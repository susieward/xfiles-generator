"THE FOLLOWING STORY IS INSPIRED BY ACTUAL DOCUMENTED ACCOUNTS"

SCENE 1
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON

(A woman runs through the forest, grunting as she trips and stumbles over logs and rocks. She is wearing a nightgown and runs through the foliage. She falls over a tree root and stumbles into a small clearing. A loud roaring starts and the wind grows stronger. She looks up to see a light growing, shining through the trees. A silhouette steps out of the light, walking towards her. The leaves around her begin swirling up in a circle, like they are in the center of a tornado. The figure stands over her as the light engulfs them both. Morning. The girl is face-down on the ground, dead. Officials walk around, murmuring to each other. The assistant coroners lean over the body as coroner John Truitt and Detective Miles walk over to the body.)

JOHN TRUITT: I put the time of death between eight and twelve hours ago. No visible cause, no sign of battery or sexual assault. All we have is this.

(He pulls up the back of her nightgown to reveal two small bumps on her lower back. Miles looks at them.)

MILES: Can we turn her over?

(They do so. Miles stands.)

Karen Swenson.

ASSISTANT CORONER: Is that a positive ID?

DETECTIVE MILES: She went to school with my son.

(He walks away as Truitt stands.)

JOHN TRUITT: Would that be the class of '89, detective? It's happening again isn't it?

(Miles keeps walking.)



SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Agent Dana Scully walks up the stairs and around to a desk where a woman sits.)

SCULLY: Agent Dana Scully.

(She continues through a group of offices and down a hallway. Reaching the door to Section Chief Blevins' office, she knocks.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: Come in.

(Scully walks in and sees Blevins sitting at his desk.)

Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice. Please...

(He motions for her to sit down, which she does. A man smoking a cigarette leans against a file cabinet. He walks around to behind Blevins and leans against the wall. Another man sits next to Blevins.)

We see you've been with us just over two years.

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SCOTT BLEVINS: You went to medical school but you chose not to practice. How'd you come to work for the F.B.I.?

SCULLY: Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school. Um, my parents still think it was an act of rebellion, but, uh... I saw the F.B.I. as a place where I could distinguish myself.

THIRD MAN: Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?

SCULLY: Yes, I am.

(Blevins and the man look at each other.)

THIRD MAN: How so?

SCULLY: By reputation. He's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult, that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988. Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section. He had a nickname at the academy... Spooky Mulder.

(She smiles at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who gives no response.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: What I'll also tell you is that Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion to an unassigned project outside the bureau mainstream. Are you familiar with the so-called "X-Files?"

SCULLY: I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena.

SCOTT BLEVINS: More or less. The reason you're here, Agent Scully, is we want you to assist Mulder on these X-Files. You will write field reports on your activites, along with your observations on the validity of the work.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stubs out his cigarette.)

SCULLY: Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, sir?

SCOTT BLEVINS: Agent Scully, we trust you'll make the proper scientific analysis. You'll want to contact Agent Mulder shortly. We look forward to seeing your reports.

(The elevator rings and the door slides open. Scully steps out into the basement and comes to an office secluded in the back. She knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted.

(She opens the door to see Agent Fox Mulder sitting at his desk, going over some slides. Walking slowly to him, she sees various pictures of UFO's and a poster that reads "I Want to Believe" with a UFO on it. He looks at her.)

SCULLY: Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with you.

(He shakes her hand.)

MULDER: Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?

SCULLY: Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.

MULDER: Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent to spy on me.

(He smiles.)

SCULLY: If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials, th...

(He stands and takes out a paper from a pile with his telephone as a paperweight.)

MULDER: You're a medical doctor, you teach at the academy. You did your undergraduate degree in physics.

(He takes off his glasses and looks at the paper.)

"Einstein's Twin Paradox, A New Interpretation. Dana Scully Senior Thesis." Now that's a credential, rewriting Einstein.

SCULLY: Did you bother to read it?

MULDER: I did. I liked it.

(He takes a slide canister and puts it into the slide projector.)

It's just that in most of my work, the laws of physics rarely seems to apply.

(He walks past her and turns off the lights. She glares at him slightly.)

Maybe I can get your medical opinion on this, though.

(He presses a button on the control and a slide comes up on the viewscreen of Karen Swenson, face-up.)

Oregon female, age twenty-one, no explainable cause of death. Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

(He changes the slide to that of the two bumps on her back.)

There are, however, these two distinct marks on her lower back. Doctor Scully, can you ID these marks?

SCULLY: Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite. Electrocution of some kind.

(She walks up to the viewscreen. He changes the slide to that of a molecular diagram.)

MULDER: How's your chemistry? This is the substance found in the surrounding tissue.

SCULLY: It's organic. I don't know, is it some kind of synthetic protein?

MULDER: Beats me, I've never seen it before either.

(The next slide is of a boy face-down on railroad tracks, his shirt lifted in the back.)

But here it is again in Sturgis, South Dakota.

(The final slide if of a close-up of another set of bumps.)

And again in Shamrock, Texas.

SCULLY: Do you have a theory?

MULDER: I have plenty of theories.

(He walks over to her.)

Maybe what you can explain to me is why it's bureau policy to label these cases as "unexplained phenomenon" and ignore them. Do you believe in the existence of extraterrestrials?

(He whispers the last few words eerily and she smiles.)

SCULLY: Logically, I would have to say "no."

(He nods, having expected that answer.)

Given the distances needed to travel from the far reaches of space, the energy requirements would exceed a spacecraft's capabilties th...

MULDER: Coventional wisdom. You know this Oregon female? She's the fourth person in her graduating class to die under mysterious circumstances. Now, when convention and science offer us no answers, might we not finally turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?

SCULLY: The girl obviously died of something. If it was natural causes, it's plausible that there was something missed in the post-mortem. If she was murdered, it's plausible there was a sloppy investigation. What I find fantastic is any notion that there are answers beyond the realm of science. The answers are there. You just have to know where to look.

MULDER: That's why they put the "I" in "F.B.I." See you tomorrow morning, Scully, bright and early.

(He walks back over to his desk and sits down.)

We leave for the very plausible state of Oregon at eight A.M.

(She smiles and walks out.)



SCENE 3
AIRPLANE TO OREGON

(The drink cart passes Mulder, who is lying down across a row of seats, sleeping, headphones in his ears. Scully is sitting nearby, wearing glasses and flipping through newspaper clippings of the dead teenagers. People are murmuring in the back, but the sounds of their voices are covered by the jet engines. Scully focuses on the name "Dr. Nemman." The overhead loudspeakers rings.)

PILOT: I would like to ask all passengers to fasten their seatbelts, as we're about to make our descent...

(Scully starts putting her things away when the plane starts shaking violently. People scream and things are tosses about as Scully grabs on to her seat. She looks at Mulder, who is awake now but still lying down in the seats passively. The plane finally is brought under control and she sighs in relief. He turns over and looks at her.)

MULDER: This must be the place.



SCENE 4
BELLEFLEUR, OREGON

(Driving down a long road, they pass a sign that reads "Welcome to Bellefleur, Oregon." Scully is reading the files and Mulder is eating sunflower seeds while driving.)

SCULLY: You didn't mention yesterday, this case has already been investigated.

MULDER: Yeah, the FBI got involved after the first three deaths when local authorities failed to turn up any evidence. Our boys came out here, spent a week, enjoyed the local salmon which, with a little lemon twist, is just to die for, if you'll pardon the expression. Without explanation, they were called back in. The case was reclassified and buried in the X-Files, till I dug it up last week.

SCULLY: And you found something they didn't.

MULDER: Mmm. (as if to say "yes.")

SCULLY: The autopsy reports of the first three victims, show no unidentified marks or tissue samples. But those reports were signed by a different medical examiner than the latest victim.

MULDER: That's pretty good, Scully.

SCULLY: Better than you expected or better that you hoped?

MULDER: Well... I'll let you know when we get past the easy part.

(She laughs.)

SCULLY: Is the medical examiner a suspect?

MULDER: We won't know that until we do a little gravedigging. I've arranged to exhume one of the other victims' bodies to see if we can get a tissue sample to match the girl's. You're not squeamish about that kind of thing, are ya?

SCULLY: I don't know. I've never had the pleasure.

(The radio starts flipping through channels rapidly, various sounds blaring. As Mulder tries to adjust it, the clock starts changing as well. The radio becomes a high-pitched screeching and Scully covers her ears. Mulder looks up to the sky.)

What's going on?

(Mulder pulls the car over to the side of the road and turns it off. He and Scully both get out. Mulder goes to the trunk, moves a briefcase, pulls out a can of pink spray paint, and walks over to where the occurance began. As Scully watches in wonder, he marks a giant "X" on the ground, then tosses the spray paint can back into his trunk. He moves the briefcase back on top of the can and closes the trunk.

What the hell was that about?

MULDER: Oh, you know... probably nothing.

(He gets back in the car.)



SCENE 5
COASTAL NORTHWEST OREGON; MARCH 7, 1992

(After driving through town, the agents arrive at the cemetery. Getting out, they see a number of men standing around, along with a crane. John Truitt and his assistant walk over to Mulder and Scully.)

JOHN TRUITT: Mister Mulder, John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.

MULDER: Yeah, hi.

(They shake hands.)

This is Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Hi.

(She and Truitt shake hands.)

MULDER: How soon can we get started?

(Scully and the assistant shake hands as well.)

SCULLY: Hello.

JOHN TRUITT: We're ready to go.

MULDER: Oh great.

JOHN TRUITT: Okay, Vinnie!

(The crane starts up as the four walk up the hill.)

MULDER: Were you able to arrange for a, uh... an examination facility?

JOHN TRUITT: I think we got something for you...

(A man and his teenage daughter pull up to the site.)

JAY NEMMAN: Excuse me!

MULDER: Ah...

(They turn around and look at the man.)

JAY NEMMAN: Excuse me!

(He starts towards them angrily but turns around and moves his daughter back to the passenger's side.)

No. Please stay in the car... let me handle this. I just want to talk to them.

(The girl gets into the car. The man walks over to the four officials.)

I just don't know who you people think you are. You just think you can come up here, and do whatever you damn well please, don't you?

MULDER: I'm sorry, you are...

JAY NEMMAN: I'm Doctor Jay Nemman. I'm county medical examiner.

MULDER: Surely, you must have been informed of our intentions to come up here.

JAY NEMMAN: No, uh, no. We've been away.

MULDER: Oh, oh. Well, that answers the question that we had. Why you hadn't done the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson. You're aware of the tissue sample that was taken from the girl's body.

JAY NEMMAN: Wha... wha... what is the insinuation here? Are you saying that I missed something in those other kids' exams?

SCULLY: We're not insinuating anything, sir.

JAY NEMMAN: Wait a minute.

(The group turns back, but Nemman grabs Mulder's arm and spins him around.)

Wait a minute, see, well I think you are. And if you're making an accusation, then you'd better have something to back it up.

(His daughter gets out of the car.)

THERESA NEMMAN: Daddy, please, let's just go home.

(Jay motions for Theresa to wait.)

Let's go home, please.

(Nemman glares at Mulder, then gets back in the car and drives off.)

MULDER: Guy obviously needed a longer vacation.

(They start back up the hill. They reach the gravesite and the crane starts scooping out the dirt above the coffin. Scully is reading from the file loudly because the crane's whirring is very loud.)

SCULLY: Ray Soames was the third victim. After graduating high school, he spent time in a state mental hospital treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.

MULDER: Soames actually confessed to the first two murders. He pleaded to be locked up but he couldn't produce any evidence that he committed the crimes. Did you happen to read the cause of death?

SCULLY: Exposure. His body was found in the woods after escaping the hospital.

MULDER: Missing for only seven hours in July. How does a twenty-year-old boy die of exposure on a warm summers night in Oregon, Doctor Scully?

WORKER: I got it.

(Two men help pull out the coffin as it is being lifted out by a harness. Suddenly, one of the straps breaks and the coffin starts rolling down the hill.)

Look out!

(As it hits the ground, the people jump, startled. They run down to the coffin as it crashes up against a tombstone, stopping it. The coffin has been broken open. Mulder goes to open it but Truitt grabs his arm.)

JOHN TRUITT: This isn't official procedure.

MULDER: Really?

(Mulder opens it anyway and sees a desecated, mummified grayish body lying in the coffin. While it is unclear exactly what this was, it is definitely not human. The arms are very long and the body is thin as well. The agents and workers gasp and cover their mouths, nauseous. Mulder stands and looks at Scully, who is kneeling.)

It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames never made the varsity basketball team.

(He turns to Truitt.)

Seal this up, right now! Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody!

(Truitt slams the lid shut.)



SCENE 6
10:56 P.M.

(Scully is dressed in her doctor's garb as Soames is laid out on the table. Mulder is taking pictures with a flashbulb.)

MULDER: This is amazing, Scully. You know what this could mean? It's almost too big to even comprehend.

SCULLY: Subject is a hundred and fifty-six centimeters in length, weighing fifty-two pounds in extremis. Corpse is in advance stages of decay and desiccation. Distinguishing features include large ocular cavities, oblate cranium... indicates subject is not human. Could you point that flash away from me, please?

(Mulder puts the camera away.)

MULDER: If it's not human, what is it?

SCULLY: It's mammalian. My guess is it's a chimpanzee or something from the ape family, possibly an orangutan.

MULDER: Buried in the city cemetery in Ray Soames' grave? Try telling that to the good townsfolk or to Ray Soames' family. I want tissue samples and x-rays. I'd like blood type and toxicology and a full genetic work-up.

SCULLY: You're serious?

MULDER: What we can't do here, we'll order to go.

SCULLY: You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial? This is somebody's sick joke.

MULDER: We can do those x-rays here, can't we? Is there any reason we can't do them right now? I'm not crazy, Scully. I have the same doubts you do.



SCENE 7
SCULLY'S HOTEL ROOM

(The time is 4:37. Scully is typing on her laptop while listening to a recording she made earlier. There is an x-ray of Soames' head with the nasal cavity circled taped to the lamp.)

SCULLY ON TAPE RECORDER: Official laboratory inspection of the body and x-ray analysis confirms homologous but possibly mutated mammalian physiology. However, does not account for small unidentified object found in subject's nasal cavity. A grey metallic implant form...

(She stops the tape and picks up a small tube containing a gray metallic object. There is a knock on the door.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

MULDER: Steven Spielberg.

(She smiles and opens the door. Mulder leans up against the doorway in jogging clothes and wearing a baseball cap backwards.)

I'm way too wired. I'm going for a run, you want to come?

SCULLY: Pass.

MULDER: You figure out what that little thing up Ray Soames' nose is yet?

SCULLY: No...

(She yawns.)

And I'm not losing any sleep over it. Good night.

(She closes the door and looks at the x-ray.)



SCENE 8
RAYMON COUNTY; STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(Mulder, Scully and Doctor Glass are walking outside the building.)

GLASS: Ray Soames was a patient of mine, yes. I oversaw his treatment for just over a year for clinical schizophrenia. Ray had an inability to grasp reality. He seemed to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.

MULDER: Is that something you've seen before?

GLASS: I've treated similar cases.

SCULLY: Were any of those Ray Soames' classmates?

GLASS: Yes.

MULDER: We're trying to find a connection in these deaths. Did you treat any of these kids with hypnosis?

GLASS: No, I did not.

SCULLY: Are you treating any of these kids now?

GLASS: Currently? Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles and Peggy O'Dell. Both have been long term live-in patients.

(They stop walking.)

SCULLY: They're here at this hospital?

GLASS: That's right, going on four years now.

SCULLY: Would it be possible for us to talk to them?

GLASS: Well, you might find it difficult. Certainly, in Billy Miles' case.

(Billy Miles lays on his hospital bed very still. His eyes are open but there is no sign of life except for the pulse read-out on the monitor. The three walk in. Peggy O'Dell sits in her wheelchair next to Billy. A nurse is changing the sheets on the adjacent bed.)

GLASS: Billy's experiencing what we call a waking coma. Functionally, his brainwaves are flat and he's persistent vegetative.

SCULLY: How did it happen?

GLASS: Both he and Peggy were involved in an automobile accident out on State road.

(He looks over to Peggy.)

Peggy?

PEGGY O'DELL: "...aerial..."

(She stops reading.)

Peggy, we have some visitors, would you like to talk with them for a moment?

PEGGY O'DELL: Billy wants me to read now. "It's not sand, it's dark..."

(Mulder kneels down in front of her.)

MULDER: Does he like it when you read to him?

PEGGY O'DELL: Yes. Billy needs me close.

(Mulder walks back over to the doctor.)

MULDER: Doctor. I'm wondering if we can do a cursory medical exam on Peggy.

(She throws the book down, tips over the food tray, and starts wheeling around.)

NURSE: Peggy? Oh, Peggy, what are you doing?

GLASS: Get an orderly.

(Nurses and Doctor Glass go to her. She grabs her nose and starts screaming.)

MULDER: No one is going to hurt you!

(She moves her hand away from her nose and it is covered with blood, as well as her face. She falls forward off the chair and onto the floor.)

GLASS: This is an emergency. Get an orderly, get an orderly. Nobody is going to hurt you. The nurse is here.

(Mulder takes the opportunity to lift up the back of Peggy's shirt. She has the bumps. Mulder looks at Scully, who looks back in shock.)

NURSE: I'm ringing for the orderlies now.

PEGGY O'DELL: Stop it! Stop!

DR. GLASS: All right, Peggy. All right. It's all right.

NURSE: Peggy, honey, you're going to be fine. You've had these nose bleedings before, now calm down. Don't worry...

(Scully walks out angrily. Mulder walks down the stairs quickly after her.)

MULDER: What's his name, er... Billy said he was sorry he didn't get to say goodbye.

SCULLY: How did you know that girl was going to have the marks?

MULDER: I don't know, lucky guess?

SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, cut the crap. What is going on here? What do you know about those marks? What are they?

MULDER: Why? So you can put it down in your little report? I don't think you're ready for what I think.
(They stop walking.)

SCULLY: I'm here to solve this case, Mulder, I want the truth.

MULDER: The truth? I think those kids have been abducted.

SCULLY: By who?

MULDER: By what.

SCULLY: You don't really believe that?

MULDER: Do you have a better explanation?

SCULLY: I'll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis. Whether it's organic or the result of those marks, I can't say. But to say that they've been riding around in flying saucers, it's crazy, Mulder, there is nothing to support that.

MULDER: Nothing scientific, you mean.

SCULLY: There has got to be an explaination. You've got four victims. All of them died in or near the woods. They found Karen Swenson's body in the forest in her pajamas, ten miles from her house. How did she get there? What were those kids doing out there in the forest?



SCENE 9
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON

(Scully and Mulder walk through the forest, carrying flashlights. They both are no longer in suits, now wearing jackets and pants. Mulder signals to Scully and they split up. Mulder looks at his compass, which is spinning wildly. Scully, in the clearing, bends down and picks up some strange dirt on the ground. A large rumbling begins.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The rumbling grows louder. She stands and takes out her gun. Walking back, she sees a light shining through the trees.)

Mulder, is that you? Mulder?

(A silhouette from out of the light comes towards her. The man lifts up his shotgun and Scully points her weapon at the man.)

Special Agent Dana Scully, FBI, drop your weapon.

(Detective Miles steps into the light.)

MILES: I'm with the County Sheriff's Department. You're trespassing on private property here.

SCULLY: We are conducting an investigation.

(Mulder walks up and points his gun as well.)

MILES: Get in your car and leave, both of you, or I'll have to arrest you. I don't care who you are.

MULDER: Hold on! This is a crime scene.

MILES: Did you hear what I said? You are on private property without legal permission. Now, I'm only going to say it one more time, get in your car and leave.

(Mulder and Scully lower their flashlights and weapons. They walk out past the yellow tape and pass a truck with huge searchlights on them that created the light. They get into their car and drive off.)

MULDER: What's he doing out here all by himself?

SCULLY: Maybe it has something to do with this.

(She holds out a handful of dirt. He turns on the carlight.)

What do you think it is?

MULDER: I don't know. Is it a campfire?

SCULLY: It was all over the ground. I think something is going on out here, some kind of a sacrifice, maybe. What if these kids are involved in some kind of occult and that man knows something about it?

(Mulder takes out his compass and looks at it. It is acting very strangely.)

I wanna come back here.

(Mulder looks at his watch, which reads 9:03. He looks down at the compass again.)

You okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm just, er...

(He starts looking up through the windshield.)

SCULLY: What are you looking for?

(There is a loud roar and a light engulfs them. Time seems to stop just for a second. When the light fades, the car slowly comes to a stop, having no power. Mulder tries to restart the car, but it will not go.)

What happened?

MULDER: We lost power, brakes, steering, everything.

(He looks at his watch.)

We lost nine minutes.

(He gets out of the car and screams into the sky. Scully gets out. They scream over the rain to each other as they talk.)

SCULLY: We lost what?

MULDER: Nine minutes. I looked at my watch just before the flash and it was nine-o-three. It just turned nine-thirteen.

(He starts running down the road.)

Look! Look!

(They stop at the pink "X" that Mulder marked in the road, only a few feet from the car.)

Oh-ho, yes! Abductees... people who have made UFO sightings, they've reported unexplained time loss.

SCULLY: Come on.

MULDER: Gone! Just like that.

SCULLY: No, what a minute. You're saying that, that time disappeared. Time can't just disappear, it's, it's, it's a universal invariant!

(The car starts up and the headlights shine on them. Mulder smiles.)

MULDER: Not in this zipcode.

(He runs back over to the car. Scully looks down at the "X" and follows.)



SCENE 10
SCULLY'S HOTEL ROOM

(Scully is typing on her laptop. We hear her voice over the scene. As she types, it reads:

"Agent Mulder's insistence of time loss due to unknown forces cannot be validated or substantiated by this witness"

She continues typing. A thunderclap rings out and the power goes out.)

SCULLY: Great.

(She goes into her bathroom, carrying a candle and wearing a bathrobe. She starts running a bath and takes off her robe, revealing only a bra and underwear. She goes to slip off her underwear when she feels something. Two bumps on her lower back.)



SCENE 11
MULDER'S HOTEL ROOM

(Mulder, carrying a candle, opens the door to see Scully standing in her bathrobe, shaken.)

MULDER: Hi.

SCULLY: I want you to look at something.

MULDER: Come on in.

(Scully walks in, turns around and slips off her robe. She is still wearing only a bra and underwear. She looks back at him, then down to her lower back. Mulder sees a few bumps.)

SCULLY: What are they?

(Mulder starts to smile.)

Mulder, what are they?

MULDER: Mosquito bites.

SCULLY: Are you sure?

MULDER: Yeah. I got eaten up a lot myself out there.

(She gasps in relief, slips her robe on and hugs Mulder for a long time.)

You okay?

SCULLY: Yes.

(She pulls away from the hug.)

MULDER: You're shaking.

SCULLY: I need to sit down.

(She sits down. He sits down in a seat across from her.)

MULDER: Take your time.

(Later, Scully is laying on the bed and Mulder sits in front of it on the floor.)

I was twelve when it happened. My sister was eight. She just disappeared out of her bed one night. Just gone, vanished. No note, no phone calls, no evidence of anything.

SCULLY: You never found her.

MULDER: Tore the family apart. No one would talk about it. There were no facts to confirm, nothing to offer any hope.

SCULLY: What did you do?

MULDER: Eventually, I went off to school in England, I came back, got recruited by the bureau. Seems I had a natural aptitude for applying behavioural models to criminal cases.

(Outside, a man in a raincoat shuffles through the bushes.)

My success allowed me a certain freedom to pursue my own interests. And that's when I came across the X-Files.

(He turns to face her.)

SCULLY: By accident?

MULDER: At first, it looked like a garbage dump for UFO sightings, alien abduction reports, the kind of stuff that most people laugh at as being ridiculous. But I was fascinated. I read all the cases I could get my hands on, hundreds of them. I read everything I could about paranormal phenomenon, about the occult and...

(He sighs and drifts off into thought.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: There's classified government information I've being trying to access, but someone has been blocking my attempts to get at it.

SCULLY: Who? I don't understand.

(She sits up a little.)

MULDER: Someone at a higher level of power. The only reason I've been allowed to continue with my work is because I've made connections in congress.

SCULLY: And they're afraid of what? That, that you'll leak this information?

MULDER: You're a part of that agenda, you know that.

SCULLY: I'm not a part of any agenda. You've got to trust me. I'm here just like you, to solve this.

(He moves closer, kneeling.)

MULDER: I'm telling you this, Scully, because you need to know, because of what you've seen. In my research, I've worked very closely with a man named Dr. Heitz Werber and he's taken me through deep regression hypnosis. I've been able to go into my own repressed memories to the night my sister disappeared. I can recall a bright light outside and a presence in the room. I was paralyzed, unable to respond to my sister's calls for help.

(He moves even closer, talking louder.)

Listen to me, Scully, this thing exists.

SCULLY: But how do you know...

MULDER: The government knows about it, and I got to know what they're protecting. Nothing else matters to me, and this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.

(The phone rings, startling Scully. Mulder picks up.)

Hello? What? Who is this? Who is thi...

(He hangs up.)

That was some woman... she just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.

SCULLY: The girl in the wheelchair?



SCENE 12
RURAL HIGHWAY 133
BELLEFLEUR, OREGON

(A mack truck sits in the road, ambulances and police cars surrounding it. People stand outside talking.)

MAN #1: Yeah, I'll bring it over in a minute.

(A sheriff lights a flare and puts it down in the road to ward off traffic. Mulder and Scully pull up.)

MAN #2: We're going to need a couple of more hours, Bob.

(Mulder walks over to a deputy and the driver.)

MULDER: What happened?

TRUCK DRIVER: She ran right out in front of me.

DEPUTY: Who are you?

MULDER: She was running? On foot?

(The county coroner pulls up and Scully uncovers Peggy's face. Her neck is in a brace, and she is very bloody. There are tubes in her nose. Scully looks at Peggy's watch, which has stopped and reads 9:03. Scully walks over to Mulder and the deputy. Mulder is very ornery.)

Well, that's just...

SCULLY: We need to ask you a few quest...

MULDER: Let's go, let's go.

(She looks at him and he leads her to the car.)

Someone trashed the autopsy bay in the lab and they stole the body, we're going back to the motel.

SCULLY: What? They stole the corpse?



SCENE 13
HOTEL

(Scully and Mulder pull up and run out of the car. Police and firemen are all around. Mulder runs over to a deputy and shows him his badge.)

MULDER: F.B.I.

(They stop and look at the hotel, which is ablaze.)

SCULLY: There goes my computer.

MULDER: Damn it! The x-rays and pictures!

(Firemen run around, one climbing a ladder.)

FIREMAN: We need a couple of men out here!

(Mulder closes his eyes, frustrated and angry. Theresa Nemman steps out of the crowd and over to the agents.)

THERESA NEMMAN: My name is Theresa Nemman. You've got to protect me.

MULDER: Come with us.



SCENE 14
DINER

(Scully sits next to Theresa in a booth. Mulder sits across from them.)

THERESA NEMMAN: This is the way it happens, I don't know how I get out there. I'll just find myself out in the woods.

MULDER: How long has it been happening?

THERESA NEMMAN: Ever since the summer we graduated. It's happened to my friends too. That's why I need you to protect me. I'm scared I might... die like the others, like... Peggy did tonight.

MULDER: Your father's the medical examiner. You were the one on the phone, you told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.

(Theresa nods.)

SCULLY: Theresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he? About what happened.

THERESA NEMMAN: Yes. But he said never to tell anyone about any of it.

MULDER: Why?

THERESA NEMMAN: He wants to protect me. He thinks he can protect me, but I don't think he can.

MULDER: Do you have the marks, Theresa?

THERESA NEMMAN: Yes. I'm going to die, aren't I? I'm gonna be next?

SCULLY: No, you're not going to die.

(Blood pours out of Theresa's left nostril.)

Oh, God!

(Scully runs over to the adjacent table and gets some napkins. Before she can give them to Theresa, she notices Nemman and Miles walk in.)

JAY NEMMAN: Let's go home, Theresa. Theresa, come on.

(He pushes Mulder out of the way and sits down next to Theresa. He puts a handkercheif to her nose.)

Come on, honey.

MULDER: I don't think she wants to leave.

JAY NEMMAN: Come on...

(Nemman looks at Mulder.)

I don't care what you think! She's a sick girl.

MILES: Your father wants to take you home. He'll get you all cleaned up.

JAY NEMMAN: I'm going to take you where you'll be safe, Theresa. Detective Miles and I won't let anything happen to you, I promise.

(Mulder looks at Miles in shock.)

MULDER: You're Billy Miles' father?

DETECTIVE MILES: That's right. And you stay away from that boy.

(Outside, Theresa looks at Mulder and Scully from the back seat of Nemman's van. The windows roll up and they drive away. Mulder and Scully watch them go.)

MULDER: Eh, you gotta love this place. Everyday's like Halloween.

SCULLY: They know Mulder. They know who's responsible for the murders.

MULDER: They know something.

(They start walking to the car.)

SCULLY: Dr. Nemman's been hiding medical evidence from the beginning. He lied on the autopsy reports and now we find out about the detective. Who else would have reason to trash the lab and our rooms?

(They stop.)

MULDER: Why would they destroy evidence? What would they want with that corpse?

SCULLY: I don't know, I...

MULDER: Makes you wonder what's in those other two graves.



SCENE 15
CEMETARY; 5:07

(As the rain pours down, Mulder and Scully, carrying flashlights, walk into the cemetary to find that the other two graves have been unearthed and are empty.)

MULDER: They're both empty.

SCULLY: What is going on here?

MULDER: I think I know who did it. I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.

SCULLY: Who? The detective?

MULDER: The detective's son. Billy Miles.

SCULLY: The boy in the hospital? The vegetable?! Billy Miles, a boy who's been in a coma for the last four years, got out here and dug up these graves?

MULDER: Peggy O'Dell was bound to a wheelchair but she ran in front of that truck. Look, I'm not making this up, it all fits the profile of alien abduction.

SCULLY: This fits a profile?

MULDER: Yes. Peggy O'Dell was killed at around nine-o-clock, that's right around the time we lost nine minutes on the highway, I think that something happened in that nine minutes. I think that time, as we know it, stopped. And something took control over it.

(She smiles, almost laughing.)

You think I'm crazy.

(She nods and he walks away a little. Her face becomes grimmer. He looks back at her and notices that something is bothering her.)

What?

SCULLY: Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine. I made a note of it when I saw the body.

MULDER: That's the reason the kids come to the forest, because the forest controls them and summons them there. And, and, and the marks are from, from some kind of test that's being done on them. And, and that may be causing some kind of genetic mutation which would explain the body that we dug up.

SCULLY: And the force summoned Theresa Nemman's body into the woods tonight.

MULDER: Yes, but it was Billy Miles who took her there, summoned by some alien impulse. That's it!

(Scully laughs, finding everything ludicrous but believing it. Mulder smiles.)

Come on, let's get out of here.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

MULDER: We're going to pay a visit to Billy Miles.

(They start walking back.)



SCENE 16
RAYMON COUNTY; STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(Mulder talks to the nurse while Scully looks at Billy's fingers.)

NURSE: Now, we could stand here until the second coming, waiting for Billy to get out of this bed. It ain't going to happen. He blinks and I know about it.

(She starts changing his IV.)

MULDER: I guess you changed his bedpan last night.

NURSE: Hmm, nobody else here's gonna do it.

MULDER: You noticed nothing unusual? Do you remember what you were doing last night around nine-o-clock?

NURSE: Mmm, probably watching TV, yeah.

MULDER: Do you rememeber what you were watching?

NURSE: Um, let's see... you know I don't really remember what I watched.

(Scully goes over to Billy's feet and lifts the covers up.)

Miss?

(Scully starts inspecting Miles' feet.)

What is she looking for?

SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.

(Mulder looks at it and Scully opens up an evidence vial. She starts scraping off some of the strange dirt into the vial. Mulder looks back at the nurse.)

MULDER: Do you know who was taking care of Peggy O'Dell last night?

NURSE: Not me, it's not my ward. Not my aisle of the produce section.

(She laughs. Mulder humors her by laughing slightly.)

I do have a job of my own to do... what is she doing now?

(Scully closes up the vial.)

MULDER: Thank you for your time, ma'am.

NURSE: Okay.

MULDER: Good day.

(Mulder leads Scully out. Once outside the room, Scully walks rapidly, excited.)

SCULLY: That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell, I don't believe this.

MULDER: Scully...

SCULLY: It's crazy! He was in the woods.

MULDER: You're sure?

(She holds up the vial in a baggie.)

SCULLY: This is the same stuff that I took a handful of in the forest.

MULDER: Okay, then maybe we should take it and run a lab test...

SCULLY: We lost the original sample in the fire. What else could it be?

(They stop.)

MULDER: All right, but I just want you to understand what it is you're saying.

SCULLY: You said it yourself.

MULDER: Yeah, but you have to write it down in your report.

(Scully calms down.)

SCULLY: You're right. We'll take another sample from the forest... and run a comparison before we do anything.



SCENE 17
COLLUM NATIONAL FOREST, NORTHWEST OREGON

(They pull up to the forest and see Miles' van. Mulder shines his flashlight in the front seat. It is empty.)

SCULLY: The detective's here. What do you think?

(A woman's scream rings out. Mulder and Scully start running through the forest. They split up, running through foliage, searching for the girl. Out of nowhere, Miles hits Scully on the head with the butt of his gun. She falls and looks up at Miles.)

MILES: You wouldn't listen to me. I told you to stay out of this.

(He runs off as she struggles to get up. Mulder stops and hears another scream, then starts running to his left. He nearly trips over a root and sees Miles standing in front of him, cocking his shotgun.)

Hold it, hold it right there! You got no business out here.

MULDER: There were screams...

MILES: Down on the ground. Now!

MULDER: You know it's Billy. You've known it all along.

MILES: I said down on the ground.

(Mulder kneels.)

MULDER: How long are you gonna let it happen?

(The woman screams again.)

He's gonna kill her!

(Miles looks towards the screams, then runs off. He sees Billy lifting up Theresa's shoulders. The wind is growing and the leaves are swirling around them.)

MILES: Billy, no! Let her go! Leave her alone!

(Billy looks at him, then goes back to lifting her up. Miles points his shotgun and Mulder tackles him. A shot rings out. Scully, holding her head, hears the shot and runs in the direction of it. Mulder and Miles watch on the ground as Billy takes Theresa in his arms and looks up. Mulder notices the two welts on Billy's back. The wind grows stronger and a light encompasses them. Mulder and Miles stand, looking at the light. Scully looks from a distance as the light grows. The light and wind die down and there is a thunderclap. Billy stands there, Theresa on the ground. She looks at him and he looks at his father.)

BILLY MILES: Dad?

MILES: Billy. Oh, god.

(They hug. Mulder sees that the bumps are gone. Mulder realizes that his partner is missing.)

MULDER: Scully.

(He picks up his flashlight and starts running. They meet halfway.)

Scully!

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened? There was a light.

MULDER: It was incredible.

(They both gasp for air, Mulder smiling slightly.)



SCENE 18
MARCH 22, 1992
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Doctor Heitz Werber sits across from Billy.)

HEITZ WERBER: If you can hear me, raise your right hand.

(Billy does so slowly.)

Tell me about the light, Billy. When did you first see the light?

BILLY MILES: In the forest. We were all in the forest having a party. All my friends. We were celebrating.

HEITZ WERBER: What were you celebrating?

BILLY MILES: Graduation. And then the light came. It took me away to the testing place.

(Mulder is off to the side, watching. His reflection can be seen in the mirror.)

They would tell me to gather the others so that they could do tests. They put something in my head... here.

(He puts his hand on his head where his nasal cavity is. On the other side of the mirror, Scott Blevins, the Cigarette-Smoking Man, the third man from before, and Scully are watching.)

I would wait for their orders.

HEITZ WERBER: Billy, who gave the orders?

BILLY MILES: The light. They said it would be okay. No one would know. But the test didn't work. They wanted everything destroyed. They said they were leaving. I'm afraid. I'm afraid they're coming back.

(Billy starts crying. The Cigarette-Smoking Man whispers in Blevins' ear.)

HEITZ WERBER: Don't be afraid Billy, we're gonna help.

SCOTT BLEVINS: All right, let's go.

(As they all start to file out, Mulder looks at the mirror directly at Scully. Scully looks at him, knowing that he cannot see her, then leaves.)



SCENE 19
SECTION CHIEF BLEVINS' OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Blevins is seated at his desk and the third man is seated next to the right of him. Scully is sitting across from Blevins.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: What we've just witnessed, what we've read in your field reports... the scientific basis and credibility just seem wholly unsupportable, you're aware of that?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. My reports are personal and subjective. I don't think I've gone so far as to draw any conclusion about what I've seen.

THIRD MAN: Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case. This, uh... time loss... you did or did not experience it?

SCULLY: I can't substantiate it, no.

SCOTT BLEVINS: What exactly can you substantiate, Agent Scully? I see no evidence that justifies the legitimacy of these investigations.

SCULLY: There were, of course, crimes committed.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Yes, but how do you prosecute a case like this? With testimony given under hypnosis from a boy who claims that he was given orders from some alien force through an implant in his nose? You have no physical evidence.

(Scully stands and puts down the vial with the nasal cavity implant on Blevins' desk.)

SCULLY: This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication device. I removed it from the exumed body.

(Blevins looks at it.)

I kept it in my pocket, it was the only piece of evidence not destroyed in the fire. I ran a lab test on it, the material could not be identified.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, what are his thoughts?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.

SCOTT BLEVINS: Thank you, Agent Scully, that will be all.

(Scully leaves the office as she walks down the hallway, she passes the Cigarette-Smoking Man. She watches him go into Blevins' office, then starts walking.)



SCENE 20
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully lays in bed, eyes wide open, unable to sleep. The time is 11:21. It changes to 11:22. The phone rings and Scully picks up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: Scully? It's me, I haven't been able to sleep. I talked to the D.A.'s office in Raymon County, Oregon. There's no case file on Billy Miles. The paperwork we filed is gone. We need to talk, Scully.

SCULLY: Y, yes. Tomorrow.

(She hangs up slowly, then grows a little tenser as she lays down.)



SCENE 21
HIDDEN ROOM

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks down a long hallway. On either side of him are rows upon rows of shelves containing brown boxes. He comes up to one and pulls out a casing holding many of the same kind of vials that were in the abductees. He takes out the one from Ray Soames' body and puts it in the casing with the rest of them. Putting the casing back, he walks down the rest of the hallway, comes to the door and walks out. Closing the door, he then runs his keycard through it's sensor. The sign on the door reads:

"In Case Of Fire Or Emergency
Know Your Exits
PENTAGON
Evacuation Procedure"

There is a map of the Pentagon next to it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks away.)

                                      DEEP THROAT


SCENE 1
NEAR ELLENS AIR BASE
SOUTHWEST IDAHO

(Several military police surround what looks to be a normal house)

COMMANDING OFFICER: As soon as we're in position, we'll be on a count of five.

(A woman comes up to a police barrier)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Excuse me, that's my house.

MILITARY POLICE OFFICER: Ok, let her through.

(The woman runs up to the commanding officer)

ANITA BUDAHAS: What's going on?

COMMANDING OFFICER: Standby. Mrs. Budahas?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yeah.

COMMANDING OFFICER: Your husband has violated basic security procedure. He's commandeered a military vehicle that's believed to be armed.

LEAD OFFICER: Keep on moving in.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oh God!

(The MP's cover the entrance of the house, while two others get ready to use a battering ram to break open the front door. The Lead Officer signals the officers to begin with a countdown from five, on his fingers. The door is broke open and the MP's move in, securing each room)

VOICE: We have access..

ANITA BUDAHAS: You've got to let me talk to him.

(The MP's secure the upstairs, room by room. Finally kicking in a door finding their target)

LEAD OFFICER: What the hell. We got him but he's gonna need a doctor.. or something.

(We see a man, wearing only his underwear, sitting trembling in a corner of the room. His skin looks like it has been burned and blistered)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The camera pans down a aerial shot of a road. Next we see the inside of a bar, a waiter is making and serving drinks. We see Scully, sitting at the bar, she checks her watch before continuing to work at a file. Mulder appears)

SCULLY: Hi. I got your message.

MULDER: Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?

SCULLY: It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.

MULDER: It's not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.

SCULLY: Something you couldn't show me at work.

MULDER: Let's get a table. (Mulder and Scully make their way through the crowded bar. We see many people sitting at the bar, but one particular man seems to be watching Mulder and Scully. Scully is looking through a file, we see a photo of a man, the same man we saw trembling in his home at the start, in a military uniform) That's Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.

SCULLY: Which was what, exactly?

MULDER: The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.

SCULLY: What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?

MULDER: That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. (Mulder passes Scully some new information, a thick pile of papers) Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.

SCULLY: Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.

MULDER: There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can't figure out, it was deprioritised. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.

SCULLY: So?

MULDER: So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.

SCULLY: I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?

MULDER: Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me.

(Mulder gets up and goes to the restroom)



SCENE 3
(Mulder walks from a urinal to the sink and washes his hands. Another man leaves the restroom. Mulder bends down and rinses his face then gets up and dries it. He sees, in the mirror, a man standing behind him, the same man that was watching him from the bar. Mulder turns to face him)

DEEP THROAT: Leave this case alone Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What?

DEEP THROAT: The military will not tolerate an FBI investigation.

MULDER: Who are you?

DEEP THROAT: I, er, can be of help to you. I've had a certain interest in your work.

(There is a knock on the door, we see that it has been bolted from the inside)

VOICE: Sorry.

MULDER: How do you know about my work?

DEEP THROAT: Well, let's just say that I'm in a position to know quite alot of things, er, things about our government.

MULDER: Who are you? Who do you work for?

DEEP THROAT: It's unimportant, I came here to give you some valuable advice. You are exposing yourself and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk, I advise you to drop the case.

MULDER: I can't do that.

DEEP THROAT: You have much work to do Agent Mulder, (The man unlocks the door) don't jeopardise the future of your own efforts.

(The man leaves and as Mulder rushes out after him, he is obstructed by another man trying to come into the restroom. Mulder pushes passed the man, and moves out into the bar. When he looks around he sees no sign of the man, he was talking to. Scully notices Mulder's curious
look and approaches)



SCENE 4

SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm fine.



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Scully is sitting at a large microfiche film reader screen, reading through information on Ellens Air Base and it's association with UFO buffs. One phrase that Scully seems to focus on reads, `...technology with stealth weaponry...')

(We see Mulder standing in his kitchen, his phone rings)

MULDER: Hello.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I checked on that file you gave me.

MULDER: Uh-huh.

SCULLY: You failed to tell me a few things. (Mulder hears clicking noises coming from his phone, he takes the phone away from his ear) This isn't some UFO goose chase, you're leading me on, is it? (Mulder listens into the phone again) Are you there Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Mulder walks towards his window and looks through some of the blinds, he sees a van parked across the road, outside his apartment)

SCULLY: Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.

MULDER: Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. I'll, I'll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK?

(Mulder hangs up)



SCENE 6
MARRIETTE FIELD
SOUTHWEST IDAHO

(Mulder knocks on the door of the house belonging to the woman we saw at the start. An aircraft flies passed and Mulder and Scully both turn around to try and see it. The door opens)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Hello?

(Mulder and Scully turn back around to face the Mrs. Budahas)

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yes.

(Mulder takes out his id and shows it to Mrs. Budahas)

MULDER: We're from the FBI.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oh, yes, please, come in. (Mulder and Scully, enter the house, we see a picture of Lt. Col. Budahas hanging on the wall) I started noticing it about two years ago, m, Bob developed this rash under his arms. We'd been doing some renovations on the house, so that, we thought it was a reaction to the paint stripper. But then everything just, went crazy.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

(Mulder is looking at the photos of Lt. Col. Budahas)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Bob's whole personality, it was so unpredictable. He started, doing things.

MULDER: What kinds of things?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It was kind of embarassing at first, we were having this dinner party once, and, erm, he sprinkled tetra-meal D all other his food. (Scully, looks confused as she doesn't know what tetra-meal D is) That's fishfood flakes.

SCULLY: Did you ever talk to him about this?

ANITA BUDAHAS: I tried, i, it was extemely difficult, Bob would get so angry, he'd, yell at the kids for no reason, and, and then, and then he would shake, like he was having a, a seizure.

MULDER: Did he ever talk about his work?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It was never discussed, e, even before the problems. Oh, I knew that he worked on top secret projects, word gets around, but, Bob was always a patriot first. He took, loyalty to his country as an oath, and, and now they treat us like strangers. I just want my husband back.

SCULLY: You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Th, then I think, what if he's... (Mrs. Budahas starts to cry a little) How would I support the family?

MULDER: Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Erm, yeah. Verla McLennen's husband, he went kinda crazy, but it's, it's not like he didn't get to come home.



SCENE 7
VERLA McLENNEN'S HOUSE

(We see the apparatus for preparing hooks for flyfishing being used. We then see a man, pull a small hair from his closely shaven head, he checks the hair and uses it on his hook)

SCULLY: How long has he been...

VERLA MCLENNEN: Almost two years, the flyfishing idea was his brother Hank's. I was upset at first, but when you're the wife of a test pilot, you thank God just to have him home alive.

MULDER: Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?

VERLA MCLENNEN: Stress, I guess. You have to understand, the military deals with things in a certain way. They've given him plenty of therapy, and treatment, and I'm grateful for that. They've taken good care of us. And you know they do volunteer for their jobs. (Mrs. McLennen stands beside Mrs. Budahas) Really Anita, bringing the FBI to my house.

(We see the man, Mr. McLennen, he is still making his hooks)

(Back outside Mrs. Budahas' house. Mrs. Budahas gives a piece of paper to Scully)

ANITA BUDAHAS: Here, I've, erm, I've called all the numbers about a thousand times, please, let me know what you find out.

SCULLY: We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Thanks. (Mrs. Budahas walks towards her house, while Mulder and Scully walk away) C'mon kids.

MULDER: So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?

SCULLY: Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they've studied it in zoo animals.

MULDER: Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. They're not supposed to fold under pressure, they're supposed to thrive on it.

(Mulder and Scully are standing beside their car)

SCULLY: Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project?

(Mulder takes off his jacket and puts it in the car)

MULDER: Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defence department, surveillance project.

SCULLY: The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.

MULDER: You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commodation, he's never washed out of anything in his life.

(Mulder gets in the car, after a brief hesitation, Scully moves to the other side of the car)



SCENE 8
BEECH GROVE MOTEL
SCULLY'S ROOM

(We see Scully hang up the telephone, Mulder comes in holding up his cellular phone and sits on the bed)

MULDER: I've been on hold with the base director of communications for fourty-five minutes, how about you?

SCULLY: Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.

MULDER: Yeah, right. (Mulder lifts up a telephone directory) Did you say Kissel?



SCENE 9
(We see a car drive down a road and into a driveway. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their car opposite the house in which the car just pulled into. They get out of the car and walk towards the man who just got out of the car)

MULDER: Colonel Kissel?

COLONEL KISSEL: Yes.

MULDER: Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

COLONEL KISSEL: I've got nothing to say. Please, this is an invasion of my privacy.

MULDER: Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?

COLONEL KISSEL: Why don't you get the hell out of my yard.

(Colonel Kissel enters his house and shuts the door)

SCULLY: Good thing we still kept that appointment.

(Mulder and Scully turn around when they hear a man greeting them and walking up the driveway towards them)

PAUL MOSSINGER: Hi. Are you the FBI agents? I'm Paul Mossinger, I, er, work for the local paper. We live a few houses down from Verla McLennen, she said you guys are out here looking into this Budahas thing.

MULDER: We're just looking around.

(Mulder and Scully, walk out of the drive, away from the man)

PAUL MOSSINGER: Aah, gotcha, right. Lot of people around here just looking around, UFO nuts mostly, but it's not everyday we get FBI. (Another aircraft flies overhead and they all stop to look) By the time you hear them, they're already gone. So this Budahas thing, are you getting anywhere?

MULDER: We're not at liberty to comment.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Well...

MULDER: Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?

PAUL MOSSINGER: Never, bunch of hoo-ey if you ask me. People see what they wanna see.

MULDER: But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you refered to earlier, where would I go?



SCENE 10
FLYING SAUCER DINER

(Another aircraft flies overhead, the glasses on the shelves of the diner all shake)

ZOE: F-15 Eagle pulling about four g's. Those boys think they are such hotshots. Get a few
drinks in `em, you'd think it was them up there flapping their wings.

(Mulder laughs)

MULDER: Who's the photographer?

(Mulder is refering to several photos atached to the shelves, photos of UFOs)

ZOE: Various and sundry. I took the one on the end there.

(The photo is of a large triangular shaped craft in the air)

MULDER: You're kidding, where?

ZOE: Out on the back porch, taking out the garbage, and there it was, just hovering. (Zoe takes
the photo down and shows it to Mulder) Quiet like a hummingbird. For a minute there, I
thought it was gonna land in the parking lot and I was gonna have to serve `em lunch.
(Scully takes the photo from Mulder and looks at it) I'm selling limited edition prints, twenty
dollars. Down to my last five, if you're interested.

MULDER: Put it on my tab.

(Scully leans over to Mulder)

SCULLY: Sucker.

MULDER: What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?

SCULLY: Catch ye outside.

(Outside the diner, Scully is looking at a map, Mulder comes out)

SCULLY: Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn't even on my US GS quadrant map.

MULDER: I know. Let's go.

SCULLY: You know. Where are we going?

MULDER: We got our own map, sucker.

(Mulder gives Scully a piece of paper with a roughly drawn map on it)



SCENE 11
OUTSIDE ELLENS AIR BASE
6:04 p.m.

(Mulder and Scully, drive off the main road and up a hill. At The bottom of the hill is a sign saying:

WARNING: THIS AREA IS A RESTRICTED MILITARY INSTALLATION TO THE WEST.

At the top of the sign is a symbol indicating no cameras. Mulder stops the car further up the road beside a fence. He gets out goes to the boot and gets a pair of binoculars)

SCULLY: What do you honestly hope to see?

MULDER: I don't know, maybe nothing.

SCULLY: Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for UFOs. (Mulder is walking up a grassy embankment) Yea, this is gonna look real good on my field report.

(It is night time and Scully is sleeping in the car. Suddenly the car starts shaking, Scully begins to rouse and is shocked awake by the sound of the rear window shattering)

SCULLY: Aaaaaah!

(Mulder comes running down the embankment)

MULDER: Scully, wake up. You've gotta see this.

(Mulder opens the car door and pulls Scully up the embankment)

SCULLY: Unnh!




9:13 p.m.

(Mulder and Scully see two small lights flying through the sky in the distance)

SCULLY: What are they?

MULDER: I don't know, just keep watching it's unbelievable.

SCULLY: That's unreal. I've never seen anything like it.

MULDER: They've been going at it like that for almost half an hour.

SCULLY: Well, it can't be aircraft. Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.

MULDER: What else could they be?

SCULLY: I don't know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds. (The two lights fly up through the clouds and disappear. Scully turns to face Mulder, her expression is one of amazement) Oh my God.

(Another bright light appears in the distance)

MULDER: Here comes another one.

SCULLY: That's not a plane, that's a helicopter.

(Mulder and Scully hear noises from the botton of the embankment, we see a guy and a girl coming through the fence and past a bush)

MULDER: Hey.

EMIL: Let's get outta here. (The young couple run off, Mulder and Scully chase after them across
a field. Mulder draws his gun, the guy notices it and both he and the girl stop and raise
their hands) Ok, don't shoot.

MULDER: Stay right there.

LADONNA: We didn't do anything.

(They all look up at the helicopter as it's search light gets closer to them)

MULDER: Come on.

(They all hide under the cover of a tree)

EMIL: Heh, heh, That was extreme.

MULDER: Let's go, you're coming with us.

EMIL: What?



SCENE 12
5:02 a.m.

(Inside another diner, the two kids are sitting eating away, while Mulder and Scully are sitting on the other side of the table)

SCULLY: So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?

EMIL: We were, erm, we're...

(Emil and the Ladonna laugh)

LADONNA: We kinda have this spot.

EMIL: You know, we go, we kinda, kick back and listen to some tunes and, er, watch the air show.

MULDER: Were you ever chased out before?

EMIL: No, first time right. Our friend showed us a hole in the fence about a year ago.

LADONNA: Oh, one time they dropped these bombs, wooah!

EMIL: Yeah, it was kinda heavy. (he laughs) Oh, ar, there's this place, ar, called the Yellow Base,
right, where they're supposed to store all this stuff. And my friend said that, there's
landmines all around it and junk like that.

(Outside the diner, a car pulls up and stops when the driver, Paul Mossinger, has Mulder and Scully in sight. He talks into a walkie-talkie)

PAUL MOSSINGER: I've got a twenty, over.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Roger, Redbird, assume fall back position, we're opening the gate.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Redbird out.

(Back inside the diner, Emil is demostrating, with a hamburger, how the lights sometimes fly)

EMIL: Sometimes they come in real low, and just put on the scares right, it's like eeoou-ra and
then they just hang there, and hover without making a sound. And you just think, you
know, who turned down the volume right.

MULDER: What do you think they are?

EMIL: Ok, everybody thinks that they're like UFOs, but I think it's some kinda, star wars cyber-
tech new fangled hardware right, they probably roll it out for, desert storm II or something
like that. Cruise right over Saddam's house, you know, it'll be like, what.

(He laughs. Then Mulder pulls out the photo, of the UFO, he bought at the Flying Saucer diner)

MULDER: Do they look anything like this?

EMIL: No, (Mulder's expression saddens a little) they look exactly like that.

(Mulder lifts Emil's mo-ped out of the trunk of his car and puts in on the ground)

EMIL: Thanks.

MULDER: Later Dude!

(Emil laughs and he and Ladonna walk up a driveway pushing the mo-ped. Mulder gets back into the car and takes a tape out of his shirt pocket)



SCENE 13

SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: Evidence. (Mulder puts the tape in the stereo and the sound of heavy metal guitar music fills the car. Scully turns it off) Kids today, huh.

SCULLY: You believe it all, don't you?

MULDER: Why wouldn't I?

(Scully has a great big smile across her face, almost laughing)

SCULLY: Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...

MULDER: Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.

SCULLY: Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that's exactly what he saw.

MULDER: Alright, I wanna show you something. (Mulder reaches into the back seat of the car and lifts a folder, he opens it and takes out a photo, which he gives to Scully) This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don't believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.

SCULLY: Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.

MULDER: No, planes built, using UFO technology.

(Scully smiles again at Mulder's total belief in UFOs, which she does not believe at all. Mulder gives Scully the photo from the diner)

SCULLY: Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You're going out on a pretty big limb.

MULDER: Tell me, there isn't a remarkable resemblance.

SCULLY: Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.

MULDER: You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?

SCULLY: Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna believe they were UFOs.

MULDER: Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I'm crazy.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're crazy. (Mulder chuckles) And it still doesn't explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas.



SCENE 14
BEECH GROVE MOTEL

(We see the reception office of the Beech Grove Motel, Scully is standing in it)

SCULLY: Thanks.

WOMAN: You're welcome.

(Scully comes running from the reception to Mulder's room. Mulder sees her running towards his room and gets up opens the door)

MULDER: You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?

SCULLY: You ready for this.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night.



SCENE 15
(Mulder and Scully drive to Mrs. Budahas' home. Mrs. Budahas opens the door)

SCULLY: We got your message.

(Mrs. Budahas is crying)

MULDER: Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?

ANITA BUDAHAS: C,come inside.

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: What? What's wrong?

(We see a man, who looks like Lt. Col. Robert Budahas, painting a model of an airplane)

ANITA BUDAHAS: That, is not my husband.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Honey, who are these people?

(Mulder looks at the photo of Lt. Col. Budahas, on the wall)

ANITA BUDAHAS: That is not him. That is not my husband. They've done something to him.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: What are you talking about?

MULDER: It's ok, it's ok, just relax, wel, I'm Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We're out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I was in the hospital.

MULDER: Here, on base?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I think so.

MULDER: Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: November 21st, 1948.

(Mulder looks at Mrs. Budahas for confirmation, she nods her head)

MULDER: And the names of your kids?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Josh and Lesley, they're right there.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Yeah.

(Mulder notices the shirt Col. Budahas is wearing says Green Bay)

MULDER: Green Bay fan.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Yes sir.

MULDER: Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Kicked four field goals, Lombardy's last game. Why do I have to answer these questions?

ANITA BUDAHAS: It's not him.

MULDER: Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that right?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Yes sir.

MULDER: Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g's, huh, is that possible?

LT. COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: I, I don't... I can't... Anita, I can't remember.

(Col. Budahas gets up to go to Mrs. Budahas, but she backs off, scared and crying)

ANITA BUDAHAS: No.

(Mulder and Scully leave the house)



SCENE 16

SCULLY: Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on.

MULDER: I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.

SCULLY: The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't just go in and erase certain files.

MULDER: Then you explain it to me.

SCULLY: There are types of amnesia th..

MULDER: This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate and insidious.

SCULLY: All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.

MULDER: And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn't in his head anymore.

(Mulder and Scully are driving along a road)

SCULLY: Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?

MULDER: To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.

SCULLY: It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?

MULDER: No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those manoeuvres, at those speeds. I mean we're talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it's taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.

(Scully smiles again, but this time she also gives a little laugh. Ahead two cars are approaching fast, the two cars cover both sides of the road, one slightly infront of the other)

SCULLY: What the hell is th..

MULDER: Hold on.

(Mulder slams on the brakes. The other two cars turn and stop sideways, blocking the road infront and behind Mulder and Scully. Groups of men wearing suits get out of both cars. One man approaches Mulder's side of the car and knocks on the window)

MAN: Please, step out of the car.

MULDER: You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away?

(The man knocks on the window again)

MAN: Please, step out of the car.

MULDER: Guess not. (Mulder gets out of the car) Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

(As he reaches for his id, another man pushes him up against the car and searches him. Scully gets out of the car)

SCULLY: Federal Agents.

(Scully is also searched, as is the car. The glove compartment is checked and Mulder's file containing the photos from Roswell. The magazine in Mulder's gun is removed and the gun is put on top of the car. The same is done with Scully's gun. One of the men opens the trunk and gets Mulder's camera, he opens it and pulls out the film, exposing it all to the light. Scully's briefcase is emptied of it's contents)

MULDER: You wanna tell me what this is about.

(A man punches Mulder in the ribs)

MAN: National security. Now get in your car. You'll be escorted back to your motel. You will pack
and leave town immediately, or assume the consequences of intense indiscretion.



SCENE 17
(Back at their motel, Scully is walking round her room, talking on the phone)

SCULLY: Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no no no, I'm sure the other one's bogus too, bye. (Mulder is lying on the bed) So who were those guys?

MULDER: I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.

SCULLY: Something else.

MULDER: I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn't give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.

SCULLY: What!

MULDER: Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there's a huge conspiracy here Scully. They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it. And they'll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.

SCULLY: If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.

MULDER: No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.

SCULLY: Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn't the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it's secrets?

MULDER: Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?

SCULLY: Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let's get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job.

(Mulder picks up the photo from the diner and holds it in front of Scully)

MULDER: Aren't you even curious? (Scully takes the photo from Mulder and sits down) Aaerm, I gonna shower, I'll pack and then, we'll get outta here.

(Mulder leaves the room, Scully is pleased that Mulder is agreeing with her to leave. Scully gets up and walks towards the bathroom, from outside she hears the sound of their car starting. She runs outside)

SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?

(Mulder drives off)



SCENE 18

(Emil and Ladonna show Mulder the hole in the fence at the air base)

EMIL: Right here.

(Mulder climbs through the hole)

MULDER: Hey, aren't you guys coming?

EMIL: No, we're, you know, we've only gone in at night.

MULDER: Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?

EMIL: Fourty-five minutes.

MULDER: Will I be able to find it?

LADONNA: Just stay on the path.

MULDER: And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.

EMIL: Don't, don't even, it's like ten miles, nobody's ever, nobody's ever been that far.

LADONNA: Hey, don't go past the edge of the tall weeds.

EMIL: Oh man, did we tell him about the, landmines and junk? HEY!

(Mulder walks to the edge of the tall weeds, he checks his watch and sits and waits until nightfall. He then leaves the tall weeds and walks towards Yellow Base. As he stands on the concrete ground, he notices a single light coming towards him. It is a triangular shaped aircraft, with lights at every point, which hovers above him. Several lights, on the underside of the aricraft, flicker on Mulder and he has to hold his hand in front of his eyes as the light becomes a beam surrounding him. After a few seconds, the light around Mulder disappears and the aircraft flies off at a great speed)



SCENE 19

(Behind Mulder, two vehicles approach, Mulder turns and sees them coming and starts running along the road. One vehicle stops in front of Mulder and the other behind him, several military officers jump out of the vehicles and tackle Mulder to the ground. Mulder is then lifted onto a stretcher and strapped down and put inside one of the vehicles)

VOICE: Go, go.

(Inside the van, Mulder is held down and he sees someone holding up a syringe and testing the contains are getting through the needle on the end)

MULDER: Nooo.

(Mulder is injected with the substance of the syringe)

VOICE: C'mon. Hold `im. Oxygen.

(An oxygen mask is put over Mulder's face)



SCENE 20
6:30 a.m.

(Scully is talking on the phone in her room at the Beech Grove motel)

SCULLY: Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can't seem to get a long distance line. (Her phone suddenly goes dead) Hello? Hello? (Scully puts the phone down beside her holstered gun and goes over to the motel reception office) Excuse me. Erm, my phone's not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?

MOTEL MANAGER: Sure thing.

SCULLY: This one's not working either.

MOTEL MANAGER: Phones are pretty undependable around here. People say it's the military interference, but, they say that about everything.

SCULLY: Thanks.



SCENE 21
(We see two hangar doors open and the van Mulder is in reverses in. The van comes to a stop and Mulder is taken out, still strapped to the stretcher. Mulder is barely conscious and sees the lights above him. As he looks around him , he sees men in white coats everywhere on one side of him and, some sort of aircraft behind a plastic curtain, on the other side)



SCENE 22
(Scully is walking back to her room when she notices Paul Mossinger coming out of her room, she reaches behind her for her gun, but it's still in her room)

PAUL MOSSINGER: Hi, I was just looking for you. I knocked, but I saw the door was open.

SCULLY: I was in the lobby trying to make a call.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Phones down again.

SCULLY: Yeah.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Base to redbird, can you give us your position, over? (Scully looks over at Paul's car as she hears the walkie-talkie, she looks back at Paul and smiles before running and getting into his car and locking the doors) Redbird do you copy?

PAUL MOSSINGER: What are you doing? (Scully reaches for the ignition but finds no key, she looks under the sun visors but finds nothing. Paul taps the window with the car key) Excuse me. (Scully reaches for the glove compartment) There's nothing in there.

(As she opens it, she finds a gun and Paul's ID: Airbase Security. Paul smashes the passenger's window with a fire extinguisher and Scully drops the gun while covering herself from the glass. Paul reaches in for Scully but she manages to push her thumb in his eye. He then goes around to the driver's door but Scully gets out and holds the gun to his face)

SCULLY: Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it.

PAUL MOSSINGER: Put the gun down, and we'll talk about it.

(Emil and Ladonna come riding up on the mo-ped. Scully pushes Paul to the car and holds the gun at his back)

SCULLY: I said, hands against the car. Who are you?

PAUL MOSSINGER: You're a long way from home, Dr. Scully. Nobody wants this to come to violence now.

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

EMIL: We took `im to the base.

LADONNA: We waited for `im.

SCULLY: I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is.

PAUL MOSSINGER: I don't think I can do that.

SCULLY: I think you can, or I'm gonna have every newspaper in America out here, writing about your experimental aircraft.

(A light is turned on, which shines brightly. We see a doctor come into view below the light, he looks into Mulder's eye. Mulder in strapped down to a medical table now, and Mulder looks around, but without moving his head. Another oxygen mask is put over Mulder's face and the doctor puts drops into Mulder's eyes)

(Paul Mossinger is driving his car, Scully is in the back holding the gun at him)

PAUL MOSSINGER: There are other ways to go about this.

SCULLY: Yeah, I've already seen where you get with tears and a sad story.

(The car approaches the gates to Yellow Base and stops, Paul turns off the engine. One of the guards on the gate is listening to a walkie- talkie)

WALKIE-TALKIE: Your target is arriving 12.

GUARD: Roger.

SCULLY: What are we doing?

PAUL MOSSINGER: Waiting.

SCULLY: I want the car running. I said start the car. (Paul starts the car) And put your hands on the wheel, where I can see them.

PAUL MOSSINGER: You do anything stupid, and this situation could get big in a hurry.

SCULLY: Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.

WALKIE-TALKIE: Intruder arriving.

GUARD: Copy.

(A jeep is approaching the gate from the inside of the base, the guards open the gate. The jeep comes to a stop as it reaches the gate. Mulder steps out and walks towards the other car)

SCULLY: I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the car. (Both Paul and Scully get out of the car, Scully keeps the gun pointed at Paul as she moves around the car and behind him) Get in the car Mulder. Get in the car.

(Mulder walks, very slowly towards the car, Paul walks towards the jeep. As they pass, Paul stops and turns to Mulder)

PAUL MOSSINGER: I just wanna say, everything you've seen here is equal to the protection we give it. It's you who have acted inappropriately.

(Both men continue to walk towards the vehicle in front of them. Scully gets in the car, followed by Mulder. As soon as Mulder is in, Scully drives off, quickly)

(Scully is driving the car back to town)

SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: I think so. Scully I...

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: How did I get here?



SCENE 23
(Mrs. Budahas opens the door to her house, but only enough so that she can stand in facing Mulder and Scully)

MULDER: Hi.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Hello.

MULDER: We came by to see how your husband was doing.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Oooh, he's fine, he's getting much better now.

MULDER: Do you think, maybe, we could see him.

ANITA BUDAHAS: Aaerm, wel, well he's resting now.

LT COLONEL ROBERT BUDAHAS: Who is it now?

ANITA BUDAHAS: Thank you for your concern.

(She closes the door)

MULDER: They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..

SCULLY: That's enough Mulder. We don't know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that's what I gonna write in my field report. Let's get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.



SCENE 24
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
ONE WEEK LATER

(Scully is typing up her field report, we hear the words as Scully types them)

Lt Colonel Robert Budahas, was returned to his home, although his own knowledge of his disappearance and whereabouts is vague and inconclusive. Special Agent Mulder's insistence that Budahas may have been a test pilot, on a top secret project involving aircraft using recovered UFO technology, and may have suffered severe stress related trauma by flying these aircraft, is also inconclusive. Though, this Agent can collaborate Agent Mulder's eye-witness account of two
unidentified flying objects, in the northern sky over Ellens Air Base, their exact nature or design could not be determined. Barring further authorised inquiry, this case - filed `DF101364' - is closed .

(Scully lifts up the photo of the UFO that Mulder bought at the diner and sits looking at it)



SCENE 25
(Mulder is running around a sports track, he stops and takes a rest before noticing Deep Throat approaching. Mulder walks towards him, meeting him halfway across the field)

DEEP THROAT: Your lives, may be in danger.

MULDER: Why?

DEEP THROAT: Mmm, you've seen things that weren't to be seen. Care and discretion, are now imperative.

MULDER: I saw something I...

DEEP THROAT: As I said, I can provide you with information, but only so long as it's in my best interest to do so.

MULDER: What is your interest?

DEEP THROAT: The truth.

MULDER: I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.

DEEP THROAT: A military UFO? Mr. Mulder, why are those like yourself, who believe in the existence of extra terrestrial life on this earth, not dissuaded by all the evidence to the contrary?

MULDER: Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.

DEEP THROAT: Precisely.

(Deep Throat walks away)

MULDER: They're here, aren't they?

(Deep Throat stops and turns to face Mulder)

DEEP THROAT: Mr. Mulder, they've been here for a long long time.

(Deep Throat continues to walk away, leaving Mulder standing by himself)

[THE END]
                                          SQUEEZE


SCENE 1
BALTIMORE, MD

(The camera pans over the city to an overhead view of a man leaving a restaurant. The man, dressed in a suit, walks along the street. The view changes to show a drain on the sidewalk. The scene with the man suddenly fades to black and white with only the man staying in color. The camera moves closer to th drain and a shape can be seen within it. The man stands opening the trunk of a car, as the shape in the drain gets closer, we see it is a pair of eyes)

(Next we see the man stepping out of an elevator, from a security monitor, the camera pans right to show the man walking away from the elevators and passed some offices. The elevator doors open but the elevator is not there. The cables in the shaft are shaking. A desklight is turned on inside an office and the man sits down, picks up the phone and dials a number)

MRS. USHER: Hi, you're reached the Usher residence, please leave a message at the tone, thank you.

(The man picks up, and shakes an ornamental snowstorm)

MR USHER: Hi honey, it's about 8:30 and erm, I'm gonna be here for a while. The presentation didn't go so well, call me, I love you, bye.

(The man, Mr. Usher, then lifts up a mug from his desk and leaves his office. Meanwhile, we see a narrow ventilation shaft, one of the screws, on the cover, seems to unscrewing itself, and then the cover opens. The man pours himself a cup of coffee, a hand emerges from the shaft. The man walks back to his office, as he enters, the door suddenly slams shut. There are screams and the door handle moves up and down as the man tries desperately to get out of the office. Part of the door suddenly breaks outwards in the struggle and then the struggle is over)

(Inside the office, blood is dripping onto the carpet, the desk is scattered with papers also covered in blood. In a reflection, from an object on the desk, we see the man lying dead, blood covering his face. The cover of the shaft is pulled closed and the screw, rescrews itself in place)

SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.

TOM COLTON: Guess who I ran into from our class at Quantico? Marty Neill.

(Tom Colton is sitting having lunch with Dana Scully, in a restaurant)

SCULLY: J. Edgar Jr?

TOM COLTON: Just got bumped up, Foreign Counter Intelligence, New York City Bureau, Supervisory, Special Agent.

SCULLY: Supervisory?

TOM COLTON: That's right.

SCULLY: Two years out of the academy, how'd he land that?

TOM COLTON: Lucked into the World Trade Center bombing.

SCULLY: Well, good for Marty.

TOM COLTON: Oh, come on Dana, the guy is a loser, look where he is now. That's where we should be.

SCULLY: Brad Wilson told me, the pyshological profile you wrote on the Washington Crossing Killer led them straight to the suspect. Word has it, you're on the Violent Crime Section's fast track.

TOM COLTON: So how are you doing? Have you had any close encounters of the third kind?

SCULLY: Is that what everyone thinks I do?

TOM COLTON: No, of course not. But you do work with Spooky Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder's ideas maybe a bit out there but he is a great agent.

TOM COLTON: Yeah, well, I've got this case that's, out there. Baltimore PD cops, they want our help on a serial killer profile. Three murders began six weeks ago, victims vary in age, race, gender, no known connections to each other.

SCULLY: I take it there's a pattern?

TOM COLTON: Point of entry. Actually, the lack of one.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

TOM COLTON: One victim, college girl, killed in her ten by twelve center block dorm room. She was found with the windows locked and the door chained from the inside. The last incident, two days ago, high security office building, nothing on the security monitors, janitor spoke to the victim minutes before the murder, didn't hear or see a thing out of the ordinary.

SCULLY: Suicides?

(Tom picks up a photo from beside him and gives it to Scully)

TOM COLTON: Each victim was found with their liver, ripped out. No cutting tools used.

SCULLY: Bare hands. This looks like an X-file.

TOM COLTON: Let's not get carried away. I'm gonna solve these murders but, what I would like from you is, to go over the case histories. Maybe, come down to the crime scene.

SCULLY: Do you want me to ask Mulder?

TOM COLTON: Ok, if he wants to come and do you a favor, great. But make sure he knows this is my case. Dana, if I can break a case like this one, I'll be getting my bump up the ladder. And you, maybe you won't have to be Mrs. Spooky anymore.



SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE
GEORGE USHER'S OFFICE
BALTIMORE, MD

(Mulder and Scully are standing in Usher's office)

MULDER: So why didn't they ask me?

SCULLY: They're friends of mine from the academy, I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.

MULDER: Why would I make them so uncomfortable?

SCULLY: It probably has to do with your reputation.

MULDER: Reputation? I have a reputation?

SCULLY: Mulder, look. Colton plays by the book and you don't. They feel your methods, your theories are...

MULDER: Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky?

VOICE: Agent Scully's in here sir.

(Tom enters)

TOM COLTON: Dana, sorry I'm late.

SCULLY: We just got here. Er, Fox Mulder, Tom Colton.

TOM COLTON: So, Mulder, what do you think, does this look like the work of little green men?

MULDER: Grey.

TOM COLTON: Excuse me.

MULDER: Grey. You said green men, a Reticulan skin tone is actually grey, they're notorious for their extraction of terrestrial human livers. Due to iron depletion in the Reticulan galaxy.

TOM COLTON: You can't be serious.

MULDER: Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula? `scuse me.

(Mulder walks off to look around the office, Tom can be heard talking to Scully in the background, Mulder looks down as he sees something)

TOM COLTON: Dana, I've been thinking about this and I have a theory, might explain alot, tell me what you think.

(Mulder bends down to pick up, using tweezers, what looks like a piece of metal thread)

What if the guy enters...

(Mulder looks at the thread and then looks up and sees the cover to the ventialtion shaft)

Hold on a second. What in the hell's he doing?

(Mulder lifts up a small brush and dusts around the cover)

Err, that vent is six inches by about eighteen, even if a Reticulan could crawl through, it's screwed in place.

(Mulder has revealed an elongated fingerprint)



SCENE 4
X-FILES OFFICE

(Mulder has several slides on a lightbox showing fingerprints)

MULDER: This is the print I took yesterday from Usher's office, these others are from an X-file. Ten murders, Baltimore area, undetermined points of entry, each victim had their liver removed. These prints were discovered at five of the ten crime scenes.

SCULLY: Ten murders, Colton never mentioned..

MULDER: Most likely, he's not aware of them. These two prints were lifted five years before he was born at Powhatan Mill. And these three were lifted probably, five years before his mother was even born.

SCULLY: Are you saying, these prints are from the 1960's and the 1930's?

MULDER: And fingerprinting was just coming into it's own in 1903, but there was a murder involving an extracted liver.

SCULLY: Of course.

(Scully wheels her chair away from the table and stands up)

MULDER: Now that's five murders every thirty years. That makes two more to go this year.

SCULLY: You're saying these are copy-cats.

MULDER: What did we learn in our first day at the academy, Scully? Each fingerprint is unique, these are a perfect match.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that I go before the Violent Crime Section and present a profile declaring that these murders were done by aliens?

MULDER: No, of course not, I find no evidence of alien involvement.

SCULLY: Well, what then? That, that this is the work of a hundred year old serial killer who is capable of overpowering a healthy six foot two businessman.

MULDER: And he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch fingers.

SCULLY: Look, bottom line, this is Colton's case.

(Mulder get up and stands beside Scully)

MULDER: Our X-file dates back to 1903, we had it first.

SCULLY: Mulder, they don't want you involved. They don't want to hear your theories. That's why Blevins has you hidden away down here.

MULDER: You're down here too. Look, why don't we agree to this, they'll have their investigation, we'll have ours and never the twain shall meet. Agreed?



SCENE 5
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully is typing up her report from a tape recording of her views)

After a careful review of the violent and powerful nature of these murders, I believe the killer to be a male, twenty-five to thirty-five years of age, with above average intelligence.

(We see the blueprints of a building, probably of the floor where George Usher worked)

His matter of entry has so far been undetectable, this may be due to his superior knowledge of the inner-structure of buildings and duct works. Or that he in fact hides in plain sight, posing as delivery or maintenace workers.

(Scully lifts up a slide of an elongated fingerprint and looks at it)

The extraction of the liver is the most significant detail of these crimes. The liver possesses regenerative qualities, it cleanses the blood,

(Scully's report continues but now she is telling it to Tom Colton and his superiors in a meeting)

the taking of this trophy is the transferring act for the killer to, cleanse himself of his own impurities. I think he is acting under, the classic form of obsessive compulsive behaviour. Now since the victims are unrelated, and we cannot predict who will be next, we must utilise the fact that a killer will not always succeed in finding a victim. When this occurs, a serial killer may, return in frustration to the sight of a previous murder, hoping to, recapture the emotional high. I think our best course of action is to target these sights.

FULLER: Good job, Agent Scully. If there are no objections, I'd like to begin our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight. We're looking for a male, twenty-five to thirty-five, possibly wearing a uniform, gas company, UPS, whatever. I know you're assigned to another area Scully, but if you don't mind some overtime, you're welcome to come aboard with us, on this. Erm, that is if you don't mind working in an area that's a bit more down-to-earth.



SCENE 6
CRIME SCENE
7:15 P.M.

(Scully is sitting in a car on a floor of the building's car park)

WALKIE-TALKIE: Position ten, do you check?

SCULLY: Position ten, I copy.

(Scully hears noises and gets out of the car and removes her gun. She walks forward to a wall and we hear the sound of someone running. As a man jumps through a large circular hole in the wall, Scully points her gun at him. It's Mulder, who stops and raises his hands)

MULDER: You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would ya copper?

(Scully walks back to her car)

SCULLY: Mulder, what the hell are you doing here?

MULDER: He's not coming back here, his thrill is derived from the challenge of unseemingly impossible entry. He's already beaten this place, if you'd read the X-file on the case, you'd come to the same conclusion.

SCULLY: Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.

MULDER: Seeds?

(Mulder holds up a bag he is carrying)

You're wasting your time, I'm going home.

(Mulder leaves and Scully gets back into the car. As Mulder is walking away he hears some noises, he stands behind a pillar but sees no one. He walks towards a caged off area of the car park and sees movement inside a ventilation duct. Mulder runs back to Scully)

Scully, call for backup and get over here.

SCULLY: Position ten requesting backup.

(Scully gets out of the car and runs over to Mulder, who is standing at a wall looking at the area with the ventilation ducts)

MULDER: In there.

(Mulder and Scully run over to the cage, and seeing the movement for herself, Scully points her gun at the duct)

SCULLY: Federal Agent, I'm armed. Proceed down the vent, slowly.

(A foot kicks open the duct hatch and a man exits, he slowly stands up and turns around holding his hands up. Several agents come running to the scene)

TOM COLTON: Take `im.

AGENT: Alright, move, move, move.

AGENT 2: FBI.

AGENT: Don't move, don't move, get your hands up, keep `em up.

AGENT 2: You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent..

MULDER: You were right.

(In the background we can hear an agent reading the man his rights)



SCENE 7
FBI BUREAU
BALTIMORE, MD

(The man arrested is taking a polygraph test, the examiner is marking the parts of the printout that are the man's answers)

EXAMINER: Is your full name, Eugene Victor Tooms?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Are you an employee of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Is it your intent to lie to me about anything here, today?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Were you ever enrolled in college?

(We see that the test is being watched from another room through a two way mirror)

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Were you ever enrolled in medical school?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

(Watching the test is, Agents Mulder, Scully, Colton, Fuller and a guard)

EXAMINER: Have you ever removed a liver from a human being?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Have you ever killed a living creature?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: Have you ever killed a human being?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Were you ever in George Usher's office?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Did you kill George Usher?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Are you over one hundred years old?

TOM COLTON: That must be a control question.

MULDER: I had her ask it.

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Have you ever been to Powhatan Mill?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

EXAMINER: In 1933?

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

EXAMINER: Are you afraid you might fail this test?

EUGENE TOOMS: Well, yes, because I didn't do anything.

(The test is over and now the examiner and the agents are discussing the results in the test room)

EXAMINER: He nailed it, A plus, as far as I'm concerned, the subject did not kill those two people.

(Mulder gets up and checks the results himself. Fuller comes in.)

FULLER: Maintenance people at the office building, confirm the call to animal control regarding a bad smell. They found a dead cat, in the ventilation ducts on the second floor.

TOM COLTON: Well, that's that.

SCULLY: It still doesn't explain what he was doing there that late at night.

FULLER: So, he's one of the few civil servants we have with initiative, and we busted him for it.

SCULLY: He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting security.

TOM COLTON: Dana, he passed the test, his story checks out, he's not the guy. It doesn't mean that your profile's incorrect.

MULDER: Scully's right, it is the guy.

FULLER: Whatta you got, Mulder?

MULDER: He lied on questions eleven and thirteen, his electrodermal and cardiographic response nearly go off the chart.

FULLER: Is number eleven, the hundred year old question? Well, let me tell ye, I had a reaction to that stupid question. And what the hell is this Powhatan Mill thing.

MULDER: Two murders with matching mo's occurred in Powhatan Mill in 1933, just look at the chart.

EXAMINER: My interpretation of those reactions..

FULLER: I don't need you or that machine, telling me if Tooms was alive in `33.

MULDER: He's the guy.

FULLER: I'm letting him go.

(Fuller and the examiner leave the room, Tom turns to Scully)

TOM COLTON: You comin'?

SCULLY: Tom, I wanna thank you for letting me put in some time with the VCS, but I am officially assigned to the X-files.

TOM COLTON: I'll see what I can do about that.

SCULLY: Tom, I can look out for myself.

TOM COLTON: You said Mulder was out there, that guy's insane.

(Tom leaves and Scully turns to look at Mulder)

(Mulder and Scully are walking through an office floor of the bureau)

SCULLY: You knew they wouldn't believe you, why did you push it?

MULDER: Maybe I thought you caught the right guy. And maybe I run into so many people, who are hostile, just because they can't open their minds to the possibilties, that sometimes the need to mess with their heads, outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

(They stop at the bottom of some stairs)

SCULLY: It seems like you were acting very territorial, I don't know, forget it.

(Scully goes to turn away but Mulder stops her, he is touching Scully's necklace)

MULDER: Of course I was, in our investigations, you may not always agree with me but at least you respect the journey. And if you wanna continue working with them, I won't hold it against ye.

(Mulder starts up the stairs and after a brief pause, Scully follows)

SCULLY: Er, I don't know, you must have something more than your polygraph interpretation to backup this bizarre theory and I have to see what it is.



SCENE 8
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

(Mulder is looking at the arrest record of Eugene Tooms on computer)

MULDER: These are Eugene Tooms' prints.

(Mulder isolates the left middle finger print and discards the rest, for a fingerprint anaylsis)

This is the fingerprint they took from Usher's office,

(Mulder brings up one of the elongated fingerprints)

it matches the old ones from the X-files. Obviously no match, but what if, somehow...

(Mulder squashes Tooms' print sideways, then stretches it lenghtways. Next he overlaps the two prints on screen, a readout shows a match of one hundred percent)

SCULLY: How could that be?

MULDER: Only thing I know for certain is, they let him go.



SCENE 9
(It is a dark night and a car pulls into a driveway, as it gets closer to the house, a motion sensor light comes on. We see a pair of eyes watching from the bushes. As the man gets out of the car and walks around it, all color, again, fades to black and white except for the man)

(Eugene Tooms jogs from the bushes to the side of the house and looks in a window. The man enters the room, and Tooms backs off as the man gets closer to the window. Tooms then runs to another part of the house and looks up, he starts climbing the wall. Inside the house, the man checks through some envelopes and takes off his jacket. Tooms has made it up the wall and pulls himself onto the roof beside the chimney stack, which he enters by stretching his body to fit)

(The man walking from the kitchen, with a drink in his hand, enters the living room and stands by the mantel drinking his drink. The man puts his drink on the mantel and straightens a small glass container. He bends down and opens the doors to the fire, he then strikes a long match and tries to light some paper in the fire. From the shadows of the room, emerges Tooms. As the man turns around, Tooms jumps on him and pushes him onto the floor. The man is kicking, trying to get up, but looses the struggle)

(It is daytime and a man is stretching a measuring tape across the murdered man's living room)

FULLER: Sixty-four inches from the south wall.

TOM COLTON: Let's run a check on liver transplants in the next twenty-four hours, maybe this thing is black market.

FULLER: C'mon, it was ripped outta there.

TOM COLTON: Look at this point, I'm willing to give any theory a shot.

(He sees Mulder and Scully enter the house)

Any sane theory, I'm sorry Dana but I only want qualified members of the investigating team at the crime scene.

MULDER: What's the matter Colton, you worried I'm gonna solve your case?

(Mulder goes to walk further into the house but Colton stops him)

SCULLY: Tom. We have authorized access to this crime scene. A report of you obstructing another officer's investigation might stick out on your personnel file.

(Tom lets Mulder enter)

TOM COLTON: Look Dana, whose side are you on?

SCULLY: The victim's.

FULLER: A hundred and five inches from the fireplace.

(Mulder looks at a single elongated fingerprint that has been dusted on the front of the mantel)

SCULLY: The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white..

MULDER: It's Tooms.

(Mulder points to the fingerprint, and also notices four small prints, like the tips of fingers on top of the mantel)

And he took something.



SCENE 10

(Mulder is looking through a microfiche reader of a county census from 1903, and finds the name, Eugene Victor Tooms. Scully enter the room)

SCULLY: Baltimore PD checked out Tooms' apartment, it was a cover. No one has ever lived there and he hasn't shown up for work since he was arrested.

MULDER: I found him. How do we learn about the present, we look to the past. I think this is where it all began in 1903 on Exeter Street.

(Mulder points to the address of Tooms on screen)

Now look at the address of that first murder in 1903.

(Scully lifts up the file on this case)

SCULLY: Apartment 2 0 3. He killed the guy above him.

MULDER: Maybe, his neighbour played the victrola too loud.

SCULLY: Well, this must be Tooms' great grandfather.

MULDER: What about the prints?

SCULLY: Genetics might explain the patterns, it also might explain the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours. It begins with one family member, who raises an offspring, who raises the next child.

MULDER: So what is this, the Anti-Waltons.

SCULLY: Well, what do you think?

MULDER: I think what we have to do is track Eugene Tooms, there's four down and one to go this year. If we don't get him right now, the next chance is in year.....

SCULLY: 2023.

MULDER: And you're gonna be head of the bureau by then. So I think you have to go through the census, I'm gonna plough through this century's marriage, birth, death certificates, and... You have any dramamine on you by any chance cos, these things make me seasick.

(Mulder and Scully go through the information for hours)

Anything?

SCULLY: Nope, he disappeared off the face of the earth. You?

MULDER: Never was born, never married, never died.

SCULLY: At least in Baltimore County. No, I did find one thing though, erm, it's the current address of the investigating officer at the Powhatan Mill murders in 1933.



SCENE 11
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME
BALTIMORE, MD

(Sitting in front of Mulder and Scully is an old man in a wheelchair)

FRANK BRIGGS: I've waited twenty-five years for you.

SCULLY: Sir?

FRANK BRIGGS: I called it quits, in 1968 after, fourty-five years as a cop. And those killings at Powhatan Mill. I was a sheriif then and, er, I'd seen my share of murders, bloody ones. But I could go home and, pitch a few baseballs to my kid and never give it a second thought, you gotta be able to do that. You'd go crazy, right. But those murders in Powhatan Mill, when I walked into that room, my heart, went cold, my hands, numbed. I could feel, IT.

MULDER: Feel what, Frank?

FRANK BRIGGS: When I first heard about the death camps in 1945, I remembered Powhatan Mill. When I see the kurds and the bosnians, that room is there, I tell ye. It's like all the horrible acts that humans are capable of, somehow, gave birth to some kind of, human monster. That's why I say I've been waiting for you. Aah, there's a box in the trunk here, get it for me, would you please.

(Mulder lifts a box out of the trunk and puts it on the bed, Frank wheels himself to it)

Now this, is all the evidence I've collected, officially and unofficially.

SCULLY: Unofficially?

FRANK BRIGGS: I knew the murders in `63 were by the same, person as in `33. But by then, they had me on a desk, pushing papers and they wouldn't let me anywhere near the case.

(Scully lifts a jar out of the box and looks in it)

SCULLY: A piece of the removed liver?

FRANK BRIGGS: Yes, but you know, that's not the only trophy he took with him. Family members reported small personal affects missing in each case. A hairbrush in the Walters murder, a coffee mug in the Taylor murder.

MULDER: Have you ever heard the name, Eugene Victor Tooms?

FRANK BRIGGS: Humh, when they wouldn't bring me aboard in `63 I, I did some of my own work. I took, these surveillance pictures, this, is Tooms.

(Frank shows some photos to Mulder and Scully)

Course, that was him thirty years ago.

(Frank takes out another photo and shows it to Mulder)

And this, is the apartment where he lived. It was located at..

MULDER: 66 Exeter Street?

FRANK BRIGGS: Right. That's it, right there.

(We see the photo of where Tooms lived. The photo changes to reality as Mulder and Scully go there)



SCENE 12

(Mulder and Scully pull up to 66 Exeter Street in their car, they enter the building, it is a run down empty building)

SCULLY: Here's 103.

(They enter the room)

MULDER: The old man was right, you can feel it.

SCULLY: There's nothing here.

MULDER: Check this out.

(Mulder pushes down a mattress that is standing against the wall.
Behind it is a large hole in the wall)

What's down here?

SCULLY: I don't know.

(Scully puts her gun away and enters the hole)

Let's find out.

(Scully climbs down a ladder, followed by Mulder and they shine their torches into the darkness)

Just an old coal cellar.

(As they look further in the cellar, they come across a table full of objects)

MULDER: Somebody having a garage sale.

(Mulder picks up a small glass container)

This is the shape of Werner's mantel.

SCULLY: Frank said he collected trophies.

MULDER: Does he live in here?

SCULLY: It looks like the wall's deteriorating.

MULDER: No, somebody made it.

(Mulder and Scully make their way to part of the room where a wall looks like it's crumbling)

This is a nest, look, it's made out of rags and newspapers.

SCULLY: This looks like the opening, think there's anything inside?

(Mulder feels the opening and gets a slimy substance on his hand)

Oh my God, Mulder, it's smells like, I think it's bile.

MULDER: Is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without betraying my cool exterior?

(Mulder quickly flicks the stuff of his fingers)

SCULLY: No one could live in this.

MULDER: I don't think it's where he lives, I think it's where he hibernates.

SCULLY: Hibernates?

MULDER: Just listen, what if some genetic mutation could allow a man to awaken every thirty years.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for that period. What if Tooms is some kind of, twentieth century, genetic mutant.

SCULLY: In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back.

MULDER: Well we're gonna need a surveillance team.

SCULLY: Yeah, that'll take some fannagling.

MULDER: Well you go down town and see what you can fannagle, I'll keep watch.

(Mulder and Scully get up and walk back towards the opening of the cellar. Scully stops suddenly)

SCULLY: Oh, wait, I'm snagged on something, oh, it's ok, I got it.

(As Scully continues forward, a hand appears from within the rafters and opening it's hand we see Scully's necklace dangling from it. We then see Tooms in the rafters)



SCENE 13
66 EXETER ST., 11:30 A.M.

(Mulder is sitting in his car when one of the back doors open and another agent gets in.
Another one gets in the front)

MULDER: It's about time.

KENNEDY: So, who're we looking for again?

MULDER: Eugene Tooms, he's unarmed but consider him dangerous. Scully and I'll be back to relieve you in eight hours if he doesn't show, right here.

KRAMER: You got it, Spooky.

(Mulder gets out of the car as the two agents are laughing)



SCENE 14

(Scully is siiting in a room at the bureau. Tom comes in)

TOM COLTON: We have to talk.

SCULLY: I have to meet Mulder..

TOM COLTON: That's what we have to talk about. You're using two of my men to sit in front of a building that's been condemned for ten years?

SCULLY: It isn't in any way interferring with your investigation.

TOM COLTON: When we first had lunch, I really looked forward to working with you, you were a good agent, but now after Mulder, I couldn't have you far enough away. Don't bother going down there, I had the stakeout called off.

SCULLY: You can't do that.

TOM COLTON: No, I can't but my regional asat can, especially after I told them about the irresponsible waste in man hours.

(Scully picks up the phone but before she can phone Mulder, Tom takes the phone off her)

Auh-uh! Let me call Mulder, let me tell him the news.

SCULLY: Is this what it takes to climb the ladder Colton?

TOM COLTON: All the way to the top.

SCULLY: Then I can't wait `til you fall off and land on your ass.

(Tom phones Mulder)

[ MULDER'S ANSWER MACHINE ]

This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.

(Scully pulls up outside her apartment. From the darkness we can see the eyes of Tooms, watching. Scully walks from her car to her apartment block and Tooms sees it all in black and white)



SCENE 15
66 EXETER ST., 7:25 P.M.

(Mulder pulls up in his car)

MULDER: Where is everyone? Scully?

(Mulder has a quick look around and then runs and enters the building)

(Back at Scully's apartment)

[ MULDER'S ANSWER MACHINE ]

This is Fox Mulder, I'm not here, leave a message.

SCULLY: Mulder, you must've gone out since Colton gave us the night off, I say we file a complaint against him, I am furious. Call me when you get in, ok, bye.

(Scully is in her bathroom, after hanging up, she runs a bath. Scully walks out of the bathroom and outside the window we see Tooms reach up and feel the window)

(Meanwhile, Mulder is in the cellar below Tooms' apartment. As he looks at the table with the trophies, from the murders, he sees and recognises Scully's necklace)

MULDER: Dammit.

(Scully is back in her bathroom, she lifts a towel of the rack and goes over to the bath and turns off the taps. She lifts a small bottle from a shelf, she moves to the side of the bath to open it. As she opens it, a lump of bile falls from the ceiling and splashes on her hand. She breaths deeply, in shock, and then looks up at the vent in the ceiling, there is bile around one corner of it. Scully rushes out of the bathroom and looks for her gun in the apartment)

(Mulder is driving his car and using his phone)

MULDER: Dammit, ANSWER.

(We see that the phone line to Scully's apartment have been cut)

(Scully is moving about her apartment, with her gun, searching for Tooms. She enters a room and turns, pointing her gun at a small vent near the floor. As Scully turns away from the vent, a hand comes crashing through and grabs Scully's leg causing her to fall. We see the face of Tooms in the vent as well. Scully manages to grab hold of a door frame and pull herself from Tooms' grasp)

(Mulder pulls up outside Scully's apartment block)

(Tooms forces himself out through the vent and Scully, on the floor, backs off into the bathroom. Tooms gets up and follows her in and sits on her. Scully tries to hit Tooms but he blocks it, but she punches him with her other hand)

(Mulder races into the building)

(Scully pushes her thumbs into the eyes of Tooms, but he grabs her arms and pushes them to the floor above her head, exposing her stomach)

(Mulder breaks open Scully's door, and rushes in)

MULDER: SCULLY!

(Tooms, hearing Mulder, gets off Scully and breaks the bathroom window. Mulder comes into the bathroom and points his gun at Tooms. Scully gets up and grabs Tooms before he can get out the window, but Tooms grabs Scully by the throat and tries to choke her. As he does this, Mulder puts handcuffs on one of Tooms' wrists. Tooms elbows Mulder, knocking him to the ground, and turns to advance on him. Scully grabs the handcuffs, stopping him from getting closer to Mulder and then pulls the handcuffs to the bath taps. Scully feeds the handcuffs through the taps, Tooms tries to stop her, but Scully grabs his other hand and fastens it in the other handcuff. Mulder gets up and points his gun at Tooms, who is tugging at the handcuffs)

You alright?

(Scully is leaning against the wall, breathing heavily. She manages a nod of the head)

He's not gonna get his quota this year.

(Tooms stops pulling at the handcuffs and accepts defeat)



SCENE 16
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME
BALTIMORE, MD

(Frank is reading an article, on the front page of a newspaper, about `the consequences of ethnic cleansing'. Shaking his head he opens the newspaper and notices a small article about Eugene Tooms at the bottom of the page)

(We see the article of Tooms again, only this time it is being ripped. As the torn piece of paper is lifted up, we see it is Tooms who has ripped it. He licks the torn piece of paper a couple of times and crumples it up and throws it against a wall. The wall has alot of paper either already stuck to it or lying on the ground)

(Mulder is watching Tooms from outside his cell. Scully comes walking around a corner and down the corridor. She looks through the window into Tooms' cell. He is still licking paper)

MULDER: Look at him, he's building another nest.

SCULLY: You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic tests. The preliminary medical exam revealed quite abnormal development in the muscular and skeletal systems, as well as a continually declining metabolic rate. It dips way below the levels registered in deep sleep. Did you hear what I said Mulder?

(Tooms has stopped what he was doing and is now looking at Mulder watching him)

(Tooms, stops looking at Mulder and continues with his nest)

MULDER: All these people putting bars on their windows, spending good money on hi-tech security systems, trying to feel safe. I look at this guy and I think, "It ain't enough".

(We see Tooms, licking more paper, through the window)

(Scully turns to Mulder and they both walk off down the corridor. As they go around the corner, a guard opens a door, at the end of the corridor, for an orderly, who is carrying a meal on a tray. The orderly walks to the door to Tooms cell. Tooms, who is stil licking paper, turns his head to the door when he hears a lock opening. A small opening in the door appears and the orderly slides the tray through, then locks the outside flap and walks away)

(Sometime later)

(Tooms is sitting on his bed staring at the small opening in the door, where the food tray was placed earlier. The camera switches between Tooms and the opening in the door, and zooming in on both in turn. As the camera gets closer to Tooms' face, a smile appears across his face as he studies the opening in the door)

SCENE 1

(It is a dark night and there is a campfire going, a young boy and girl are sleeping in their sleeping bags outside a camper van, beside a lake. Inside the van sleeps the mother, and all is quiet. We see there is a bag of shells on a table, the tap is dripping and a cup of coffee sits on the table also. Suddenly the cup starts shaking, the mother wakes up as we see it's the whole van that is shaking. She falls out of her bunk and hits the floor hard, a cupboard opens and all the plates and cups shake off the shelf. A bright light is coming in through the windows, the woman is sitting on the floor backed against a wall and screaming. As suddenly as the shaking started, it stops)

DARLENE MORRIS: Kids!

KEVIN MORRIS: MOM! MOM!

DARLENE MORRIS: Kevin!

KEVIN MORRIS: MOM! (The woman crawls towards the door of the camper and as she puts her hand on the handle, she burns her hand) MOM! MOM! (The woman looks around and finds an oven glove which she puts on) MOM! MOM! MOM! (As the woman opens the door, her son, Kevin, is standing at the bottom of the steps in front of the door) MOM! Ruby's gone.

(The woman comes out of the camper and takes Kevin's hand)

DARLENE MORRIS: Ruby! RUBY! (The woman runs to both sides of the camper calling out her daughter's name) RUBY! RUBY! (The woman stops and looks straight up into the night sky) RUBY!

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(We see the outside of the building and then we see Scully in Section Chief Scott Blevins' office. He hands Scully a green file)

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder's latest 3-0-2, requesting assignment and travel expenses for the both of you.

SCULLY: Sioux City, Iowa. That's the first I've heard of it.

BLEVINS: It came up through channels, from Mulder's Asat, to the district G-14 and onto my desk.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

(Inside the file, attached to the 3-0-2, is an article cut out from a
paper with the headline `TEEN TAKEN FROM TENT BY ALIENS')

BLEVINS: In essence, Mulder is petitioning the bureau to assign a case number to a tabloid headline.

SCULLY: He must have more evidence than..

BLEVINS: Not according to his 3-0-2, he doesn't.

SCULLY: I admit, that is strange. Even for Mulder.

(Blevins gets up and takes a file out of a filing cabinet)

BLEVINS: Perhaps, it has something to do with this, take a look.

(He walks in front of the desk and gives the file to Scully)

SCULLY: An X-File.

(Scully opens the file and inside we see the following information:)

Name Samantha T. Mulder Address 2790 Vine Street City Chilmarc, Mass. Place of Birth Chilmarc, Mass. Date of Birth January 22, 1964 Nationality American

(Below is a picture of a young girl. More information reads as:)

REMARKS: Name and address of nearest relative notified in case of emergency.

Fox Mulder (brother) c/o F.B.I. Washington Bureau

(There is also a signature below)

(Scully sits down)

BLEVINS: Has he shared any of this with you? There's no need to protect him, he's the agent of record, he initiated the file himself.

SCULLY: She was his sister, she disappeared twenty-one years ago, he was, twelve and she was eight. He claims that he was in the room when it happened. He recalls a, bright light outside the window and er, and a presence in the room.

BLEVINS: In your opinion, has Agent Mulder's personal agenda clouded his professional judgement?

SCULLY: In my opinion, no.

BLEVINS: But you can see, how it might appear that way. (Blevins goes behind his desk and sits down) As you know, Agent Mulder's pre-occupation with fringe matters has been a big source of friction in the bureau, this is another case in point. I'm gonna disallow the 3- 0-2.

SCULLY: With respect sir, at least let me talk with him, and make a recommendation.



SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE

(Scully is pacing talking to Mulder, who is sitting at a desk)

SCULLY: It just doesn't seem, substantial enough to warrant an investigation.

MULDER: Ok Scully, so we disagree, it's not the first time and it won't be the last.

SCULLY: Well, at least if we had a legitimate source, we could..

MULDER: This is the essence of science, you ask an impertinent question and you're on your way to a pertinent answer.

SCULLY: But what makes this case anymore credible, than...(Scully lifts a copy of National Comet, from were the article attached to Mulder's 3-0-2 was taken, off Mulder's desk and reads another cover feature)...the hundred year old mother with the lizard baby?

MULDER: Because, the lizard baby, wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.

SCULLY: Oko-what?

MULDER: Bogee. (Mulders get up and talks right into Scully's face) Okobogee.

SCULLY: Is that supposed to mean something to me?

(Mulder turns off the lights)

MULDER: If you know anything about trout fishing, or UFO hotspots.

SCULLY: Define hotspot.

(Mulder turns on a slide projector and we see a UFO on a projection screen)

MULDER: Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a national weather service plane. (Mulder clicks to a bigger picture of the UFO) This is a light blasted, digitally enhanced enlargement.

SCULLY: The pilot took that photograph?

MULDER: Try a girl scout with an instamatic. Four of the nine girls in the troupe claim to have seen something, five if you include the den mother. The Air Force said it was a weather balloon caught in a wind sheer. But there wasn't a weather balloon launched that day within seven hundred miles. (Mulder turns off the slide projector and gets a file which he gives to Scully) Now read me the names of those girl scouts from 1967.

(Mulder turns on an overhead projector and walks off out of sight)

SCULLY: Lisa Tyrell, Bonnie Winston, Dorreen McAllister, Darlene Mor...

(Mulder attached to his 3-0-2)

MULDER: It's the same Darlene Morris.



SCENE 4
SIOUX CITY, IA

(Mulder and Scully pull up to a house in a car, they get out and approach the house. Mulder knocks on the door)

SCULLY: Miss Darlene Morris? (Scully shows her id) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder, we talked with you on the phone last night.

DARLENE MORRIS: Er, please come in. (They enter the house) Well I, knew that if I screamed, loud and long enough that, someone would listen. But I never expected the FBI. Er, this is Kevin. Kevin, say "hi". (Kevin is sitting at a table in the next room) Would you like some coffee?

SCULLY: Hmmm.

(Darlene walks off to the kitchen, Scully walks towards the next room when she looks behind her at Mulder. Mulder is looking at some of the pictures on the mantel, pictures showing Ruby. Mulder touches a photo of Ruby as a young girl)

(Darlene, Scully and Mulder are sitting in the kitchen)

DARLENE MORRIS: Somedays I can't even, get myself up out of bed. And, Kevin has been acting so strange, er, I don't know what to do anymore. I, I just, want her back again.

SCULLY: Miss Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle?

DARLENE MORRIS: Charles had nothing to do with this.

SCULLY: How can you be so sure?

DARLENE MORRIS: Because I know what happened. It's just like it was before.

MULDER: Summer of 1967, the girl scout troupe?

DARLENE MORRIS: How did you know about that?

MULDER: Your name's on record at the center for UFO studies in Evanston, Illinois.

DARLENE MORRIS: Really?

MULDER: Yea, pilot for the national weather service made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day.

DARLENE MORRIS: They took her didn't they Mr. Mulder?

(There is a long pause)

MULDER: You, you said that erm, Kevin was there, the night it happened.

DARLENE MORRIS: He didn't see anything, he was asleep.

MULDER: Do you think I might talk to him anyway? (Darlene nods her head) Thanks.

(Mulder gets up and walks away)

DARLENE MORRIS: You know, I've told this story so many times now, oh to the newspapers and the police. And everytime I tell it, people get this, look in their eye, just like the look that you've got right now.

(Kevin is sitting in front of a TV which is untuned to any channel)

MULDER: Hey buddy! Mind if I sit down? (Kevin shrugs his shoulders) Thanks. (Mulder sits on the end of a coffee table) Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares.

KEVIN MORRIS: I guess so.

MULDER: Wanna tell me about `em?

KEVIN MORRIS: No.

MULDER: Alright. (Mulder notices Kevin is writing on a pad) Whatta you doing? (Kevin turns round to look at Mulder and then turns back to his pad and continues writing) Are you making something? (Kevin nods his head) Can I take a look at it? (Kevin lifts his pad and passes it to Mulder) Thanks.

(When Mulder looks at the pad all he sees are ones and zeroes written continously down the page)

(Kevin points towards the tv)

KEVIN MORRIS: It's coming from there.

MULDER: The TV?

(Kevin stops pointing at the tv and nods his head)



SCENE 5
SIOUX CITY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

(A fax is being sent out on headed paper. The information on it reads:)

DATE: AUG 26
FROM: FOX MULDER
TO: DANIEL BERNSTEIN
REPORTING TO: CRYPTOGRAPHY SECTION, F.B.I. WASH. D.C.

(Mulder is talking on a phone, Scully is in the Sheriff's office talking to the Sheriff)

MULDER: I don't know what it is, maybe a binary sequence of some kind. Could be anything, could be nothing. I know you're busy, look erm, I know a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend who-oo can get you tickets to a Redskins game. You got it. Alright, you know where to find me? Thanks Danny.

(Inside the Sheriff's office, the Sheriff walks around to sit behind his desk)

SIOUX CITY SHERIFF: So, as I was telling your partner, we found no evidence of kidnap, no phone call, no ransom note, and since we didn't turn up a body....

MULDER: You assume she ran away.

SHERIFF: Well, it wouldn't be the first time Ruby Morris ran away from home.

MULDER: Well, how do you explain what her mother saw?

SHERIFF: Well I think that Darlene has a very active imagination. I've been listening to those stories since the first grade.

MULDER: So basically you ignored her statement.

SHERIFF: I included it in my report.

MULDER: But you didn't bother to check it out.

SHERIFF: We went out to the camp sight, we didn't find anything. Let me tell you something, Darlene's little girl was no prom queen. I can't count the number of times I pulled her out of parked cars, or found her puking her guts out by the side of the road, it was just a matter of time before...

MULDER: Before what?

SHERIFF: Before something bad happened to her and if Darlene needs to make up crazy stories to get past that, fine. But don't tell me to treat it as the truth, I not gonna waste my time.

(Mulder and Scully leave the building)

SCULLY: I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement.

MULDER: Who me? I'm Mr. Congeniality.

SCULLY: You never know, we might need his help one of these days.

MULDER: I'll send him a bunt cake.

(As Mulder walks around the driver's side of their car, he notices a piece of paper stuck under the window wiper. He takes it and opens it, it reads `I'M ACROSS THE STREET FOLLOW ME'. Mulder hands the note to Scully, who after reading it looks around to see who left the note. They see a girl across the street, and when she sees that Mulder and Scully have noticed her, she walks away. Mulder and Scully follow her into a library)

(As they enter the library, they look up each of the aisles until they find the girl standing at the end of one. As they approach, the girl moves into the next aisle and talks to Mulder and Scully through the books)

TESSA: You're looking for Ruby, right?

SCULLY: That's right. Who are you?

TESSA: Doesn't matter.

SCULLY: Are you a friend of Ruby's?

TESSA: Ruby didn't have friends, she just had people she liked to hang with.

SCULLY: And she liked to hang out with you?

TESSA: Guess we had some times.

MULDER: Like the night she disappeared?

TESSA: It was Greg, she was supposed to see him that night.

MULDER: Who's Greg?

TESSA: Her boyfriend, Greg Randall. Supposed to meet up at the lake. Had stuff to talk about.

MULDER: What kind of stuff?

TESSA: Greg got Ruby pregnant. I don't know, whatever, she got herself pregnant.

SCULLY: Do you know what they were planning to do about it?

TESSA: Gonna leave town, least that's what Ruby told me.

SCULLY: You know Greg from School?

TESSA: Greg, school, I don't think so. All he ever did since we met him was pour beer, The Pennyslvania Pub.

(A woman knocks some books off a shelf, Mulder and Scully turn to see what the noise was but when they turn back to talk to Tessa, she's gone. They look in the next aisle but she's gone)



SCENE 6
THE PENNSYLVANIA PUB

(Outside the pub is alot of parked motorbikes, inside most people are wearing leather jackets. Mulder and Scully make their way across the floor to the bar. A comment is made about Scully, refering to her as a `real' girl)

MULDER: `scuse me. Do you know where we could find Greg Randall?

PENNSYLVANIA PUB BARTENDER: Who's asking? (Mulder takes out and shows his id) What kind of trouble's he got himself into now?

MULDER: Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.

BARTENDER: Greg called in sick about three weeks ago man, I haven't seen or heard from him since.

MULDER: Any ideas where he might have gone?

BARTENDER: No, but if you find him, you tell him he's fired.

SCULLY: This is the motel we'll be staying at if you hear of anything.

(Scully gives the bartender a card with the details of where they are staying. The bartender looks at it and puts it in his waistcoat pocket. As they are about to leave, Mulder notices a tattoo on the
bartender's arm)

MULDER: Hey, that's a nice tattoo, what is that?

BARTENDER: What's it look like?

MULDER: Flying saucer. You don't really believe in that stuff do ya?

BARTENDER: I take it you don't.

MULDER: No, I think it's all just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon.

BARTENDER: So er, you haven't been out to Lake Okobogie, have ya?

MULDER: No I haven't, why?

BARTENDER: You should ride with us sometime, you might see somethings that'll change your mind. (The bartender pulls back his hair to show his ear. It looks like the skin has been badly burned) Get a killer sunburn in the middle of the night.



SCENE 7
STAY `N SAVE MOTOR INN
5:30 A.M.

(Scully is sleeping in her room, shadows move across her body. When she wakens she sees figures standing outside her door and she hears whispers)

VOICE 1: Yeah.

VOICE 2: ..downstairs.

VOICE 3: Alright.

(Scully sits up in bed watching the figures outside her door. The door handle is turned but it is locked. Scully sees her gun on a dresser on the other side of the room and gets out of bed to get it. As she puts her hand on it, the door is busted open and a man shines a light in her face)

FOURTH MAN: Where's Mulder?

(A man, Holtzman, and the man who initially bust into Scully's room, are now in Mulder's room. Mulder is sitting on the edge of his bed)

HOLTZMAN: Where did you get the document?

MULDER: Well, if you explain to me what you're talking about, maybe I can help you out. (The fourth man hands a sheet of paper to Mulder) This is a document? Just looks like a bunch of ones and zeroes to me.

HOLTZMAN: Tell me where you got it.

MULDER: Tell me what it is.

HOLTZMAN: Keep playing games Mulder, I'll haul your ass up in front of the D6. You can explain to them, what you're doing obstructing justice.

(Mulder gives the sheet of paper to Holtzman)

MULDER: It's your call Holtzman. So unless they tell me otherwise, I'm not accountable to anybody outside my sub-committee. I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican Police.

(Mulder puts walks to a chair and lifts his shirt, which he puts on)

HOLTZMAN: It's a defence satellite transmission.

MULDER: You're kidding.

HOLTZMAN: Just a fragment but highly classified, we need to know where it came from.

MULDER: Well sure, I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

(A ringing noise is heard, and the fourth man lifts his cellular phone)

HOLTZMAN: That's it Mulder, you just bought yourself a oneway back to Washington.

(Mulder and Holtzman wait to find out the outcome of the call)

FOURTH MAN: We got it.

(The fourth man and Holtzman leave Mulder's room)

MULDER: Great.

(Scully enters)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: You shouldn't have told them. They have no jurisdiction.

SCULLY: Mulder, they're NSA. (Mulder puts on his jacket) They think the boy may be a threat to national security.

MULDER: C'mon, how could an eight year old boy, who can bearly multiply, be a threat to national security? People call me paranoid.

SCULLY: Well how did Kevin obtain top secret information? And, where do you think he got it from?

(Mulder walks past Scully and out of the room)



SCENE 8
DARLENE MORRIS' HOUSE
KEVIN'S ROOM

(A group of men can be seen filling boxes with Kevin's stuff. The fourth man is flicking through Kevin's books and then dropping them on the floor when he doesn't find what he is looking for. Kevin's drawings are ripped off the wall)

(Outside the house, Mulder and Scully have arrived. They walk up to the front of the house, all the neighbours are gathered around the house to try and find out what's going on)

AGENT: Watch your step, ma'm.

(Two men are escorting Darlene and Kevin out of the house, past Mulder and Scully and to waiting cars)

DARLENE MORRIS: It'll be ok baby, don't worry. It'll be ok.

SECOND AGENT: Come with me son.

(One agent takes Darlene to one car while the other agent takes Kevin to another car)

KEVIN MORRIS: MOOOMMMM!

SECOND AGENT: Get in the car please.

(Kevin is put into the back of a car)

DARLENE MORRIS: It'll be alright baby.

AGENT: Watch your head please.

(Darlene is put into the back of the other car. Mulder approaches the car that Darlene is in and looks in the window. It is too dark to see inside, both cars drive off. Mulder and Scully enter the house)

(A set of papers containing binary codes is lifted out of a drawer by Holtzman, who flicks through them before nodding his head. Mulder enters the room and lifts up a broken piggy bank and puts in on a dresser)

MULDER: You guys do really delicate work.

HOLTZMAN: Let's get this to cryptography. (Holtzman gives the papers to the fourth man and walks past Mulder, then Scully and out of the room, followed by the other agents) I think we got what we needed, thank you.

(Mulder pulls back the curtain and looks out the window. Noticing Mulder is looking at something in particular, Scully comes over to the window)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: I'm not sure.

(Mulder walks away and Scully continues to look out the window, she sees the top of the camper van is black)

(Mulder sets a pair of ladders against the van and climbs up, Scully is watching him from the window. Mulder scrapes and takes a piece of the burned roof of the camper in his fingers, and crumples it into ash. He smells it before flicking it from his hands)



SCENE 9
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS
SIOUX CITY, IA

(Mulder and Scully are talking to another agent)

LEZA ATSUMI: We scanned all seventy-seven pages through the mainframe in Washington.

SCULLY: And none of the information is actionable?

LEZA ATSUMI: Other than the satellite transmission, nothing can be construed, in anyway, as a national security risk. As far as I know, the boy's being released this afternoon.

SCULLY: So it's just a random set of ones and zeroes.

LEZA ATSUMI: On the contrary, there was nothing random about it.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

LEZA ATSUMI: All information can be rendered digitally, (Agent Leza Atsumi sits down at her computer) in a series of ones and zeroes. When we downloaded the data, we found an amazing range of...(Leza types in a command on the computer, The screen shows a binary sequence and in the center of the screen is a message reading: CMMD: DNLD.CURRENT FILE) Well see for yourself. (A part of a picture comes up) Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. (The screen reverts back to binary, Leza types in another command and up comes a rotating object) A DNA double helix. Oh, there's lots more. (Leza types in another command and up comes a soundwave bar and as a line travels across the bar, a piece of music is heard)

SCULLY: That's from the Brandenburg concertos.

LEZA ATSUMI: But they're just fragments, a few notes here, a few notes there. A line from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet...

MULDER: Almost like someone's switching channels, huh.

(Mulder looks at Leza and then at Scully but no one has an answer)

(An agent escorts Darlene and Kevin out of Holding Area 107, and then lets them go. Darlene walks passed Mulder and Scully, ignoring them)

MULDER: Mrs. Morris.

DARLENE MORRIS: I have nothing to say to you.

(Mulder chases after Darlene touching her arm)

MULDER: Mrs. Morris, please give me a minute to explain.

(Darlene stops and turns round, then she bends down and talks to Kevin)

DARLENE MORRIS: Would you please just wait right over there for momma, I'll be right there. (Kevin looks up at Mulder and then walks to where Darlene asked him to wait. Darlene stands up and faces Mulder and Scully again) I thought you were both supposed to be here, to help us.

SCULLY: This has been a terrible mistake. And I assure you that the government will pay for all repairs and damages.

DARLENE MORRIS: I don't want your money, I want my daughter back. And I want you to leave us alone.

MULDER: But your son, has seen something.

DARLENE MORRIS: You stay away from me, and you stay away from my child. (Darlene walks away, Kevin is staring up at the security monitors) C'mon honey, it's ok, let's, let's go now.



SCENE 10
EXIT 68. SIOUX CITY DOWNTOWN

(Mulder and Scully are driving along the road)

SCULLY: I thought we were headed back into town. (Mulder shakes his head slightly) Where are we going?

MULDER: The boy's the key Scully, I know it.

SCULLY: The key to what?

MULDER: Finding Ruby. Just think about it for a minute, this is a boy who is receiving all kinds of digitised data from a television screen.

SCULLY: Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration.

(Mulder shakes his head again)

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Ok, I admit it, it's not much of an explanation but it..

MULDER: I think that Kevin is a conduit, of some kind.

SCULLY: A conduit.

MULDER: A link, or a connection, to whoever, or whatever, took Ruby that night.

SCULLY: But how?

MULDER: If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way.

(There is a brief pause)

SCULLY: Mulder I know what you're thinking. I know why this is so important to you. (Mulder looks at Scully) I know. But there is no evidence indicating an abduction.

MULDER: That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.



SCENE 11
LAKE OKOBOGEE, IA
CAMPSITE 53

(Scully is looking at the campfire, the sound of seagulls can be heard in the background. Scully stands up and Mulder walks by)

MULDER: According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.

(Mulder walks towards the waterfront)

SCULLY: Just a stones throw from the forest wall.

MULDER: Meaning what?

SCULLY: Meaning anybody could've come out of the forest to grab her.

MULDER: Have you noticed the tree line? (Mulder points up to the trees, the leaves and burnt away from the tops and only the thin trunk remains) Evidence of extreme heat.

SCULLY: Or an electrical storm. (Mulder is looking through some shells on the waterfront) Besides which, there's nothing to connect it to the night of Ruby's disappearance.

(Mulder lifts up a piece of glass)

MULDER: That's true. (Mulder is cleaning the sand of the glass) Do you think a lightning strike could've caused this? (Mulder walks towards Scully with the piece of glass) Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass? (He gives it to Scully, who rubs the hardened sand on it) Twenty-five hundred degrees fahrenheit. Something was out here Scully, something hot enough to turn sand into glass, that, singed those trees and to blister the roof of that camper.

(Mulder walks back towards the waterfront, and Scully looks around the area. As she is about to turn towards Mulder, she hears a noise and then sees a white wolf. She quietly calls to Mulder)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(Mulder walks up beside Scully. After a few moments, the wolf heads off into the forest, Mulder hands some papers to Scully and then follows the wolf. Mulder runs into the forest and stops when he sees a pack of wolves crowding around a group of stones. Mulder takes out his gun and fires a shot into the air, the wolves scatter off into the forest. Mulder advances towards the stones, Scully comes running to where she heard the gunshot. She stops when she sees Mulder)

What is it?

MULDER: It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.

(Mulder starts removing the stones)

SCULLY: Mulder what are you doing? (Mulder continues to move the stones) Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene. (Mulder is still moving the stones, Scully grabs Mulder's arm) Stop.

(Mulder turns to face Scully)

MULDER: What if it's her? I need to know.

(A police officer is sectioning off the area with police tape, the county coroner is at the grave and a man documenting the scene with photographs, as well as people from the hospital morgue. There are also several police officers around the area. Mulder and Scully stand watching)

SCULLY: You ok Mulder?

MULDER: Fine.

(We see a man lying in the grave)

CORONER: Looks like a male caucasian.

(The Sheriff is standing shaking his head)

M. E. WORKER: Sir.

(The M. E. Worker hands the Sheriff the man's wallet. The Sheriff, while wearing surgical gloves, opens the wallet and takes out the man's id)

SIOUX CITY SHERIFF: Victim's name was Greg Randall.

SCULLY: Ruby's boyfriend.

SHERIFF: Ruby had alot of boyfriends.

MULDER: Before you put that away, can I take a look at it?

SHERIFF: Go right ahead.

(Mulder lifts a pair of gloves out of a case, puts them on and takes the wallet. He flicks through the wallet, there is alot of money in the back as well as a piece of paper that Mulder takes out. On the
paper is a note reading `DR. JACK FOWLER AUG. 7 - 2:30'. Mulder looks at Scully who has also seen the note)



SCENE 12
SHERIFF'S OFFICE

(An enlarged photocopy of the note comes out of a photocopier, which Mulder lifts and brings over to a desk. He switches on a desklamp and places the photocopy beside the note that Tessa left on Mulder and Scully's car. As Mulder and Scully study the pages, the Sheriif looks on. Mulder places the original note on the photocopy so that the word FOLLOW sits beside the FO of Fowler)

SCULLY: Look at that, it's her, the girl from the library.

SHERIFF: Who?

SCULLY: We didn't get her name but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together.

SHERIFF: Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy o mine, delivered both my kids. I could find out who had that appointment.

(Two police officers are escorting Tessa down a corridor in the police station. She is escorted into a room, a table and some chairs can be seen through the door)

SCULLY: Have a seat Tessa. (Tessa sits down and the door is shut. The letters on the door read `INTERROGATION ROOM'. Inside the room on the table, sits a tape recorder which is recording. Scully sits down opposite Tessa) We know that you lied to us the other day. We know that you had the appointment with Doctor Fowler on August 7th. We know that you're the one that's pregnant, not Ruby.

TESSA: Aah, don't know nothing do ye.

SCULLY: We can prove it Tessa, and we can prove that Greg, was the father.

TESSA: So what if he was the father.

SCULLY: This is very serious. Do you understand how serious this is? (Tessa just looks away from Scully) Now you've waived the right to an attorney, so if you lie to us here today, you could be charged with perjury.

TESSA: Promised me we'd be in L.A. by Christmas. (The Sherif is standing against the wall listening) He had a friend there, I'd never seen the ocean.

SCULLY: You said that he and Ruby were seeing each other. You said that they were planning to meet at the lake, is that true?

TESSA: Look it, I was nowhere near the lake that night, ok.

(Mulder gets up from his seat in the dark against the wall)

MULDER: Sure you were Tessa. (Mulder walks towards Tessa) You knew they were meeting, so you sat there and you waited for them. You were angry and you were jealous.

TESSA: I wasn't.

MULDER: You sat there and you waited and when they showed, you killed him first, isn't that how it went?

TESSA: No.

MULDER: You snuck up from behind him and you shot him in the back, (Mulder hits the desk with his hand) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks around the desk and stands beside Tessa) And then you killed Ruby, (Mulder hits the desk again) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks to the other side of Tessa) What was she doing right before she died Tessa? Was she pleading for her life? Was she running away?

TESSA: I didn't kill her.

(Mulder walks back to the other side of Tessa again)

MULDER: Where's she buried Tessa?

TESSA: I don't know.

MULDER: You don't know where you buried her Tessa.

(Mulder walks again to Tessa's other side)

TESSA: I didn't kill her.

MULDER: You didn't?

TESSA: SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE THAT NIGHT!

(Mulder crouches down beside Tessa)

MULDER: Well how would you know that Tessa, if you weren't there yourself.

(Mulder and Scully are walking along a corridor in the police station)

SCULLY: Mulder you're not seeing the whole picture here.

MULDER: Which is?

SCULLY: Which is that all likelihood, Ruby is dead.

MULDER: Is that your conclusion or the conclusion of the Sioux City Sheriff's Department?

SCULLY: They're searching the national park and a rescue dive team is coming in from Des Moines to drag the lake.

(Mulder stops and turns to face Scully)

MULDER: They're wasting their time.

SCULLY: Do you really think Tessa Seers is telling the truth?

MULDER: Why not, what if Ruby never did show up that night?

SCULLY: She lied to us in the library, she lied to us about her pregnancy, what makes you think she wouldn't lie to us about killing Ruby?

MULDER: Because something was out there in those woods.

SCULLY: We have a suspect in custody, we have a confession to one murder, and we have a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another. It's over Mulder. It's time to go home and turn this over to local law enforcement.

MULDER: I can't do that.

(Mulder walks off. Mulder leaves the station and Scully follows him)

SCULLY: Mulder where are you going?

MULDER: To talk to the boy.

SCULLY: Darlene won't even let you in the door.

MULDER: Well, I've gotta see him.

SCULLY: They don't wanna have anything to do with you...us. (Scully stops and call after Mulder) Mulder stop. Stop running after your sister. (Mulder stops, and then turns around to face Scully again) This won't bring her back.

MULDER: Come with me or don't come with me but until they find a body, I'm not giving up on that girl.

(Mulder walks off again and Scully stands where she is for a moment and then follows Mulder)



SCENE 13
DARLENE MORRIS' HOUSE

(Mulder knocks on the front door)

MULDER: Hello? (Mulder notices the door is unlocked, enters the house. Scully is right behind him) Mrs. Morris?

SCULLY: Kevin? (Mulder notices something on the floor and turns off the TV. On the floor are sheets of paper with binary sequences on them, they are placed in a square shape. Scully hears the kettle boiling and goes into the kitchen and takes it off the stove. She walks back into the living room and looks at the papers) Mulder. (Mulder is sitting down staring at the papers) What does it mean?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: I'm gonna check upstairs. (Scully goes upstairs and glances over the bannister, as she does she notices something about the papers) Oh my god.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Just come up here. (Mulder goes up the stairs) Look, (Mulder looks at the papers and sees that the binary sequences make a face) it's her, it's Ruby.



SCENE 14
LAKE OKOBOGEE. NATIONAL PARK

(It is night time and Mulder and Scully are driving to Lake Okobogee)

SCULLY: This is a longshot Mulder, they could be anywhere.

MULDER: You know when I was a kid, I had this ritual. I closed my eyes before I walked into my room, cause I thought that one day when I opened them my sister would be there. Just lying in bed, like nothing ever happened. You know I'm still walking into that room, everyday of my life. (Mulder notices something up ahead) Scully. (Scully looks to see what it is, it's Darlene's camper van. They pull up behind it and get out of the car. They run to the van) DARLENE!

(Mulder opens the door but there is no one inside)

SCULLY: Look, there's a trail ahead.

(Mulder and Scully follow the trail, after a moment they hear Darlene's cries as if she has fallen. Mulder and Scully run into the forest and find Darlene crawling along the trail)

MULDER: Are you ok?

DARLENE MORRIS: It's here, I saw it.

MULDER: Where's Kevin?

DARLENE MORRIS: I couldn't keep up with him.

SCULLY: Go ahead.

(Mulder runs off while Scully stays with Darlene. Mulder runs into a clearing and sees Kevin in the distance, a bright orange light appears in front of Kevin)

MULDER: KEVIN!

(Mulder stands watching Kevin as he walks towards the light, and then runs after him. Kevin stops as the light grows bigger, Mulder is still running to catch him. The light grows into multiple, smaller
lights, and we see that the lights belong to motorbikes. As Kevin realises they are bikes, he covers his eyes and Mulder picks him up and jumps to the ground with him. The bikes drive passed Mulder and Kevin on all sides. When all the bikes are passed, Mulder sits up and lifts Kevin off the ground)

You ok?

KEVIN MORRIS: She's back.

MULDER: Kevin I'm sorry but, I don't...

KEVIN MORRIS: She's here I know it.

MULDER: Kevin I don't think she is. I know how much you want it to be her, I did too.

SCULLY: MULDER!

(Hearing Scully's screams, Mulder gets up and runs with Kevin back to Scully)

MULDER: SCULLY!

(As Mulder and Kevin find Scully and Darlene, they see another girl lying on her back)

KEVIN MORRIS: RUBY!

SCULLY: She's unconcious but she's still alive.

MULDER: I'll get help.

(Mulder runs off)



SCENE 15
SIOUX CITY HOSPITAL

(Mulder and Scully are walking down a corridor, Scully has Ruby's chart)

SCULLY: Nurse says she been awake for almost an hour.

MULDER: Any ideas what caused the coma?

SCULLY: Eerrr, there's no sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces or electralight abnormalities, but her white blood cell count was skyhigh.

MULDER: By any chance was there attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or a release of gluco-cordacoids?

(Mulder and Scully stops outside Ruby's room while Scully checks the chart)

SCULLY: Errmmm, actually both, how did you know that?

MULDER: They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness. Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances.

(Mulder looks through the window of the door and Scully knocks on it. Kevin opens the door.
We see Ruby lying in bed, awake)

SCULLY: Hi. (Mulder and Scully enter the room) Hi Ruby.

RUBY MORRIS: Who are you?

SCULLY: Ooh, we're with the FBI, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.

RUBY MORRIS: My mom said you might be coming by.

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

RUBY MORRIS: Fine I guess.

MULDER: Where were you Ruby? Can you tell us?

KEVIN MORRIS: It's ok Ruby, he knows.

RUBY MORRIS: Ah, I'm not supposed to tell. They told me not to say.

MULDER: Who told you? (Ruby is afraid to say anything) Ruby, who told you?

DARLENE MORRIS: Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.

(Darlene is standing in the doorway)

SCULLY: You're right, we should wait until Ruby gets a little stronger.

DARLENE MORRIS: Can we speak outside for a moment. (Mulder and Scully join Darlene outside Ruby's room) I think that it's best that we put all of this, behind us. I mean, hasn't Ruby been through enough already?

MULDER: I know how dis-oriented she must seem right now, but in a couple of weeks, maybe even a few days, we could..

DARLENE MORRIS: I don't want her talking to you, or anyone.

MULDER: She should be encouraged to tell her story, not to keep it inside, it's important that you let her.

DARLENE MORRIS: Important to who? I have my daughter back, I don't want anymore trouble. Besides she can hardly remember anything.

MULDER: But she will remember one day, one way or another, even if it's only in dreams. And when she does, she's gonna wanna talk about it, she's gonna need to talk about it.

DARLENE MORRIS: Like I did? Listen to me, all of my life I have been ridiculed, for speaking my mind.

MULDER: But it was the truth Darlene.

DARLENE MORRIS: The truth has caused me nothing but heartache, I don't want the same thing for her.

MULDER: It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.

DARLENE MORRIS: As far as I'm concerned, she spent the last month on the back of a Harley Davidson.

MULDER: Is that what you're gonna tell Kevin?

DARLENE MORRIS: I'm sorry.

(Darlene walks back into Ruby's room, Kevin is standing at the door. Mulder goes to follow Darlene in but Scully puts her hand on Mulder's shoulder to stop him. Darlene brings Kevin inside and closes the door. Mulder storms up the corridor)



SCENE 16
(A tape is taken out of a tape recorder and turned over and put back in and play pressed. Scully is alone in a room, voices are heard from the tape recorder)

DR. HEITZ WERBER: But your eyes are open?

(Scully is going through the X-File on Mulder's sister)

MULDER: Yeah, they're open but it's like, nothing's happening.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Try turning your head.

MULDER: I can't.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Why not?

MULDER: I don't know. I can't move, so I don't...(We see a close-up of the tape being played, on it it says: F. Mulder hypnotic regression tape session number 2B: June 16) I just lie there in bed.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Can you see your sister?

MULDER: No, but I can hear her.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: What is she saying?

(Scully lifts up a picture and looks at it)

MULDER: She's calling out my name, over and over again. (We see the picture is one of Mulder and his sister when they were kids. We see it is Mulder who is now holding the picture) She's crying out for help but I can't help her. I can't move. (We see that Mulder is sitting inside a church)

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Are you scared?

(Mulder starts crying)

MULDER: I know I should be but I'm not.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Do you know why?

MULDER: Because of the voice.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: The voice?

MULDER: The voice in my head.

(Mulder keeps down on his knees and begins to pray)

DR. HEITZ WERBER: What's it telling you?

(The camera zooms away from Mulder as he prays)

MULDER: Not to be afraid. It's telling me no harm will come to her, and that one day she'll return.

DR. HEITZ WERBER: Do you believe the voice?

(The scene fades to black)

MULDER: I want to believe.

[THE END]
                                           THE JERSEY DEVIL


SCENE 1
NEW JERSEY, 1947

(It is a dark night and a single car is seen driving along a road, singing can be heard from within the car)

FAMILY: ..was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o. There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o. There was a farmer had a dog and Bingo was his name-o, B-I-N-G-O

(Just then a sudden bang is heard from outside the car)

SON: Dad what was that? What's happening?

DAD: It's ok, it's ok, I just got a flat.

MOM: Ooh Noo.

DAD: No problem here honey.

(There is a flashlight lying on the ground shining on the car while the dad is removing the panelling to get to the wheel. The dad sets the panelling down and lifts his wheel wrench, in doing so, he knocks the flashlight down a hill at the side of the road)

Aaooh. Darn it.

(He throws down the wheel wrench and goes after the flashlight. We see the man pick up his flashlight and go back up the hill from the viewpoint of someone or something in the bushes watching him. The kids are sleeping in the car and the dad taps on the window beside his wife)

Honey, would you mind holding the light for a secaaaaaah....

(The dad is suddenly pulled backwards out of sight very quickly. The mom gets out of the car)

MOM: Paul. Paul. PAUL.

(The mom picks up the flashlight and shines it down the hill into the woods)

Where are you? Paul. What happened?

(We see the mom standing at the top of the hill holding the flashlight from the same viewpoint of something in the bushes. Next we see the the legs of the dad as he is being dragged into the woods)



SCENE 2
(It is dawn and the police are out in the woods with other men and their tracker dogs. The police officers and some of the men are carrying rifles. The dogs are sniffing on a scent when a voice calls out)

VOICE: Over here, we found something.

(The men all run off to where the voice was calling from. They go downhill and the dogs are anxious to get down)

MAN WITH DOGS: Easy, easy.

(The dead body of the dad is lying on the ground, the men look at each other)

POLICE OFFICER: His leg's been eaten off.

(Just then another voice calls out)

POLICE OFFICER 2: HEEYY, UP HERE.

(The men make their way back up the hill and run towards the area where the calls where made. Several police men are standing pointing their rifles into a cave)

IT'S IN HERE. IT'S AS TALL AS A HOUSE.

POLICE OFFICER 3: We can smoke him out.

POLICE OFFICER: And then what?

(From within the cave, we see the men all pointing their rifles into the cave, waiting)

POLICE OFFICER 2: I SEE IT.

POLICE OFFICER: He's coming at us.

(All the men begin shooting again and again)

SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.

(A man is typing on a computer and several voices can be heard in the background.
We see Scully walking through a busy office)

(Mulder is sitting, staring at a centrefold in "Hanky Panky" magazine. Scully walks in the door and sees what Mulder is looking at, she pauses and then puts her case on a desk and walks beside Mulder)

SCULLY: Working hard Mulder?

(Mulder turns the magazine around so that Scully can see it better)

MULDER: This woman claims to have been taken aboard a spaceship and held in an anti-gravity chamber without food and water for three days.

SCULLY: Anti-gravity's right. (Mulder throws the magazine onto the desk) Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation, but I just heard a story that'd just about take your knees out.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: They found a body in the New Jersey woods yesterday, missing it's right arm and shoulder. They think they may have been eaten off, by a human.

MULDER: Where in New Jersey?

SCULLY: Just outside Atlantic City.

MULDER: Not an uncommon place to lose a body part. They think it's the mob?

SCULLY: Mmma, it was a homeless man. There doesn't seem to be a motive.

(Mulder gets up and gets his coat)

MULDER: You feeling lucky Scully?

SCULLY: Relative to whom? (Mulder is looking in a drawer in his office) It's not our case Mulder, the local police are handling it. (Mulder pulls out a file) An X-File?

MULDER: Ever hear of something called The Jersey Devil?

(Mulder hands the file to Scully)

SCULLY: Yeah, it's a beast that's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars, right. Kind of like an East Coast Bigfoot.

MULDER: Read the file about the case in 1947.

(Mulder leaves the office, Scully closes the file and grabs her case and follows after Mulder)

SCULLY: Save me the trouble.

(Mulder and Scully walk back through the busy office)

MULDER: 1947, family watches dad get dragged off into the woods, cops find dad with a few appendages gnawed off. Cops corner a large naked man in the woods and gun `im down. (They stop at a desk) Autopsy shows human flesh and bones in the man's large intestine. A beast man. (Mulder talks to someone behind the desk) Requisition for a car please.

SCULLY: Is the autopsy report in here?

(Mulder fills in a requsition form)

MULDER: No, the original disappeared from the Patterson PD's files a few years after the incident. But there is a statement from the attending pathologist.

SCULLY: Mulder it's the same story I've heard since I was a kid. It's a folk tale, a myth.

MULDER: I heard the same story when I was a kid too, funny thing is, I believed it. (Mulder hands back the form to the person behind the desk and is given a set of keys) Thanks Doreen. (Mulder turns to face Scully) Fact is, we got a cannibalised body in New Jersey, someone or something out there is hungry.

(Mulder walks off and Scully turns and looks at him)



SCENE 4
ATLANTIC CITY MORGUE

(Mulder and Scully are in the morgue looking at the body of the victim. The coroner is there holding up the sheet which covers the body)

GLENNA: Er, they say animals can develop an appetite for human flesh but, this is no animal. You see the teeth marks, just below the clavicle, they're human.

(Glenna walks off and removes her surgical gloves)

MULDER: Who found the body?

GLENNA: Park Ranger.

(Scully is examing the body while Mulder walks to the feet of the body)

SCULLY: Was he alive when it happened?

GLENNA: Well, it's hard to tell.

(Mulder looks at the toe-tag, it reads:)

CORONER'S DEPARTMENT

NAME CROCKETT ROGER CASE NO. 2272 DATE AUG 29 / 93 WHERE TAKEN FROM: N.J. STATE PARK

There's a scull fracture but no sign of a struggle, his blood alcohol level was up, probably never knew what hit him.

MULDER: Any ideas about that?

GLENNA: The size of that bite mark, I'd say.......

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I want this on the QT.

(A man walks around a corner into view, and approaches the three of them)

GLENNA: .......large adult male.

MAN: I'll do my best.

GLENNA: Er, Detective Thompson is handling the case.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Glenna?

(Scully shows her id to the detective)

SCULLY: Hi, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I don't remember anybody calling the, FBI in on this.

MULDER: Well we're not here on an official capacity, Agent Scully's a medical doctor, we heard about your victim and, she thought she might take a look.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I'm sorry, I'm gonna ask you to leave. We have an investigation.

GLENNA: For God's sakes Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: We have jurisdiction here.

MULDER: Any suspects yet Detective?

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I don't work for you sir, and unless you hear different from the Attorney General, er, this case is a local matter.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder, we should go.

MULDER: There's no need to get bent outta shape.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: On the contrary, I think I've been exceedingly polite.

(Mulder and the detective stand there staring at each other for a few moments, and then Mulder leaves)



SCENE 5
OUTSIDE

(Mulder and Scully walk along a street until they reach their car)

MULDER: So what's eating that guy?

SCULLY: He was perfectly in his rights. The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction in a murder case. Anyway, you'd feel the same way if someone was horning in on your work.

MULDER: Yeah, chances are he's without a clue. He'll probably be scratching his head when they bring the next body in.

SCULLY: You missed your opening Mulder, you could've really humiliated him and er, told him who the perpetrator was, The Jersey Devil. (Mulder laughs)

(Mulder stands beside the car and talks to Scully, who is standing on the other side of the car)

MULDER: Hey whatta you say, we grab a hotel, take in a floor show, drop a few quarters in the slot, do a little digging on this case.

SCULLY: You're kidding right.

MULDER: Ok, we can skip the floor show.

SCULLY: Mulder I have to be back in D.C.

MULDER: What you gotta date?

SCULLY: No, I have my godson's birthday party at 6:30. (Mulder throws the car keys across the top of the car, Scully catches them) What are you doing?

MULDER: A little poking around, maybe make a weekend out of it.

(Mulder walks off)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's a three hour drive back by myself...(Mulder waves to Scully)...in Friday night traffic, ooowh.



SCENE 6
CASINO

(We see people playing slots machines, playing at the crap tables. Mulder is standing beside a telephone, looking through a telephone directory. He runs his finger down a page until he finds what he is looking for:

PARKS SERVICES - STATE OF NEW JERSEY Parks Information - General Inquiries ....555 - 9573

Mulder lifts the phone)



SCENE 7
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK

(Mulder and a Park Ranger get out of the ranger's pick-up truck and walk a couple of feet away from it)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Found the body just over there, lying face down in the rocks. Thirty-two years with the park service, I've come across some weird stuff but I tell ye, never anything like this.

MULDER: Victim was a homeless man, you get many of them wandering around out here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, occasionally ar, see some but, most are scared of the woods.

MULDER: Scared? Of what?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I don't know, the devil.

MULDER: People say that's just a myth.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Depends on who you talk to.

MULDER: What do you think?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well like I said, now thirty-two years, I see alot of weird stuff. Like one time, a little over four years ago, I saw what I thought was a, large man come out of a, copse of birch trees, not, not a stitch of clothing. And he was about, sixty yards away, and he starts, sniffing the air, you know like a dog. And then he looks straight at me, and I swear he smelled me because he took off into the woods so fast, you'd swear it wasn't human.

MULDER: Really. You never saw him again?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: No, but I feel him. And, I found things, some scat, half buried like a cat's only more human. Found a half eaten rabbit with what looked like a human cuspid tooth in it. And some deer bones, looked like they'd been sharpened into tools.

MULDER: You think it might be what's responsible for the body you found?

(The ranger laughs slightly)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I got a pension coming up in a few years, you know, you say the wrong thing.

MULDER: Yeah.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Er, I'll tell you one thing, I don't ever come out here without my weapon anymore.

MULDER: How far is it into town from here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: `Bout a mile, mile and a half.

MULDER: I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for the next couple of days, if you think of anything, will you call me?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Sure.

(Mulder walks off down a path in the woods)



SCENE 8
SCULLY'S GOD-SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY, D.C.

(We see a gorilla mask and the wearer runs into a room, from which another kid runs also wearing a gorilla mask and carring a plastic baseball bat. He runs into a wall and falls on his back and starts to cry. Scully comes to see what has happened)

SCULLY: Oh c'mon, it's ok, it's alright, what happened, did you bump your head? Hhmmm.

(A dog is licking the birthday cake while the kids cheer at it, a woman lifts the dog onto the floor)

ELLEN: Oh Peter, stop that. (Scully comes in holding the kid who hurt himself) What, what happened?

SCULLY: Jungle warfare.

ELLEN: Aaar, I'm gonna kill that dog.

SCULLY: If the hit squad doesn't get to him before you do.

(Scully and Ellen laugh)

ELLEN: I'm so glad you're here Dana.

(Ellen hears the breaking of glass and goes to find out what is broken)

(All the kids are sitting around a table eating food, Scully lifts an empty plate and goes into the kitchen, where Ellen is washing dishes)

SCULLY: Oooh, you're amazing.

ELLEN: What?

SCULLY: You're just such a natural at all this, I don't know how you keep it all together.

ELLEN: Mommy radar.

SCULLY: Mmmm, I don't think I'm cut out for this El.

ELLEN: Dana, you went through the FBI academy, what better training could there be for motherhood. (Scully lifts out a large plastic container from a cupboard and opens it) Seriously, you're great with kids, what're you talking about.

SCULLY: When am I supposed to find the time?

ELLEN: Well first you have to get a life.

SCULLY: Ooooh.

ELLEN: And, of course, it helps if you can find a man.

SCULLY: Know of any?

ELLEN: Yeah, they're disappearing faster than the Brazilian rain forest. What about that guy you work with?

SCULLY: Mulder?

ELLEN: Yeah, I thought you said he was cute.

SCULLY: He's a jerk. He's not a jerk, he's erm, he's obsessed with his work.



SCENE 9
(Mulder is walking along the path. We see Mulder from the viewpoint of someone or something watching him. Mulder continues his walk, not aware that he is being watched)

(Scully's godson's party is still going, when there is a ring of the doorbell, Scully answers it. A man stands outside the door)

ROB: Hi.

SCULLY: Hi.

ROB: I'm Rob, I'm Scott's dad.

SCULLY: Oh, come in.

ROB: Thanks. Hey Tiger. How you doing? Are you having a good time?

(Rob crouches to talk to his son, Scully watches him and smiles. Ellen is along the hallway talking on the phone, she puts her hand over the mouthpiece and quietly says something to Scully)

ELLEN: Divorced.

(Scully looks back at Rob, who turns and looks at Scully and smiles. Scully coyly smiles, puts her head down and looks away)



SCENE 10
OUTSKIRTS OF ATLANTIC CITY
6:47 P.M.

(Mulder walks along a street filled with homeless people living in cardboard boxes. The street is littered with boxes and cars stripped of anything valuable)

MULDER: Did anybody here know Roger Crockett? (No one acknowledges Mulder's request) He was murdered two days ago. (Mulder tries to talk to a woman as she goes passed but she just ignores him) Ma'am, can I..

VAGRANT WOMAN: Hey honey, have you got any change to spare?

MULDER: Roger Crockett? Anybody?

(A man gets up and walks towards Mulder)

JACK: What d'you wanna know?

MULDER: Did you know Roger Crockett? (The man nods his head) Did you hear how he died?

JACK: Yeah.

MULDER: Any ideas who might've done it?

JACK: You a cop?

MULDER: No, I'm FBI.

JACK: I'll show you something.

MULDER: Ok.

(Jack leads Mulder through a door and into and alleyway)

JACK: I need some money.

(Mulder takes some money out ot his wallet and gives it to Jack. Jack rummages in a black bag, in amongst a sheltered area, and pulls out a piece of paper from a small plastic bag. He unfolds it and shows it to Mulder. It looks like a man, but more like a beastly kind of man)

MULDER: What is this?

JACK: Stuck in the pocket of a jacket I found.

MULDER: Does it mean anything to you?

JACK: I've seen it.

MULDER: Where?

JACK: Right here, digging in the trash..

MULDER: Here? Are you hustling me?

JACK: Swear to God.

MULDER: Who do you think it is?

JACK: I don't know, scared the hell out of me.

MULDER: Has anybody else seen it?

JACK: Oh yeah, everybody's pretty freaked.

MULDER: Anybody told the cops?

JACK: You think they don't know.

MULDER: Where're you sleeping tonight?

JACK: You're standing in my bedroom.

MULDER: You know the er, The Galaxy Gateway? (Mulder gives Jack his room key) Room 756. Go ahead.

JACK: Hey, they got HBO?

(Mulder laughs)

MULDER: Yeah, they do.



SCENE 11
ALLEYWAY

(It's night time and Mulder is sitting in Jack's bedroom with a blanket wrapped round him. As he tries to go to sleep he hears a noise, at first glance he can't see anything but he gets up and
quietly looks around)

(He notices a figure at the end of the alleyway searching in the trash. Mulder slowly advances to get a better look at the figure. Suddenly the figure starts sniffing the air, but soon continues to
resume searching in the trash. The figure then climbs over a fence and out of sight. Mulder runs and jumps up the fence and sees the figure running along a catwalk)

(Mulder then rushes out of the alleyway and into the street to see if he can see where the figure is going, as it runs along the roof of a building, Mulder whistles at it. It stops and looks over the edge of the building at him. A police car and police van approach from behind Mulder and the figure moves on. The headlights from the police car shine into Mulder eyes, the vehicles come to a stop and a police officer gets out of the car)

POLICE OFFICER: Sir.

(Mulder points up to the roof)

MULDER: You got a man up on that roof.

POLICE OFFICER: Nothing to be afraid of, we're gonna give ye a warm place to sleep it off.

(The police officer grabs Mulder by the arm but Mulder shakes it off)

MULDER: Hey back off.

POLICE OFFICER: Alright, calm down.

MULDER: I'm telling you, there's a man up on that roof.

POLICE OFFICER: Get in the car, now.



SCENE 12
ATLANTIC CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT

(Mulder is sitting in a small white room, empty except for a table and some chairs. Through a window in the door, Detective Thompson peers through before entering)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: What the hell do you think you're doing?

MULDER: Enjoying the night life here in beautiful Atlantic City.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I'll go right to the D.A.'s office if I have to, obstructing an investigation, misconduct.

MULDER: That's good, let's go see her together, and while we're at it, why don't we add withholding evidence to the list.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Whatta you talking about?

MULDER: Statements given to you describing something stalking the back streets of Atlantic City.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: This is the fishing trip they get me up at three-o-clock in the morning for. Unbelievable.

MULDER: Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight? You know it's out there.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: I got a perpetrator out there. Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or Elmer Fudd, I've got a job, to protect people.

MULDER: Oh is that your job, or is it to keep the dice rolling, keep the tour buses rolling in. You can't fill those casinos, this town disappears like a quarter down the slot. (There is a brief pause of silence) I've seen it.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Seen what?

(Mulder reaches into his back pocket and pulls out the piece of paper with the drawing of the creature. He unfolds it and shows it to Detective Thompson, who looks at it and laughs)

You've been spending too much time in supermarket check-out lines.

(Detective Thompson folds the paper up again and throws it onto the table)

This story's as old as the hills.

MULDER: Who's going to be responsible when you lose your first tourist, Detective? You are.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: No, you are sir, because you're wasting my time, and impeding the solution of this case. (Detective Thompson opens the door and stands by it) You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa. In the meantime, enjoy the rest of your weekend.

(He leaves, closing the door behind him, and leaving Mulder sitting by himself)



SCENE 13
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.

(Scully is walking through the same busy office, we've seen at the start, another agent calls to her from behind a desk)

AGENT: Agent Scully, Agent Mulder line three.

(Scully picks up the phone on the desk beside her, and answers line three)

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I'm not far from where you left me.

SCULLY: You're still in Atlantic City?

MULDER: Er Scully, you got anything happening this morning?

SCULLY: What's that noise in the background?

(We see Mulder is talking on a payphone outside a jail cell. In the cell is a man, bent over)

MULDER: That's a guy getting sick.

SCULLY: Mulder where are you? (We see Scully again, Mulder has just told her where he is) The drunk tank.

(Another agent is looking at Scully, she turns away and continues to listen to Mulder)



SCENE 14
ATLANTIC CITY

(Mulder and Scully are walking along a street, Mulder's clothes look dirty)

SCULLY: Well, it's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant.

MULDER: You gonna rag on me or you gonna take me to get something to eat?

SCULLY: Am I buying or did you manage to pan-handle some spare change while you were at it?



SCENE 15
A RESTAURANT IN ATLANTIC CITY

(Mulder and Scully are sitting at a table, Mulder is eating a meal, he appears to be very hungry, talking at times with food in his mouth. Scully is drinking coffee)

MULDER: It moved like a cat, quick and graceful. There's no way a human could've got up on the roof that fast.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: What's gonna happen when word of this gets back to the bureau?

MULDER: They dropped the charges, that guy Thompson, he ran me through the system just to spite me.

SCULLY: I'm talking about this Jersey Devil thing.

MULDER: I saw it, it's exactly the way the ranger described it, the way it moved, the way it sniffed the air. It's come out of the woods, probably in search of food.

SCULLY: Hyeah, I'll say.

MULDER: It was peeking through the garbage Scully, if it was a man-eater, why didn't it come after me? Probably felt threatened in some way..

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to yourself. You're already ascribing it a motive and an alibi. This thing, chewing somebody's arm off is not exactly a defensive posture.

MULDER: But you do believe that I saw something, don't ye?

SCULLY: You saw something, I'll give you that but I'm not about to go in and sell it. Not when it's nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley.

MULDER: I still got a hotel room I'm paying for.

SCULLY: Yeah well, I have got to get back to Washington by 7:30, so er..

MULDER: Another birthday party?

SCULLY: No. I have a date.

(Mulder looks at Scully)

MULDER: Can you cancel?

SCULLY: Unlike you Mulder, I would like to have a life.

MULDER: I have a life!

(Mulder and Scully look at each other, Scully looks away with a slight laugh)

SCULLY: C'mon, I have somebody I want you to meet, on the way home. C'mon.

(Mulder, with a mouth full of food, lifts his hand and gives a consenting grunt. He wants to finish his meal)



SCENE 16
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND

(Mulder pours himself a cup of coffee, Scully is standing, arms crossed, beside another man who is talking)

DR. DIAMOND: Just about every culture has one. Yetis, Sasquatch, Russian Almas, Dsonoqua.

MULDER: Why is that?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh, it's a kind of universal wild man myth. A symbolic fear of our dual natures as humans, as creators of life and destroyers of it.

MULDER: What's this chart?

(Dr. Diamond walks towards Mulder and the chart)

DR. DIAMOND: It shows the historic entry of man onto each continent and the effect it had on other animal species, which as you see has been disastrous.

MULDER: Why?

(Mulder goes to sit down)

DR. DIAMOND: Well, we humans have retained hereditary traits through evolution that have proven to be extremely destructive. We tend to be tribal and aggressively territorial, oriented by selfish sexual and reproductive drives that make, co-operation beyond the family-a-tribe, extremely hard for us.

MULDER: So we kill other species in order to survive.

SCULLY: Yeah, humans are top carnivores, we sit at the top of the food chain and we, reduce other species' chance of survival.

DR. DIAMOND: Nice to know Dana left here with more than a degree.

MULDER: But what if something entered the food chain above us?

(Dr. Diamond pouts himself a cup of coffee now, and walks back towards Mulder and Scully, at a table)

DR. DIAMOND: It won't happen, see our intelligence virtually insures us, barring the introduction of some alien life-form, we will live out our days as rulers of the world.

MULDER: But, but what if through some fluke of nature, a human was born, who reverted to it's most animal instincts, a kind of carnivorous neanderthal. Wouldn't he occupy a space above us on the food chain?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh sure, all he'd have to do is wait outside any fast-food restaurant and eat us on the way in.

MULDER: Right, yeah, an.and, and haven't there been cases were, men have been raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators?

DR. DIAMOND: Oh yes several, but you see cannibalism is rare, even among the lower mammals.

MULDER: But even when faced with extinction?

DR. DIAMOND: Well maybe in the jungles of New Gineau or, it's just, highly unlikely that what you're suggesting could've survived civilization, a revolution, out in the woods of New Jersey.

MULDER: Yea, highly unlikely, but not outside the realm of extreme possibility?

DR. DIAMOND: Well, it would be an amazing discovery.

(Dr. Diamond nods his head a few times. Mulder looks back at Scully.
Nothing is said, but she turns to look away)



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
X-FILES OFFICE

(Mulder is sitting, looking at some photos, in a dark room. Photos connected to the Jersey Devil, both photographs of footprints and the drawing of the creature)



SCENE 18
(Scully is sitting in a fancy restaurant with Rob. Both are well dressed and they are sitting at a table with a candle in the middle and they both have a drink in front of them)

ROB: Well the hard thing was when my wife remarried I... Suddenly I felt very competitive for my
son's attention. It was weird.

SCULLY: I'm sure.

ROB: I became a superdad on the weekends with Scott, I, had this unconscious fear of being
replaced. I actually had dreams where I was running over his step-father with my car. Well,
you'll understand when you have kids, having kids changes everything.

SCULLY: That's what they say.

ROB: Maybe some weekend, if you're up for it, we could er, take the kids out to the beach for the
day.

(A waiter brings Scully and Rob's meals to them)

SCULLY: Yeah.

ROB: Great. (Scully looks at Rob and smiles. The waiter puts Rob's meal down in front of him)
Thank you. (The waiter leaves) So, can I ask about the case you're on or, can't you say.

(Scully picks up a piece of food on her fork, looks at Rob cutting his food and pauses)

SCULLY: I don't think it's a case we should discuss over dinner.

ROB: I don't suppose you'd wanna hear about the, finer points of the state planning and taxation.

(Scully looks up at Rob and smiles, she continues to eat her meal)

(Mulder takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, he looks at the time on a clock on the wall, it is 7:55 p.m.. The phone rings)

MULDER: Mulder.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Agent Mulder, this is Peter Boulay of the Jersey Parks Department.

MULDER: Oh yeah, hi.

(Peter Boulay is talking from his rangers's truck, in what appears to be part of the park)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Hi, I found a body out in the woods today, it looks like it's been dead about six to eight months. A long haired male, missing the same tooth I found in that rabbit a while back. It could be your devil.

MULDER: Where's the body now?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I turned it over to the coroner's office.

MULDER: You're sure it was a male?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, it had all the plumbing.

ROB: Excuse me.

(Rob lifts a small milk jug to pour into his coffee)

SCULLY: Eef-hhmmm. (Scully's beeper goes off) Sorry. (She opens her handbag and checks the message on the beeper. She closes her bag again and gets up from the table) Excuse me.

ROB: Certainly.

(The phone in Mulder's office rings again)

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Sorry to interrupt your evening.

(Scully is using a phone in the restaurant)

SCULLY: That's ok, what's up?

MULDER: I just had an amazing thought, maybe it isn't a beast-man we're looking for after all.

(Mulder is holding up the drawing of the creature)



SCENE 19
ATLANTIC CITY MORGUE

(Glenna is looking through a filing cabinet, and pulls out a file. She walks back towards Scully and the ranger, Mulder is walking beside her)

GLENNA: Well, if they picked it up, nobody logged the body on the chart. I sure haven't seen it.

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Well, I don't understand. What else would they have done with it?

SCULLY: I'm afraid we may have called you down here for nothing.

(Scully is talking to Dr. Diamond, who is also standing with the others)

MULDER: They're going to try and sweep this whole thing under the carpet.

DR. DIAMOND: Why?

MULDER: Any publicity and you're got the streets crawling with the kind of people who aren't here to play the crap tables. Word gets out there's something still on the loose, forget it.

DR. DIAMOND: You said it was a female.

MULDER: The body they found was a male, there's a fifty-fifty chance there was a mate. We may never know unless we find out ourselves.

DR. DIAMOND: If it's true, what're the chances of catching it alive?



SCENE 20
ALLEYWAY

(Mulder is cutting the wire attaching the wire fence to the metal post with a small pair of wire-cutters)

DR. DIAMOND: If it is a primate, it would have a natural fear of heights. It would also want to stay close to it's food source.

(Mulder steps through the fence and holds it back so that Scully, Dr. Diamond and Peter Boulay can get through. The ranger is carrying a rifle)

MULDER: This thing has no fear of heights. We'll stay together and start with the lower floors. How much time will that dart give us?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: It'll put down a five hundred pound bear for an hour, if I hit it.

(They all enter a building, the same building that Mulder saw the creature enter and run across the roof. It is an old building, with bars on the doors and windows, the windows have been smashed)

(Out on the street, a police car drives by and stops when the two officers inside the car notice the ranger's truck)

POLICE OFFICER 1: What the hell's a park ranger vehicle doing here?

POLICE OFFICER 2: I don't know.

POLICE OFFICER 1: Check it out.

(Both officers get out of the car, the first one walks off while the second one lifts the radio)

POLICE OFFICER 2: Run a check for me on a...

(Back inside the building, Scully is walking past some lockers while Dr. Diamond is looking at a pile of rubbish. He lifts a few empty bags and plastic covers, and then he notices something. He crouches down and picks up a piece of cloth and smells it)

DR. DIAMOND: Something here. (The others arrive at the location of Dr. Diamond, who gets up) It's blood. She could be bringing her killing here. She could be injured.

(A S.W.A.T. team member stands outside the building and turns looking at the surroundings, he is holding a machine gun and has a headpiece on)

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: Roger, zebra team in position.

(More S.W.A.T. team men gather outside an entrance to the building with one man pointing out directions for the others)

(Everyone is still looking inside, but now they are up a few floors. Mulder peers over a railing and looks down, Scully comes near)

MULDER: What if it is a female Scully? How close is she to you or me? Does she feel emotion? Or are her days just spent looking for food?

SCULLY: Maybe, she spends her day shopping.

MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa, I don't think we're all that different.

(S.W.A.T. team members are running quietly through the bottom floor of the building)

SCULLY: Mulder, we've put men into space, we've built computers that work faster than the human mind.

MULDER: While we over-populate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with. Maybe we're just beasts with big brains. (Scully is standing, not moving, a still face gazing into nothingness) What?

SCULLY: No I was just, thinking about my godson's birthday party, eight little six year old boys running around, talk about primitive behaviour.

(Mulder hears the voice of Detective Thompson and peers, once again, over the railing. He sees the detective standing talking to Dr. Diamond with a couple of police officers standing beside them)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Now look, his name is Mulder and he's a federal agent, you ever hear of him?

DR. DIAMOND: No.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: You know him?

DR. DIAMOND: No.

(Mulder puts his finger to his mouth, Scully turns and looks down over the railing as well)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Well what are you doing here?

DR. DIAMOND: I'm a professor of Anthropology.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Mulder, does that sound familar to you? Look, I know he's here somewhere. Would you check you upstairs Andrew, go check upstairs. I want this place searched...

(Mulder and Scully continue their search of the higher levels of the building. Outside, two S.W.A.T. members appear on a bridge looking into the building, they take a quick look and then run on)

(Mulder is looking through a room and stops, suddenly he hears a noise and as he looks in the direction of the noise, a figure runs past a window. Mulder gives chase, Scully hears the sounds of Mulder's feet running as she is close by. Mulder stops after coming around a corner and walks slowly along the corridor. Mulder hears Scully's voice, quiet and soft as not to arouse the attention of the police)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder where are you?

(Mulder looks out a window and sees the figure, the beast-woman, running across the top off an adjacent building. Scully is walking down a corridor, looking for Mulder as well as the beast. Mulder jumps onto the roof of the other building and as he lands, rolls over and scrambles to his feet, trying to catch up with the beast. Scully appears in the same corridor Mulder was in recently. When she peers out a window, she sees Mulder running across the top of the other building)

(The S.W.A.T team is quickly making their way up through the building)

(Scully lands on top of the roof of the other buidling, and like Mulder, rolls on landing. She takes out her gun and gets to her feet, crouching under large metal girders, making her way to where she saw Mulder going)

(Mulder is crawling slowly on his hands and feet, making no noise, trying to hear where the beast might be. The creature walks quickly and quietly across a boarded walkway on top of the roof, close to where Mulder is. As the creature goes passed, Mulder jumps up onto the walkway and runs after the beast)

(The walkway leads down some steps and into a dark building. Mulder slows his pursuit once inside the building, he reaches the bottom of the steps and enters a dark room, cautiously looking it over. Beams of light shine in through the spaces of a fan as the fan is spinning. Mulder looks along one side of a piece of machinery and then back towards the fan. Suddenly the beast jumps Mulder and they both fall to the ground. Mulder lands on his back, and lifts his head trying to see where the beast has gone and wondering what it might do to him. The beast appears from the darkness and sits on Mulder's legs. Mulder lies back, breathing heavily, waiting)

(Scully has made her way to the top of the steps, and descends slowly with her gun trained in front of her. The beast backs off from Mulder and Mulder tries to sit up, as he does so the beast-woman swipes at him, knocking him back to the ground and hitting his head. Scully approaches the bottom of the steps)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The beast-woman runs off, Scully quickly runs down the last few steps)

MULDER: Scully.

(Mulder is sitting up when Scully enters the room, she puts away her gun, and attends to Mulder)

SCULLY: Lay back. Oh, Mulder you're hurt.

MULDER: You should've seen her, she was beautiful.

SCULLY: Yeah well, she just about ripped your lungs out.



SCENE 21
OUTSIDE BUILDING

(Mulder is sitting in the back of an ambulance getting medical attention, he is holding his shirt up while a medic attends to his wound. Dr. Diamond is sitting in the ambulance also)

MULDER: She could've torn my head off Scully but she didn't, she sensed that I wasn't a threat..

AMBULANCE DUDE: You've gotta hold still.

(Scully is talking on her cellular)

SCULLY: Yeah I need to talk somebody who can get me federal jurisdiction on this case. Mulder.

MULDER: What?

DR. DIAMOND: How old would you say she was?

(Both Scully and Dr. Diamond are talking to Mulder at the same time but he turns his attention to Scully)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: The US assistant D.A.'s on the phone with the bureau right now, he wants to know what the hell is going on up here in Atlantic City.

MULDER: Well tell him he's got a real live neanderthal on the loose. She was young, I, I, I don't know...It's hard to say exactly what, what, what...

SCULLY: The Atlantic City major crime unit has filed a complaint that we're endangering a murder investigation.

MULDER: That is such crap, you can..

(The ranger comes over to the ambulance)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: Agent Mulder, they got her cornered, in a building.

MULDER: Let's go.

(The S.W.A.T. team have followed the beast-woman into another room.
One officer is talking on a walkie-talkie)

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Can you see it?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: It crawled into the walls.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Can you get a man in there?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: That's affirmative.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: And keep these people outta here.

(Two police officers restrain Mulder as he tries to get past)

MULDER: You could take her alive.

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: What's going on in there?

S.W.A.T. TEAM OFFICER: I got a man down, I got a naked woman just jumped from a second storey window. (The S.W.A.T. officer is looking out of a window as he is talking) Suspect is headed south into the woods on foot.



SCENE 22
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK

(Police officers with tracker dogs approach the woods. Mulder, Scully, Dr. Diamond and the ranger all travel to the woods in the ranger's truck. They come to a stop at the woods and they all get out
of the truck)

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I know these woods, if she's going for cover, she'll be down by the rocks.

(They make their way into the woods. Meanwhile, the police are tracking through the forest slowly. As the others make their way to the top of a rockface, the ranger notices the beast-woman and points her out)

Look.

MULDER: Can you reach her from here?

RANGER PETER BOULAY: I can try.

(Peter aims at the beast-woman and fires, the dart hits her in the back of the right shoulder. She pulls the dart out and continues on her way. Mulder leads the others down the side of the rockface, holding his side, and they run across a bridge. Down by the river, with the bridge still in sight, Detective Thompson comes into view. As the others come to the end of the bridge, they hear gunshots and run in the direction from where they came)

VOICES: I got it. Up ahead. I got it. She tried to take my arm off. Watch it right here.

(A man is sitting holding his arm, as Mulder arrives at the scene of the shooting, blood staining his shirt from his wound, he stops and looks at the scene and advances to the body of the beast-woman)

Right there. Looks like she was trying to bury herself.

(The beast-woman lies dead on the ground, leaves partially covering her lower back and legs. Mulder crouches down beside her and pulls back her hair and moves his hand over her eyes, shutting them. He pauses for a moment and them gets up and walks over to Detective Thompson)

MULDER: Why did you have to kill her?

DETECTIVE THOMPSON: Same reason you kill a rabid animal.

(Mulder stands looking at the detective, Scully moves to Mulder and touches his arm. Mulder looks at Scully, without saying a word, Scully walks off, followed by Mulder. Peter Boulay looks from the detective to the body)



SCENE 23
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON D.C.
X-FILES OFFICE
ONE WEEK LATER

(Mulder is looking at a photos of the body of the dead beast-woman, he puts them with the rest of the file into a filing cabinet. Scully enters the office carrying a file. Mulder sits down, Scully passes
something to Mulder)

SCULLY: Hi, this just came through, it's the posthumous medical exam on the woman's body. They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract, they estimated her age to be twenty-five to thirty years. Now they allowed Dr. Diamond to do a medical exam of the body but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology. Now the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe, and a search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun, in earnest.

MULDER: Good luck.

(Scully gives Mulder the file she is holding)

SCULLY: They have also released the medical exam from the male body that they found, his age is estimated to be about forty years.

MULDER: There would have been offspring.

SCULLY: The medical exam of the women's uterus does seem to indicate that she may have given birth.

MULDER: She was just protecting her children Scully, it all makes sense. (Mulder gets up and gets his coat from behind the door) The male dies and she comes out of the woods in search of food.

SCULLY: Mulder will you do me a favour, will you just go out and have a beer, will you take the day off. I'll cover for you, will you just, take some time for yourself.

MULDER: Thanks for the offer but I've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with.. (The phone rings)...an ethno-biologist, I can't wait to tell him about this. (Mulder answers the phone) Mulder, yeah just a second, it's for you.

(Scully takes the phone and Mulder rushes out of the office)

SCULLY: Hello?

ROB: Hi Dana, it's Rob.

SCULLY: Oh hi.

(Rob is sitting behind a large desk, in an office or a study, books line the shelves behind him)

ROB: Sorry to call you at work, it's just I have Scott for the night and er, we have two extra tickets for Cirque De Soliel, we thought maybe you'd like to ask Ellen if you could take Trent and join us.

(Mulder approaches a reception desk at the head of a busy office)

MULDER: Requisition for a car please Fran. Thank you. (Mulder is filling out the form when Scully arrives) Who was that on the phone?

SCULLY: A guy.

MULDER: A guy. Same guy as the guy you had dinner with the other night?

SCULLY: Same guy.

MULDER: You gonna have dinner with him again?

SCULLY: I don't think so.

MULDER: No interest?

(Mulder finishes filling in the form and passes it back to Fran)

SCULLY: Not at this time.

(Fran gives Mulder a set of keys)

MULDER: Thanks Fran. (Mulder walks away from the desk and towards a door. Scully walks with him) What are you doing?

SCULLY: I'm going with you to the Smithsonian.

MULDER: Don't you have a life Scully?

SCULLY: Keep that up Mulder and I'll hurt you like that beast-woman.

(Scully stops at the door, her hand on the handle)

MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa.

(Scully opens the door)

SCULLY: Look who's holding the door.

(Mulder walks through the doorway followed by Scully)



SCENE 24
NEW JERSEY STATE PARK

(A man and a boy are walking through the woods, wearing backpacks)

BOY: Dad, did you just see something down there?

DAD: Where?

(The boy points to part of the woods)

BOY: Over there.

DAD: Naah, I'm sure it was nothing.

BOY: No, I saw something.

DAD: Hey, did you ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil? You know when I was a kid, my dad
used to tell this story about a creature who lived out down the woods...

(As the father and son walk off, the camera pans down to the ground and from a hole appears the face of a young girl. The offspring of the beasts)

[THE END]

                                         SHADOWS



SCENE 1
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES
PHILADELPHIA, PA
HOWARD GRAVES' OFFICE

(Pan along the desk. We see Howard Graves' name plate and a plaque that reads 'One to-day is worth two to-morrows Ben Franklin', pictures of Howard Graves with past and present presidents. LAUREN KYTE takes the pictures of Howard and Clinton off the wall and looks at it while crying. A co-worker, JANE, enters)

JANE: Lauren, I've been looking everywhere! (Lauren puts the picture down) Are you all right? You want some water?

LAUREN: No, I'm fine.

JANE: Oh honey, it's been a couple of weeks now. Do you want to talk?

LAUREN: No. Really, Jane, I'm OK. It's just that I don't know a lot of people who have died, that's all. I've never known anyone that's killed themselves.

JANE: Oh, maybe after everything gets packed away it will get easier. There won't be a constant reminder. Here's your paycheck. (Jane hands it to Lauren.) Come on... go home.

LAUREN: Ok. (Jane leaves. Lauren is about to leave and the plaque of Ben Franklin's saying moves on the desk. Lauren goes over and picks it up. She takes it with her and leaves.)



SCENE 2
NIGHT - ATM MACHINE

(Lauren is at the machine and makes the deposit of her paycheck. She is attacked by two men who take her into an alley. She screams)



SCENE 3
TWO HOURS LATER

(Two teens are walking by the same alley. A male and female. The male sniffs in the large garbage dumpster and waves the stink away. He looks up and sees a fire escape.)

MALE: Hey... I know a great place to crash... up that fire escape. Come on. I'll give you a boost.

(He hikes the girl on his shoulders as she tries to pull it down, but it's jammed. A body falls from above to their left and another body falls from the fire escape ladder. They are the two attackers of Lauren Kyte and the girl screams. They both run off.)

SCENE 4
BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL
BETHESDA, MD

(Mulder, Scully and another man walk into the morgue where two corpses lie under sheets on the slabs. On the other side of the room there are two women and a man standing there.)

MAN: Agent Scully, Agent Mulder, Chief Blevins assures us of your cooperation. We regret any inconvenience at this extreme hour.

WOMAN: We hope your expertise in extraordinary phenomena matters will help us in our investigation.

MULDER: You're not FBI, are you?

SECOND WOMAN: Have you ever seen anything like this before? (She hands Mulder and chart and pulls the sheet off one of the corpse's body. His arm flinches) Abnormal post mortem muscle reflex. Both corpses are still responding to high levels of electrostatic charge.

SCULLY: Any sign of external legions or surface burns?

SECOND WOMAN: None.

MULDER: Time of death? (She doesn't answer, just looks at the other two in the corner.)

SCULLY: Well, it can't be long. The body's still warm.

SECOND WOMAN: Somatic death occurred sometime over 6 hours ago. Their body temperatures have yet to drop below 98.3 degrees.

MULDER: Where did you find them? (No answer) Look, at least tell us the mode of transport. That might tell us why the bodies haven't cooled. (Still no answer from them) Hey, you called us down here. If you want some answers you have to give some. (The man finally answers)

MAN: They traveled 60 minutes by air.

MULDER: Thank you.

SECOND WOMAN: The most troubling aspect of their deaths is the throat area. (She walks over to an X Ray screen.) Larynx, esophagus, and hyoid bone all have been crushed like chalk. There is no evidence of tissue damage. It's as if their throats were crushed... from the inside. (Mulder and Scully take a close look at the X Rays of the men)

MULDER: Who are these guys? (No answer)

SCULLY: If you've conducted your investigation, why consult us?

WOMAN: Because of your work on the X Files. Have you ever seen anything like this?

MULDER: Ah, uh. Never.

MAN: Well, thank you for your time Agent Mulder, Scully. If any inquiry into this meeting be made, we request full denial.

MULDER: I'd say you people already suffer from full denial. (Mulder and Scully leave)



SCENE 5
HALLWAY

(Scully and Mulder walk down the hall outside the morgue.)

SCULLY: You lied. You have seen this before, I can tell. You lied to them.

MULDER: I would never lie. I willfully participated in a campaign of misinformation.

SCULLY: Who do you think they were?

MULDER: NSA, CIA, some convert organization Congress will uncover in the next scandal. It's not important who they are but what they have and I'm sure they have no idea because they pulled us in. I have X Files. Each case with an element of what we saw tonight. Residual electrostatic charge, internal mutilation without any external causality - but none has all the elements combined in one case.

SCULLY: How can the esophagus be crushed without the neck even being touched?

MULDER: Psychokinetic manipulation.

SCULLY: Psychokinesis? You mean how Carrie got even at the prom?

MULDER: The Russians were doing studies on it. The Chinese still are. Their findings are kept secret. (They get into an elevator)

SCULLY: Ok, I'm intrigued. How can we investigate, we have nothing to go on. (Mulder puts his arm around her shoulders and brings his eyeglasses up and exhales on them. There is a perfect fingerprint on each lens.



SCENE 6
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES - NEXT MORNING

(Lauren walks into work and scans the newspaper on a desk. Mr. Dorland's secretary comes up to her, scaring her.)

SECRETARY: Just getting in, Lauren? Mr. Graves used to let you get away with that but Mr. Dorland is in charge now. I was wondering if I could have a minute with him. (The secretary looks at his appointments. She pencils in as she talks)

SECRETARY: Tomorrow... at 3.

LAUREN: Can I see him today? It's really important. (Secretary's coffee cup topples spilling coffee all over her desk. They both start to wipe it up. Mr. Dorland comes out of his office)

MR. DORLAND: Is everything all right out here?

LAUREN: Can I speak with you?



SCENE 7
DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Lauren enters and Dorland shuts the door. Dorland motions to the chair in front of his desk)

DORLAND: Please. (Lauren sits)

LAUREN: I'm here to give my two week's notice.

DORLAND: Lauren, Jane told me about your crying in Howard's office and I wanted to tell you that you aren't alone. As a matter of fact, we share something special. Howard and I started this company 10 years ago and as long as I've known him he had no interest besides work. So we became like family. I was his brother and you were like a daughter to him. So, of course, I feel very close to you and I want to take care of my family. Stay, Lauren. Please, the company needs you. Especially now. (He reaches down and takes her face in his hands.) I won't let you leave, Lauren. (A bracelet on his wrist tightens and he flinches, taking his hands from Lauren.)

LAUREN: What's wrong? (Dorland finally loosens the bracelet.) I can't. I have to leave. I can't be here anymore.

DORLAND: You've got two weeks. (Lauren leaves his office.)



SCENE 8
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Mulder is looking at a computer screen with a picture of one of the corpses.)

MULDER: Mohamed Amalaki. Convictions: Illegal possession of firearms. Illegal possession of explosives. Falsification of export licenses. (Scully walks around him with a file and puts it on his desk)

SCULLY: He has ties to extremist group operating in the US. The Isfahan. They take their name from a city in Iran. Recently they've been working out of Philadelphia.

MULDER: That's 60 air minutes.

SCULLY: I'll talk to the Philly P.D.



SCENE 9
BROAD STREET - PHILADELPHIA

(Mulder and Scully are in the alley of Lauren's attack with a cop)

COP: It was last Wednesday night. I was on routine patrol. This is where we found them.

SCULLY: Who discovered their bodies?

COP: Nobody. It was about 10. I was on patrol. Just saw them hanging around. The folks that come around here, they don't witness very much. You hear what I'm saying? (Mulder walks off, Scully and the cop still talking. Mulder sees an anxious woman at the ATM. She leaves and he looks at it.)



SCENE 10
FBI OFFICE

(On the surveillance film from the ATM, we see an older man taking money out.)

MULDER: A daily visual record is made of everyone who makes a transaction.

SCULLY: We'll just have to interview everyone who was at the machine before 10 last night.
(We see Lauren at the machine and being dragged off by the two attackers at 9:45.)

MULDER: There. Back up.

SCULLY: (reading in her file) Lauren Kyte. 858 Franklin, Bensalem. Why would the Isfahan being robbing someone for 40 bucks at an ATM machine?

MULDER: Look at that. (He stops the film and there is a ghostly flash across the screen. Hovering over them.)

SCULLY: It's another person.

MULDER: Maybe, maybe not.

SCULLY: Well, the resolution is too poor. It won't help much to enhance it.

MULDER: That leaves only one person we know we can talk to.



SCENE 11
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(She's in the process of moving. She is going to wrap glass things in newspaper when the plaque from Howard's office catches her eye on the mantle. She picks it up. She is startled by a knock on the door. She looks through the keyhole. It is Mulder and Scully)

LAUREN: Hello?

MULDER: Miss Lauren Kyte, please. (She opens the door and Mulder flashes his badge.) I'm Agent Fox Mulder and this is Agent Dana Scully. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Do you mind if we come in?

LAUREN: Um, I was just in the middle of ...

MULDER: Thank you. We won't be long.

(He squeezes through the door way and past Lauren into the house. Scully enters and smiles at Lauren, who closes the door behind them. Scully shows pictures to Lauren)

SCULLY: Have you seen either of these two men before?

LAUREN: No.

SCULLY: Take your time.

LAUREN: I'm sorry. I've never seen them before.

SCULLY: I'm afraid you have. (Scully shows her another picture) This is a surveillance picture from your ATM. (It's a picture of Lauren and the attackers. Their faces clear.)

MULDER: Can you tell us what happened that night?

LAUREN: Um... These guys, I was depositing my paycheck. They grabbed me, I got away. I ran. I just didn't want to file a report.

MULDER: They were found dead. (She has a reaction. Scully gives her another picture)

SCULLY: Have you ever seen this person before? (It's the still frame from the surveillance video of the spectral image)

LAUREN: No. I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

MULDER: Does that mean you know?

LAUREN: It means I can't tell who it is.

MULDER: When you can tell me, this is the number where I can be reached at anytime, ok?

LAUREN: Ah hum. (Mulder and Scully leave)



SCENE 12
OUTSIDE

(Mulder and Scully walk to their car)

SCULLY: A woman her size breaking free and out running those men?

MULDER: And somehow crushing their necks? (They get into the car and put on their seatbelts. Lauren is seen looking at them through her window.)

SCULLY: She knows who the other person in that photo is.

MULDER: Packing, running away, from what? ( The parking brake goes off, the car is put into reverse, and the doors are locked. Mulder tries to brake, put the car spins backward.)

SCULLY: What the hell's going on?

MULDER: Hang on! (He turns around and steers the car speeding backward, trying to brake. The car is hit in the intersection by another car. It comes to a stop) You ok?

SCULLY: Yeah. (Mulder looks over at the other driver, shaking his head wondering what happened. Lauren is still looking out the window and she pulls the drapes when Mulder sees her.)



SCENE 13
GARAGE

(Mulder is crouched at the side of the dented car. Scully walks up.)

SCULLY: Hi.

MULDER: Hi. The paramedics check you out?

SCULLY: Yeah. I'm fine. Except I have a waiting-in-line-at-the-DMV-sized headache.

MULDER: Mine's more IRS sized.

SCULLY: They check out the car?

MULDER: Yeah, it's brand new. Only a 100 miles.

SCULLY: Then someone tampered with it while we were in her house.

MULDER: Mechanic said everything is in proper order. Nothing cut, nothing greased. Check out the lights.

SCULLY: They are on.

MULDER: They're not. The filaments are heated due to massive levels of electrostatic charge. Just like the bodies at the morgue. And isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte was present at both incidents?

SCULLY: She was in our presence the entire time we were at her house.

MULDER: What if it's possible somehow to raise a body's electrostatic charge to levels we've been seeing and use that energy to affect objects?

SCULLY: If a person could generate that much energy, their body would break down. They'd start glowing like those lights.

MULDER: Well there's evidence of this all through the X Files. Furniture moving untouched, objects levitating, unexplained electrical discharges. Frequently people who have psychokinetic power are unaware of their own capability.

SCULLY: Are you saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?

MULDER: Either that or a poltergeist.

SCULLY: They're here... (imitation of the little girl from the movie, "Poltergeist")

MULDER: They may be.

SCULLY: Oh, come on Mulder, look at the tangible evidence. Two Mid-East extremists are killed trying to assault a woman working for a manufacturer of parts for the Defense Department. While we questioned her our car is sabotaged. Now in both those cases, someone else may have committed those acts. Maybe the same someone we saw in those ATM photos. The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy, it's her accomplice. (They both notice the lights of the car are out.)



SCENE 14
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

(Lauren drives into the parking lot and gets out of her car. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their new rental, Mulder with binoculars, Scully going through papers.)

SCULLY: She's clean. No arrest, not even a traffic ticket. The only thing is, she's in deep with her credit card company... $15,000. (They look over at Lauren, mad at a sign painter painting over Howard Graves' parking spot with a new name, Tom Braidwood (Who happens to be a second unit director and Frohike on the show)

LAUREN: No, no. (She grabs the stencil out of the painter's hands) I'll talk to somebody, just go.

MULDER: A little upset over losing a parking space, wouldn't you say? So, who is Howard Graves anyway?



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Scully is pouring over the microfiche film. Scully gets Mulder's attention and they read an article from a newspaper. Howard Graves Suicide Creates Shock.)

MULDER: She was his secretary. That's three people dead in the last month all associated with Lauren Kyte. (The newspaper article says Howard slashed his wrists in a bathtub.)



SCENE 16
CEMETERY - DAY

(Mulder and Scully pull up to the cemetery to see Lauren put flowers on a grave. They watch her as she sadly walks away from the grave site. They get out of the car and go to the grave she put flowers on. It's Howard Graves'.)

MULDER: You don't see too many bosses graves without people dancing on it.

SCULLY: Look at this one. (There is another maker next to Howard's that reads, \'93 Sarah Lynn Graves September 8, 1966 to August 3 1969". There's a groundskeeper planting flowers nearby.)

MULDER: Excuse me, Sir? Is there an office here so that I can get information on those people?

GROUNDSKEEPER: I attend every funeral. I'm the last person to see them put to rest.

MULDER: Do you know how Sarah Lynn is related to Howard Graves?

GROUNDSKEEPER: His daughter. They were at home one day and he didn't latch the pool gate. She drowned. His wife left him a year later. She's buried in a plot in the Northeast corner.

MULDER: Thank you, Sir.

GROUNDSKEEPER: You're welcome. (He leaves. Mulder and Scully go to Sarah's grave again.)

SCULLY: She was only three years old.

MULDER: If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age. (Scully looks at Mulder and he looks at her.)



SCENE 17
DARKROOM

(Mulder is developing pictures)



SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully is typing into her laptop)

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): Further investigation into Lauren Kyte's personal history reveals an estrangement from her family. Phone records confirm no contact with her parents for the last two years. Her actions observed during surveillance (Go back to Mulder looking at photos taken during the surveillance as Scully continues speaking) indicate a strong relationship between Lauren Kyte and her employer, the late Howard Graves. (Back to Scully typing) Was this relationship somehow the motivation for his suicide? How are the attack and the subsequent murders of the Isfahan agents related, if at all? I am certain that the answers to these questions lie in finding the identity of Lauren Kyte's accomplice. (Back to Mulder looking at the negatives of the photos. One is of Lauren Kyte's house, the next of her front window. There's a figure standing in the window.)



SCENE 19
CRIME LAB

(The photo of the figure in the front window is being put on the computer and manipulated. The framing of just the window of the photo is enlarged and we see the figure is Lauren Kyte, but right behind her is another figure. Mulder and Scully are with the computer operator.)

SCULLY: Enhance it by 10. (He does.) That's Howard Graves. He's alive.

MULDER: Not necessarily.



SCENE 20
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

(Lauren is asleep in the bed. Her cat is sitting on the end of it and hisses and takes off. We can hear banging. Lauren wakes up. She is scared. The stairs creak. Lauren slowly goes to her closet and gets out a bat. She slowly moves to the door, opens it and looks into the dark hallway. She enters the hallway and the pounding gets louder and we can also hear a man saying, 'No.' She walks down the hallway and there are other voices too, I can't make out what is said besides, 'No.' Then a reverberating 'Don't do this to me.' Lauren moves to the bathroom. The door is ajar and she pushes it open with the bat as we hear, 'No. Stop. No, no, no. Please!' She guardedly moves into the bathroom and turns on the light. The shower curtain is closed. The man's voice is now crying. Lauren pulls open the shower curtain and there is a tub full of water, with a cloud of red in the middle. It grows and soon the entire tub is full of blood.)

LAUREN: Oh, Howard. (The tub drains)



SCENE 21
NATIONAL BUREAU OF MEDICAL EXAMINERS
PHILADELPHIA, PA

(Scully and Mulder walk down a flight of steps in a stairwell.)

SCULLY: I think Howard Graves faked his own death.

MULDER: Do you know how difficult it is to fake your own death? Only one man has pulled it off, Elvis.

SCULLY: He and Lauren Kyte are in on something. Maybe an illegal deal through his company. Something the CIA was interested in.

MULDER: You may be right. (They get to the door to the office of Ellen Bledsoe, ME.)

SCULLY: Wait, you think I'm right?

MULDER: Sure, all you got to do is prove that Howard Graves is still alive. (He knocks on the door.)



SCENE 22
ELLEN BLEDSOE'S OFFICE

(We see a dour black woman's face, Ellen Bledsoe, I presume.)

ELLEN: Howard Graves is very dead.

SCULLY: May we see the autopsy report, please? (Ellen tosses it across the desk)

ELLEN: Knock yourself out. (Scully reads the report)

SCULLY: Cause of death... arterial hemorrhage...

ELLEN: 4 to 6 liters of blood down the tub.

SCULLY: Well there seems to be some blood work missing here.

ELLEN: We only do that when we suspect homicide.

MULDER: I don't suppose you ran any dental conformation?

ELLEN: What for? It was him.

SCULLY: How did you know?

ELLEN: It said so on the toe tag.

MULDER: Who made positive ID on the body? (Scully looks through the report again.)

SCULLY: Lauren Kyte.

MULDER: But Howard Graves was cremated. There would be no way to run a dental check or to get a DNA sample.

SCULLY: Yes, there is. His body's tissues and organs were donated.



SCENE 23
UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL

(Mulder and Scully and another man in a lab coat are standing in a hallway looking through a window to the Cryogenics lab while the man talks. There are lots of people working in the lab.)

MAN: Howard Graves is in 5 different people. They harvested his organs immediately after death. His kidneys were sent to Boston, his liver to Dallas, and his corneas to Portland, Oregon. They've all been transplanted. Because of his age, we could only cryo-preserve the dura matter, the membrane of the spinal column. We have Mr. Graves' hospital records, we'll extract a sample, run a test and in a couple of hours... confirm the identity of the donor.



SCENE 24
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES
PHILADELPHIA, PA

(There's a party going on. Balloons, champagne hats, lots of people, music, etc.)

JANE: I knew you would rush, so I made sure to have your check before you leave. (She hands it to Lauren) Oh, I'm going to miss you. (They hug. Jane gets teary eyed. Lauren smiles and gives her a glass of champagne.)

LAUREN: What? Here.

JANE: Bye.

LAUREN: Bye. (Lauren walks away from her. She goes to her desk which has all her stuff in a box. She puts her desk nameplate in it. She takes the box and starts to leave, but turns and goes into Howard's office instead, careful to see no one was watching her.)



SCENE 25
HOWARD GRAVES' OFFICE

(The office is bare of all personal effects from the beginning of the show. The bare furniture is all that's left. Lauren looks around the office and is startled when the door shuts. She turns and sees Dorland leaning back to the door and smiling.)

DORLAND: You're going to leave without saying goodbye? Well, I've come to say goodbye... to wish you luck, and to leave you with this little thought... I know Howard told you and if it ever gets out, I won't waste my time trying to pin the source. I'll go straight to you.

LAUREN: And you'll do to me what you did to Howard? I know you had him killed.

DORLAND: Why would you say that?

LAUREN: He told me. (She takes her box off the desk and goes to the door, but Dorland grabs her. They jostle and Lauren gets out of the office and walks away. She walks into the party and uses the phone)



SCENE 26
UNIVERSITY OF PA OFFICE

(Mulder and Scully are reading and fidgeting. Mulder's cell phone rings. While he answers it, the lab guy enters and talks to Scully.)

MULDER: Mulder. (Cut between Lauren and Mulder)

LAUREN: It's Lauren Kyte. How soon can you get to my house?

MULDER: Why?

LAUREN: Please hurry. (She hangs up and takes her box and leaves. Dorland stands in Graves' office doorway watching her)

SCULLY: The tests are conclusive, the dura matter does belong to Howard Graves. He is indeed, very dead. (Mulder gets up and walks away)



SCENE 27
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(Lauren walks down stairs. She has her suitcases and puts them on the dining table. She finishes up packing up things at her desk. A car with a man and a woman pulls up outside her house. They get out and walk to the front door. Inside, Lauren is pacing. There's a knock on the door. She is relieved and walks across her empty house to the door. She opens the dead bolt. It slides closed again.)

LAUREN: Just a second. (She opens it again, she hears a noise behind her. She jumps out of the way of a kitchen chair that moves across the house and wedges itself under the door knob. The door flies open and the man and woman enter. The man has a switchblade in his hand.)

MAN: Go run the bath. (Lauren falls back into the living room floor.)

LAUREN: Get out of here! (The bulbs in the lamps around the room shatter. The man grabs Lauren and a table slams into him. She gets away. The only light in the room is coming from the window. A spectral presence moves from the dining room to the front door where the woman sees it and tries to get out of the house.) No! (The woman is flung to the door. Her neck is crushed. Lauren screams no as the woman falls to the ground. The man gets out from between the table and fireplace and runs to the door but is flung back on the floor. He looks all around. He stands up. He gets punched in the face, drawing blood but there are no hands. It's like Lauren can't move from where she stands. She screams some more. Mulder and Scully drive up outside. They hear screams from inside the house and race to the front door. Mulder pushes the woman aside as he opens the door. He looks into the living room and the man is hanging from nothing in the middle of the room. Lauren is crying. The man falls to the floor as Scully enters the house, gun drawn. They look at Lauren whimpering in a crouched position on the floor.



SCENE 28
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Mulder is sitting across the table from Lauren as Scully leans against a window ledge.)

SCULLY: You know, you're not under arrest. You're just here for questioning. The sooner you talk to us the sooner you get to go home. (Pause) What happened to those people tonight? (Lauren's not saying anything) Do you have any idea who they might be. Why did they attack you? (Mulder picks up a picture and walks around the table and shows it to Lauren)

MULDER: Do you know who this is? (The man from the beginning, the non-talker at the morgue walks in)

MAN: Scully, Mulder... He'll keep an eye on her. (He motions to an officer who enters the room after him.) Come. Now. (Scully and Mulder leave the room with him and the woman from the morgue is there too.)

WOMAN: You've seriously compromised our investigation.

MULDER: We were following leads pertaining to an X File.

MAN: I want to know every detail of your activities concerning this case.

SCULLY: What case? You're the ones who've been withholding information. (They all fall silent.)

MULDER: Then we have nothing more to talk about. (Mulder and Scully walk away. The woman and man follow them to the hallway.)

WOMAN: We believe HTG Technologies was selling restricted parts to the Isfahan. Partial serial numbers from their manifest were recovered in the wreckage of a July bombing of a Navy transport van.

MULDER: How's Lauren Kyte involved?

MAN: We don't quite know. Your actions impeded our investigation.

WOMAN: In any case, we don't have enough evidence to hold her. If she doesn't talk, she goes free and we lose our chance to break this company.

MAN: I could make her talk.

MULDER: My advise to you. Don't get rough with her.




LATER

(The door to the interrogation room opens.)

WOMAN: That was a waste of time. (The woman and man walk out. The woman keeps walking. The man regards Mulder and Scully off screen.)

MAN: Your turn. (He leaves. Scully and Mulder walk into the room.)



SCENE 29
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Scully and Mulder enter.)

SCULLY: Lauren?

LAUREN: I won't talk to you, either.

MULDER: Ok, then you're free to go. (Lauren looks up surprised and gets up from her chair. Scully throws a surprised look in Mulder's direction as Lauren walks by her. Lauren pauses at the door.)

LAUREN: I can't go back to that house.

MULDER: Why? Because of Howard Graves?

LAUREN: He's dead.

MULDER: I know. He's watching over you, isn't he?




LATER

(A tape recorder is rolling)

LAUREN: I don't know if you've ever been a secretary. Sometimes your boss can talk as if you weren't even in the room, which can hurt, you know? Sometimes... you're all he has to talk to. Which is how it was all the time with me and Howard. One night, late, I went into his office. He was crying, more scared than sad. The Pentagon contracts were being canceled, the company was going under, he felt personally responsible for each of his employees... seeing and feeling their fear every day... it really wore him down. Then this one time, Dorland came with that group... that Mid East group... Isfahan, that terrorist group. They'd buy parts at an outrageous price. Not just once, but for as long as they could get away with it. That night Howard was crying, he'd just found out the Isfahan had just claimed responsibility for killing a couple of sailors in Florida. He was never the same. And I thought that was why he killed himself. But he didn't... I saw ... Howard showed me how Dorland had him killed. Made it look like a suicide because he see Howard was going to put an end to the deal.

MULDER: So now Howard is protecting you?

LAUREN: It sounds so ridiculous.

SCULLY: But you believe it.

LAUREN: He was closer to me than my father. I told him that. I still feel his presence. Sometimes... I even smell his aftershave. If you just could've ... seen ... the things I've seen... I just... want all that to go away. I'm leaving. Maybe he can move on. (Scully gets up from the table and go to Lauren.)

SCULLY: That's not enough. You've been given the chance to tell him again. Take it. Tell him you love him, by showing him, by... helping us finish his unfinished business. Lauren, how will you ever be able to rest if he never can? (Lauren nods.)

LAUREN: Ok. (Scully nods too.) I'm a mess. I'm um, going to wash up. (She leaves.)

MULDER: What are you doing Scully? You don't believe.

SCULLY: Mulder, there's no such thing as ghosts or psychokinesis. I'm sure there's an explanation. But I believe that she believes. And my priority is to get her to help us stop Dorland.

MULDER: Well we may have just sacrificed our best opportunity to observe spectral phenomena.

SCULLY: I'm giving us a chance to solve a case that's tangible instead of chasing after shadows.
(Scully leaves leaving Mulder to ponder.)



SCENE 30
STAIRCASE

(Lots of FBI come down the stairs, Mulder with them. He goes to Lauren standing by a car. Scully approaches.)

MULDER: You ready? (She nods. Scully addresses the troops)

SCULLY: All right, everyone. We have a warrant to search the premises for evidence of the sale of restricted manufactured parts. The evidence may be in the form of falsified export licences, parts manifests, communiques. It could be on computer disks or hard copy.

MAN: (from morgue and interrogation room) Once there, when in doubt, ask. We need this to be clean. This is the culmination of a year long investigation. If we don't come out of there today with something proving a connection to the Isfahan, this guy could walk.

SCULLY: Lets go. (The man break up. Lauren walks with Scully.) Now, it will most likely be in Dorland's office. We'll conduct the search, but we need you to guide us so we need you to be strong, okay? (Scully opens the back door of the car for her. Lauren gets in. The cars pull out.)



SCENE 31
HTG INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES

(The FBI walk into the office. Scully walks in with them with her badge.)

SCULLY: Everybody stay calm. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Ma'am, could you step away from those files, please?

(The FBI moves people around and out of the way and others start looking in files, drawers, reports, etc. Dorland comes out of his office. Scully and Lauren walk by him into his office. Mulder stays outside with him.)

DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Scully puts things into a box. Lauren searches through his bureau and books.)

LATER

(The man and woman from the morgue go to Mulder and Scully.)

WOMAN: This is all we could find.

MULDER: We don't have him. He's not even breaking a sweat. (Dorland is standing in a corner with the employees, engaging in small talk. The man walks up to Mulder.)

MAN: Our case is blown. A wasted year. This guy is going to walk. (The man and woman leave.)



SCENE 32
DORLAND'S OFFICE

(Scully walks to the door and out with a box of things taken from his office as Mulder enters)

SCULLY: Let's get out of here. (Mulder walks to Lauren still at the bureau. She is distraught.)

MULDER: Lauren, it's over. We have to go. (She looks around the room as Dorland enters.) What we're looking for isn't here. (Lauren takes a letter opener from the desk and smashes the glass in a picture frame and takes out the photo.)

DORLAND: Look! She isn't an agent. I've been more than cooperative and I don't want to be combative, but she has no right destroying my personal property. (Lauren takes a painting from the wall and opens the back. Nothing but a painting.

LAUREN: Destroying property? What about that van that blew up and killed those servicemen?

DORLAND: Oh, I don't know what you're talking about you stupid bitch! (Lauren rushes Dorland with the letter opener.)

MULDER: Lauren, No! (Dorland pushes her away and he is pushed against the wall by Howard. The door slams shut. Dorland starts gasping at his neck. He can't breathe.

LAUREN: Don't kill him. Help us find it! (Dorland slides to the floor. The track lighting explodes. The bulbs in the lamps explode. Mulder grabs Lauren.)

MULDER: Get down. (Outside the office, Scully hears the commotion and runs back to Dorland's office door. It's locked.)

SCULLY: Mulder! (Inside the office, it's dark and we hear Scully yelling. Pictures fly from the wall. Drawers open and papers fly around the room. The letter opener hovers in front of Dorland's face. It turns and flies into the wall. It slits the wallpaper about two feet and stops. The noise and flying papers die down and Scully bolts into the room. She looks around at the mess.)

SCULLY: My God. (Mulder walks across the wall to wall paper to the wall and takes a floppy disk out from behind the wallpaper.)

MULDER: I guess what we're looking for is here.



SCENE 33
LAUREN KYTE'S HOUSE

(A moving trailer is hitched to Lauren's car. Scully, Lauren and Mulder walk to it. Lauren is carrying a box.)

SCULLY: The US Attorney's office is going after Dorland with everything they've got. Including the murder of Howard Graves.

LAUREN: I'll come back to testify. (She puts the box in her trunk.)

MULDER: Where are you going?

LAUREN: Away from here. (Lauren gets into the drivers seat and starts the car.) Thanks. (She drives off.)

MULDER: Boy, she's in a rush to get out of here.

SCULLY: Out of here, or away from the ghost of Howard Graves? (They walk to the car.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully. Do you believe in the afterlife?

SCULLY: I'd settle for a life in this one.

MULDER: Have you ever seen the liberty bell?

SCULLY: Yes. (They get into the car and fasten their seat belts.)

MULDER: You know, I've been to Philadelphia a 100 times and I've never seen it.

SCULLY: You're not missing much. It's just a big bell with a big crack, and you have to wait in a long line.

MULDER: Yeah, (Mulder starts the car and drives off) but I'd really like to go.

SCULLY: Why now?

MULDER: I don't know. How late do you think they stay open?



SCENE 34
LAUREN'S NEW WORKPLACE

(Howard Graves' plaque with Ben's quote is on her desk. She brings a report to her new head secretary.)

HEAD SECRETARY: Miss Kyte, I asked for this 25 minutes ago.

LAUREN: I know. I'm sorry.

HEAD SECRETARY: Maybe that's the way they work back in the East, but here in the Midwest, punctuality is a virtue. (She takes the report and goes back to what she was doing. The coffee cup on the secretary's desk starts shaking. Lauren is nervous. The secretary sees it and covers it with her hands.) We really need to find a new office space. Every time a truck goes by the whole building shakes. (She takes a sip of her coffee. Lauren is relieved.) That's all Lauren. (Lauren goes back to her desk. She smiles at the plaque.)

[THE END]

                                      GHOST IN THE MACHINE



SCENE 1
EURISKO WORLD HEADQUARTERS
CRYSTAL CITY, VA

(High rise office building, exterior. Office with two men arguing.)

SCRUFFY GUY: Look, Ben. This is what infuriates me. Don't you see? It's so painfully obvious. Why do you think our stock's in the toilet? Because you're cutting research and development in half. You've forgotten what the adventure's all about.

SUIT GUY: (BAD dub job on the voice) Like it or not, the industry's changing. We need to make some hard choices.

SCRUFFY GUY: You save your sound bite for the press.

SUIT GUY: Let's not relive the stockholder's meeting again.

SCRUFFY GUY: Don't you get it? You're killing me! You're killing my company!

SUIT GUY: Eurisko is not your company, Brad - - not any more. And you damn well better grow up and get used to it.

SCRUFFY GUY (BRAD WILCZEK): (exiting angrily) You're going to regret this.

(Night. SUIT GUY typing from tape recorder in his office.)

SUIT GUY: (recorded) New paragraph. As I'm sure everyone on the Board will agree, Eurisko has to face head on the realities on an increasingly competitive world. (focus on camera overhead) Since the unfortunate departure of Brad Wilczek, I have made certain recommendations which I believe will reposition Eurisko as an industry leader.

(Focus on camera monitor filming SUIT GUY - COS SCANNING: DRAKE, BENJAMIN - DATA INTERCEPT)

At the top of this list, is the immediate termination of the COS project.

(COS computer monitor starts flashing little lights like the computers in the 1960's Star Trek)

It's disastrous performance over the past three quarters and projected losses well into 1994 leave us no other choice.

(COS watches SUIT GUY, DRAKE, check his watch then go into his private bathroom where he hears water running. The sink is overflowing. Drake shuts off the water and is now wet standing in a puddle. The phone rings. DRAKE answers)

DRAKE: Hello? Hello!

PHONE VOICE: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 P.M.

(Suddenly, lights go out and bathroom door slams shut. DRAKE sets down phone)

DRAKE: What the hell?

(He tires the door, no luck. He swipes his card key, no luck. He puts metal manual override key in the lock and ..... WHAMMMO!!! Huge electrical shock flings him across the room, breaking the mirror. Camera focus on DRAKE'S body.)

COMPUTER VOICE: File deleted.

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.
(Agent JERRY LAMANA walking through FBI office. He swipes some candy out of someone's Halloween pumpkin. He approaches MULDER and SCULLY who are getting lunch at a cart.)

JERRY: Mulder.

MULDER: (hugging him) Jerry?

JERRY: You're Dana Scully, right? (shakes SCULLY'S hand) Jerry Lamana.

MULDER: Jerry and I worked together in Violent Crimes.

JERRY: Worked together? What are you talking worked together. (to SCULLY) We were partners.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY)

LUNCH CART GUY: That's $8.50, please. (SCULLY starts to pay him)

MULDER: So, Jerry, what are you doing here?

JERRY: Looking for you. And I'm buying you two lunch.

SCULLY: No, really ...

JERRY: No, it's on me. (pays LUNCH CART GUY)



SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE

(MULDER and SCULLY listening to JERRY)

JERRY: Cause of death was electrocution.

SCULLY: And it wasn't accidental?

JERRY: It looks like some kind of elaborate booby trap, but we don't know a whole lot more. The building engineer just found him twelve hours ago.

SCULLY: Who's running the investigation?

JERRY: Do either of you know Nancy Spiller?

SCULLY: The forensics instructor at the Academy? (to MULDER) We used to call her the Iron Maiden.

JERRY: On a good day. Well, anyway she's putting together the squad and, well, I took the liberty of mentioning your name. (to MULDER)

MULDER: Look, Jerry. I'd like to help you out, but we're not on general assignment.

JERRY: Because of the X-Files? (slightly desperate, to MULDER) Look, the truth is, I could use a little help on this. I don't want to drop the ball on this one.

MULDER: You won't drop the ball.

JERRY: Drake wasn't just a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. He was a good friend of the Attorney General's. Another feather in my cap would be really nice right now, because the one I got's looking a little mangy.

MULDER: Yeah, but Jerry ...

JERRY: Look, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.



SCENE 4
EURISKO WORLD HEADQUARTERS

SCULLY: How come you two went your separate ways?

MULDER: I'm a pain in the ass to work with.

SCULLY: Seriously.

MULDER: I'm not a pain in the ass? We had different career goals. Jerry wanted the fifth floor.

SCULLY: And you?

MULDER: I was gunning for a basement office with no heat or windows.

(Security camera follows them inside the building.)

SCULLY: I know where you ended up. What about Jerry?

MULDER: He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta working hate crimes.

SCULLY: What kind of bad luck?

MULDER: He misplaced a piece of evidence, bagged and everything. Sent it to the cleaners. By the time he got it back, a federal judge had lost both his hands and his right eye.

(Elevator dings and they enter. Security camera watches them.)

SCULLY: (pushing button) Twenty-nine?

MULDER: Uh-huh.

ELEVATOR: Going up.

SCULLY: Must be for the visually impaired.

MULDER: How do you like that? A politically correct elevator.

ELEVATOR: Third floor....Fourth floor....

(Elevator slams to a stop. SCULLY falls. MULDER helps her up.)

MULDER: You okay?

SCULLY: Yeah. What was that?

(MULDER tries buttons. SCULLY picks up phone. As she does, it rings. She looks surprised.)

MAN'S VOICE: Yes?

SCULLY: Hello?

MAN'S VOICE: Security. Who's this?

SCULLY: This is Agent Dana Scully.

MAN'S VOICE: Agent Scully, do you have a problem? (Elevator begins going up again, announcing floors.)

SCULLY: Uh, actually, I think everything's okay.

(Security camera monitor reads - DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PHONE SEARCH
SCULLY, DANA 202-555-6431)



SCENE 5
DRAKE'S EXECUTIVE BATHROOM

(JERRY, MULDER, and SCULLY looking at door computer controls.)

JERRY: Someone has tampered with the servo. They switched the ground to the negative so that when he put the key in the lock...

SCULLY: ...he completed the circuit.

JERRY: It's fused. It takes a lot of juice to melt a steel key.

SCULLY: And to throw a 180 pound man ten feet. (Looks at cracked mirror)

MULDER: The, uh, servo switch. Could it have been moved manually?

JERRY: We didn't find any prints in the surrounding area.

(PETERSON enters the bathroom.)

PETERSON: Sure it could have been switched manually. But whoever did it would have had to override the COS.

MULDR: What's the COS?

PETERSON: The central operating system. It runs the building. It regulates everything from energy output to the volume of water in each toilet flush.

JERRY: This is Claude Peterson. He's the building systems engineer. He discovered the body.

MULDER: If somebody wanted to override the COS, what would they ...?

PETERSON: Well, first he'd have to break the access codes which, well let's just say it wouldn't be easy.

(Camera watches them)

MULDER: Well, we're going to need a list of all the people with that kind of know how.

PETERSON: Well, I can tell you right now it'll be a pretty short list.

MULDER: Would you be on it?

PETERSON: Me? Hey, look. I'm just a glorified building super. All I do is monitor the system. Make sure it's functioning properly. Like when I saw the overload in Mr. Drake's office.

MULDER: What about the phone lines? Does the COS monitor all phone calls?

PETERSON: Yes it does. Why?

MULDER: I was just wondering.

PETERSON: Okay, um, look. Can I go now?

JERRY: Yeah. (Camera watches PETERSON leave. To MULDER) Why'd you ask him about the phones?

MULDER: Phone's off the hook. (hangs it up) Maybe Drake was talking to someone right before he did his Ben Franklin impersonation.

JERRY: (to SCULLY) Taught him everything he knows. (he exits)

(MULDER nods and smiles tightly at SCULLY who looks a bit over it.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQURTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(X-Files office. MULDER is looking around on his messy desk. Knock at door.)

MULDER: Come in.

SCULLY: (entering) It's past three.

MULDER: I'm just looking for my profile notes.

SCULLY: Maybe if you cleaned your desk more than once a year.

MULDER: They were right here. I'm telling you.

SCULLY: Come on. We're late.

(MULDER looks around one more time. SCULLY hands him his jacket and they exit.)



SCENE 7
CONFERENCE ROOM

(Investigative team meeting. MULDER stares at the wall as JERRY reads notes)

JERRY: Now, there are a couple of elements for us to consider, here. Both the statistical rarity of homicidal electrocution and the complexity of the crime indicate a certain devious premeditation. After all, there are much simpler ways of killing someone. All of which leads me to believe that our guy was some kind of sociopathic game player - - maybe even a recluse since he designed a trap not only to avoid detection, but to avoid contact with the victim.

SCULLY: (whisper to MULDER) Is that your profile?

MULDER: (whisper) Forget it, no.

JERRY: Drake's final phone call supports this theory. (plays tape)

COMPUTER VOICE: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 P.M.

JERRY: Drake's estimated time of death.

AGENT SPILLER: Why would Drake call for the correct time just before he died?

JERRY: It was an incoming call. From somewhere in the Eurisko building itself. Whoever set the trap wanted to make sure that Drake took the bait.

AGENT SPILLER: Excellent work, Agent Lamana.

JERRY: Thank you.

(MULDER looks not happy)



SCENE 8
FBI BUILDING

(MULDER approaches JERRY in the FBI bullpen)

MULDER: Jerry, what the hell are you doing?

JERRY: Hey, don't get all bent out of shape.

MULDER: Jerry, that was my profile.

JERRY: Look, I didn't think you'd mind. (Starts to leave, MULDER stops him) Anyway, they were just notes. I filled in the blanks.

MULDER: Jerry, you went into my office and you stole my work.

JERRY: Look, you're on this case cause I asked you to help me out, and you helped me out. What is the big deal. (exits as SCULLY enters)

SCULLY: What did he say?

MULDER: He apologized - in his own way.

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Peterson, the systems engineer. (hands MULDER a piece of paper)

MULDER: One name? Brad Wilczek?

SCULLY: He said it would be a short list. And it's headline news how much this guy despised Drake.

MULDER: That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal.

SCULLY: And fully consistent with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.

MULDER: Fully. (as they exit)



SCENE 9
WILCZEK'S COUNTRY CLUB HOUSE

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up. As they walk to the front door, a camera follows them)

MULDER: So this is what a 220 IQ and a $400 million severance settlement buys you.

(SCULLY knocks. WILCZEK opens door immediately)

WILCZEK: Yes?

SCULLY: (surprised) Brad Wilczek? (MULDER shows badge) We're with the FBI.

WILCZEK: What took you guys so long. Oh, do you mind taking off your shoes?

(WILCZEK leads MULDER and Short!SCULLY barefoot through the house)

WILCZEK: You can divide the computer science industry into two types of people - - neat and scruffy.

SCULLY: I take it Benjamin Drake fit into the first category.

WILCZEK: Neat people like things neat. They wear nicely pressed suits and work on surface phenomena. Things they can understand. Market shares, and third quarter profits.

SCULLY: And you had a different vision for the company?

WILCZEK: I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage. I was 22 years old. I'd just spent a year following around the Grateful Dead. You know what Eurisko means?

MULDER: That's from the Greek, isn't it? Um, "I learn things."

WILCZEK: Not exactly. It means "I discover things." (MULDER shrugs) Unfortunately, Ben Drake wasn't interested in discovery. He was a short-sighted, power-hungry opportunist. (Goes to computer) Let me show you something - Smart Home. From this prototype, I have access to every square foot of my house. This place is as safe as Fort Knox and as energy efficient as your average igloo. We were two years ahead of Microsoft and Cebus when Drake, in his infinite wisdom, killed the program.

MULDER: Mr. Wilczek, is this system related to the one in your corporate building?

WILCZEK: Variation on a theme.

MULDER: In your opinion, how many people know the system well enough to override it?

WILCZEK: Finally the bonus question. Not many is the answer.

MULDER: Could someone have hacked into the system?

WILCZEK: Well, not your average phone freak, that's for sure. But there's plenty of kooks out there. Data travelers, Electro wizards, techno anarchists. Anything's possible.

SCULLY: Could you have done it?

WILCZEK: Of course. I designed the system. That's why you guys are here, isn't it? I'm your logical suspect.

SCULLY: You don't seem too worried.

WILCZEK: It's a puzzle, Miss Scully, and scruffy minds like me like puzzles. We enjoy walking down unpredictable avenues of thought, turning new corners - - but as a general rule, scruffy minds don't commit murder.

(MULDER and SCULLY share a look under ominous music)



SCENE 10
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(SCULLY working at computer)

SCULLY VOICE OVER: Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected -- to make juxtapositions, to see relationships where others cannot. Is Brad Wilczek a genius? I don't know. But I do know this for certain. He has a predilection for elaborate game playing. He has an intimate knowledge of the Eurisko building and he has a demonstrable motive for killing Benjamin Drake. The question remains. But if he is so clever how do we nail him? End of field journal, October 24, 1993.

(SCULLY turns off monitor, turns off light, goes into bedroom removing earrings, jacket and shoes. Computer beeps, monitor turns back on (?!) modem connects. SCULLY'S report comes up along with message "COS SCANNING: Scully, Dana --- Data Intercept." Camera shows that screen is now that of the COS inside the Eurisko building that we saw in the teaser.)

COS COMPUTER: File opened.



SCENE 11
X-FILES OFFICE

(MULDER and SCULLY listening to tapes of WILCZEK. SCULLY isolates the word "eastern." JERRY enters.)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Will you give me a second? (SCULLY nods. MULDER steps outside the office with JERRY.)

JERRY: Look, I'm here with my hat in my hand. I screwed up - - I'm sorry. (Grins) What more can I say?

MULDER: All you had to do was ask. I would've helped you with the profile.

JERRY: You don't know what it's like, Mulder.

MULDER: What *what's* like?

JERRY: You heard about Atlanta?

MULDER: Yea ...

JERRY: They got me on six month's probation. I got to file daily reports like some cherry new agent.

MULDER: That was bad luck. That could have happened to anybody.

JERRY: Not to you.

MULDER: Don't run yourself down, Jerry. You're a good agent. We did some good work together.

JERRY: Let's face it. I was tagging along.

MULDER: That's not how it was.

JERRY: How would you know, Mulder? You were too busy dazzling them up there on the high wire.

SCULLY: (from the office) Mulder, take a look. (MULDER nods for JERRY to follow, then goes to SCULLY) We borrowed this from the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown. (Indicates voice analyzer.) It's a computer spectrogram capable of identifying individual speech patterns. Now this is the recording the Central Operating System made of the phone call Drake received just before he died.

RECORDING: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.

SCULLY: And this we spliced together from a series of lectures Brad Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year.

RECORDING 2: At the tone, Eastern Standard Time will be 7:35 p.m.

SCULLY: Now we'll stack them. (plays them together)

JERRY: Your saying this is the same person?

MULDER: I'm saying that both voices are Brad Wilczek's. He may have disguised his voice electronically, but he couldn't alter the form that is unique to his own speech patterns.

SCULLY: Which means that he was the one that killed Drake. He had the motive and the means. And now we have the physical evidence. (Draws circles on the computer screen with a *hopefully* dry erase marker.) Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights. I can get a warrant in less than an hour.

JERRY: Someone has to make sure Wilczek stays put.

MULDER: I'll go with you.

JERRY: No. Let me bring him in alone. I need this one, Mulder.

MULDER: All right.

(JERRY leaves, smiling)



SCENE 12
WILCZEK'S HOUSE

(WILCZEK typing at computer.)

WILCZEK: Come on, come on. Let me in. (Screen says "Access Denied.") Damn!

(WILCZEK leaves his house and drives off in his early 60's ? Corvette. On the street, JERRY starts his car and follows.)



SCENE 13
EURISKO BUILDING

(WILCZEK runs in past security cameras to elevators.)

GUARD: Mr. Wilczek!

(In elevator camera watches WILCZEK)

ELEVATOR: Going up. Second floor...Third floor...Fourth floor...

(JERRY enters building and shows badge to GUARD.)

GUARD: Can I help you?

JERRY: FBI

(WILCZEK enters control room and begins typing. Screen prints "System access granted.")

COMPUTER: Welcome back, Brad.

WILCZEK: (speaking as he types) You're not equipped with a voice synthesizer. What is my user level?

COMPUTER: That is now at the discretion of the Operating System.

(JERRY enters elevator.)

ELEVATOR: `Going up. (Counts up floors. At 16th floor WILCZEK notices.)

WILCZEK: What are you doing?

COMPUTER: Sorry. Those commands are not available at your current user level. Try again.

(24th floor. JERRY checks his gun.)

WILCZEK: What are you doing!

COMPUTER: What are you doing! (echo)

(WILCZEK tries to manually shut down system. Elevator sticks between 29 and 30, repeating the numbers very quickly, then stops. Doors open to solid wall.)

JERRY: Oh, man.

(Elevator camera focuses on JERRY.)

ELEVATOR: Going down.

(As elevator goes into free fall, JERRY falls to floor.)

WILCZEK: NO!! Don't do this!

(Elevator crashes to bottom. Screen goes blank. WILCZEK horrified.)

COMPUTER: Program executed.



SCENE 14
X-FILES OFFICE

(MULDER watching video of JERRY falling with the elevator and of WILCZEK watching. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: I heard about Jerry. I'm sorry.

MULDER: I don't think Wilczek did it.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: It doesn't make sense. Why would he go back to Eurisko?

SCULLY: To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks.

MULDER: If you were going to destroy evidence, would you pose for the cameras?

(Show SCULLY tape of WILCZEK. SCULLY turns off tape and kneels beside MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through a lot - - more than I think even you realize.

MULDER: I think Wilczek is smarter than this. (Turns on tape again.)

SCULLY: (after deep breath) He just signed a confession. How much proof do you need?



SCENE 15
WILCZEK'S HOUSE

(MULDER drives up to Wilczek's house. Several men in suits are in driveway.)

SUIT #1: Excuse me sir, this is a crime scene. You're going to have to leave.

MULDER: Yeah, I know. (Shows badge) I ordered the subpoena.

SUIT #1: That subpoena's been obviated.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SUIT #1: Unless you've got a code five clearance, I'm going to have to ask you to turn back.

(MULDER, obviously NOT having a code five clearance, gets back in his car and leaves.)



SCENE 16
PARK BENCH

(MULDER on park bench. DEEP THROAT arrives and MULDER rises to walk with him.)

MULDER: Thanks for coming.

DEEP THROAT: I'm here against my better judgement. In the future I must insist that you respect the terms of our arrangement.

MULDER: I need to know why Brad Wilczek is the subject of a code five investigation. What the Defense Department wants with him.

DEEP THROAT: What do you think they'd want with the most innovative programmer in this hemisphere?

MULDER: Software.

DEEP THROAT: For years, Wilczek has thumbed his nose at any contract involving weapons applications. He's a bleeding heart.

MULDER: What kind of software?

DEEP THROAT: How much do you know about artificial intelligence?

MULDER: I thought it was only theoretical.

DEEP THROAT: It was, until two years ago. You remember Helsinki, the first time that a chess playing computer ever beat a Grand Master? (MULDER nods.) That was Wilczek's program. And the rumor was that he did it by developing the first adaptive network.

MULDER: An adaptive network?

DEEP THROAT: It's a learning machine. A computer that actually thinks. And it's, ah, become something of a holy grail for some of our more acquisitive colleagues in the Department of Defense.



SCENE 17
FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER
WASHINGTON, D.C.

WILCZEK: They make me wear shoes all the time. What else do you want from me?

MULDER: I want you to tell me why you're willing to spend the rest of your life in prison for a crime you didn't commit.

WILCZEK: What are you talking about? I'm guilty.

MULDER: I know you're innocent. You're protecting a machine -- the Central Operating System at Eurisko.

WILCZEK: If I'm protecting anything, it's not the machine.

MULDER: Then what?

WILCZEK: After the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki - - Robert Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life regretting he'd ever glimpsed an atom.

MULDER: Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions but he never denied responsibility for them.

WILCZEK: He loved the work, Mr. Mulder. His mistake was in sharing it with an immoral government. I won't make the same mistake.

MULDER: But your machine killed Drake. And it killed my friend.

WILCZEK: I'm sorry about what happened. But there's nothing I can do.

MULDER: And you talk about morality. You're afraid of the government but you're willing to accept the risk that your machine will kill again.

WILCZEK: The lesser of two evils.

MULDER: What about a third option. You created that machine. Now you tell me how to destroy it.



SCENE 18
OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING

(MULDER and SCULLY walking outside the FBI building.)

MULDER: Wilczek can create a virus that will destroy the system.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't you see, blaming the machine is an alibi, and a bad one.

MULDER: But it's the only thing that makes sense. The COS project was posting big losses for Eurisko and Drake was about to terminate the program.

SCULLY: So the machine killed Drake out of self-defense?

MULDER: Self-preservation. It's the primary instinct of all sentient beings.

SCULLY: Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence is decades away from being realized.

MULDER: Then why was our government trying to usurp Wilczek's research?

SCULLY: (pulling him aside) Mulder, I think you're looking for something that isn't there. And I think it has something to do with Jerry. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea if you talked to someone.

MULDER: You're probably right. (Starts to leave.)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To talk to someone. (SCULLY watches him leave)



SCENE 19
FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER

(Guard opens door to WILCZEK's cell. MULDER enters, opens early 90's laptop, LOL)

MULDER: How much time do you need?



SCENE 20
SCULLY'S BEDROOM

SCULLY ASLEEP. CLOCK 1:31. Phone rings. SCULLY picks it up)

SCULLY: Hello?

(Modem sounds are heard over the phone. SCULLY hangs up and runs to her computer which is displaying her files.)

SCULLY: Oh my God. (Dials out on another line.) This is Special Agent Dana Scully, ID number 2317-616. I need you to run a quick trace on a number for me. Yeah, 202-555-6431. Yeah, that's my number. Somebody's accessing my computer.



SCENE 21
OUTSIDE EURISKO BUILDING
NIGHT

(MULDER opens his trunk, then turns to see SCULLY pulling up. License 3Y7-260)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here?

SCULLY: Someone or something's been scanning my computer files. Tapping my phones. I traced the line. It came from somewhere in there.

MULDER: It's the machine.

SCULLY: How can we get in?

MULDER: You remember the Trojan Horse? (Reaches in trunk and pulls out VA license plate EURISKO)

(MULDER and SCULLY in car at metal gate entrance to parking deck. Computer scans the EURISKO plate. Green light PASS, and gate slides up.)

MULDER: (grinning) Open, Sesame! (SCULLY is not amused.)

(Computer watches them drive forward. When they are directly under the gate, a red and white bar stops them.)

MULDER: Oh, what the - -

(They look up and see the gate with evil little spikes crashing down on top of the car.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Horn is blaring as MULDER and SCULLY crawl out the drivers side of the smashed car. Mechanic!Mulder opens the hood and pulls the plug on the horn.)

MULDER: So much for the element of surprise. What do you say we take the stairs? (Computer watches them cross the garage.)



SCENE 22
STAIRWELL

(MULDER and SCULLY in stairwell, SCULLY still in her heels - better woman than I)

MULDER: 28 down, one to go. (Lights go out)

SCULLY: Oh, great. Mulder?

(Long pause. MULDER shines flashlight at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Trick or treat.

(SCULLY sighs. Flashlight illuminates #29. Computer watches. SCULLY reaches for doorknob.)

MULDER: No! (stops her)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I don't want to make the same mistake Drake made. (Takes insulated screwdriver out of his bag. When he touches it to the lock, WHAMMMMO!!!! Huge flash, lots of sparks. SCULLY jumps back. Beeping sound starts. MULDER tries door. Still locked. He looks around and points at security camera.)

MULDER: (to camera) What are you looking at? (Camera POV as MULDER puts glove over the lens. MULDER takes flashlight and looks around, then up at a ceiling vent. Then looks down at SCULLY.)

(SCULLY, shoeless now, is boosted by MULDER into the vent.)

SCULLY: Unh....

MULDER: There should be a way for you to drop down and open the door.

(SCULLY crawls into air duct tunnel and goes left.)

MULDER: (waiting, to himself) Come on, Scully.

(SCULLY crawling around. Air begins to blow)

(Door beeps and buzzes.)

MULDER: Scully? (Door opens)

PETERSON: Agent Mulder? What are you doing here?

(SCULLY in increasingly windy duct. Has trouble crawling. Debris flying. She is blown backwards. Wheeeee!)

SCULLY: Ahhhhh!!!!!

(She grabs a corner, but slips. Is about to slide into a large spinning fan, but catches another corner. Accidentally drops flashlight which falls into fan knocking off a fan blade.)

(MULDER and PETERSON enter the COS control room.)

PETERSON: The machine's been acting all crazy. Power surges, shut off. That's why I'm here so late.

MULDER: Where's the B port?

PETERSON: Oh, it's right back here. (Opens console. MULDER gets tool out of his bag.) Look, are you sure you know what you're doing? Because if you don't, it's my job on the line.

(MULDER attaches electronic device to console. Screen reads Access Denied.)

MULDER: Damn.

(SCULLY in wind tunnel pulls out her gun and begins shooting at the fan. Two more blades down.)

(MULDER tries again. Screen reads Begin Algorithm Code Program.)

COMPUTER: System access granted. (MULDER claps his hands together and runs to keyboard.) User code level seven.

MULDER: Now I can put in the virus.

PETERSON: (aims a gun at MULDER) Not bad, Agent Mulder. You know, I've been trying to access the CPU for the past two years. Now please, take out your gun and remove the clip. (MULDER sighs, and obeys.) Careful.

MULDER: Defense Department?

PETERSON: Lets just say our paychecks are signed by the same person. Now give me the diskette and step away from the console. (MULDER doesn't move.) You don't want to test my resolve, Agent Mulder. (Mulder hands him diskette.)

(Very windblown SCULLY opens the door, pointing gun at PETERSON.)

SCULLY: (don't mess with me attitude) Put down the gun.

PETERSON: Look, you may think you know what you're dealing with -

SCULLY: Shut up and drop the gun.

PETERSON: (Setting down the gun) You're making a mistake, Agent Scully. Compromising your sworn duty. This operation is more sensitive than you can possibly imagine.

MULDER: Don't listen to him.

PETERSON: The technology in this machine is of enormous scientific interest.

MULDER: The machine's a monster, Scully. It's already killed two people. They won't be able to handle it any better than Wilczek did.

PETERSON: Make no mistake ..... *You* will be held accountable.

SCULLY: (after a pause) Mulder, put in the disc.

(MULDER puts in disc. Doesn't have to push enter or anything. Hmmm.)

COMPUTER: What are you doing, Brad? Don't do this, Brad. (Gibberish. Screen fills with gibberish also. Elevator doors open and close, cameras swing back and forth.) Brad....Brad....Why?

(MULDER and SCULLY look relieved. Light all come back on in building.)



SCENE 23
PARK

(Outside day on bench with Deep Throat)

MULDER: I checked with Congressman Klebanon and the Department of Corrections Subcommittee. I even petitioned the Attorney General's office.

DEEP THROAT: You won't find him.

MULDER: They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation.

DEEP THROAT: *They* can do anything they want.

MULDER: Where is he?

DEEP THROAT: In the middle of what we in the trade call "hard bargaining."

MULDER: Wilczek won't deal. He'll never work for them.

DEEP THROAT: Loss of freedom does funny things to a man, and remember, Wilczek confessed to two murders, and you effectively destroyed the only evidence that could have exonerated him.

MULDER: What else could I have done?

DEEP THROAT: Nothing... Unless you were willing to let the technology survive.

MULDER: The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?

DEEP THROAT: They've been on it for five days. Wilczek's virus was thorough. It left no trace of the artificial intelligence. The machine is dead. (DT rises and leaves)



SCENE 24
DOD LAB

PETERSON: (on phone) We've pushed the pulse code modulations to the limit. Nothing. (Techies carrying around pieces of computer) We've combed the parsing subroutine. Yes, sir. Twice. No, sir. Still nothing. But I'd like to request .... Yes, sir. No, I understand. Yes, sir. (hangs up) Well, six more hours before we have to consign the whole damn thing to the metal shredder.

TECH: We'll do what we can, sir.

(Behind PETERSON, light comes on, camera looks at PETERSON)

PETERSON: (Camera POV) I'm going to figure this thing out if it kills me.

SCENE 1
JET PROPULSION LABORATORY
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA
1977

70'S TV REPORTER: I'm here in pasadena with the nasa mission control team as they celebrate scientific history. The first close up photographic transmissions of mars from the viking observer spacecraft. Photos that have created something of a stir by revealing surprising geologic information: the presence of large amounts of water locked in mars' polar icecaps. Water that some speculate could have possibly sustained life on the planet. Even more controversial is one image of a land formation: a formation that looks like a sculpted human face. However nasa officials are denying it as an indication of an alien civilization.

Cut to interview w/ LT COL MARCUS AURELIUS BELT - Viking Orbiter Project Director

70'S BELT: No, it's nothing more than a trick of light and shadows, a geologic anomaly. I'm afraid the only sculptors at work are the solar winds that blow across the surface of Mars at 300 miles an hour ten months a year.

(Present day - Belt's apartment. Close up of Mars face picture, Belt's keys land on it. Belt gets ready for bed. Belt asleep in bed in very fashionable burgundy PJs. Dream memory, Belt on EVA in space.)

YOUNG BELT IN SPACE: I'm seeing......I've got......

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(Present Day Belt waking in bed. Mars face appears in ceiling over him, then comes at Belt.....AAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!

SCENE 4
WASHINGTON DC
TWO WEEKS LATER

(Mulder and Scully BOTH(?!) eating sunflower seeds outside on steps of building)

SCULLY: What did the note say?

MULDER: Just that they worked for NASA. (Hands over note.) They wanted to talk to somebody from the FBI.

SCULLY: Why the cloak and dagger routine?

MULDER: I have no idea.

SCULLY: Think it's a crank?

MULDER: It's beginning to look that way.

(Michelle walks past them, then turns and comes back looking very incognito)

MICHELLE: My name is Michelle Generoo. (Shakes Mulder's hand)

MULDER:	Fox Mulder...

MICHELLE: I sent you the note. (shakes Scully's hand)

SCULLY: Hi. Special Agent Dana Scully.

MICHELL:	I'm sorry to have to take these precautions. I flew up from Houston this morning. I work at the Space Center there.

MULDER:	In what capacity?

MICHELL:	I'm the Mission Control Communications Commander for the Space Shuttle Program.

SCULLY: What brings you to Washington?

MICHELLE: I have reason to believe there may be a saboteur at work inside NASA.

MULDER:	Do you have evidence of sabotage?

MICHELLE: I don't know. I may. Two weeks ago, a shuttle mission was scrubbed three seconds before lift off when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned. If the flight had not been aborted, there was a great chance the liquid fuel system and the Orbiter would have exploded on the launch pad. This was sent to me in the mail. (Opens briefcase and removes pictures) It's a material analysis that shows deep grooved scoring marks inside this APU valve. Marks that could have caused a malfunction.

MULDER: Evidence of tampering?

MICHELLE: That's what it looks like, but.. according to the person who gave me your names you have expertise in unexplained phenomena, and what's unexplainable is how and when anybody could have done it.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

MICHELLE: The valve is made of ferrocarbon Titanium. To score, that material would take extreme temperatures : launch pad temperatures. If anyone at NASA were to take a look at that analysis, they would say that it would be impossible for anyone to do that type of damage undetected.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea who may have sent that to you?

MICHELLE: No. No idea. But I can tell you that the official analysis of the malfunction was simple mechanical failure.

MULDER:	Does anybody share your suspicions?

MICHELLE: If they do, they're not talking to the FBI. I believe in the space program. I believe in the people who run it, but there's another launch window tomorrow and my reasons may sound selfish, but my fiancee is a shuttle commander on that mission.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other)



SCENE 5
HOUSTON SPACE CENTER
NEXT DAY

(Mulder and Scully riding through the halls on one of those airport golf cart things)

SCULLY: Why would somebody want to sabotage the Space Shuttle?

MULDER: Well, if you were a terrorist, there probably isn't a more potent symbol of American progress and prosperity. And if you're an opponent of big science, NASA itself represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible and debate of the democratic process. And of course there are those futurists who believe the Space Shuttle is a rusty old bucket that should be mothballed. A dinosaur spacecraft built in the 70's by scientists setting their sights on space in an ever declining scale.

SCULLY: And we thought we could rest easy with the fall of the Soviet Union.

MULDER: Not to mention certain fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage. The failure of the Hubble Telescope and the Mars Observer are directly connected to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.

SCULLY: Evidence of what?

MULDER: Alien civilizations.

SCULLY: Oh, of course.

(Digital clock on wall counting down - 10:45:27...26...25)
(Mulder and Scully walking down corridor with guide, Mulder looking at framed posters)

MULDER: Wow, look at that  Gemini 8.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Well, the man we're gonna see? Col Marcus Aurelius Belt nearly died on that mission. Had to make an emergency landing right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

SCULLY: You remember all that stuff?

MULDER: You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, Scully?

SCULLY: Guess I missed that phase. (ANOTHER CLOCK ON WALL 10:39:40...39...38...37)

(Knock on door with Belt's nameplate)

BELT: (Inside) Come in. (They open door)

SCULLY: Col. Belt, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. (Shakes Belt's hand as he rises and puts on jacket) And this is...

MULDER: Col. Belt. Fox Mulder. (Extends hand) I'm a big fan. It's an honor to meet you. Y-you were a big hero to me when I was a kid.

BELT: Thank you.

MULDER: I-I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.

BELT: (uncomfortable) Well, now it's like a stroll around the block. So... how can I help you? (They all sit, Mulder shifting around, obviously excited in presence of his hero)

SCULLY:	This found its way to the FBI. (hands Belt picture that Michelle gave them) Do you recognize it?

BELT: Sure, it's an auxiliary power unit valve. (Hands picture back)

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to believe that the damage done to it was in an effort to sabotage the Space Shuttle Program?

BELT: No.

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to suspect sabotage at all?

BELT: No reason whatsoever. And if you have any respect for this program and for the people who have devoted their lives to it, you'll be careful to whom you make those accusations. (Mulder very uncomfortable)

SCULLY: Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted?

BELT: Look, I don't know where you got this specious artifact, but I can assure you every precaution has been taken to rectify the problem. We've been waiting two weeks for a window to initiate this mission. We've got a payload to deliver.

SCULLY: Col. Belt, has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter?

BELT: The part you have here, has been installed, inspected, and designed by over 100 highly trained technicians. With the security measures we take, it would be virtually impossible for one man working by himself, or two or four men, to do what you are suggesting. I can assure you there isn't a person in this facility that doesn't want to see that shuttle go into space, complete its mission, and come back like winged victory herself. And in about ten hours, God willing, you're gonna see just that.

MULDER: (grinning, as they rise) Do you think there would be a problem with us watching lift off from Mission Control?

BELT: Well, being that you'd probably go over my head anyway, please, be my guest.

MULDER: (Shaking hands again, still in awe) It was an honor, sir.

SCULLY: (Shaking hands) Thank you. (Follows Mulder out the door) Didn't you want to get his autograph?

(Mulder and Scully with some tech guy in some technical mechanical place)

TECHMECH GUY:	Where did you say you got this? (Looking at picture)

SCULLY: It came to us anonymously.

TECHMECH GUY:	Well this is an APU valve all right, but this doesn't make sense.

SCULLY: What doesn't make sense?

TECHMECH GUY:	This scoring here. This valve is made out of ferrocarbon titanium. Its -

MULDER: You didn't order the analysis?

TECHMECH GUY:	No, I've never seen this before. But we're on outside contract to NASA. They may have ordered it.

MULDER: But as a matter of course wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?

TECHMECH GUY:	Every shuttle has flown with that same APU valve. We haven't had a problem. To do an analysis and redesign would delay the program for months, not to mention the cost.

SCULLY: Is it conceivable that in order to avoid these delays, the program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution?

TECHMECH GUY:	Look, there are about 17000 things that can go wrong with the shuttle, and about 17000 people who make sure they don't.

(Another digital clock - 8:43:40...39...38...37 See Belt standing above them on balcony listening)

SCULLY: And who makes the final determination as to its safety?

TECHMECH GUY:	Oh we make a recommendation, but ultimately, the decision is Col Belt's. (Belt leaves)

MULDER AND SCULLY: Thank you. (They start up stairs to balcony)

SCULLY: (Quietly) What do you think?

MULDER: I can't believe how much faith we put in machines.

SCULLY: You think Col Belt knows more than he's saying? That he lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?

MULDER: I can't believe that Col Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts knowing that something might go wrong. He was an astronaut himself.

SCULLY: So you think this x-ray is bogus?

MULDER: God, I hope so.

(NASA footage of launch in progress.)



SCENE 6
SHUTTLE LAUNCH CONTROL

SHUTTLE LAUNCH CONTROL:	This is Shuttle Launch Control with T minus one minute 40 seconds and counting.

FLORIDA MISSION CONTROL:	OTC is go for orbiter access arm retract.

??????: OTC, OVCC verified.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, OVCC verified.

BELT: (With Michelle at Houston Mission Control) Here we go.

SHUTTLE LC: This is Shuttle Launch Control with T minus one minute 30 and counting.

SHUTTLE: Copy purge sequence. Main engine check.

OTC: Switching off Orbiter's ground supply. On board fuel cells check.

SHUTTLE: Roger, OTC.

HOUSTON: Pick up terminal sequence, MPS.

SHUTTLE: Copy that. OTC to CDR, how do you read?

FLORIDA MC: Loud and clear.

SHUTTLE: CDR Houston, how do you read?

MICHELLE: Loud and clear.

FLORIDA MC: Side hatch close out and white room configuration complete. Retracting Orbiter arm. All systems go for APU start.

SHUTTLE: Go with APU start.

FLORIDA MC: PBSR power down and ready for launch. Transfer to internal power.

SHUTTLE: Transfer to internal power.

FLORIDA MC: Gimbaling of main engines complete. Aero surfaces in launch position.

HOUSTON: MPDR assembled. Military recorder is running.

SHUTTLE: Roger that.

FLORIDA MC: Go for auto sequence start. Booster hydraulic units have started. Go for main engine start. (Mulder and Scully and everybody else look really nervous)

SHUTTLE LC: T minus ten and counting. 9...8...7...6...5...4...3...2...1...zero. Ignition. We have lift off of the shuttle Orbiter. (Lots of cheers and clapping)

FLORIDA MC: CDR Houston, bet y'all have never seen a more beautiful sight.

MICHELLE: Roger that, 10-4.

FLORIDA MC: Roger. Back to you. Lower throttle back. Main engine at 65%.

(Michelle and Mulder give each other thumbs up.)

FLORIDA MC: Roger. Throttle at 110%.

SHUTTLE: Go for SRB separation.

FLORIDA MC: Roger OTC.



SCENE 7

(Mulder and Scully walking corridor of NICE hotel.)

MULDER: I have to admit, that fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies.

SCULLY: Yeah, it ranks right up there with getting a pony and learning how to braid my own hair.

MULDER: Come on, Scully. You have to admit that was exciting. Mission control....(playfully punches her arm)....countdown.

MICHELLE: (Running up behind them) Mulder!! Wait! Something's gone wrong.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: Something's wrong with the shuttle. We had some trouble with the solid rocket boosters, but we were able to fix it. We changed watch, I went home to try to get some sleep. I got a phone call twenty minutes ago. Communication with the shuttle had gone down. Come on. We've got to get back to Houston.



SCENE 8
WET ROAD

(Michelle's car followed by Mulder and Scully's car on wet two lane road. Scully tries to get radio station - all static)

MULDER: They have a press blackout in effect. Chances are, the media doesn't know about it.

SCULLY: Do you think this is sabotage?

MULDER: I don't know. Things go wrong all the time.

SCULLY: Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?

MULDER: Usually.

SCULLY: She's turning.

(Michelle driving. Mars face comes out of the rain and fog and .....AAAAGGGGHHHH!!! Michelle gets run off the road and car flips over.
(Mulder and Scully pull up behind overturned car and get out.)

MULDER: Michelle! I can see her.

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: Heeelllp!

MULDER: Kneeling at passenger side of overturned car) You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm stuck!

SCULLY: Can you move?

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here. I'm wedged in! (Mulder and Scully run around to driver's side of car - duuhh)

MULDER: You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm wedged in! (Mulder reaches in)

MULDER: C'mere. Can you push with your legs?

SCULLY: Be careful.

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here!

MULDER: Okay, all right. Come on. Okay. Come on Okay. (Pulls Michelle out)

SCULLY: It's okay. Now don't try to move.

MICHELLE: Oh, I got to get back to Houston.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: I don't know. Something came at me in the fog, and the next thing I knew I was upside down.

SCULLY: Was it some kind of an animal?

MICHELLE: No. It had a face. It was... it was grotesque. I don't know what it was. (Mulder helps her stand, arms around her)

SCULLY: You okay?

MICHELLE: Yeah.



SCENE 9
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL ROOM

HOUSTON TECH: Orbiter, this is Houston. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Your transmission is breaking up, Houston. (Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter)

MICHELLE: What's happening?

HOUSTON TECH: We have a malf in the OMS and RCF systems. They can't get the Orbiter into attitude rotation. Temperature in the cabin is approaching 103 degrees and they have downlink transmission problems... what happened to you?

MICHELLE: I had an accident. What's their position?

HOUSTON: Just over Eastern Africa.

MICHELLE: Try patching them into the Saychelles Tracking Station. (On headset) Hang in there OTC.

MULDER:	(explaining to Scully for our benefit) The Orbiter maneuvering system has malfunctioned. Without it they can't rotate the shuttle. They need to rotate it away from the sun to keep the Orbiter cool.

HOUSTON TECH: We've got a drop in cabin pressure, 21 kilopascals and declining.

MICHELLE: They're going to burn up.

MULDER: Where's Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: He's on his way.

MICHELLE: Damn it! What happened when they went to back up?

HOUSTON TECH: Back up system failed to respond.

MICHELLE: Well, what about telemetry? Can we auto-activate their systems from down here?

HOUSTON TECH: We cannot auto-activate! It's like someone's interfering with the telemetry, screwing with the uplink communications from this end.

MICHELLE: Can you trace it?

HOUSTON TECH: It'd have to be a digital processor.

MICHELLE: They'd have to be in the data banks.

MULDER: Where's that?

MICHELLE: Come on. (Mulder and Scully fling their trenchcoats on a console counter and follow Michelle up and out of the room)



SCENE 10
DATA BANK ROOM

Mulder and Scully, guns drawn, with Michelle between them. Figure runs behind Mulder. A second later, lights go out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Emergency lights on. Mulder sees someone in corner)

MULDER: I'm a federal agent. Come on out of there. (Scully and Michelle join Mulder. Computer Tech Geek with Glasses comes out of the corner) What are you doing in here?

CTGG: I work here.

MICHELLE: (Checking him) Let me see your clearance.

CTGG: A sensor went off. There was a malfunction in one of the telemetry processors.

MICHELLE: Did you find it?

CTGG: No.

MULDER: Did you see anybody else in here? (CTGG shakes his head, lights come back on) Okay, call security. I want a search of the premises. I don't want anybody coming in or out of this building who doesn't have proper clearance.



SCENE 11
MISSION CONTROL ROOM

SHUTTLE: .....rotation maneuver.

HOUSTON: I'm breaking up, OTC.

BELT: What's the attitude of the Orbiter?

HOUSTON TECH: They're flying tail first sir, with their belly toward the sun.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Their flash evaporator system is working, but it's not enough to cool them down.

HOUSTON TECH: Cabin temperature climbing to 116.

BELT: Where's - - - (Michelle, Mulder and Scully enter)

MICHELLE: Somebody's jamming our transmissions.

BELT: Who do you mean?

MICHELLE: Somebody or something is interfering with our ground communications and scrambling our uplink telemetry. The shuttle is not responding to override signals.

BELT: I'm going to let them fly by wire. I'm cutting off telemetry.

MICHELLE: It might not work. We might lose contact for good.

BELT: We have to give it a chance to work.

MICHELLE: We have to try to bring them down.

BELT: We have to give them control of the ship, take a chance they'll be able to perform that rotation maneuver and deliver their payload.

MICHELLE: What if they can't? We could be stranding them up there.

BELT: (Pause) Abandon telemetry. Go to fly by wire mode.

MULDER: (Explaining to Scully) They're cutting off ground control to the Orbiter. The astronauts will be flying the shuttle all by themselves.

SCULLY: Is it going to work? (Mulder looks doubtful)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. How's the weather up there?

SHUTTLE: Sunny and warm Houston. What's the forecast?

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to fly by wire mode. We're going to abort ground control momentarily to see if you can bring those systems back up.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston. And leave the driving to us.

MICHELLE: David... you take care. (Transmission broken)

SCULLY: What just happened? (Wake up, Scully)

MULDER: They cut off contact with the shuttle. (Everyone waits. Very tense)

MICHELLE: 45 seconds. If they were able to execute they'd have done it by now.

BELT: Standing by.

MICHELLE: 60 seconds.

BELT: Go to reestablish uplink communication.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Video signal's failed on them.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Do you copy? (Pause) OTC , this is Houston. Where are you?

SHUTTLE: Howdy-do, Houston. Looks like we finally got this bird to fly right. (Everyone claps and smiles, even Scully!)

MICHELLE: OTC, do you hear that?

SHUTTLE: Music to our ears.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Cabin temperature stabilizing.

BELT: OTC, this is Mark Belt in Houston. How's the crew holding up?

SHUTTLE: They're looking good, sir.

BELT: Y'all get some rest. We'll get back to work at about 0700.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston.

BELT: Let's get to work on that telemetry problem. We got a big day ahead of us.

(Belt washes his face.)



SCENE 12
NASA PRESS CONFERENCE

Belt at podium, Mulder, Scully and Michelle watch from side)

BELT: I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll get to them.

SCULLY: (to Michelle) How did he know what he did was going to work?

MICHELLE: He didn't. They could have died up there and there would have been nothing we could have done. They'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit.

SCULLY: Why would he take that risk?

MICHELLE: Bring those men back without delivering that payload? You're talking millions of wasted dollars. That's all Congress would need to shut down NASA.

BELT: As of 2200 hours, the crew has been conducting onboard tests and tasks and resting up for their first full day in space tomorrow. I'm happy to say after a beautiful night launch the Shuttle Orbiter has performed magnificently. (Michelle leaves in disgust)

SCULLY: So much for your boyhood hero.

(Mulder following Belt down hallway)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt? Can I talk to you for a moment?

BELT: You want to know why I lied to them. You're asking yourself if this means I'd lie to you. (Mulder nods) You know what it means to be an astronaut, sir? You risk your life every time you get into your spacecraft for nothing more than the good progress of mankind.

MULDER: You've got no argument from me, sir. You're true American heroes.

BELT: Heroes? We used to make headlines when we did our job right. Now they bury them in the back of the paper. Name me two astronauts on the last shuttle mission. (Mulder can't) You make the front page today only if you screw up. They only know your name if you're the unlucky SOB sitting on 500 tons of dynamite. That's what they're really waiting for. (Starts to go)

MULDER: Sir, I have to ask. I'm sorry, it's my job. Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle?

BELT: My answer to you sir, will be to bring those men back safely to earth.



SCENE 13
BELT'S APARTMENT

Belt enters, gets vodka out of the freezer, drinks it out of the bottle, lies down on bed and has another EVA memory dream.)

YOUNG BELT: My God!

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(See present day Belt awake on bed, his face morphing into Mars face. White ghostly thing pulls out of Belt and floats out the window and up into space. Belt sits frozen, hand outstretched.)



SCENE 14
SHUTTLE ORBITER
PASSING OVER CANADA

SHUTTLE: Uh, Houston, we just heard something weird up here.



SCENE 15
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL

HOUSTON TECH: OTC, Houston. Can you describe it?

SHUTTLE: Sort of a dull thump, like something bumped the ship. Got any ideas about that? (banging sound) There it is again.

(Computer Tech Geek with Glasses runs for the stairs and up to data room where Mulder, Scully, Michelle and techs are dissecting machines)

CTGG: (quietly to Michelle) They've got an oxygen leak on board the Orbiter.

SHUTTLE: Our O2 gauges are going all screwy, Houston.

HOUSTON TECH: (To Michelle, Mulder and Scully entering Mission Control) We got problems. We've got an O2 leak in the main tank.

MICHELLE: What did they say happened?

HOUSTON TECH: They don't know. They just said it was a thump.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: (On head set) Stand by. We have an astronomer in Winnipeg who just spotted a gaseous cloud about a mile long trailing in our orbit.

MULDER: (To Scully) That's the liquid O2 leaking out into space. The exact same thing happened to Col. Belt on an Apollo mission.

MICHELLE: How much time do they have?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Well, that's hard to know without accurate telemetry data. I'll do the calculations, but it will just be a guesstimate.

MICHELLE: I need some answers, and where is Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: We can't find him and he was due here 90 minutes ago to begin payload deployment.

SHUTTLE:	Uh, Houston? We're up here kind of wondering when we have to start holding our breath.

MICHELLE: We're working on it OTC. I need those calculations and I need a worst case scenario.

HOUSTON TECH: We don't know if one or both of the O2 tanks are damaged.

MICHELLE: Worst case scenario! And then I want someone to find Col. Belt.

MULDER: We'll find Col. Belt.

HOUSTON TECH: They've got thirty minutes of back up oxygen. Beyond that, it's anybody's guess.



SCENE 16
HALLWAY

(Mulder and Scully walking down hall)

SCULLY: Why does she need Belt?

MULDER: She doesn't know how serious the leak is.

SCULLY: It's an oxygen leak. Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen.

MULDER: Col. Belt's been up there in the same situation before. He'll know better than anybody else what to do. He's got to make the decisions.

SCULLY: Where the hell is he?

(Mulder and Scully knocking at Belt's door.)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt!

SCULLY: I'm going to go get security.

(Belt opens door)

MULDER: Col. Belt. Are you all right?

BELT: Yeah. I wasn't feeling well.

MULDER: They need you down at Mission Control, sir. There's been another accident.



SCENE 17
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL

MICHELLE: OTC, is your orbital maneuvering system still operational?

(Belt, Mulder, and Scully enter)

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're ready for reentry. Just say the word.

BELT: How bad's the leak?

MICHELLE: We have no way to determine.

BELT: OTC, What's the condensation, cabin.

SHUTTLE: Windows are getting a little steamy.

MICHELLE: Carbon dioxide buildup.

BELT: Okay, OTC. Everything's going to be fine. I want you to get in your spacesuits and depressurize your cabin, and then I want you to vent that CO2.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. And then what? (Michelle and Houston Tech look worried)

BELT: I want you to stay in your suits. And then I want you to prepare to use your emergency oxygen systems. And then I want you...to...deliver your payload.

MICHELLE: Those are men up there.

BELT: You're out of line. You want to tell me how to do my job? I've been up there in that situation, Miss Generoo. There's more at risk here than your personal life. And if you can't accept that or operate effectively in the circumstances then maybe you'd better leave the decisions to people in this room who can. (Michelle leaves. Scully follows) OTC, do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're waiting on those O2 calculations. (Mulder leaves)



SCENE 18
HALLWAY

(Mulder and Scully follow a crying Michelle down the hall)

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: They're going to die.

MULDER: You don't know that.

MICHELLE: It's absolutely unconscionable putting that payload before those men's lives.

SCULLY: I think she's right, Mulder. You saw him in there. He's losing it.

MULDER: He saved their lives earlier.

SCULLY: Did he? Or did he put their lives in unnecessary jeopardy? If he can't deliver that payload, Congress is going to kill the Space Program.

MULDER: And you think killing those astronauts isn't going to have the same effect?

SCULLY: Look, Mulder. I think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle because too many things have gone wrong. I think Col. Belt knows about it and he's known about it from the beginning.

MICHELLE: We have to stop him. We've got to pull them out of orbit. (Tries to go, Mulder grabs her and doesn't stop touching her for the rest of the scene. What is up with that?! She's engaged)

MULDER: He doesn't want those men to die.

MICHELLE: How do you know?

MULDER: I know it. I'm sure of it.

MICHELLE: He's the one who put them up there.

MULDER: And he may be the only person who can get them down alive. Now how can you be certain that what he's doing isn't the right thing? That what he's doing isn't going to save their lives? Now I need access to you records... in a hurry. (Michelle leads them off)



SCENE 19
COMPUTER ROOM

MULDER: (at computer with Computer Tech Geek with Glasses) I need everything on the Hubble Telescope, the Mars Observer, the Shuttle Challenger, and the current Orbiter mission.

CTGG: You're talking about tens of thousands of documents.

SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for?

MULDER: X-rays, diagrams, schematics - - any proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.

SCULLY:	A needle in a haystack.

(Mulder and Scully going through files. Mulder opens the Challenger file to picture of the O ring)



SCENE 20
MISSION CONTROL

SHUTTLE: Payload deployment initiated.

HOUSTON: Roger that, OTC. Tracking it now. (Footage of something coming out of shuttle)

SHUTTLE: Looks good from here. Payload delivery is complete, Houston. We're awaiting your order.

BELT: System check for reentry deorbit burn.

SHUTTLE: Holy God! There's something outside the ship! There's someone outside the ship!

BELT: Can you repeat that, OTC?

SHUTTLE: There's some kind of .... ghost outside the ship!

BELT: (losing it) No. Nono. NonoononooooooooooOOOOOOO!!!!



SCENE 21
FILE ROOM

SCULLY: Mulder, I found it. This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle...ordered by Col. Belt. Which means he knew about the faulty valve.

MULDER: This is from the Challenger. It's the O ring fitting that failed dated January 21, 1986. That's one week before the space shuttle blew up. And the analysis was ordered by Col. Belt.

SCULLY: Are you saying he might have known about the Challenger defect?

MULDER: Something weird is going on here, Scully.

MICHELLE: (at door) Col. Belt's collapsed.

MULDER: Where is he?

MICHELLE: He's in his office. (they follow her out, Mulder's hand back where it belongs on Scully's lower back)



SCENE 22
BELT'S OFFICE

Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter )

MICHELLE: He was just here.

(They find Belt crying under his desk)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MICHELLE: What's wrong with him?

MULDER: Get a doctor.

BELT: Help me. Help me.

MULDER: How can we help you, Col.?

SCULLY: He's having some kind of a seizure, Mulder.

MICHELLE: (leading EMTs in)Come on! Come on, come on!

BELT: It hurts! It's tearing me apart!

EMT1: See if I can get a bus. (They walk him to stretcher)

MICHELLE: I'm bringing that shuttle down.

BELT: Nooooo! It's out there.

EMT1: Easy, easy.

BELT: Spacesuits!

MULDER: Strap him down.

SCULLY: (Suddenly remembering 7 years of med school) Give him 10 milligrams of Diazepam.

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: He's going to hurt himself, Mulder.

MULDER: He's trying to tell us something. Col. Belt.

MICHELLE: Those men are up there and they're running out of oxygen.

BELT: They don't have to die.

MULDER: (Holding up his finger) Col. Belt, I want you to focus. Focus your breathing. Focus your pain. (Oh, this scene is bad) Right here.

EMT1: Blood pressure is 174 over 120.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're risking an anuerysm.

MULDER: Focus. (Belt calms) Now you're focused. Right here. Now you're going to save those astronauts and you're going to tell me how to do it.

BELT: The shuttle can't survive reentry.

MICHELLE: No, he's lying.

MULDER: How do you know it can't survive?

BELT: The fuselage...the fuselage is damaged. The silicone tiles are destroyed.

MICHELLE: How does he know?

MULDER: How has it been damaged?

BELT: I'm responsible.

MULDER: Did you sabotage the shuttle?

BELT: No, but I couldn't stop them. Nobody can stop them.

MULDER: Stop who?

EMT1: Pulse is 194.

SCULLY: You're going to kill him, Mulder.

MULDER: Stop who?

BELT: They don't want us to know. They don't want us to know.

MULDER: Who?

BELT: It came to me. It lives in me. (EVA flashback)

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me. It's coming at me! Get me out of here! (Ghost thing invades Young Belt's body) It's attacking me! Get me out! (Back to present)

BELT: Get it out. Help me. It's coming back. (Belt's face morphs into Mars face)

MICHELLE: That's the face I saw in the fog.

EMT1: We're losing him. Defib.

EMT2: (Handing padddles) Here you go.

EMT1: Clear.

EMT2: Hit it.

HOUSTON TECH: (in door) We've just run out of oxygen. They've got exactly thirty minutes left in the emergency backup system.

MICHELLE: They're going to suffocate up there. I've got no choice but to bring them down. It's the only chance I've got. (Michelle and Houston Tech leave)

EMT1: Again.

EMT2: Okay, we got O2 standing by. (Giving O2)

EMT1: Hold on. We've got vitals. We've got a pulse.

SCULLY: We've got to get him to a hospital.



SCENE 23
MISSION CONTROL

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston Mission Control. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE:	Roger, Houston. We've got some spooky stuff up here.

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to bring you down. We want you to instigate deorbit burn, and begin deceleration.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. Kind of hoping you were going to say that. Activating OMS rockets. All systems go for reentry.



SCENE 24
HALLWAY

(Belt on gurney down hallway)

MULDER:	They're bringing the shuttle down. You said the shuttle would burn up on reentry. Is there anything we can do to save it?

BELT: Change the trajectory.

MULDER: Change the trajectory to what?

BELT: Change the reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. (Mulder and Scully run off)



SCENE 25
Mission Control

MISSION CONTROL:	T minus 35 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: (running in) You've to change the reentry trajectory.

MICHELLE: What?

MULDER: You've got to change it to 35 degrees.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 30 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: Col. Belt- - -

MICHELLE: I can't.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 25 seconds.

MULDER: It's your only shot.

MICHELLE: We...we...we'd have to change the landing site, we'd have to inform them before the blackout.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: 15 seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: I want to know what the weather conditions are in Albuquerque. Are we go for an emergency landing?

HOUSTON TECH: Weather in Albuquerque? Landing conditions go in Albuquerque.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus five seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. I want you to change your reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. You'll be landing at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque. Do you copy?

HOUSTON TECH: Ionosphere reentry. Temporary blackout in effect.

MICHELLE: Did they get that transmission?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Two minutes to reestablish.

MICHELLE: Damn it. (Red clock reads 16:26:01...2...3) How much oxygen do we have?

HOUSTON TECH: 16 minutes.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:15...16...17) OTC, this is Houston. Come in OTC. Anything? (Curly shakes head) What's the point of their new reentry?

HOUSTON TECH: 500 miles west of Hawaii.

MICHELLE: See if Hawaii can get me - -

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Hawaii's picked the shuttle up on radar.

SCULLY: They made it.

HOUSTON TECH: Not necessarily.



SCENE 26
KIRTLAND AIR BASE
ALBEQUERQUE, NM

CURLY HOUSTON: Albuquerque, do you have radar confirmation?

ALBUQUERQUE: Negative, Houston. Nothing on the screen.



SCENE 27
MISSION CONTROL

(Clock - 16:26:43...44...45...46)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:53...54...55) OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC.

SHUTTLE:	Houston, this is OTC. You know a good place to eat in Albuquerque?

(Big grin and laugh from...Scully? Everybody happy. Mulder and Michelle big hug.)

HOUSTON TECH: OTC, welcome home. Welcome home, OTC. You're looking real good.

SOME GUY: Yes!



SCENE 28
PRESS CONFERENCE

Michelle at press conference on TV)

MICHELLE: The Space Shuttle touched down today at 10:56 Central Standard Time. The Orbiter delivered it's payload after just thirteen orbits and returned to Earth...without incident. (Belt is watching the TV. He is hooked to machines in hospital) We at NASA are looking forward to our next shuttle mission and to future successful explorations of space, for mankind, and the future of mankind.

(Belt's machines beep wildly, his face does the Mars morph, he rips off, the tubes, fights with the ghost, yells noa few times, and flings himself through the glass window. Alternating images of him on EVA in space and of the street intersection below coming rapidly closer. AAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!)



SCENE 29
X-FILES OFFICE
WASHINGTON, DC

(Mulder reads obituary Former Astronaut Space Program Plunges to Death. Scully enters)

SCULLY: I just heard.

MULDER: Something had possessed him. Something he must have seen out there in space.

SCULLY: The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia.

MULDER: I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him or that he ever knew...that he was...responsible for his own actions.

SCULLY: He ordered those x-rays of the damaged parts.

MULDER: You saw what I saw, Scully. I think he was trying to warn her. I think that he sent Michelle those x-rays like he was trying to reach out to her without quite knowing why, as if...his own instinctual impulse was to save those men.

SCULLY: While simultaneously trying to kill them?

MULDER: Hey, Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe, and we don't even know what's behind them. I think what ever it was, he took it with him. And in the end that was the only way he knew how to stop it.

SCULLY: There's an investigation, you know. They haven't ruled out foul play.

MULDER: He gave his own life. As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to do.



SCENE 30
MILITARY FUNERAL

Mulder and Scully have really good seats)

MINISTER: ...for Col. Marcus Aurelius Belt devoted his life to the exploration and understanding of Space, learning its mysteries and experiencing it not just for himself, but for humanity. Lord, take this man's soul and let it rise up to your heavens, higher than he could ever go as a man. Let him know the true nature of the universe that he sought to learn.

(Michelle and her fiancee watch planes fly over. Michelle and Mulder have a shared look and nod. Close up of flag on coffin.)

SCENE 1
JET PROPULSION LABORATORY
PASADENA, CALIFORNIA
1977

70'S TV REPORTER: I'm here in pasadena with the nasa mission control team as they celebrate scientific history. The first close up photographic transmissions of mars from the viking observer spacecraft. Photos that have created something of a stir by revealing surprising geologic information: the presence of large amounts of water locked in mars' polar icecaps. Water that some speculate could have possibly sustained life on the planet. Even more controversial is one image of a land formation: a formation that looks like a sculpted human face. However nasa officials are denying it as an indication of an alien civilization.

Cut to interview w/ LT COL MARCUS AURELIUS BELT - Viking Orbiter Project Director

70'S BELT: No, it's nothing more than a trick of light and shadows, a geologic anomaly. I'm afraid the only sculptors at work are the solar winds that blow across the surface of Mars at 300 miles an hour ten months a year.

(Present day - Belt's apartment. Close up of Mars face picture, Belt's keys land on it. Belt gets ready for bed. Belt asleep in bed in very fashionable burgundy PJs. Dream memory, Belt on EVA in space.)

YOUNG BELT IN SPACE: I'm seeing......I've got......

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(Present Day Belt waking in bed. Mars face appears in ceiling over him, then comes at Belt.....AAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!

SCENE 4
WASHINGTON DC
TWO WEEKS LATER

(Mulder and Scully BOTH(?!) eating sunflower seeds outside on steps of building)

SCULLY: What did the note say?

MULDER: Just that they worked for NASA. (Hands over note.) They wanted to talk to somebody from the FBI.

SCULLY: Why the cloak and dagger routine?

MULDER: I have no idea.

SCULLY: Think it's a crank?

MULDER: It's beginning to look that way.

(Michelle walks past them, then turns and comes back looking very incognito)

MICHELLE: My name is Michelle Generoo. (Shakes Mulder's hand)

MULDER:	Fox Mulder...

MICHELLE: I sent you the note. (shakes Scully's hand)

SCULLY: Hi. Special Agent Dana Scully.

MICHELL:	I'm sorry to have to take these precautions. I flew up from Houston this morning. I work at the Space Center there.

MULDER:	In what capacity?

MICHELL:	I'm the Mission Control Communications Commander for the Space Shuttle Program.

SCULLY: What brings you to Washington?

MICHELLE: I have reason to believe there may be a saboteur at work inside NASA.

MULDER:	Do you have evidence of sabotage?

MICHELLE: I don't know. I may. Two weeks ago, a shuttle mission was scrubbed three seconds before lift off when an auxiliary power unit valve malfunctioned. If the flight had not been aborted, there was a great chance the liquid fuel system and the Orbiter would have exploded on the launch pad. This was sent to me in the mail. (Opens briefcase and removes pictures) It's a material analysis that shows deep grooved scoring marks inside this APU valve. Marks that could have caused a malfunction.

MULDER: Evidence of tampering?

MICHELLE: That's what it looks like, but.. according to the person who gave me your names you have expertise in unexplained phenomena, and what's unexplainable is how and when anybody could have done it.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

MICHELLE: The valve is made of ferrocarbon Titanium. To score, that material would take extreme temperatures : launch pad temperatures. If anyone at NASA were to take a look at that analysis, they would say that it would be impossible for anyone to do that type of damage undetected.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea who may have sent that to you?

MICHELLE: No. No idea. But I can tell you that the official analysis of the malfunction was simple mechanical failure.

MULDER:	Does anybody share your suspicions?

MICHELLE: If they do, they're not talking to the FBI. I believe in the space program. I believe in the people who run it, but there's another launch window tomorrow and my reasons may sound selfish, but my fiancee is a shuttle commander on that mission.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other)



SCENE 5
HOUSTON SPACE CENTER
NEXT DAY

(Mulder and Scully riding through the halls on one of those airport golf cart things)

SCULLY: Why would somebody want to sabotage the Space Shuttle?

MULDER: Well, if you were a terrorist, there probably isn't a more potent symbol of American progress and prosperity. And if you're an opponent of big science, NASA itself represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible and debate of the democratic process. And of course there are those futurists who believe the Space Shuttle is a rusty old bucket that should be mothballed. A dinosaur spacecraft built in the 70's by scientists setting their sights on space in an ever declining scale.

SCULLY: And we thought we could rest easy with the fall of the Soviet Union.

MULDER: Not to mention certain fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage. The failure of the Hubble Telescope and the Mars Observer are directly connected to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.

SCULLY: Evidence of what?

MULDER: Alien civilizations.

SCULLY: Oh, of course.

(Digital clock on wall counting down - 10:45:27...26...25)
(Mulder and Scully walking down corridor with guide, Mulder looking at framed posters)

MULDER: Wow, look at that  Gemini 8.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Well, the man we're gonna see? Col Marcus Aurelius Belt nearly died on that mission. Had to make an emergency landing right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

SCULLY: You remember all that stuff?

MULDER: You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, Scully?

SCULLY: Guess I missed that phase. (ANOTHER CLOCK ON WALL 10:39:40...39...38...37)

(Knock on door with Belt's nameplate)

BELT: (Inside) Come in. (They open door)

SCULLY: Col. Belt, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. (Shakes Belt's hand as he rises and puts on jacket) And this is...

MULDER: Col. Belt. Fox Mulder. (Extends hand) I'm a big fan. It's an honor to meet you. Y-you were a big hero to me when I was a kid.

BELT: Thank you.

MULDER: I-I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.

BELT: (uncomfortable) Well, now it's like a stroll around the block. So... how can I help you? (They all sit, Mulder shifting around, obviously excited in presence of his hero)

SCULLY:	This found its way to the FBI. (hands Belt picture that Michelle gave them) Do you recognize it?

BELT: Sure, it's an auxiliary power unit valve. (Hands picture back)

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to believe that the damage done to it was in an effort to sabotage the Space Shuttle Program?

BELT: No.

SCULLY: Do you have any reason to suspect sabotage at all?

BELT: No reason whatsoever. And if you have any respect for this program and for the people who have devoted their lives to it, you'll be careful to whom you make those accusations. (Mulder very uncomfortable)

SCULLY: Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted?

BELT: Look, I don't know where you got this specious artifact, but I can assure you every precaution has been taken to rectify the problem. We've been waiting two weeks for a window to initiate this mission. We've got a payload to deliver.

SCULLY: Col. Belt, has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter?

BELT: The part you have here, has been installed, inspected, and designed by over 100 highly trained technicians. With the security measures we take, it would be virtually impossible for one man working by himself, or two or four men, to do what you are suggesting. I can assure you there isn't a person in this facility that doesn't want to see that shuttle go into space, complete its mission, and come back like winged victory herself. And in about ten hours, God willing, you're gonna see just that.

MULDER: (grinning, as they rise) Do you think there would be a problem with us watching lift off from Mission Control?

BELT: Well, being that you'd probably go over my head anyway, please, be my guest.

MULDER: (Shaking hands again, still in awe) It was an honor, sir.

SCULLY: (Shaking hands) Thank you. (Follows Mulder out the door) Didn't you want to get his autograph?

(Mulder and Scully with some tech guy in some technical mechanical place)

TECHMECH GUY:	Where did you say you got this? (Looking at picture)

SCULLY: It came to us anonymously.

TECHMECH GUY:	Well this is an APU valve all right, but this doesn't make sense.

SCULLY: What doesn't make sense?

TECHMECH GUY:	This scoring here. This valve is made out of ferrocarbon titanium. Its -

MULDER: You didn't order the analysis?

TECHMECH GUY:	No, I've never seen this before. But we're on outside contract to NASA. They may have ordered it.

MULDER: But as a matter of course wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?

TECHMECH GUY:	Every shuttle has flown with that same APU valve. We haven't had a problem. To do an analysis and redesign would delay the program for months, not to mention the cost.

SCULLY: Is it conceivable that in order to avoid these delays, the program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution?

TECHMECH GUY:	Look, there are about 17000 things that can go wrong with the shuttle, and about 17000 people who make sure they don't.

(Another digital clock - 8:43:40...39...38...37 See Belt standing above them on balcony listening)

SCULLY: And who makes the final determination as to its safety?

TECHMECH GUY:	Oh we make a recommendation, but ultimately, the decision is Col Belt's. (Belt leaves)

MULDER AND SCULLY: Thank you. (They start up stairs to balcony)

SCULLY: (Quietly) What do you think?

MULDER: I can't believe how much faith we put in machines.

SCULLY: You think Col Belt knows more than he's saying? That he lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?

MULDER: I can't believe that Col Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts knowing that something might go wrong. He was an astronaut himself.

SCULLY: So you think this x-ray is bogus?

MULDER: God, I hope so.

(NASA footage of launch in progress.)

(Michelle and Mulder give each other thumbs up.)

FLORIDA MC: Roger. Throttle at 110%.

SHUTTLE: Go for SRB separation.

FLORIDA MC: Roger OTC.



SCENE 7

(Mulder and Scully walking corridor of NICE hotel.)

MULDER: I have to admit, that fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies.

SCULLY: Yeah, it ranks right up there with getting a pony and learning how to braid my own hair.

MULDER: Come on, Scully. You have to admit that was exciting. Mission control....(playfully punches her arm)....countdown.

MICHELLE: (Running up behind them) Mulder!! Wait! Something's gone wrong.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: Something's wrong with the shuttle. We had some trouble with the solid rocket boosters, but we were able to fix it. We changed watch, I went home to try to get some sleep. I got a phone call twenty minutes ago. Communication with the shuttle had gone down. Come on. We've got to get back to Houston.



SCENE 8
WET ROAD

(Michelle's car followed by Mulder and Scully's car on wet two lane road. Scully tries to get radio station - all static)

MULDER: They have a press blackout in effect. Chances are, the media doesn't know about it.

SCULLY: Do you think this is sabotage?

MULDER: I don't know. Things go wrong all the time.

SCULLY: Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?

MULDER: Usually.

SCULLY: She's turning.

(Michelle driving. Mars face comes out of the rain and fog and .....AAAAGGGGHHHH!!! Michelle gets run off the road and car flips over.
(Mulder and Scully pull up behind overturned car and get out.)

MULDER: Michelle! I can see her.

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: Heeelllp!

MULDER: Kneeling at passenger side of overturned car) You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm stuck!

SCULLY: Can you move?

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here. I'm wedged in! (Mulder and Scully run around to driver's side of car - duuhh)

MULDER: You all right?

MICHELLE: I'm wedged in! (Mulder reaches in)

MULDER: C'mere. Can you push with your legs?

SCULLY: Be careful.

MICHELLE: Just get me out of here!

MULDER: Okay, all right. Come on. Okay. Come on Okay. (Pulls Michelle out)

SCULLY: It's okay. Now don't try to move.

MICHELLE: Oh, I got to get back to Houston.

MULDER: What happened?

MICHELLE: I don't know. Something came at me in the fog, and the next thing I knew I was upside down.

SCULLY: Was it some kind of an animal?

MICHELLE: No. It had a face. It was... it was grotesque. I don't know what it was. (Mulder helps her stand, arms around her)

SCULLY: You okay?

MICHELLE: Yeah.



SCENE 9
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL ROOM

HOUSTON TECH: Orbiter, this is Houston. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Your transmission is breaking up, Houston. (Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter)

MICHELLE: What's happening?

HOUSTON TECH: We have a malf in the OMS and RCF systems. They can't get the Orbiter into attitude rotation. Temperature in the cabin is approaching 103 degrees and they have downlink transmission problems... what happened to you?

MICHELLE: I had an accident. What's their position?

HOUSTON: Just over Eastern Africa.

MICHELLE: Try patching them into the Saychelles Tracking Station. (On headset) Hang in there OTC.

MULDER:	(explaining to Scully for our benefit) The Orbiter maneuvering system has malfunctioned. Without it they can't rotate the shuttle. They need to rotate it away from the sun to keep the Orbiter cool.

HOUSTON TECH: We've got a drop in cabin pressure, 21 kilopascals and declining.

MICHELLE: They're going to burn up.

MULDER: Where's Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: He's on his way.

MICHELLE: Damn it! What happened when they went to back up?

HOUSTON TECH: Back up system failed to respond.

MICHELLE: Well, what about telemetry? Can we auto-activate their systems from down here?

HOUSTON TECH: We cannot auto-activate! It's like someone's interfering with the telemetry, screwing with the uplink communications from this end.

MICHELLE: Can you trace it?

HOUSTON TECH: It'd have to be a digital processor.

MICHELLE: They'd have to be in the data banks.

MULDER: Where's that?

MICHELLE: Come on. (Mulder and Scully fling their trenchcoats on a console counter and follow Michelle up and out of the room)



SCENE 10
DATA BANK ROOM

Mulder and Scully, guns drawn, with Michelle between them. Figure runs behind Mulder. A second later, lights go out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Emergency lights on. Mulder sees someone in corner)

MULDER: I'm a federal agent. Come on out of there. (Scully and Michelle join Mulder. Computer Tech Geek with Glasses comes out of the corner) What are you doing in here?

CTGG: I work here.

MICHELLE: (Checking him) Let me see your clearance.

CTGG: A sensor went off. There was a malfunction in one of the telemetry processors.

MICHELLE: Did you find it?

CTGG: No.

MULDER: Did you see anybody else in here? (CTGG shakes his head, lights come back on) Okay, call security. I want a search of the premises. I don't want anybody coming in or out of this building who doesn't have proper clearance.



SCENE 11
MISSION CONTROL ROOM

SHUTTLE: .....rotation maneuver.

HOUSTON: I'm breaking up, OTC.

BELT: What's the attitude of the Orbiter?

HOUSTON TECH: They're flying tail first sir, with their belly toward the sun.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Their flash evaporator system is working, but it's not enough to cool them down.

HOUSTON TECH: Cabin temperature climbing to 116.

BELT: Where's - - - (Michelle, Mulder and Scully enter)

MICHELLE: Somebody's jamming our transmissions.

BELT: Who do you mean?

MICHELLE: Somebody or something is interfering with our ground communications and scrambling our uplink telemetry. The shuttle is not responding to override signals.

BELT: I'm going to let them fly by wire. I'm cutting off telemetry.

MICHELLE: It might not work. We might lose contact for good.

BELT: We have to give it a chance to work.

MICHELLE: We have to try to bring them down.

BELT: We have to give them control of the ship, take a chance they'll be able to perform that rotation maneuver and deliver their payload.

MICHELLE: What if they can't? We could be stranding them up there.

BELT: (Pause) Abandon telemetry. Go to fly by wire mode.

MULDER: (Explaining to Scully) They're cutting off ground control to the Orbiter. The astronauts will be flying the shuttle all by themselves.

SCULLY: Is it going to work? (Mulder looks doubtful)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. How's the weather up there?

SHUTTLE: Sunny and warm Houston. What's the forecast?

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to fly by wire mode. We're going to abort ground control momentarily to see if you can bring those systems back up.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston. And leave the driving to us.

MICHELLE: David... you take care. (Transmission broken)

SCULLY: What just happened? (Wake up, Scully)

MULDER: They cut off contact with the shuttle. (Everyone waits. Very tense)

MICHELLE: 45 seconds. If they were able to execute they'd have done it by now.

BELT: Standing by.

MICHELLE: 60 seconds.

BELT: Go to reestablish uplink communication.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Video signal's failed on them.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Do you copy? (Pause) OTC , this is Houston. Where are you?

SHUTTLE: Howdy-do, Houston. Looks like we finally got this bird to fly right. (Everyone claps and smiles, even Scully!)

MICHELLE: OTC, do you hear that?

SHUTTLE: Music to our ears.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Cabin temperature stabilizing.

BELT: OTC, this is Mark Belt in Houston. How's the crew holding up?

SHUTTLE: They're looking good, sir.

BELT: Y'all get some rest. We'll get back to work at about 0700.

SHUTTLE: Roger that, Houston.

BELT: Let's get to work on that telemetry problem. We got a big day ahead of us.

(Belt washes his face.)



SCENE 12
NASA PRESS CONFERENCE

Belt at podium, Mulder, Scully and Michelle watch from side)

BELT: I know you have a lot of questions, and I'll get to them.

SCULLY: (to Michelle) How did he know what he did was going to work?

MICHELLE: He didn't. They could have died up there and there would have been nothing we could have done. They'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit.

SCULLY: Why would he take that risk?

MICHELLE: Bring those men back without delivering that payload? You're talking millions of wasted dollars. That's all Congress would need to shut down NASA.

BELT: As of 2200 hours, the crew has been conducting onboard tests and tasks and resting up for their first full day in space tomorrow. I'm happy to say after a beautiful night launch the Shuttle Orbiter has performed magnificently. (Michelle leaves in disgust)

SCULLY: So much for your boyhood hero.

(Mulder following Belt down hallway)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt? Can I talk to you for a moment?

BELT: You want to know why I lied to them. You're asking yourself if this means I'd lie to you. (Mulder nods) You know what it means to be an astronaut, sir? You risk your life every time you get into your spacecraft for nothing more than the good progress of mankind.

MULDER: You've got no argument from me, sir. You're true American heroes.

BELT: Heroes? We used to make headlines when we did our job right. Now they bury them in the back of the paper. Name me two astronauts on the last shuttle mission. (Mulder can't) You make the front page today only if you screw up. They only know your name if you're the unlucky SOB sitting on 500 tons of dynamite. That's what they're really waiting for. (Starts to go)

MULDER: Sir, I have to ask. I'm sorry, it's my job. Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle?

BELT: My answer to you sir, will be to bring those men back safely to earth.



SCENE 13
BELT'S APARTMENT

Belt enters, gets vodka out of the freezer, drinks it out of the bottle, lies down on bed and has another EVA memory dream.)

YOUNG BELT: My God!

HOUSTON: How's it going out there?

YOUNG BELT: There's something out here!

HOUSTON: Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me! Holy God!

(See present day Belt awake on bed, his face morphing into Mars face. White ghostly thing pulls out of Belt and floats out the window and up into space. Belt sits frozen, hand outstretched.)



SCENE 14
SHUTTLE ORBITER
PASSING OVER CANADA

SHUTTLE: Uh, Houston, we just heard something weird up here.



SCENE 15
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL

HOUSTON TECH: OTC, Houston. Can you describe it?

SHUTTLE: Sort of a dull thump, like something bumped the ship. Got any ideas about that? (banging sound) There it is again.

(Computer Tech Geek with Glasses runs for the stairs and up to data room where Mulder, Scully, Michelle and techs are dissecting machines)

CTGG: (quietly to Michelle) They've got an oxygen leak on board the Orbiter.

SHUTTLE: Our O2 gauges are going all screwy, Houston.

HOUSTON TECH: (To Michelle, Mulder and Scully entering Mission Control) We got problems. We've got an O2 leak in the main tank.

MICHELLE: What did they say happened?

HOUSTON TECH: They don't know. They just said it was a thump.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: (On head set) Stand by. We have an astronomer in Winnipeg who just spotted a gaseous cloud about a mile long trailing in our orbit.

MULDER: (To Scully) That's the liquid O2 leaking out into space. The exact same thing happened to Col. Belt on an Apollo mission.

MICHELLE: How much time do they have?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Well, that's hard to know without accurate telemetry data. I'll do the calculations, but it will just be a guesstimate.

MICHELLE: I need some answers, and where is Col. Belt?

HOUSTON TECH: We can't find him and he was due here 90 minutes ago to begin payload deployment.

SHUTTLE:	Uh, Houston? We're up here kind of wondering when we have to start holding our breath.

MICHELLE: We're working on it OTC. I need those calculations and I need a worst case scenario.

HOUSTON TECH: We don't know if one or both of the O2 tanks are damaged.

MICHELLE: Worst case scenario! And then I want someone to find Col. Belt.

MULDER: We'll find Col. Belt.

HOUSTON TECH: They've got thirty minutes of back up oxygen. Beyond that, it's anybody's guess.



SCENE 16
HALLWAY

(Mulder and Scully walking down hall)

SCULLY: Why does she need Belt?

MULDER: She doesn't know how serious the leak is.

SCULLY: It's an oxygen leak. Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen.

MULDER: Col. Belt's been up there in the same situation before. He'll know better than anybody else what to do. He's got to make the decisions.

SCULLY: Where the hell is he?

(Mulder and Scully knocking at Belt's door.)

MULDER: Col. Belt? Col. Belt!

SCULLY: I'm going to go get security.

(Belt opens door)

MULDER: Col. Belt. Are you all right?

BELT: Yeah. I wasn't feeling well.

MULDER: They need you down at Mission Control, sir. There's been another accident.



SCENE 17
HOUSTON MISSION CONTROL

MICHELLE: OTC, is your orbital maneuvering system still operational?

(Belt, Mulder, and Scully enter)

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're ready for reentry. Just say the word.

BELT: How bad's the leak?

MICHELLE: We have no way to determine.

BELT: OTC, What's the condensation, cabin.

SHUTTLE: Windows are getting a little steamy.

MICHELLE: Carbon dioxide buildup.

BELT: Okay, OTC. Everything's going to be fine. I want you to get in your spacesuits and depressurize your cabin, and then I want you to vent that CO2.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. And then what? (Michelle and Houston Tech look worried)

BELT: I want you to stay in your suits. And then I want you to prepare to use your emergency oxygen systems. And then I want you...to...deliver your payload.

MICHELLE: Those are men up there.

BELT: You're out of line. You want to tell me how to do my job? I've been up there in that situation, Miss Generoo. There's more at risk here than your personal life. And if you can't accept that or operate effectively in the circumstances then maybe you'd better leave the decisions to people in this room who can. (Michelle leaves. Scully follows) OTC, do you copy?

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. We're waiting on those O2 calculations. (Mulder leaves)



SCENE 18
HALLWAY

(Mulder and Scully follow a crying Michelle down the hall)

SCULLY: Michelle!

MICHELLE: They're going to die.

MULDER: You don't know that.

MICHELLE: It's absolutely unconscionable putting that payload before those men's lives.

SCULLY: I think she's right, Mulder. You saw him in there. He's losing it.

MULDER: He saved their lives earlier.

SCULLY: Did he? Or did he put their lives in unnecessary jeopardy? If he can't deliver that payload, Congress is going to kill the Space Program.

MULDER: And you think killing those astronauts isn't going to have the same effect?

SCULLY: Look, Mulder. I think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle because too many things have gone wrong. I think Col. Belt knows about it and he's known about it from the beginning.

MICHELLE: We have to stop him. We've got to pull them out of orbit. (Tries to go, Mulder grabs her and doesn't stop touching her for the rest of the scene. What is up with that?! She's engaged)

MULDER: He doesn't want those men to die.

MICHELLE: How do you know?

MULDER: I know it. I'm sure of it.

MICHELLE: He's the one who put them up there.

MULDER: And he may be the only person who can get them down alive. Now how can you be certain that what he's doing isn't the right thing? That what he's doing isn't going to save their lives? Now I need access to you records... in a hurry. (Michelle leads them off)



SCENE 19
COMPUTER ROOM

MULDER: (at computer with Computer Tech Geek with Glasses) I need everything on the Hubble Telescope, the Mars Observer, the Shuttle Challenger, and the current Orbiter mission.

CTGG: You're talking about tens of thousands of documents.

SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for?

MULDER: X-rays, diagrams, schematics - - any proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.

SCULLY:	A needle in a haystack.

(Mulder and Scully going through files. Mulder opens the Challenger file to picture of the O ring)



SCENE 20
MISSION CONTROL

SHUTTLE: Payload deployment initiated.

HOUSTON: Roger that, OTC. Tracking it now. (Footage of something coming out of shuttle)

SHUTTLE: Looks good from here. Payload delivery is complete, Houston. We're awaiting your order.

BELT: System check for reentry deorbit burn.

SHUTTLE: Holy God! There's something outside the ship! There's someone outside the ship!

BELT: Can you repeat that, OTC?

SHUTTLE: There's some kind of .... ghost outside the ship!

BELT: (losing it) No. Nono. NonoononooooooooooOOOOOOO!!!!



SCENE 21
FILE ROOM

SCULLY: Mulder, I found it. This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle...ordered by Col. Belt. Which means he knew about the faulty valve.

MULDER: This is from the Challenger. It's the O ring fitting that failed dated January 21, 1986. That's one week before the space shuttle blew up. And the analysis was ordered by Col. Belt.

SCULLY: Are you saying he might have known about the Challenger defect?

MULDER: Something weird is going on here, Scully.

MICHELLE: (at door) Col. Belt's collapsed.

MULDER: Where is he?

MICHELLE: He's in his office. (they follow her out, Mulder's hand back where it belongs on Scully's lower back)



SCENE 22
BELT'S OFFICE

Mulder, Scully and Michelle enter )

MICHELLE: He was just here.

(They find Belt crying under his desk)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MICHELLE: What's wrong with him?

MULDER: Get a doctor.

BELT: Help me. Help me.

MULDER: How can we help you, Col.?

SCULLY: He's having some kind of a seizure, Mulder.

MICHELLE: (leading EMTs in)Come on! Come on, come on!

BELT: It hurts! It's tearing me apart!

EMT1: See if I can get a bus. (They walk him to stretcher)

MICHELLE: I'm bringing that shuttle down.

BELT: Nooooo! It's out there.

EMT1: Easy, easy.

BELT: Spacesuits!

MULDER: Strap him down.

SCULLY: (Suddenly remembering 7 years of med school) Give him 10 milligrams of Diazepam.

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: He's going to hurt himself, Mulder.

MULDER: He's trying to tell us something. Col. Belt.

MICHELLE: Those men are up there and they're running out of oxygen.

BELT: They don't have to die.

MULDER: (Holding up his finger) Col. Belt, I want you to focus. Focus your breathing. Focus your pain. (Oh, this scene is bad) Right here.

EMT1: Blood pressure is 174 over 120.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're risking an anuerysm.

MULDER: Focus. (Belt calms) Now you're focused. Right here. Now you're going to save those astronauts and you're going to tell me how to do it.

BELT: The shuttle can't survive reentry.

MICHELLE: No, he's lying.

MULDER: How do you know it can't survive?

BELT: The fuselage...the fuselage is damaged. The silicone tiles are destroyed.

MICHELLE: How does he know?

MULDER: How has it been damaged?

BELT: I'm responsible.

MULDER: Did you sabotage the shuttle?

BELT: No, but I couldn't stop them. Nobody can stop them.

MULDER: Stop who?

EMT1: Pulse is 194.

SCULLY: You're going to kill him, Mulder.

MULDER: Stop who?

BELT: They don't want us to know. They don't want us to know.

MULDER: Who?

BELT: It came to me. It lives in me. (EVA flashback)

YOUNG BELT: It's coming at me. It's coming at me! Get me out of here! (Ghost thing invades Young Belt's body) It's attacking me! Get me out! (Back to present)

BELT: Get it out. Help me. It's coming back. (Belt's face morphs into Mars face)

MICHELLE: That's the face I saw in the fog.

EMT1: We're losing him. Defib.

EMT2: (Handing padddles) Here you go.

EMT1: Clear.

EMT2: Hit it.

HOUSTON TECH: (in door) We've just run out of oxygen. They've got exactly thirty minutes left in the emergency backup system.

MICHELLE: They're going to suffocate up there. I've got no choice but to bring them down. It's the only chance I've got. (Michelle and Houston Tech leave)

EMT1: Again.

EMT2: Okay, we got O2 standing by. (Giving O2)

EMT1: Hold on. We've got vitals. We've got a pulse.

SCULLY: We've got to get him to a hospital.



SCENE 23
MISSION CONTROL

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston Mission Control. Do you copy?

SHUTTLE:	Roger, Houston. We've got some spooky stuff up here.

MICHELLE: OTC, we're going to bring you down. We want you to instigate deorbit burn, and begin deceleration.

SHUTTLE: Roger, Houston. Kind of hoping you were going to say that. Activating OMS rockets. All systems go for reentry.



SCENE 24
HALLWAY

(Belt on gurney down hallway)

MULDER:	They're bringing the shuttle down. You said the shuttle would burn up on reentry. Is there anything we can do to save it?

BELT: Change the trajectory.

MULDER: Change the trajectory to what?

BELT: Change the reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. (Mulder and Scully run off)



SCENE 25
Mission Control

MISSION CONTROL:	T minus 35 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: (running in) You've to change the reentry trajectory.

MICHELLE: What?

MULDER: You've got to change it to 35 degrees.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 30 seconds to ionosphere reentry.

MULDER: Col. Belt- - -

MICHELLE: I can't.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus 25 seconds.

MULDER: It's your only shot.

MICHELLE: We...we...we'd have to change the landing site, we'd have to inform them before the blackout.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: 15 seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: I want to know what the weather conditions are in Albuquerque. Are we go for an emergency landing?

HOUSTON TECH: Weather in Albuquerque? Landing conditions go in Albuquerque.

CURLY HAIRED TECH: T minus five seconds to blackout.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. I want you to change your reentry trajectory to 35 degrees. You'll be landing at Kirtland Field in Albuquerque. Do you copy?

HOUSTON TECH: Ionosphere reentry. Temporary blackout in effect.

MICHELLE: Did they get that transmission?

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Two minutes to reestablish.

MICHELLE: Damn it. (Red clock reads 16:26:01...2...3) How much oxygen do we have?

HOUSTON TECH: 16 minutes.

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:15...16...17) OTC, this is Houston. Come in OTC. Anything? (Curly shakes head) What's the point of their new reentry?

HOUSTON TECH: 500 miles west of Hawaii.

MICHELLE: See if Hawaii can get me - -

CURLY HAIRED TECH: Hawaii's picked the shuttle up on radar.

SCULLY: They made it.

HOUSTON TECH: Not necessarily.



SCENE 26
KIRTLAND AIR BASE
ALBEQUERQUE, NM

CURLY HOUSTON: Albuquerque, do you have radar confirmation?

ALBUQUERQUE: Negative, Houston. Nothing on the screen.



SCENE 27
MISSION CONTROL

(Clock - 16:26:43...44...45...46)

MICHELLE: OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC. (16:26:53...54...55) OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC.

SHUTTLE:	Houston, this is OTC. You know a good place to eat in Albuquerque?

(Big grin and laugh from...Scully? Everybody happy. Mulder and Michelle big hug.)

HOUSTON TECH: OTC, welcome home. Welcome home, OTC. You're looking real good.

SOME GUY: Yes!



SCENE 28
PRESS CONFERENCE

Michelle at press conference on TV)

MICHELLE: The Space Shuttle touched down today at 10:56 Central Standard Time. The Orbiter delivered it's payload after just thirteen orbits and returned to Earth...without incident. (Belt is watching the TV. He is hooked to machines in hospital) We at NASA are looking forward to our next shuttle mission and to future successful explorations of space, for mankind, and the future of mankind.

(Belt's machines beep wildly, his face does the Mars morph, he rips off, the tubes, fights with the ghost, yells noa few times, and flings himself through the glass window. Alternating images of him on EVA in space and of the street intersection below coming rapidly closer. AAAAAAGGGGGHHHH!)



SCENE 29
X-FILES OFFICE
WASHINGTON, DC

(Mulder reads obituary Former Astronaut Space Program Plunges to Death. Scully enters)

SCULLY: I just heard.

MULDER: Something had possessed him. Something he must have seen out there in space.

SCULLY: The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia.

MULDER: I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him or that he ever knew...that he was...responsible for his own actions.

SCULLY: He ordered those x-rays of the damaged parts.

MULDER: You saw what I saw, Scully. I think he was trying to warn her. I think that he sent Michelle those x-rays like he was trying to reach out to her without quite knowing why, as if...his own instinctual impulse was to save those men.

SCULLY: While simultaneously trying to kill them?

MULDER: Hey, Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe, and we don't even know what's behind them. I think what ever it was, he took it with him. And in the end that was the only way he knew how to stop it.

SCULLY: There's an investigation, you know. They haven't ruled out foul play.

MULDER: He gave his own life. As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to do.



SCENE 30
MILITARY FUNERAL

Mulder and Scully have really good seats)

MINISTER: ...for Col. Marcus Aurelius Belt devoted his life to the exploration and understanding of Space, learning its mysteries and experiencing it not just for himself, but for humanity. Lord, take this man's soul and let it rise up to your heavens, higher than he could ever go as a man. Let him know the true nature of the universe that he sought to learn.

(Michelle and her fiancee watch planes fly over. Michelle and Mulder have a shared look and nod. Close up of flag on coffin.)

SCENE 2
US SPACE SURVEILLANCE CENTER
CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, CO

MALE OFFICER #1: Sir? Sorry to disturb you sir. But we just picked up an unidentified bogey. I think you should see the replay for yourself.
(both officer and chief walk toward info area)

MALE OFFICER #1: It tripped the fence at 23-17 off the coast of Conneticut, sir.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Initial trajectory was north by northwest. Then it started going crazy.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: What about other craft in the area...missle testing?

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Sir. No known aircraft can maneuver like this.

MALE OFFICER #1: Well, whatever it was dropped of the screen at 24-18 sir. Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan outside Townsend Wisconsin.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: The tracking and impact team predicted impact calculated at over 800 miles an hour.

MALE OFFICER #1: I've instructed Cheif Koretz to to start her report right away...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Negative. What she tracked was a meteor. Its abberant movement was obviously due to instrument malfunction.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: But sir...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Your report will reflect these facts. Is that clear?

MALE OFFICER #1: Yes sir.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Good.
(Colonel exits, walks to deserted corner. Dials cell phone)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Code indigo delta echo niner. I have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87.
Mobilize Operation Falcon Immediately.

(Voice from Television Report)
...still have no comment until the government investigation now under way is completed. Government officials remain vague about the toxic cargo that has caused the immediate evacuation of Townshend Wisconsin's 12,000 residents. Speculation here has centered on a shipment of toxic waste...(fades out)

(shot of Mulder in foreground checking his gun)
[Flashback]

MULDER: Then what happened out there if it wasn't a train wreck?

DEEP THROAT: Mulder the continental United States is surrounded by an electronic fence that reaches 15,000 miles into space. We use it to track and monitor the 7,087 man-made objects that orbit the earth. Last night at 23-17 that fence was breached.
[Mulder shown back in hotel testing flashlight on hand]

DEEP THROAT: (contines)This morning at 0100 Operation Falcon went into effect Led by Colonel Calvin Henderson--The Air Force's premiere reclamations expert.

MULDER: Reclamations?

DEEP THROAT: During the cold war his job was to prevent technologies from downed US aircrafts from  getting into Soviet hands.

MULDER: He's part of a craft retrieval unit.

DEEP THROAT: Mm Hmm(looking down). Quick response. I'd say you have...24 Hours before the entire area is sanitized. After that it will be like nothing has happened.



SCENE 5
Mulder seen running through woods: wearing backpack. Approaches "laser" fence Walks around what is obviously military campsight. Helicopter flies overhead, large trucks check in at main gate. Military men all around.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You're late, Liutenant.. Its going to be dark in a half hour.

LIEUTENANT: We had a flat outside the peremiter, sir.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: There's a general briefing at 2200 hours. But first got to headquarters for the live rounds.

LIEUTENANT: Live rounds, sir?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You have a problem with that?

LIEUTENANT: No sir. We were told this was just a drill.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: They told you wrong.

LIEUTENANT: (To soldiers in truck) OK! Everyone out!

(soldiers exit truck)
Mulder drops from bottom of truck, walks into forest.

Forest at night. Armed soldiers walk through on patrol. Mulder walks by. Mulder sees light in distance, walks toward it. Approaching lit area, crouches down. Men yelling. Whooshing noises. Mulder sees crash site lit with heavy lights. Men walk around crash site in protective gear spray area. Mulder takes photos of this scene. Man approaches Mulder from behind. Mulder turns around, is hit in face with gun.



SCENE 7
(Inside tent at Operation Fallen Angel headquarters. Close up shot of camera film being exposed to light)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You just made the worst mistake of your life, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I think you knocked out a filling.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I'll see to it you that pay the price for putting my men at risk.

MULDER: Since when does taking pictures put anyone's life at risk?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: You violated a US government quarantine and thats a federal crime.

MULDER: That's a quarantine? Is that what you call this?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: We're trying to contain an ecological disaster.

MULDER: Thats a lot of firepower just to protect mother nature.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I have my orders. And a license to execute them as a I see fit. I suggest you forget what you saw, what you think you saw for your own well being.

MULDER: You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir. And troops carrying live rounds ! We both know what's out there!



SCENE 8
(Mulder escorted into temporary chain-link-fence brig)

MAX FENIG: Are you MUFON or CUFOS? (Approaches out of shadows, wears baseball cap backwards, glasses, long blonde hair) Do you mind if I sit down? Let me guess you're with that new group--CSICOP, right? (Mulder looks away) Um, say no more. You're a cautious man. Trust no one. Very wise. After what happened to JFK I understand completely. (Mulder looks back) Oh, let me introduce myself. My name is Max Fenig. I'm with the National Investigative Committee of Arial Phenomenon...NICAP (Turns around hat to display the initials). Pleased...pleased to make you're acquanitance. Wish we could shake on it, you know. Firm grip, look you right in the eye. You learn a lot about a guy that way. (Mulder looks away) Hey, uh... Can I ask you a question?

MULDER: Go ahead.

MAX FENIG: Did you see anything? Did you get close? Me, I saw nothing. (talks loudly to anyone who may be listening) I didn't see anything! (To Mulder) Nada, zip. Hundred yards past the road block they nailed me. I have no idea how they did it. I'm telling you its like the Roswell cover up all over again.

MULDER: What makes you so sure that something's out there?

MAX FENIG: (laughs) Same thing that makes you so sure?



SCENE 9
(Dawn at camp. Empty bunk in cell. Pans to next cell, Mulder asleep as door opens.
Scully enters.)

MULDER: I didn't order room service.

SCULLY: This isn't funny, Mulder.

MULDER: Did you meet Max?

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Max from NICAP. (Looks to empty bunk) Oh, they must have released him.
Another intrepid soul in seach of a close enounter.

SCULLY: Is that what this is about?

MULDER: What else?

SCULLY: Try explaining that to Section Cheif McGrath. He stepped over Blevins ordering a full inquiry. With a recommendation...Mulder he wants to shut down the X-files. And he wants you out of the bureau.

MULDER: So what else is new?

SCULLY: I don't understand you Mulder. Why you're always defying protocol? Ignoring jurisdiction...

MULDER: Because I know what I saw Scully. There weren't train tracks anywhere near that site. So how could it have been a derailed container?

SCULLY: Because it wasn't. What you saw was not a toxic spill. But it wasn't a UFO either.

MULDER: OK. I'm all ears. What was it?

SCULLY: It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead. (Mulder laughs) Over US air space... They'd been picking up low grade levels of radiation indicating that a plutonium casing may have cracked. So to avoid mass panic...

MULDER: You really believe that story..?

SCULLY: That story happens to be highly classified.

MULDER: A highly classified lie. (Helicopter passes overhead) They're searching for someone Scully.

SCULLY: If they're searching for anyone, its probably the pilot.

MULDER: You think they'd roll out all of this material for one Libyan fighter jock? (pause)
Besides, no human pilot walked away from the wreckage I saw.

SCULLY: Well, maybe he ejected.

MULDER: Maybe.



SCENE 10
(a Predator-like figure [i.e. see-through, yet produces a visible aura-kinda thing] approaches the laser fence. Pausing outside it as A military truck drives down nearby road, it then runs through the laser fence, and across the road behind the truck.)



SCENE 11

MULDER and SCULLY walk from car to motel door.

SCULLY: You can't be serious!

MULDER: As long as we're here in beuartiful downtown Townsend, why not?

SCULLY: Mulder, the hearing is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

MULDER: That gives us 24 hours to investigate.

SCULLY: My assignment is to bring you back, not to help you dig yourself in deeper.

MULDER: "The Last Detail" starring Dana Scully

(Both enter hotel room. Room is a mess. Phone is off the hook)

SCULLY: What's going on?

MULDER: Looks like housekeeping hasn't been here yet.

SCULLY: Who would...

MULDER: SH...

(noise from bathroom. Both draw guns and approach bathroom. Entering bathroom both see the rear legs of a man sticking as he tries to fit through the bathroom window)

MULDER: Max?

SCULLY: Get your hands up!

MAX FENIG: Whoa. Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

MULDER: Max?

MAX FENIG: (Takes off hat) Ahem..

(Mulder brings Max into bedroom, sits him on the bed)

MAX FENIG: My apologies. Forgive me please. I'm a curious man. I had to know..

MULDER: Know what?

MAX FENIG: If it was really you.

MULDER: But you don't know me. Last night is the first time you've laid eyes on me.

MAX FENIG: Not true. We at NICAP have been following your career really closely. Ever since you became involved with the X-files.

MULDER: Following my career? How?

MAX FENIG: Through the Freedom of Information Act.Your travel expenses are a matter of public record. (Pauses and looks at Scully) So, this must be the enigmatic Agent Scully. (Max moves toward her extending his hand, Mulder pushes him back onto the bed)

MULDER: How did you recognize me?

MAX FENIG: I saw your picture in a trade magazine once. And of course I read your article in Omni about the Gulf Breeze sightings.

MULDER: I published that under a pseudonym.

MAX FENIG: M.F. Luder. I know. M.F. Luder is an anagram for F. Mulder. You really didn't think that would fool us did you?

MULDER: I didn't think anyone was really paying attention

MAX FENIG: Somebody's always paying attention Mr. Mulder.

SCULLY: A-mazing.

MAX FENIG: Amazing? Hardly. You want to see something amazing? Come with me.
(Mulder heads out of motel room)

MULDER: (looking at Scully) *Enigmatic* Dr. Scully.



SCENE 12
(Max leads them to trailer in motel parking lot)

MAX FENIG: This is my, uh...Right this way.

(Inside trailer. Max begins to search around trailer. Scully begins to look around)

MAX FENIG: Okay. Where's those, uh...They were right here. Oh, here they are. The latest crop circle photos from Project Argus. Huh? Your opinion fact or fraud.

MULDER: Fraud.

MAX FENIG: How do you explain the anamolous blisters on the plants?

MULDER: Some unreported weathering effects common to wheat or a systematic reaction to the plant tissue to being lodged in one position.

(Dana notices medication on a shelf. Picks up one prescription and reads it: MELLARIL)

MAX FENIG: (To Mulder) I see you've read the literature.

MULDER: I try to keep up.

MAX FENIG: What about the...

MULDER: Max! You said you had something to show us.

MAX FENIG: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. (All three approach electronic equipment) Wolf Ear 2000. Did you ever hear of this?

SCULLY: Yeah. Wolf Industries supplied the CIA with all of its surveillance equipment.

MAX FENIG: State of the art, search and intercept. Up to 100 channels per second. Currently I'm jacked into local fire and police departments, cellular pathways, and when the weather's right sometimes even air traffic control from Whitmarsh Air Force Base.

MULDER: What have you got Max?

MAX FENIG: Mobil Unit Broadcast. In Scan Mode. Townshend Shariff's deparment. Two nights ago.

(--recording--)
We got a fire of county road D7. Two miles west of the canyon ridge intersection. Suggest we dispatch fire crews, over? This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?

MAX FENIG: And this. 35 minutes later. Presumably from the fire crew. Reception got wiggy for some reason.

(--recording--)
This is unit 53. Man down. Request medivac. I said request medivac! You're breaking up!
Very. Bad. VERY bad. Wait a second. What the hell? Charlie, we've got a situation here!



SCENE 13
(Operation Falcon headquarters)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (on phone) We put up a tight net. (pause) Yes sir. Every inch of ground is being covered, dug up, squeezed and sifted. (pause) No, sir. It will not get away. Not this time.



SCENE 14
MILLS ROAD HIGH SCHOOL
EMERGENCY EVACUATION CENTER
6:27 PM
DAY 2

(People scattered on cots in make-shift evacuation center)

MULDER: Mrs. Wright? Hi. I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. We're from the FBI. We'd like to ask
you a few questions about your husband.

MRS WRIGHT: He's dead. What else is there to know? (walks away toward empty cot with young boy)

SCULLY: I'm sorry about your husband.

MRS WRIGHT: Oh, please.

SCULLY: Mrs. Wright, we want to help you.

MRS WRIGHT: Then leave me alone.

MULDER: Why won't you let us help you?

MRS WRIGHT: I don't know anything! (Looks from one agent to another.Sits down) Don't you understand? They won't even release the body so I can give him a proper burial. OK?

SCULLY: The government can't do that. I'm sure if you appealed to...

MRS WRIGHT: No!

SCULLY: You're entitled to the truth.

MRS WRIGHT: I can't afford the truth. They said that if I spoke to anyone, they would withhold my husband's pension. And I have a child to take care of.
(Lights go out in the evacuation center)



SCENE 15
US MICROWAVE SUBSTATION B21

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON has earphones on. (high pitch screech) CCH pulls of earphones.

MILITARY POLICEMAN: Picking up extremely high frequency signal--200,000 Mhz (static screeching) Sir, target. onthe northeast side, Footspeed-- seven miles per hour sir

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (Speaking into headset) Beta team

BETA TEAM LEADER: Copy

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Target entering your section from the southwest. Search and destroy. Repeat, Search and Destroy

BETA TEAM LEADER: Yes sir!

(Two teams of two men apeice in tactical gear. Guns drawn, surveying area. Looking around, and up to ceiling. The two teams split up in opposite directions, but keeping visual contact)

BETA TEAM LEADER: : Jackson?

JACKSON: Nothing.

(Looks to other team. Team leader shakes head--no. Camera as entity. Approaches B1 and Jackson. Draws back, heads toward other team)

BETA TEAM LEADER: Must have been an animal.

(Other team. Entity approaches. Bright white light. Both teams are knocked to ground.)



SCENE 16
COUNTY HOSPITAL
TOWNSEND, WI
11:42 PM

DR. OPPENHEIM: I'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena I can't discuss patient information.

SCULLY: Does that mean Jason Wright was your patient?

DR. OPPENHEIM: It means I have nothing more to say about this.

MULDER: What about his wife and child, Doctor? Would you have anything to say to them? Because whoever got to you also got to her. They must have some pretty big threats. What did they hold over your head? Your medical licence, the IRS?

DR. OPPENHEIM: I hate fascists.

MULDER: Excuse me?

DR. OPPENHEIM: The men who came in here. The way they pushed us all around.

MULDER: Dr. Oppenheim. Tell us about the deputy. You saw him that night, didn't you?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Yes. And three others from the fire crew. They were all DOA with 5th and 6th degree burns over 90 percent of their bodies. Although they weren't like any burns I've ever seen. And they took the bodies away before we could perform any pathologies.

SCULLY: Did you note any cadaver acute heat rigor or heat stiffening?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Yes, actually there was quite a bit of heat inflection in the limbs. How do you know so much about it?

MULDER: Doctor, in your opinion, could those burns have been caused by ionizing radiation?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Well, I hadn't thought...I suppose its possible. If the exposure was significantly intense.



SCENE 17
(walking down hallway)
[Hospital PA: Code Five. All available teams and nonessential...fades out]

SCULLY: Lets say those men died from radiation exposure. Couldn't it have been from the cracked core of a nuclear warhead?

MULDER: I've read about these kinds of burns, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah, so have I. In Hiroshima at Ground Zero.

MULDER: I'm talking about close encounter mortalities. I have a stack of X-files recording the same clinical results.

SCULLY: Mulder I don't claim to know all the answers, but if we don't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow morning, there may not be any more X-files.

(Sudden commotion as men in military uniform are brought in on stretchers. Men have severe burns. Moaning. CCH follows them in. Looking directly at Mulder as he passes)



SCENE 18
(SCULLY and MULDER back in emergency room with DR. OPPENHEIM and COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON. Men in military men lay on gurneys in various positions of the ER. Medical personnel scurry around frantically. DR. OPPENHEIM is checking on a burn patient wearing a military uniform)

DR. OPPENHEIM: Start an IV here stat.

MULDER: (to HENDERSON) Tell us what happened out there?

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Whatever happened, Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.

MULDER: Wrong colonel. We both want the same thing. Only you want it dead. Can't you see that chasing it down like an animal you leave it no choice but to defend itself? How many more people have to die before you rethink your approach?

(Off camera: Are we going to get anybody from ICU in here. We need help)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Listen to me. Cause I'm not wasting another breath on this. If you and your partner aren't out of here in 30 seconds ...

DR. OPPENHEIM: Agent Scully stays right here. We're undermanned. She's a medical doctor. She stays.
(To SCULLY) If that's OK with you.

SCULLY: Of course, I...

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Doctor, if you don't mind, you just take care of my men, and let me do my work, OK?

DR. OPPENHEIM: Outside this emergency room, you can do whatever you want, But in here I call the shots. Assuming of course, you want me to take care of your men.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: (Pauses a moment) Get this man out of my sight! (Nods to Mulder)

SCULLY: I'll scrub up.
(Mulder is led out)



SCENE 19
(Mulder gets out of a car in a parking lot, and heads to Max's trailer.)

MULDER: Max? (knocking) Hey, Max. Max?

(Max lying on ground in convulsions. Mulder tries to hold him still. The convulsions subside.)

MULDER: Hey... Max

MAX FENIG: Who...who are you?

MULDER: Max.. Its me. Fox Mulder.. Are you OK?

MAX FENIG: What are you doing here?

MULDER: You were haveing some kind of seizure.

MAX FENIG: Seizure? That's impossible.

MULDER: You were lying on the floor. Unconscious. Convulsing.

MAX FENIG: Thats odd. I haven't had an episode in seven years. Not since I went on medication.

MULDER: Lets get you to the hospital.

MAX FENIG: No! I mean, I mean its not necessary.

MULDER: Are you sure?

MAX FENIG: Yeah. I've lived with epilepsy all my life. I'm not in any danger.
(Mulder gets glass of water, gives it to Max)

MAX FENIG: Yeah. It started in South Dakota when I was ten. The doctor said I must have incurred a
head injury. I don't remember hitting my head.

MULDER: And when you have a seizure, you have no memory of it?

MAX FENIG: As a kid I used to wake up in strange places with no idea where I was, or how I got there.
(sighs) Sorry I... (hands Mulder water) I've got to get some sleep.

(Mulder helps him to bed. As Max lies down, Mulder notices mark behind his ear.)



SCENE 20

(SCULLY enters - sighing)

MULDER: Rough night, huh?

SCULLY: It was terrible. We lost all but two. And they're still in critical condition on their way to the burn unit at John's Hopkins.

MULDER: So what do you think, Scully? What's going on out there?

SCULLY: I don't know. And under other circumstances, I would like to find out, but we have a plane to catch in just over an hour...(heads toward door)

MULDER: I want you to take a look at something first.

SCULLY: What? (turning around)

MULDER: Max. There's an unsual incision bechind his left ear. I've seen this incision twice before. Two women. A thousand miles apart. No way of knowing each other. No relation. Both claim to have been abducted by aliens.

SCULLY: Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee? Mulder, the man is taking powerful anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV.

MULDER: They're for his epilepsy.

SCULLY: Not all of them. DILANTIN is an anti-convulsant, but MELLARIL is used exclusively to treat schitzophrenia. More than likely, Max is delusional.

MULDER: You don't seem to understand Scully. Max doesn't believe he was abducted by aliens, I believe he was. Now could you at least take a look at the scar, and give me you medical opinion?

SCULLY: Okay. You pack. I'll take a look at Max...on the way to the airport.



SCENE 21
US SPACE SURVEILLANCE CENTER
CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN, CO

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Sir I have flash traffic at 24-18. Repeated calls for ID go unanswered. And its not in the orbital or suborbital inventory.

MILITARY OFFICER #2: 24-18. Isn't that where...

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Same exact spot sir. Although I am reading a much larger craft his time.

MILITARY OFFICER #2: Meteor, Ms. Koretz.

CAPTAIN KORETZ: A much larger Meteor, sir. Hold on a second.(Putting hand to earpeice) We have a confirm. Whitmarsh Air Force BAse is tracking...

MILITARY OFFICER #2: Where is it?

CAPTAIN KORETZ: Well, sir. The meteor, seems to be hovering over a small town in Eastern Wisconsin.



SCENE 22
(Overhead shot of Max's trailer. Camera enters through vent. Sees Max in bed, asleep on his left side. Approaches his right ear, blood trickles out. Max lifts head. Blood is also on the pillow. Max opens his eyes.)



SCENE 23
(Scully and Mulder approach the trailer.)

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder. Lets get this over with.

MULDER: (Knocking on trailer) Hey, Max. (opens trailer) Max!

(Inside the trailer, a frequency scanner chatters.)

MULDER: Max?

SCULLY: Mulder - look at this. (pointing to blood on the pillow)

MULDER: What is that, blood?

Mulder and Scully stand in front of the scanner, looking and listening.

SCANNER: Repeat.......patrol reporting unidentified tresspass at the waterfront. This is Henderson.
Move on target. (Mulder looks at Scully, and leaves the trailer)



SCENE 24

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Come on.(Heading towards the car)

SCULLY: Where do you think you are going? Look, if we go to the airport right now, we might make
the plane. Which would at least give you half a chance of defending yourself.

MULDER: Think about is Scully. Max is a gypsy. A nomad, right?

SCULLY: Yeah, so what?

MULDER: So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call to his dispatcher. Which means he was here in Townsend Wisconsin the night of the crash. Of all the places he could of been, he was right here. Don't you think thats more than a coincidence. If Max was abducted that would go a long way to explaining his obsession. And if we've figured it out, you can be sure Col. Henderson has as well. Do you have the keys? (SCULLY hands over keys.)



SCENE 25
LAKE MICHIGAN WATERFRONT, MI
DOCK 7

(Mulder walks along dock, right hand holding his ear, panting.Two men in military jeep pull up.)

MAX FENIG: Don't do this.

ARMY MAN 1: Sir, we've apprehended the target. Its just a civilian.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Negative, Falcon patrol. Take him with extreme caution.

(MULDER and SCULLY pull up. Two military men, lie on ground, smoke pouring off bodies.)

SCULLY: They're dead.

(screams heard in distance)



SCENE 26

(MULDER and SCULLY enter warehouse.)

MAX FENIG: It hurts. It hurts. Please stop. It hurts.

MULDER: Max?

MAX FENIG: It hurts. It hurts.

MULDER: Max. Its alright.

MAX FENIG: It hurts. Stop it. No, no. It's me they... (helicopter can be heard overhead) They're coming for me. Now I know....They're coming for me. That's why they're here.
(Mulder motions to the helicopter and SCULLY leaves the warehouse.)



SCENE 27
(Outside warehouse. Military jeeps and transport vehicles pull up outside warehouse.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: gets out of jeep.)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Alpha team, secure the room.

OFFCAMERA: Stop right there. Put your hands up, and come with us.

(Scully is escorted by two men in fatigues to CCH. Two men in blue uniforms seen placing plastique on large loading dock doors)

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Alpha team ready on the roof.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Roger alpha .

DELTA TEAM LEADER: Delta team in position sir.

SCULLY: (to CCH) What are you doing? You have a very sick man in there.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: We're not in the hospital now, Doctor Scully.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Omega team report.

OMEGA TEAM LEADER: Omega Team in position.

SCULLY: He's a delusional schitzophrenic.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Keep her clear!

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Sir, this is Alpha Team Leader.(Looking through heat-source sensing device) I'm picking up three forms inside the structure.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Did you say three forms?

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Two are proximate. The third approaching from 30 meters.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: All teams prepare to go in 30 seconds



SCENE 28
(Inside warehouse)

MULDER: Come on. Come on, Max.

MAX FENIG: Why... Stop. Why?

MULDER: I'm hear to help you.

MAX FENIG: I'm scared.

MULDER: I know.

MAX FENIG: Don't let them take me.

MULDER: I won't let them take you. Come on, Max. Come with me.

MAX FENIG: NO!!

(Camera as creature rushes in towards Max and Mulder. Mulder is thrown clear. When he stands up, Max is gone)

MULDER: Max! Max!(Mulder limps off in another direction) MAX!

(Mulder sees Max suspended in a light in the middle of the warehouse. His feet aren't touching the ground. With explosive sound, light gets brighter. Max begins to shake. Mulder watches until light gets too bright. Light washes out.)



SCENE 29
(Outside warehouse)

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: Sir this is Alpha team leader. Except for our men, I'm only picking one figure inside.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: I *Do Not* copy that.

ALPHA TEAM LEADER: We indicate only one figure inside the building.

SCULLY: What?!

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Blow the door!

(Plastique blows off door. Men enter running. Mulder limps over to place where Max was. Picks up Max's NICAP hat which is lying on the floor.)

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Where is he?

MULDER: He's gone. They got to him first. They beat us Colonel.

COLONEL CALVIN HENDERSON: Arrest him...and keep looking.



SCENE 30
(Exterior shot of FBI Building)
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY HEARING
10:17 AM
DAY 4

(Scully sits at one end of a long table. Section Chief McGrath, a stenographer, and two other men in suits are sitting at the far end)

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Agent Scully, to the best of your knowledge was Agent Mulder ever assigned to investigate matters related to the evacuation of Townshend, Wisconson?

SCULLY: No, sir

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: At any time were you aware of his submitting a form 302 requesting said assignment or travel expenses?

SCULLY: No, sir.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: While in Wisconsin, did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus registered to the state car rental agency.

SCULLY: Yes.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Thank you, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Sir. Request permision to make a statement.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Request denied.

SCULLY: Sir, its unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You're dismissed Agent Scully.

SCULLY: But sir, I...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: THAT will be all.
(Scully stands up and leaves room)



SCENE 31
(Mulder sits in hallway, reading a newspaper. Crutches lean against the wall behind him.
Scully exits from room into hallway)

MULDER: Do you hear that sound Scully? (picks up crutches) Hammer and nails. They're building a gallows in the town square. Don't worry. (Scully bends down, picking up a large envelope) It was only a matter of time. (Hands envelope to Mulder) I'm surprised I lasted this long.

SCULLY: Good luck

MULDER: (limping on crutches) I'll break a leg.

(Dana watches Mulder enter room. Picks up paper and reads story: Title: Toxic Clean Up a Success Subtitle: Wisconsin residents allowed back to their homes)



SCENE 32

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: ...as well as insubordination and misconduct. How do you respond to these allegations, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Over a dozen men lost their lives and you want me to respond to issues of protocol?

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You failed to obtain proper authorization for your actions.

MULDER: Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: You also violated a federal quarantine....

MULDER: (Raising his voice) A cover up was underway...

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: (Raising his voice)...exposing yourself and possibly others to toxic contamination.

MULDER: (Yelling) Oh, toxic contamination? Are we back in that? You read my report, explain the disapearance of Max Fenig.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Your report is not the subject of this inquiry...

MULDER: I have further evidence to support my conclusions -- X-rays taken while Mr. Fenig was institutionalized show an object lodged in his cerrebelum (Waves the envelope)

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: That is irrelevant Agent Mulder.

MULDER: The man was abducted. We all know it. Everybody in this room knows it.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: (Increasingly agitated) Colonel Henderson's written testimony states that Fenig's body was found two hours later in a cargo container.

MULDER: Then what can I say? (Stands up) How can I disprove lies that are stamped with an official
seal?

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: That will be all Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: You can deny all the things I've seen. All the things I've discovered. But not for much longer. Because too many others know what's happening out there. And no one. No government agency has jurisdiction over the truth. (Takes crutches and envelope, and leaves)



SCENE 33
(Section chief McGrath stalks up to Deep Throat. Both are standing in the courtyard outside an office building)

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: Why did you countermand my decision? Mulder's conduct was in clear violation not only of bureau procedures but of federal law.

DEEP THROAT: Yes.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: I don't understand. The committee's case was air tight. You've ruined the last best chance we had to get rid of him.

DEEP THROAT: I appreciate your frustration, but you and I both know Mulder's work is a singular passion -- poses a most unique dilemma. But his occasional insubordination is in the end, far less dangerous.

SECTION CHIEF MCGRATH: With respect sir, less dangerous than what?

DEEP THROAT: Than having him exposed to the wrong people.What he knows...(laughs)... what he thinks he knows...(sighs) Always keep your friends close, Mr. McGrath... but keep your enemies closer.

(Deep Throat walks off.)

[THE END]
                                        EVE


SCENE 1
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT

A barking dog is heard in the distance. It's a nice upper class neighborhood. The camera pans to a white two story house. A couple jog by and look over at the house.

WOMAN: What's she doing there by herself?

(There is a little girl, Teena Simmons, 8, who is standing at the end of the driveway of the white house holding a big stuffed bunny. They jog to her.)

MAN: Teena?

WOMAN: Honey? (The woman reaches out to Teena.)

WOMAN: You're freezing. Where's your jacket?

MAN: Where's your Daddy?

TEENA: In the yard. He told me he needed some time to himself.

MAN: I'd say his time's up.

WOMAN: Come on, Honey. I'm sure he wouldn't want you to catch cold.



SCENE 2
BACKYARD

They go to the back yard. There is a man sitting in the backyard swing. The man walks to him as he talks.

MAN: Joel? Hey, Joel... The swing set's supposed to be for your daughter, not for you.

(He touches Joel and he falls to the side. He's pure white, has a ghost look on his face, glazed eyes and has two puncture marks on his neck. Teena screams.)

MAN: I'll call 911.

TEENA: Daddy?

SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS

Scully and Mulder in their office. Mulder is looking at slides.

SCULLY: Death by hypovolaemia. 95% blood loss. That's over 4 liters of blood.

MULDER: I'd say the man was running on empty.

SCULLY: The man's daughter, 8 years old... was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes. She doesn't remember anything, there was no trace evidence found at the crime scene.

MULDER: Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday's rain.

SCULLY: Oh, there were two small puncture wounds.

MULDER: Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations?

(He goes to the slide projector and shows slides of mutilated cattle to Scully as he talks.)

MULDER: Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilations. Trace evidence is remarkably similar. Incision marks of surgical precision. The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs have been removed. There's a substantial degree of blood loss but not a trace of blood at the scene.

SCULLY: How could that be?

MULDER: Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular of any living creature, the heart itself would act as a pump. These animals have had their jugulars punctured the same as the man in Greenwich, CT. Although this is the first time I've ever seen it on a human being.

SCULLY: But there was no sign of a struggle. How could a man just sit through a blood letting?

MULDER: The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Often there are related sightings in the sky near the incidences, along with surface burns...

MULDER: Witnesses often relate time loss. We've seen this in abduction cases. That might explain why the girl can't remember anything.

SCULLY: Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space in order to play doctor on cattle?

MULDER: For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.

(Mulder points to the slide of the father, Joel and his puncture wounds on his neck.)



SCENE 4
FAIRFIELD COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES HOSPITAL GREENWICH, CT

We see through the window that Teena is in a bed.

HALLWAY

A social worker leads Mulder and Scully through a hall and up some stairs.

SOCIAL WORKER: Her mother passed away from ovarian cancer two years ago. There's no other family. We'll keep Teena here until we can place her with a foster family.

MULDER: Has she spoken about it?

SOCIAL WORKER: No. Not a word.

MULDER: Any nightmares?

SOCIAL WORKER: No. At least, not that I know of.

(They get to a door with a round window and look in.)

SCULLY: Can we talk to her now?

(They knock on Teena's door and open it.)



SCENE 5
TEENA'S ROOM

They enter. Teena is sitting up in bed holding a stuffed bunny. Scully sits on Teena's bed. Mulder sits in a chair.

SOCIAL WORKER: Teena? These are the people we talked about. This is Miss Scully and Mr. Mulder. Do you think you could talk to them?

(Teena nods and the social worker leaves the room.)

SCULLY: Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. But we want to find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy. Okay?

(Teena nods.)

SCULLY: Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?

(Teena shakes her head no.)

SCULLY: Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?

TEENA: No.

SCULLY: Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy?

TEENA: No.

MULDER: Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? About what happened in the back yard?

(Teena nods hesitantly.)

MULDER: Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?

TEENA: There was Red Lightening.

MULDER: Can you tell me more about the Red Lightening?

TEENA: I can't remember... it all went dark.

MULDER: Had you ever seen anything like that before?

(Teena nods.)

MULDER: Yeah? When?

TEENA: The men from the clouds, they were after my dad.

(Scully's phone rings. She answers it away from the bed and Mulder and Teena.)

SCULLY: Scully... Where?

MULDER: Why were these men after your Dad?

TEENA: They wanted to exsanguinate him.

(Mulder looks at Teena with surprise such a little girl would know such a word.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Mulder joins Scully.)

SCULLY: There's been another one.



SCENE 6
REARDON CRIME SCENE - MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

In a back yard of a similar home as the Greenwich house, a back yard swing set is shown. Mulder and Scully walk in from the driveway. Scully is holding a file.

MULDER: It's like looking at a mirror image.

SCULLY: The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause of death, hypovilemia. Mulder, this is crazy. They also found traces of the poison digitalis.

MULDER: Puncture wounds?

SCULLY: Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2:30 p.m. Same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.

MULDER: That's Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment.

SCULLY: It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.

MULDER: No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they kill together not separately.

SCULLY: Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.

MULDER: Is Reardon's daughter nearby when he was murdered?

(She looks in the file again. )

SCULLY: Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Ah... she's with her mother and family in Sacramento.

MULDER: When will they be back?

(She reads again.)

SCULLY: Tomorrow.

MULDER: Even money... she'll remember Red Lightening.



SCENE 7
FAIRFIELD COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES HOSTEL 12:35 AM E.S.T.

It is night. There is a storm outside. Lightening and thunder. Teena is in bed. She is holding her stuffed bunny. She lifts her head off the pillow. She looks at the window and gets out of bed. She checks through the window in the door if someone is in the hall. She pushes a chair in front of it. Someone on the other side of the door is trying to break in. Teena hides under the bed. Someone enters the room. Teena tries to make a break for it. A figure grabs her arm.



SCENE 8
HALLWAY

We hear Teena's scream. Thunder and lightening pounding. The social worker comes.

SOCIAL WORKER: Teena? Teena? Teena!

All that remains is Teena's stuffed bunny by the open window. Rain beating down on it.



SCENE 9
REARDON HOUSE - NEXT DAY

Mulder and Scully get out of the car and talk as they get to the house.

SCULLY: She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. last night. Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.

MULDER: Someone or something, Scully.

SCULLY: Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an hour. Nothing.

MULDER: Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction. (He points up.)

SCULLY: I told them to contact us if they happen to find her.

(Mulder knocks on the door. It opens. Standing there is a little girl that looks exactly like Teena Simmons. Mulder and Scully just stare at her for a second.)

SCULLY: Teena?

CINDY: No.

SCULLY: What's your name?

CINDY: Cindy Reardon.

MULDER: You live here, Cindy?

CINDY: Ever since I was born, 8 years ago.



SCENE 10
REARDON HOUSE - LATER

Inside, Cindy is watching cartoons as Mulder and Scully watch her from a distance. Cindy picks up the remote and turns the channel to a news conference. She puts the remote down. She's interested. Scully looks at Mulder as Mrs. Reardon enters with a tray of tea.

MULDER: Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon.

MRS REARDON: Doug and I wanted to spoil her. We wanted to protect her from everything horrible in the world. She was daddy's little girl.

(She starts to softly cry.)

MULDER: Is she an only child?

(Mrs. Reardon nods.)

SCULLY: May I ask... Was Cindy adopted?

MRS REARDON: No. I gave birth to her at San Rafael General.

(Cindy listens to what they are saying.)

SCULLY: So, I assume you have all the proper documentation. Birth certificate...

MRS REARDON: Of course I do.

MULDER: Was she the only child delivered at that birth?

MRS REARDON: What the hell kind of question is that? Look, I have told the police everything I know.

(Mulder shows Mrs. Reardon a picture of Teena and Mr. Simmons.)

MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?

MRS REARDON: This... is this your suspect?

MULDER: No.

MRS REARDON: Did he do something to Cindy?

MULDER: No... he... he did... he didn't...

SCULLY: No. Mrs. Reardon. This is not your daughter. That girl's name is Teena Simmons. She lives 3,000 miles away in Connecticut. That man, her father, was killed in the same manner as your husband.

MRS REARDON: Cindy is my daughter. I can show you videos of her birth. We tried for six years to become pregnant.

MULDER: In vitro fertilization?

(She nods.)

MULDER: At which clinic?

MRS REARDON: Luther Stapes Center. Down in San Francisco.

MULDER: Thanks.



SCENE 11
OUTSIDE

Scully and Mulder leave the house and talk on the way to the car.

SCULLY: Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn't see Red Lightening.

MULDER: I don't know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn't seem to be their appearance.

SCULLY: Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people can have an unrelated likeness.

MULDER: Who both just happened to see their father's exsanguinated. I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas.

(Scully seems to agree.)



SCENE 12
CAR

Mulder and Scully get in.

SCULLY: The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.

MULDER: One girl was just abducted.

SCULLY: Kidnaped.

MULDER: Potato, potahto.

(Mulder stops the car.)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: The murders were committed by the same person or persons. Part of the pattern involves kidnaping the daughter.

SCULLY: And you expect the pattern to continue.

MULDER: I'm going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. See if the Simmons were enrolled in the same fertility program.

(He opens the door and gets out.)

SCULLY: Okay. I'll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.

MULDER: Okay.

(He shuts the door.)



SCENE 13
LUTHER STAPES CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE

A doctor and Scully walk up the stairs and talk.

DOCTOR: In vitro fertilization is a procedure in which we can implement fertilization. An implantation of the embryo to the uterus.

SCULLY: Could a patient have believed she was receiving her own eggs but actually receive another without her knowledge?

DOCTOR: Not here. We have very strict controls.

SCULLY: Are you ever aware of having patients by the name of Claudia and Joel Simmons?

DOCTOR: Any information about patients is confidential. That's our policy.

SCULLY: Both the Simmons are dead. And their daughter has been kidnaped. I think any information that you have that could help overrides your policy.



SCENE 14
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

Scully is looking at a file and reads.

SCULLY: You have copies of their records sent to Greenwich, CT, in 1991... They came here 9 years ago under the supervision of a Dr. Sally Kendrick?

(No answer.)

SCULLY: There a problem?

DOCTOR: Dr. Kendrick was nothing but a problem.

(They watch a video tape of Sally Kendrick giving a lecture. She is sharp looking and professional. Wearing a lab coat and in an office. She smiles as she talks.)

SALLY KENDRICK ON TAPE: Hello. And welcome to the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine. (She sits on the desk.) I'm Dr. Sally Kendrick, a specialist in the exciting field of in vitro fertilization.

DOCTOR: She was a resident here in 1985. Brilliant. First in her class at Yale med where she got her MD. After completing her doctorate in Bio Genetics, we were thrilled to get her.

SCULLY: And now you don't sound too thrilled.

DOCTOR: We have reason to believe that Dr. Kendrick was tampering with genetic material that was fertilized in the lab prior to implant. Experimenting with Eugenics.

SCULLY: Did you report this to the AMA?

DOCTOR: Of course. And I fired her. And also requested an investigation with the Health Department.

SCULLY: And what happened?

DOCTOR: The AMA censured her. My request for an investigation was denied. Dr. Kendrick disappeared.

DR KENDRICK ON TAPE: We know the pain of infertility and we are ready to help. In the next half hour, I'll guide you through...

(We watch the tape again as it melds into another TV and VCR showing the same tape with Scully's voice over.)



SCENE 15
HOTEL ROOM

Mulder and Scully are sitting on the end of a bed watching the tape. Scully talks over the tape.

SCULLY: Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon's and Simmons' IVF program. It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.

MULDER: Maybe now she's trying to erase the results?

(They watch the tape again.)

DR KENDRICK ON TAPE: ... can't guarantee everyone's success, but with our scientific advances, a little luck, and a lot of hope... miracles can happen.

SCULLY: Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders.

MULDER: So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against the Stapes Center?

(The phone rings. Scully answers it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection? (to phone) Hello?

(There's two clicks on the phone. )

SCULLY: Hello?

(She hangs up.)

SCULLY: Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number.

MULDER: I'll tell you what... I'm going to sleep on it and we'll talk about it in the morning.

(He guides her to the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.

MULDER: No, I'm not.

SCULLY: You got a girl coming over?

MULDER: What's a girl?

(He opens the door.)

MULDER: No, I have... there's a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. See you in the morning.



SCENE 16
PIER

Mulder waits and looks around. He walks by bushes and hears Deep Throat's voice. He stops.

DEEP THROAT: Are you certain she hasn't followed you?

MULDER: Yes. What are you doing here?

(Deep Throat comes out of the bushes and they walk as they talk.)

DEEP THROAT: I was hoping we could take in a Warriors game. Actually I was just in the neighborhood... Wondered if I ever told you about the Lichfield Experiments.

MULDER: No you haven't.

DEEP THROAT: Well, it was the most interesting project. Highest level of classification. All records have since been destroyed. And those who knew of it, denied knowledge of its existence. It existed during the height of the cold war. We got wind the Russians were fooling around with Eugenics. Rather primitively, I might add. Trying to crossbreed top scientists, athletes... to come up with the superior soldier. Naturally, we jumped on the band wagon.



SCENE 17
WHITING INSTITUTE FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE

Deep Throat's voice over continues as we see the outside of the institute that looks like a prison.

MULDER VOICE OVER: The Lichfield Experiment.

DEEP THROAT VOICE OVER: A group of genetically controlled children. Raised and monitored on a compound in Lichfield. The boys were called Adam and the girls were called Eve. There's a woman you should see and I'll make sure that you can get in.



SCENE 18
INSIDE

Scully and Mulder go to a desk to sign in by a guard.

MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully. We're here to see Eve 6.

GUARD: Deposit your fire arms.

(They do.)

GUARD: Sign for these.

(He puts two contraptions on the desk.)

MULDER: What are those?

GUARD: Panic buttons. Can't let you inside without one.



SCENE 19
LATER

They are being led through a series of corridors, stairs and cages. All metal and mesh. They stop by a cell door. The female security guard gives them both flashlights.

SCULLY: Why the flashlights?

GUARD: She screams and screams if we turn the over heads on. No one's ever gotten a good look at her.

(Mulder and Scully are going to go into the cell.)

GUARD: We'll be right outside.



SCENE 20
INSIDE CELL

Mulder and Scully turn the flashlights on. It's a dirty cell with garbage all over. Padded walls.

MULDER: Hello? (They see Eve 6 crouching in the corner on the floor with shackles. Eve 6 has dirty hair and yellow teeth. There are pictures on the wall.)

EVE 6: Well it looks like you got what you're looking for... One of us at least.

SCULLY: Sally Kendrick...

EVE 6: Cut off the chains... then we'll talk.

MULDER: They're probably there for a good reason.

EVE 6: No. Bad reason. I paid too much attention to a guard. Bit into his eyeball. (She giggles and makes gnashing sounds.) I meant it as a sign of affection. (She laughs.) Are you going to give me an IQ test by any chance? I think I can top 265. We're very bright, we Eves. It runs in the family.

MULDER: Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves?

EVE 6: All that's left is me. And Eve 7, she escaped early on. And Eve 8. She escaped 10 years later.

SCULLY: Are you Sally Kendrick?

EVE 6: That's not my name. But she is me and I am her and we are together.

(She thinks this is funny too.)

SCULLY: Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine in 1985?

EVE 6: 1985?! I've been tied up like this for two years and for what reason? For no reason, I did nothing. I'm just me. They made me. But did they suffer? No. No. I suffer. I suffer! They keep me alive for the Lichfield Project , they come in... they test me, they poke me... to see what went wrong. Sally knows what went wrong.

(She was almost spitting out the words. She points to them as best she can with her hands tied.)

EVE 6: You and you. You have 46 chromosomes. The Adams and the Eves ... we have 56. We have extra chromosomes. Number 4, 5, 12, 16, and 22. This replication of chromosomes also produces additional genes. Heightened strength. Heightened intelligence.

MULDER: Heightened psychosis.

EVE 6: Saved the best for last. (She looks at them.) You don't believe me. I have proof. Look on the wall. My family album.

(One of the pictures on the wall is of many clones of Teena and Cindy by a swing set.)

SCULLY: My God. It's the girls.

EVE 6: We were close. We were very close.

MULDER: Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. She was cloning herself.



SCENE 21
REARDON HOUSE

There are religious picture on the wall as we hear Cindy's voice over reciting a prayer.

CINDY VOICE OVER: Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord, my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake... (She is bent by the bed and her mother is watching her while sitting on the bed.) I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Grandma and Grandpa Stenner, Erma and ___, and please bless Mom, and please take care of Daddy up in heaven.

MRS REARDON: You're such a special little girl, Cindy. (She tucks her into bed.) Good night, Honey.



SCENE 22
OUTSIDE HOUSE

The upstairs light is turned off.



SCENE 23
CAR

Mulder and Scully are in the car watching the house.

MULDER: Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. That could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time. Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice. Herself.

SCULLY: Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls.

MULDER: No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Teena and Cindy in the family.



SCENE 24
CINDY'S ROOM

The lights are off and Cindy gets out of bed.



SCENE 25
CAR

Scully looks at Cindy's window with binoculars. Cindy is standing at the window.

SCULLY: You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are?

MULDER: I hope not.

(A bright light appears in Cindy's room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, let's go.



SCENE 26
CINDY'S ROOM

The closet fills with light and the doors open. Light floods the room. Cindy turns around and someone comes out of the closet and takes Cindy's arm.



SCENE 27
CAR

Mulder and Scully get out of the car.

MULDER: I'll take the back.

(They take off in different directions.)



SCENE 28
OUTSIDE HOUSE

Mulder goes around the side of the house on the driveway with his flashlight and gun.



SCENE 29
INSIDE HOUSE

The lights are off and Scully walks through the house with her gun poised. She meets up with Mrs. Reardon.

SCULLY: There's someone upstairs, wait outside.



SCENE 30
OUTSIDE HOUSE

Mulder comes around to the back yard.



SCENE 31
INSIDE HOUSE

Scully gets to the top of the stairs and is blind sided. She is knocked down by a force.



SCENE 32
OUTSIDE HOUSE

The patio door bursts and a woman holding Cindy comes out of the house. Mulder points his gun.

MULDER: FBI. I'm armed.

((I'm not sure if this is the real Sally Kendrick who is Eve 7 or this is just Eve 7 or what, but I'll call this one Eve 7.)) Eve 7 holding Cindy stops and looks at him. She's wearing a dark sweatshirt with the hood over her head.

MULDER: Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8?

(Eve 7 points a gun at Cindy's head.)

EVE 7: Drop it. You know I'm capable. Slow. Real slow.

(Mulder puts his gun on the ground. Eve 7 takes off and Mulder stoops to pick up his gun and follows her. A car starts and he runs after it as it takes off down the alleyway.)



SCENE 33
LATER

Scully is talking to a cop filling out a report.

SCULLY: Suspect's name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40's, 5'8, 135 pounds. Now she may have an accomplice, similar in appearance. Kendrick is driving a light blue '93 Corolla. She has exceptional strength for her size. So you must consider her armed and dangerous. Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behavior. The Oakland Bureau was here to orchestrate a search across the bridge.

(She leaves the cop and joins Mrs. Reardon wrapped in a blanket and Mulder.)

MRS REARDON: What if she kills her?

MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice murdered the fathers and abducted the girls means they want them alive. I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.

(Mrs. Reardon walks away crying.)

SCULLY: And then what do we do?



SCENE 34
PT. REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE - 40 MILES NORTH OF SAN FRANCISCO

A vacancy sign is lit with a car driving up to the hotel. The manager does gardening and watches as the car parks and a woman, an Eve gets out and walks into a hotel kitchenette with the girl.



SCENE 35
INSIDE

They enter.

EVE 7: I'm sorry you have to meet this way. But it's the best for all concerned.

(Eve 7 opens the bathroom door. Teena is sitting on the edge of the tub. Cindy hangs by the door. Eve 7 sits on the tub with Teena.)

EVE 7: Teena Simmons, meet Cindy Reardon.

(They look each other over and smile.)



SCENE 36
REARDON HOUSE

Scully and Mulder come downstairs. A female cop meets them. Mulder is on his cell phone.

COP: Agent Scully? They found the Corolla in the parking lot at San Francisco International.

SCULLY: Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single passenger for every flight that left the terminal over the past twelve hours. I want you to check every single terminal to make sure she's not hiding out somewhere for a later flight. And remember, she may have an accomplice.

(Mulder hangs up.)

MULDER: That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he's got a guest that matches Sally Kendrick's description.

SCULLY: We just found the car at the airport.

MULDER: She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman checked in with a little girl. That she leaves the hotel in the afternoon by herself, was gone all night and returns the next day with the little girl.

SCULLY: Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the manager knowing about it. The place is crawling with vacationing families. There would be hundreds of little kids running around.

MULDER: No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine to irradiate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool. Does that sound like someone we know?

SCULLY: That's it.



SCENE 37
HOTEL

Sally prepares fast food for them and sits at the table with the girls.

EVE 7: I've always kept and close eye on your behavior. No matter where I was. The last few years I've spent in search of the remaining Eves. That however was cut short by your... activity. I hoped my work at the Stapes Center had corrected the Lichfield flaws. Psychotic behavior didn't develop in the Adams and Eves until age 16. Homicidal behavior... at 20. Imagine my... disappointment when I learned of your... accelerated development. How did you know of each other's existence?

TEENA AND CINDY: We just knew.

EVE 7: Did you discuss how you would orchestrate your little... prank?

TEENA AND CINDY: We just knew.

EVE 7: Why murder your fathers?

TEENA OR CINDY (who knows which is which): They weren't our fathers.

THE OTHER ONE: We have no parents.

THE FIRST ONE: We weren't born.

THE OTHER ONE: We were created.

EVE 7: You cannot think that way. You're human beings. Different, special, but you cannot give into genetic destiny. That's why I've taken you. I was raised by a man who knew what I was. He was a genetic engineer on the project. With the... proper environment, and a program... of long term medication... you can become like me... and not the other Eves...

(She is breathing heavy. Sally starts shaking the table. The girls smile at each other. She gets up and is about the throw up.)

EVE 7: What... what have you done to ... me?

TEENA OR CINDY: Your soda...

THE OTHER ONE: 4 ounces of foxglove...

THE FIRST ONE: ...extracted from the digitalis plant...

(The other one makes a measurement of about a half inch between her pointing finger and thumb.)

THE OTHER ONE: This much is a lethal dose.

THE FIRST ONE: We cultivated it ourselves.

EVE 7: Wh... why?

TEENA OR CINDY: You tell us.

THE OTHER ONE: You made us.

THE FIRST ONE: We're your mistake.

(Eve tries to get a grip by the counter. )

EVE 7: That I'll correct... my mistake.



SCENE 38
LATER

Mulder and Scully arrive. Cops are already there. He's in the front seat of his prowler. Mulder and Scully walk to him and he gets out.

COP: I waited like you told me. No one's gotten out and no one's gotten in.

(They hear a noise.)

COP: Get the back!

(They all rush to the hotel room.)



SCENE 39
INSIDE

They enter and see Eve on the floor. Mulder looks both ways out the open window as Scully checks for a pulse.

TEENA OR CINDY: They left.

(Scully sees the girls huddled in a corner.)

SCULLY: Who's they?

OTHER ONE: Her and another lady.

FIRST ONE: We were all supposed to drink but we only pretended to drink it.

OTHER ONE: They tried to poison us.

(The girls hug, scared.)

MULDER: What did the other lady look like?

(They point at the dead Eve 7 on the floor.)

MULDER: Eve 8. They were working together.

SCULLY: It's alright. We'll take care of you. You're safe with us.



SCENE 40
LATER

A sheet is put over Sally. Scully picks up a glass from the table. She looks at it and hands it to Mulder.

SCULLY: Looks like the Eves mixed about 4 ounces of digitalis in each glass.

MULDER: Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.

SCULLY: It has a sweet flavor. It's probably not even perceptible in soda.

(A cop comes up to them.)

COP: We're still searching the area but still no sign of the other suspect. We'll have an officer take the girls back.

MULDER: Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls.

SCULLY: We could take them to get checked out by a doctor.

COP: Okay, whatever.



SCENE 41
OUTSIDE

Scully walks to the girls.

SCULLY: We're going to take you back.

CINDY: Back where? What's going to happen to Teena?

(They get in the back seat.)

SCULLY: They've already grown so attached. It's going to be hard when Teena gets placed in foster care.

MULDER: Yeah.

(Mulder and Scully get in.)



SCENE 42
ROAD - NIGHT

Mulder is driving. Scully in front passenger seat and the girls in the back. They look at each other.

TEENA OR CINDY: Agent Mulder, I have to go to the bathroom.

OTHER ONE: Me too.

MULDER: Can you hold it?

FIRST ONE: I really need to go.

SCULLY: I could use some caffeine.



SCENE 43
TRUCK STOP

They drive up.



SCENE 44
INSIDE

They walk up to the counter. There's a waitress behind the counter.

MULDER: Hi. Where's your bathrooms?

WAITRESS: In the back. Let me get you the key.

(She hands them to him.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He gives the woman's key to Scully and turns back to the counter.)

MULDER: Oh, can I get four diet sodas?

TEENA AND CINDY: Regular.

MULDER: Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please.

(Scully and the girls go to the woman's restroom.)



SCENE 45
WOMAN'S RESTROOM

We see the closed stall doors.

TEENA OR CINDY VOICE OVER: Agent Scully, my door's stuck.

SCULLY VOICE OVER: Just a second.

(One of the girls leaves.)



SCENE 46
COUNTER

The girl goes to the counter and takes two of the drinks. The waitress stops her.

WAITRESS: Just a minute.

TEENA OR CINDY: That's okay. My dad will pay for them when he gets out of the bathroom.

(She brings the drinks to a table and puts poison in them. Mulder comes up behind her.)

MULDER: Those are the diet?

(She points to two drinks.)

TEENA OR CINDY: I think these are.

(He takes a drink.)

MULDER: Are you sure? These are really sweet.

TEENA OR CINDY: I know they are. I saw her pour it.

MULDER: Okay.

(Scully and the other girl comes out.)

SCULLY: Let's go.

MULDER: Come on.

(He gives his drink to Scully and puts his hand on the back of the girl and they walk to the door. Scully and the other girl go outside.)

TEENA OR CINDY: Don't forget the drinks.

(Mulder and the girl come back to counter to pay for them.)

MULDER: How much?

WAITRESS: $5.

(Mulder gives money to the girl.)

MULDER: You want to pay?

TEENA OR CINDY: Sure.

MULDER: Thanks.

(He says to the waitress and they walk to the door.)



SCENE 47
OUTSIDE

They all walk outside. Scully takes a drink.

SCULLY: Um, tastes syrupy.

(Mulder pats his pockets.)

MULDER: You didn't pick up my keys off the counter, did you?

(She shakes her head.)

MULDER: All right. I'll be right back.

(Scully smiles and she and the girls walk to the car. Mulder goes back inside. )



SCENE 48
INSIDE

Mulder sees a green residue on the table where the drinks were.



SCENE 49
OUTSIDE

Mulder bursts out of the truck stop as Scully takes another drink.

MULDER: SCULLY!

SCULLY: What?

(He rushes down the stairs to her.)

MULDER: I just wanted to open the car door for you.

(He knocks the drink out of her hand.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER (to Scully, quietly so the girls won't hear): It's them, they poisoned them, let's just get them into the car.

(The girls are gone.)

MULDER: I only had a sip.

SCULLY: We didn't drink enough to make us sick.

(They look around for them. Guns raised. Neat shots through pipes as Scully passes, etc. Teena and Cindy walk under a semi bed and Mulder grabs them. They scream.)

MULDER: SCULLY! I GOT THEM!

TEENA AND CINDY: LEAVE US ALONE!

MULDER: SCULLY!

(A truck driver comes with a shotgun and his wife.)

TRUCK DRIVER: HEY! What the hell are you doing?

(Scully runs up.)

MULDER: Back off. We're federal agents.

TRUCK DRIVER: Yeah, and these are America's Most Wanted? Hands in front.

TEENA AND CINDY: LEAVE US ALONE!

TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE: Get in the truck, girls.

(The girls get out of Mulder's clench.)

TRUCK DRIVER'S WIFE: Get in. I'm going to call the police.

SCULLY: We are the police.

(The girls take off.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(They search for them again. A bus leaves.)

TRUCK DRIVER: They went that way.

(He points to the truck stop. They go into the truck stop again.)



SCENE 50
TRUCK STOP

Mulder and Scully run in. They see the waitress.

SCULLY: Did you see the twins we were with?

WAITRESS: No. There's a bunch of school kids just left in that bus.



SCENE 51
OUTSIDE

Mulder and Scully go outside and into their car. It drives behind a truck, pauses, then takes off after the bus. Teena and Cindy get out of a boat with a tarp on it. Mulder comes up behind them.

MULDER: Forget your sodas?

TEENA: We didn't do anything wrong.

CINDY: We're just little girls.

MULDER: That's the last thing you are.



SCENE 52
REARDON HOUSE

She is looking at pictures of Cindy.

MRS REARDON: They said they have an excellent program that can help her.

MULDER: They can't hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have every right to know what happened. You have a right to know about your daughter.

MRS REARDON: All I need to know is she was not my daughter. She never was.



SCENE 53
CELLS

In adjoining cells, Teena and Cindy are next to Eve 6. They look at her. They are now labeled Eves 9 and 10.

EVE 6: Hello girls. So nice to have company.



SCENE 54
GUARD STATION

A woman in a white lab coat is signing in. He gives her a panic button.

GUARD: Sign for this.
(She does.)



SCENE 55
CELLS

The lab coated woman goes to the cell doors.

EVE 9: Hello Eve 8.

EVE 8: How did you know I'd come for you?

EVE 10: We've been waiting.

EVE 8: How did you know I'd come for you?

EVE 9: We just knew.

EVE 10: We just knew.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
BOSHAM, ENGLAND
70 MILES SOUTHWEST OF LONDON

(A man goes out of his house, holding hands with his young wife as gardeners shuffle around)

MAN: Hmm, yes.

(He kisses her.)

Love you.

(He walks down the walkway with his cane, looking at the various gardeners.)

Hello.

GARDENER: Good morning, sir.

MAN: Good morning.

(He goes over to a man, Cecil L'Ively, trimming the flower bushes.)

Good morning, Cecil.

L'IVELY: Top of the morning to you

(The man walks to his car. The chauffeur opens the door and the man turns and waves goodbye. Cecil watches intently.)

Eh, thank you. Goodbye, darling.

WOMAN: Goodbye, Charles. When can I expect you?

MAN: Before supper.

(He looks at his arm. It is on fire. The woman gasps as he begins spinning around, screaming. The men start running towards him, all except Cecil. The man is completely engulfed in flames now, and he spins around before falling, screaming horrifically. The men scream various commands to each other as they run over to try to put out the fire. Cecil watches the fire dance, a smile on his face.)

SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and Scully walk to their car. Mulder is carrying a stack of books.)

SCULLY: I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court.

MULDER: Well, that's one of the luxuries of hunting down aliens and genetic mutants. You rarely get to press charges.

(He puts the books on the top of the car and reaches into his pocket to take out the keys. Scully laughs and opens the door.)

SCULLY: It's open.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: It's unlocked.

MULDER: That's weird. I'm sure I locked it.

SCULLY: Must be an X-File.

(She gets in the car. He smiles, takes the books and gets in the car.)

What's that?

(Mulder looks to see a cassette sitting on the dashboard.)

MULDER: I told you I locked the door.

(He takes the tape out of it's case and looks at it.)

SCULLY: What do you think it is?

MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.

(He puts the tape in and it plays. A woman with a British accent speaks.)

WOMAN: Greetings, Agent Mulder. Six months ago, British Minister of Parliament Reggie Ellicott received an audio cassette much like the one you are listening to now.

(Mulder recognizes the voice and starts looking around.)

Unfortunately for Mr. Ellicott, when he popped the tape into the car stereo, he armed a device, which, when he tried to exit the car, created an explosion that was heard five miles away. The Scotland Yard Forensic Team could only identify the poor bastard by his dental records. If only he hadn't reached for the door handle and triggered the detonator. But then how was he to know he was sitting on enough plastique explosive to lift the car forty feet in the air and deposit the engine block on top of a three-story building?

(The door opens and Scully gasps. A woman, Phoebe Green, looks in. She was the woman on the tape.)

GREEN: Aren't we looking rather ghostly?

MULDER: (to Scully) It's an old friend.

(He gets out of the car.)

GREEN: Aren't you going to thank me?

MULDER: For what?

GREEN: Saving your life. One tends not to make the same mistake twice.

MULDER: I'll try to remember that.

GREEN: Oh, come on, don't tell me you left your sense of humor in Oxford ten years ago?

MULDER: No, actually. It's one of the few things you didn't drive a stake through.

(Scully gets out of the car and looks at them. Green kisses Mulder. Scully seems uncomfortable with that.)

GREEN: You know, some mistakes are quite worth making twice.

MULDER: Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green, terror of Scotland Yard.

GREEN: Hello.

SCULLY: Hello.

GREEN (whispering): She hates me.

MULDER: What brings you to the colonies?



SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Mulder is sitting down and looking at pictures of severely charred men. Phoebe is sitting across from him, Scully is standing.)

GREEN: Some clever bloke has been giving the aristocracy a good scare. Killed off a ranking member of Parliament or three for good measure. Set Windsor Castle ablaze in 1992.

MULDER: Your car bomber?

GREEN: No. This one likes to burn his victims alive. Can't figure out how he does it either. Not a crumb of evidence left at the crime scene. The last one died in his front garden, his poor young wife watching helplessly as he went up in smoke.

MULDER: The Irish Republican Army?

GREEN: Our suspect likes to send love letters to his victims' wives.

(She stands up.)

Sent one to the wife of Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago. Three days later, he narrowly escaped a fire in his garage. Burned to the ground. So they're renting a place out on Cape Cod. Bringing the family over to the states for an extended holiday or until we can catch the dirty bugger.

MULDER: You think he's that determined?

GREEN: Judging by his success, he seems to take a certain delight in his work.

MULDER: So what brings you on this detour to Washington, D.C., Inspector?

GREEN: I figured my friend Mulder couldn't resist a three-pipe problem.

MULDER: I'll run it by our arson specialist.

GREEN: Splendid. I'll call London, let them know.

(Mulder nods. Green walks over to the chair, takes her coat and bag, and opens the door. She turns back and looks at Scully.)

Oh, goodbye.

(Scully waves goodbye. Phoebe leaves.)

SCULLY: Three-pipe problem?

MULDER: That's, uh, from Sherlock Holmes. It's a private joke.

SCULLY: How private?

MULDER: Um... we knew each other in school in England. She was brilliant and, uh, I got in over my head and, uh, paid the price.

SCULLY: Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower.

(She gets up, as does he. He puts on his coat.)

MULDER: That was over ten years ago, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah, I noticed how you couldn't drop everything fast enough in order to help her out.

MULDER: Oh, I was merely extending her a professional courtesy.

SCULLY: Oh, is that what you were extending?

MULDER: Look, I'm going to run this by the arson guys and then she's on her own.

SCULLY: Something tells me you're not going to get rid of her that easily.

(He opens the door and looks at her, then walks out.)



SCENE 4
ARSON LAB
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Mulder is sitting in the back. Phoebe is holding a remote control. On the slide viewscreen, there is a picture of fire. Agent Beatty, the arson specialist, stands in front of it.)

BEATTY: Beautiful.

(The slide changes to more flames.)

BEATTY: Oh, just beautiful. Look at that. Salmon red flames. This is fourteen-hundred, fifteen-hundred degrees. This is a work of art.

(Slide changes to a burnt body.)

BEATTY: Was there any kind incendiary device used?

GREEN: Yes, actually. The victim's body.

BEATTY: Spontaneous combustion?

GREEN: He was murdered. However, we've turned up no evidence that tells us how the body caught fire.

(The slides go off.)

BEATTY: Well, that's peculiar. People don't normally just catch on fire.

(Scully takes a peek in. The specialist starts around the desk to Phoebe.)

BEATTY: I mean, we burn, but we don't conduct all that well. There's usually some kind of extraneous fuel involved like candle wax, gasoline, something flammable and incendiary that adheres to the skin.

GREEN: Like an accelerant.

BEATTY: Like an accelerant, yes.

GREEN: But we found no trace of anything, save for a dusting of magnesium at two of the sites.

BEATTY: That's aliphatic pyrolysis. It's a residue remaining after an exothermic reaction.

GREEN: But there's no evidence of the source, no pour patterns or ignition devices.

BEATTY: There have been some arson fires in Seattle lately and, uh, Pennsylvania that burn so hot that the firemen can't put them out. 7,000 degrees. I mean, hosing that down just makes it worse.

MULDER: How's that?

BEATTY: Uh, the, uh, reaction is so intense that it splits the water into hydrogen and oxygen. Just adds fuel to the fire.

GREEN: What were they using?

BEATTY: We don't know for sure. Could be rocket fuel. That stuff burns so hot and clean, there's never any trace left. You see, it's very difficult to prove arson. It's driving the insurance companies nuts.

(He and Phoebe laugh.)

BEATTY: Well, that's about the only explanation that I can give you.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: But there have been cases of pyrokinetics, people who can control and conduct fire.

BEATTY: Well, I've seen fire bend around corners, seen it bounce like a rubber ball. Fire's got a certain genius, you know? A certain demon poetry. It's like it's got a mind of it's own. But I've never seen one that can defy the laws of physics, not when you figure it out. You've, uh...

(He looks at Phoebe.)

BEATTY: You've got quite a case for yourself here, Mulder. I almost wish I could be in your shoes.

(Mulder and Green look at each other.)



SCENE 5
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(Cecil L'Ively is dressed as a handyman, painting the walls with argotypoline, a kind of rocket fuel. He looks through the window and sees a towncar drive up, followed by a rental truck. The door opens and a dog runs out, followed by two boys, Jimmie and Michael.)

JIMMIE: Hey, Jackson... boy, that's a nice house.

LADY MARSDEN: Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

L'IVELY: Welcome to America, Sir Malcolm.

(Sir Malcolm Marsden gets out of the car and goes to the other three. They talk to each other, but we can't understand it. L'Ively pulls out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. It lights by itself. He takes a few puffs. Some men walk in with boxes, led by Sir and Lady Marsden.)

MOVER: Where would you like these boxes?

LADY MARSDEN: Right there.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Over there, please, thank you.

LADY MARSDEN: And over there, as well. But the second one I want upstairs.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Gentlemen, the second set of boxes will go directly upstairs.

LADY MARSDEN: All right?

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you very much.

(L'Ively starts down the stairs, carrying paint cans. He stops at the couple, who are standing on the stairs.)

L'IVELY: (with American accent) Hello there.

LADY MARSDEN: Hello.

L'IVELY: I'm Bob the caretaker. We've been exchanging letters?

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Oh, good heavens, yes of course, Bob. How are you?

(They shake hands.)

L'IVELY: Pleased to meet you.

(He shakes hands with her as well.)

LADY MARSDEN: Hi.

L'IVELY: Hi. Just trying to spruce the place up for you.

LADY MARSDEN: Well, it's delightful. The photos don't do it justice.

L'IVELY: Anything I can do for you, anything at all, you just holler.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you, Bob.

LADY MARSDEN: Thanks.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Thank you very much.

(L'Ively walks down the stairs past them as they start up.)

Seems like a rather nice fellow, don't you think?

LADY MARSDEN: Very.

(They walk up the stairs and see a painting. It is of Lady Marsden.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: My God, darling. That painting rather looks like you. What do you think?

LADY MARSDEN: Oh, I don't know.

(Outside, the boys are playing soccer. Cecil walks out and looks at them.)

JIMMIE: I've never been good at this.

(Cecil smiles and hears the dog whimpering. He looks over at the dog, who is digging up something a little ways into the woods. He walks up and kicks the dog away. The dog starts barking at him.)

L'IVELY: Bloody little cur, I'll skin you alive.

(The dog whimpers and backs away. Cecil and the dog look at the ground. A hand is sticking out.)

See? I'm the caretaker now.



SCENE 6
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Mulder walks in and sees Scully sitting at the desk, reading a file.)

SCULLY: So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?

MULDER: I'm afraid so, Watson. But you're off the hook on this one.

(He closes the door. She takes off her glasses.)

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: I mean I'm not going to put you through this.

(He pulls a file out of the file cabinet and walks over to her.)

SCULLY: Put me through what?

MULDER: Phoebe's little mindgame.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully.

(He sighs, kneels down and starts digging through the bottom drawer of another file cabinet.)

I hate fire. Hate it. Scared to death of it.

(He sighs again.)

When I was a kid, my best friend's house burned down. Had to spend the night in the rubble to keep away looters. For years, I had nightmares about being trapped in a burning building.

(He pulls out a file and stands up.)

SCULLY: Wait, and Phoebe knows about this?

MULDER: This is classic Phoebe Green. Mindgame player extraordinaire. Ten years it's taken me to forget about this woman, and she shows up in my life with a case like this.

SCULLY: So she shows up knowing the power she has over you and then she makes you walk through fire, is that it?

MULDER: Phoebe is fire.

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you sure you don't want me to help you out on this one?

MULDER: Sooner or later, a man's got to face his demons.

(He walks out.)



SCENE 7
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(Lady Marsden lights the stove and fills the tea kettle with water. Outside, Cecil watches her through the window, breathing heavily. She takes two cups out and then goes to get the sugar. Cecil hears a coughing and looks over. He looks back at the window briefly, smiles, then walks back around the house to the garage, where the chauffeur is standing. The chauffeur is smoking and coughing harshly.)

L'IVELY: (with American accent) Hello. You're the Marsden's driver?

DRIVER: Who's that?

(They walk towards each other.)

L'IVELY: Bob. Caretaker.

(He smiles.)

DRIVER: Oh.

L'IVELY: Bum a smoke?

DRIVER: Yeah, sure.

(He hands "Bob" a cigarette, who promptly puts it behind his ear.)

L'IVELY: I'm going into town. Can I get you anything?

DRIVER: Yeah. (coughs) Some cough medicine if it's not a problem.

L'IVELY: Syrup or, uh... lozenges?

DRIVER: Syrup would be good.

(L'Ively smiles and starts walking.)

Can I give you some money?

(L'Ively makes a "forget-about-it" motion.)

I appreciate that.

(He coughs some more and throws the cigarette down.)



SCENE 8
HENNESEY'S BAR
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(L'Ively pulls up a seat at the bar, putting a paper bag down, presumably with cough syrup in it. People can be heard murmuring, talking and laughing in the background. Cecil nods to the barkeep.)

L'IVELY: Beer?

(The barkeep nods. The woman two seats down looks at him, then moves into the seat next to him, beer in hand.)

WOMAN: They don't let you bring your own around here.

(L'Ively looks at the paper bag.)

L'IVELY: Well, I guess they'll just have to make an exception, won't they?

(She laughs.)

WOMAN: Oh, you're English. God, I just love that accent.

(She takes out a cig and a lighter. L'Ively holds the hand with the lighter.)

L'IVELY: Allow me.

WOMAN: And a gentleman to boot.

(He holds up a finger and moves it to the left of her. Her eyes follow it. He smirks and the tip of his finger lights.)

Oh my God. Now that is a trick.

(She laughs and turns around.)

Hey guys, take a look at this!

(She turns back around and Cecil's whole arm is on fire.)

L'IVELY: Care for a light?

(She gets up. He slams his fist down onto the bar, and all the spilt alcohol catches on fire. People start screaming and running out as he watches the fire dance on his arm.)



SCENE 9
BOSTON MERCY HOSPITAL

(Mulder and Phoebe walk into the waiting room.)

MULDER: I pulled this report off the wire last night. Eyewitnesses are saying that a customer in the bar caught fire but they're still looking for a body.

GREEN: Any indication an accelerant was used?

(He goes to the desk and signs a clipboard.)

MULDER: The bar's across the street from the fire station. It burned to the ground before they had a chance to even respond. The fire marshall said it burned so hot, it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake. This was a woman who was in the bar.

(He knocks on a door labeled 28E. They open the door and walk in. The woman from the bar is lying on the bed.)

Hello?

WOMAN: Hello.

MULDER: Miss Kotchek?

WOMAN: Yes?

MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. This is Inspector Green.

(He closes the door and sits down next to her. Phoebe walks around to the other side.)

GREEN: Can you tell us what happened in the bar last night?

WOMAN: There was this guy. I'd had a few drinks, so... he sat next to me and he did this thing. It was like a magic trick where he lit his finger on fire.

(Green looks at Mulder, who takes notes.)

Next thing, I turned around and he was up in flames.

GREEN: Can you describe him?

WOMAN: Good looking, I think. Brownish hair.

MULDER: Long hair, short hair?

WOMAN: I've already given the police the information.

MULDER: Do you think you could work with a composite artist and come up with a sketch for us?

WOMAN: I said I had a few drinks...

MULDER: Can I get your full name and address?

WOMAN: See...

(He looks at her.)

I live with someone. He thinks I was at school last night.

MULDER: That's no problem. You can come down to the field office and work with somebody there. I'll give you a minute to think about it, okay?

(She nods. She sighs as Mulder and Green walk out.)

GREEN: Deftly done, Agent Mulder. Casually disregard her indiscretion. A firm but polite manner until she accedes to cooperate.

MULDER: It's a technique I refined in my relationship with you.

(He writes on his pad. She looks down at the desk.)

GREEN: Oh. Yes, well, I see you haven't lost your sense of humor after all.

(He looks at her.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. I don't want to dredge up the past. Let's just stick to the case.

GREEN: Let's.

(She takes the pad from him and walks away a little. He walks over to her.)

MULDER: Look, Phoebe, I...

GREEN: Unless I'm mistaken, ten years seems like sufficient time to have forgiven, if not forgotten, a few youthful indiscretions.

MULDER: I'm cursed with a photographic memory.

GREEN: And don't you tell me that you've forgotten a certain youthful indiscretion. Atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tombstone on a misty night in Windlesham.

(She smiles.)

MULDER: Like I said, just stick to the case.

GREEN: Well, it occurred to me that we're going to a lot of trouble to find a description of a man who, in all likelihood, as been burnt to a crisp.

MULDER: I would agree with you but they haven't found a body yet.

(He walks back into her room, followed by Green.)

So can we count on you?

WOMAN: Yeah, okay.

(Green hands Mulder a paper.)

I don't know if it matters but I remembered something else about the guy who caught fire. He had an English accent.

(The agents look at each other.)



SCENE 10
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(The driver walks out of the bathroom, coughing and hacking. L'Ively, who is folding the sheets, looks at him, smiling.)

L'IVELY: Having a rough time, eh?

DRIVER: Yeah...

(He walks out. L'Ively looks at the open bottle of Pembroke's cough syrup sitting on the dresser.)

L'IVELY: Maybe it's the cough syrup.



SCENE 11
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully sits at her desk, taking notes. She opens up a folder and looks at some pictures of some burnt bodies. She starts typing up her profile on her laptop. We hear her as a voice-over as she does.)

SCULLY: After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders, two points remain unexplained. One is the use of an untraceable accelerant. The other involves the victims. Since they all burned in the presence of family members in safe surroundings, this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist.



SCENE 12
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

("Bob" coats the swing with argotypoline as Jimmie and Michael run around the yard, laughing. Scully still speaks over the scene.)

SCULLY: The arsonist is most likely a male, less than twenty-five years of age. He will often act out of impulse, satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behavior, which compensates for his social inadequacies or maladjustment.

(L'Ively looks at the boys.)

L'IVELY: You boys want to see a magic trick?

JIMMIE: Okay!

(They run over to him.)

L'IVELY: What's your names?

MICHAEL: Michael and Jimmie.

L'IVELY: Doesn't he talk?

MICHAEL: Yes!

(The boys laugh, as well as L'Ively.)

What kind of a magic trick?

L'IVELY: Maybe I'd better not.

JIMMIE: Show us!

L'IVELY: Nah, you might tell your mom and dad.

MICHAEL: We won't tell.

L'IVELY: Really? Promise?

JIMMIE: We promise.

L'IVELY: Hope to die? Stick a needle in your eye?

(The boys laugh.)

Okay, boys. You've taken a solemn oath of trust that can't be broken. Except under penalty... of death.

(The boys laugh a little more. L'Ively takes out a cigarette.)

Watch...

(He holds it up, then sticks it in the other hand, which is a fist.

Is it in there?

JIMMIE: No!

(The boys laugh. L'Ively blows into his fist and opens it. The cigarette is gone.)

L'IVELY: Ah, you're too smart for me.

(He smiles.)

MICHAEL: Where did it go?

L'IVELY: Where did it go... where do you think it went, Jimmie?

JIMMIE: I don't know.

L'IVELY: Ah... I think I remember.

(He makes a fake surprised expression as he reaches over to his right ear with both hands.)

Ah... ah... ah... ha!

(He "pulls it out" of his ear. The cigarette is lit, and looks like it has been for a while. He puts it in his mouth and takes a puff.)

Ta-da!

(The boys laugh in amazement.)

MICHAEL: Do it again!

L'IVELY: You want me to do it again?

MICHAEL: Yes!

L'IVELY: Okay, we'll do it again.

(He takes it out of his mouth and exhales smoke.)



SCENE 13
ARSON LAB
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Agent Beatty is sitting at his desk, circling parts of a picture on his desk. Scully knocks on his open door.)

SCULLY: Agent Beatty?

(He looks up.)

BEATTY: Yes?

SCULLY: I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. Can I... steal a minute of your time?

BEATTY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Come in, sit down, come here. I'm just working on this Mafia torch job here.

(Scully walks over as Beatty takes off his glasses.)

SCULLY: I'm... working with Agent Mulder.

BEATTY: Oh, yeah, wild case. So, what can I do for you?

SCULLY: You mentioned that the arsonist might be using some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.

BEATTY: Yeah, well, that's just speculation. It still doesn't explain how he sets bodies on fire.

SCULLY: What if he got some of this fuel into some... hand cream or, uh...

BEATTY: Well, you've got to understand. Even the smallest amounts of this stuff can produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees. But I suppose it's not impossible. Extremely diluted. But you'd still have to find a way to ignite it.



SCENE 14
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(L'Ively now has three cigarettes in his mouth. The middle one lights suddenly. The boys laugh and clap.)

JIMMIE: Wow! Isn't that a great trick?

L'IVELY: Now sit down.

(They sit down in front of him. He takes them out of his mouth.)

So... you guys ever smoked a cigarette?

MICHAEL: No, they're bad for you.

L'IVELY: Would you like to take a puff, Michael?

MICHAEL: No.

L'IVELY: Make a man out of you.

MICHAEL: I don't want to.

L'IVELY: Why don't you hold one for me?

(He holds out his hands. In front of Michael's face is two cigarettes, one between his index and middle, the other between his middle and ring fingers.)

How about you, Jimmie?

(He moves his hand in front of Jimmie's face.)

Huh, little man?

(He holds up the other cigarette. They stare at each other, L'Ively smiling. Jimmie goes to take the cigarette when his mother appears at the top of the hill.)

LADY MARSDEN: Jimmie! Michael!

(They run to her. L'Ively puts his cigarettes away.)

Hello. Hi, Bob.

(She waves. He stands.)

There you are. We've had a bit of bad news.

(She starts walking towards him, a child under each arm.)

Our driver has taken ill and we're due at a party in Boston this evening. Is there any chance that we can impose upon you to drive the family into town? We'd be more than happy to pay you for your time and certainly to put you out for the night.

(L'Ively shakes his head, smiling.)

L'IVELY: I'd be very happy to do it as a favor.

LADY MARSDEN: Well, good. Thank you. All right then, boys, let's go, Daddy's got lunch all ready.

(As they walk away, Cecil's face becomes grim. Scully's voice comes over as he watches Lady Marsden walk away.)

SCULLY: The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to excessive fantasies about women or men who are inaccessible to him. Often, the setting of fires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship.



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Cut to Scully, typing at her laptop.)

SCULLY: His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned. The suspicious nature of the fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States. A check of all recent immigrations in the northeastern area is underway. It has become not a matter of if, but when he will strike.

(A man walks in behind her and hands her a paper.)

MAN: Here's that immigration data you wanted.

SCULLY: Thank you.

MAN: You're welcome.

(He leaves.)



SCENE 16
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder and Green walk down a street, carrying umbrellas. It is raining.)

MULDER: Remember those reports I told you about, about people who could control and conduct fire, pyrokinetic?

GREEN: Faintly...

MULDER: I think this guy just sent us a message that he's far more exotic.

GREEN: I'd say so, I mean, he can set himself afire.

(Mulder laughs.)

What?

MULDER: I'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me.

GREEN: Oh.

MULDER: What kind of protection does the family have?

GREEN: The driver's a very capable bodyguard.

MULDER: Well, he should look into getting a few additional men and limit public exposure.

(They reach their car.)

GREEN: Oh, they've got a party being held in their honor tonight in Boston. They're going to have to cancel.

MULDER: Unless you wanted to set a trap.

GREEN: I had thought of that. But we must be careful and discreet. The party's at 8:00 at the Venerable Plaza. I'll be traveling with the family so why don't you go on ahead and have a look around?

(Mulder nods and unlocks the door.)

Oh, and I've taken a room at the hotel for the night.

(He looks at her and sighs. She smirks and gets in the car as he folds up his umbrella.)



SCENE 17
VENABLE PLAZA HOTEL
5:16 P.M.

(A bellhop leads Mulder into his room, putting his bag down on the floor and his key on the dresser.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He takes out a roll of bills and hands one to the bellhop. The bellhop nods.)

All right, thank you.

(The bellhop leaves. Mulder looks around the huge room, then puts his suitcase down on the bed. He sits down.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully's office. She's sitting at her desk, her computer on.)

SCULLY: It's Scully, where are you?

(Cut to hotel. Mulder stands.)

MULDER: I'm in Boston.

SCULLY: There's something I need to show you.

(Cut back to her office.)

I'm going to come up there.

(Cut to hotel.)

MULDER: What have you got?

SCULLY: I might have some information...

(Cut to her office.)

...on the identity of your arson suspect.

(Cut to the hotel. Mulder sighs and sits down on the bed. Cut to her office.)

You there, Mulder?

(Cut to the hotel.)

MULDER: Yeah, yeah...

(Cut to her office.)

SCULLY: Can I meet you somewhere?

(Back to the hotel.)

MULDER: No, it's just that I'm, I'm kind of anticipating having my hands full.

(Cut to Scully, who looks dismayed.)



SCENE 18
6:47 P.M.

(A limousine pulls up and a bellhop opens the door. The Marsdens get out. He then opens the front door and Phoebe gets out.)

MICHAEL: Jimmie, we're here!

BELLHOP: Good evening.

GREEN: Thank you.

(The Marsdens talk together intelligibly.)

BELLHOP: Excuse me, sir.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Hello.

(The bellhop closes both doors as Green and the Marsdens scurry off. L'Ively, decked out in a tuxedo, gets out of the driver's side, watches them go, and sighs. Inside, Mulder leans up against a wall, drinking some champagne, as people walk by talking. He looks on as the Marsdens walk up the stairs, followed by Phoebe. He watches her walk by. Later, Mulder stands by himself in an empty room with a buffet table. The crowd can still be heard. He looks at his watch as Phoebe walks in. She walks over to him.)

GREEN: Enjoying yourself?

MULDER: Good food, witty conversation. I'm having the time of my life.

(Phoebe laughs.)

GREEN: I wondered if you'd think it's safe enough to indulge ourselves in a dance.

MULDER: It doesn't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance.

GREEN: That doesn't mean there won't be any fires to put out.

(They start slow dancing.)

I've thought about you often.

(Scully walks down the hall and sees Mulder and Green dancing. She stops, rolls her eyes a little, and sighs. She looks at her watch, then turns to see L'Ively standing there, smiling. She tries to look away and sees Mulder and Green kissing. She tries to look away from that and sees that L'Ively is gone. She looks around for him and hears a beeping. She turns to see a control panel with a list of the floors and lights next to them, as well as two columns of lights to the right that are for smoke and fire, respectively. The light beeps next the 14th floor, as well as the two lights for smoke and fire for that floor. She runs over to Mulder and Phoebe.)

SCULLY: There's a fire upstairs.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: On the fourteenth floor.

GREEN: That's where the children are.

(She runs off with Scully as Mulder runs down the hall that Scully came from. Upstairs, the fire dances it's way down the hallway. Mulder runs up the stairs as Scully runs past the crowd.)

SCULLY: We've got a fire on the fourteenth floor!

(A bellhop runs off and the crowd murmurs. Lady and Sir Marsden run out and watch her run off. Mulder reaches the door to the fourteenth floor, out of breath. He puts his hand on the door and closes his eyes, trying to control his fear. He takes a deep breath and opens the door. The hallway is covered with smoke and Mulder keeps close to the floor, coughing.)

MICHAEL: Help, help!

(The fire erupts out of the hallway and Mulder stands a little, then drops to his knees, not moving anymore. He coughs and starts to crawl back the other way. He coughs and wheezes, slumping against the wall as firemen start up the stairs. A man runs by carrying Michael and Jimmie. Two firemen stop at Mulder, who is nearly out.)

FIREMAN #1: Here we go, got one out. Come on, buddy, come on. Come on, here we go...

(They lift him to his feet and support him.)

And we go up!

FIREMAN #2: You got him?

FIREMAN #1: Yup, here we go...

(The first fireman puts Mulder's arm around him and helps him off. Downstairs, L'Ively comes out of the elevator with Michael and Jimmie as people watch on in awe.)

L'IVELY: Here we are.

(Lady and Sir Marsden run to their children. Everybody speaks at once, some patting L'Ively on the back.)

LADY MARSDEN: You saved their lives.

(Scully looks back to see the fireman coming out, Mulder being helped by one, wearing an oxygen mask. Scully goes over to him as he slumps down to the floor. She looks back and sees Phoebe shake L'Ively's hand.)

GREEN: Marvelous. Good job. Thank you.

(Scully puts her hand on Mulder's head, but he moves it off, coughing into the mask. Later, Mulder lies in bed with his shirt off, Scully sitting on the bed. Mulder continues coughing and Scully hands him a glass of water, which he drinks.)

SCULLY: You were really out.

MULDER: Where's Phoebe?

SCULLY: She's down the hall.

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: How about the kids?

SCULLY: Okay, the doctor checked them out.

(Mulder gets up, wearing only black boxers, picks up his robe and starts towards the bathroom.)

What happened to you up there?

MULDER: I panicked. I couldn't move, Scully.

SCULLY: It could've happened to anyone.

MULDER: Yeah, but it happened to me. I hared out. Plain and simple.

(He goes into the bathroom as Phoebe walks in behind Scully.)

SCULLY: What do you know about this guy that saved the kids? The driver?

GREEN: I checked him out prior to the Marsdens' arrival.

(Scully stands and looks at her as she closes the door.)

He's worked on the property for eight years. No record. His references checked out. They were lucky he was here tonight.

SCULLY: Who was watching the kids tonight?

GREEN: He was.

SCULLY: Are you sure? I could have sworn I saw him down in the hallway about the same time that the fire broke out.

(Mulder walks out of the bathroom wearing a robe.)

GREEN: He couldn't have. Anyway, the man we're looking for is English.

MULDER: Hey.

(They looks at him. He closes his robe.)

GREEN: I came to see if you were okay.

MULDER: How are the kids?

GREEN: They're fine. Everybody's anxious to get back.

MULDER: To the cape?

GREEN: Only to pack. They've, uh, made travel arrangements to return to England the day after tomorrow.

MULDER: And you?

GREEN: I'll be leaving in a few days.

(Mulder nods.)

Look, I'll give you a ring back at the Bureau before I leave.

MULDER: Right.

(Phoebe walks to the door and looks at Scully.)

GREEN: Goodbye.

(She leaves. Mulder goes to sit down on the couch.)

SCULLY: You all right?

(He sits and puts his feet up on the table.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: You at all interested in what I came up here to show you?

MULDER: Yeah.

(She sits down across from him and unlocks her briefcase.)

SCULLY: Well, I did a little checking of my own. I didn't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists so I took the opportunity... for my own edification, of course.

(He smiles. She pulls a paper out of her briefcase and gives it to Mulder.)

I ran a profile of possible incendiary fuels and accelerants that could have been used in the crimes.

(The list says "Representative Liquid Propelant Fuels" at the top and lists a number of fuels, their densities and heat of concentration. The fuels are: Argotypoline, Ammonia (Liquid), Ballium, Beryllium, Boron, Carbon (qr), Decarbonate and a few others.)

I also took the liberty of running a search through Interpol of all the gardeners, manservants and domestic help that were hired by the murder victims at the time of their death.

(She hands him that list.)

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: And these people probably don't even tie their own shoes. There were over two-hundred names. And not a duplicate. Except one. A "Cecil L'Ively." He worked as a gardener for two of the victims.

MULDER: What did you find on him?

SCULLY: Nothing.

MULDER: So he's clean.

SCULLY: Apparently, he was question by Scotland Yard and they released him but I dug a little further. Cecil L'Ively is a documented citizen of Great Britain, paid his taxes, never been on the dole, a model citizen until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire.

(He looks at her strangely.)

I know, that's what I thought. So, I checked a little further. Cecil L'Ively, spelled "L apostrophe," came up again. In fact, it came up twice. First, on a list of death certificates listed among a group of children who died in ritual sacrifice by a satanic cult in 1963 in the Toddingham Woods outside Bath, England.

MULDER: Where else did you find him?

SCULLY: You're going to love this. On a list of recent visas issued by the British government. Cecil L'Ively's passport was stamped by U.S. immigration officials two weeks ago at the port of entry in Boston.

(Mulder looks around, stands and takes off his robe.)

MULDER: Call the local field office in Boston of the F.B.I. and get them to fax to you the composite that the witness did of the man who burned down the bar and then get them to fax it to every local law enforcement agency in the area.

(He picks up his suit.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I'm going to try and catch Phoebe, this guy could be waiting for them in Cape Cod.

(He runs into the bathroom. Later, Scully is on the phone. She looks at her watch.)

SCULLY: Yes, this is Special Agent Scully. I've been waiting on hold for you guys to fax me a composite of an arson suspect. Right. Hang on a second.

(A whirring starts.)

It's coming through. Thanks.

(She looks down at the fax machine and a composite comes out of Cecil L'Ively.)

Oh my God. It's the driver.

(Scully takes out her phone and, looking at the picture, dials Mulder's number.)

CELLULAR PHONE MESSAGE: We're sorry. The cellular customer you are trying to reach is out of the area.

(She hangs up and stares at L'Ively's picture.)



SCENE 19
CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS

(L'Ively watches from his window, smoking, as Mulder pulls up. Mulder runs in the front door and finds he has interrupted an embrace between Green and Marsden on the stairs. They pull away from each other, and Marsden clears his throat.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Excuse me.

(He walks up the stairs. Phoebe walks tentatively to Mulder.)

MULDER: His name is Cecil L'Ively.

GREEN: Who?

MULDER: Your arsonist. Where's the rest of the family?

GREEN: They went outside for a walk.

MULDER: Well, go find them. We've got to get them packed and get them out of here.

(She looks at him, then walks away. Outside, she brings the children and Lady Marsden back to the house. The children whine and complain.)

GREEN: Come on, we have to hurry... let's go. Come on, this way.

(Cecil watches them run into the house, all murmuring. He smiles and walks up the stairs past Lady Marsden's portrait. Later, a knock on the door. Mulder opens it and Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: It's the driver.

MULDER: I know. He disappeared.

SCULLY: What's the matter?

MULDER: Nothing, um... I found this out in the garage.

(He hands her the can of argotypoline.)

It's been very hard on the family.

(Phoebe and Sir and Lady Marsden run down the stairs.)

GREEN: Did you get the composite?

SCULLY: Yes.

LADY MARSDEN: I don't believe it, I can't believe it. He's worked for us for over ten years.

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Well, obviously there's been some type of mistake.

(Scully hands him the rendition of L'Ively.)

Oh...

LADY MARSDEN: Oh my God!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: This isn't the driver, it's the caretaker!

LADY MARSDEN: And he's upstairs with the children!

(Mulder looks up the stairs. Sitting on a dresser is the bottle of Pembroke's cough syrup. Scully walks past the room.)

SCULLY: Michael?

(Mulder walks in.)

MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?

(He looks at the cough syrup as Scully walks in. He opens the bathroom door and they see a charred husk of the driver, kneeling over the toilet as if he was vomiting when he died.)

It looks like we found the missing driver.

(Phoebe calls from down the hall.)

GREEN: Mulder! In here, quickly!

(They run in and see the other three looking at the drapes, which has caught fire.)

LADY MARSDEN: What's going on?

GREEN: They just went up all by themselves.

(Mulder looks around for something when the painting hanging over the bed behind him erupts in flames.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: My God!

(Mulder takes a sheet and tries in vain to put out the fires. The bed then starts burning. Phoebe and Lady Marsden scream a little.)

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Oh my God...

MULDER: Everybody out!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Let's go, get out...

(They run out, Mulder closing the door behind him. Malcolm grabs his wife's hand.)

MULDER: I think he rigged the whole house.

LADY MARSDEN: Oh God...

(She runs into her husbands arms. Mulder smells the sheet he's carrying.)

MULDER: It's fuel.

(Mulder drops it as it catches fire.)

LADY MARSDEN: What?

GREEN: Oh my God...

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Go, go...

(They start running down the hall.)

SCULLY: Quick, come on...

(They run down the stairs, coughing.)

MULDER: Scully, see if you can find a fire extinguisher. Everybody else, outside.

(Scully walks off to get one.)

LADY MARSDEN: But what about the children?

(They hear a banging on a door and the dog barking.)

MULDER: I'll take care of the children. Go!

(The Marsdens walk out. Phoebe grabs Mulder's arm.)

GREEN: Are you going to be okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Oh yeah. I'll be fine. There's no place I'd rather be.

(He takes out his gun and runs up the stairs. Phoebe leaves the house. He looks around down the hallway then walks slowly, the only sound his footsteps. He passes a few doors and hears some noise in one. The dog barks inside the room. He tries the doorknob, but it is locked.)

MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?

MICHAEL: Help...

(The children can be heard coughing. Mulder hits the door with his shoulder a few times. Behind him, at the end of the hallway, appears L'Ively.)

L'IVELY: Time to call 911.

(Mulder spins around and points his gun at him in one fluid motion.)

MULDER: Don't move!

(L'Ively raises his hands and snaps his fingers with the left one. The hallway literally explodes in flames, the paintings catching fire one by one down the hall. The fire rises to the ceiling as Mulder stares in awe. Mulder jumps backwards to the ground as the paintings where he was standing burst into flames as well. As the flames cover the ceiling, L'Ively turns and starts down the stairs only to see Scully standing at the bottom, pointing her gun.)

SCULLY: Freeze! Federal agent.

L'IVELY: You won't shoot me.

(He starts walking towards her.)

SCULLY: Stay right where you are.

(L'Ively jumps down a stair.)

L'IVELY: See? Cause you don't know the spark from that round won't blow this whole house to kingdom come.

(L'Ively slowly walks. Scully squeezes the trigger. L'Ively smiles as Scully backs away slowly. His face suddenly turns serious. Green turns the corner from the other room and splashes the accelerant in his face. L'Ively staggers back.)

GREEN: Back off the gun! It's the accelerant!

L'IVELY: No!

(L'Ively staggers and spins out the door. Mulder stares at the fire while the boys scream. He takes a deep breath and starts moving slowly, staying very low to the ground, hands on the walls. He lets out a slight scream in pain and winces, pulling back his hand when he touches a hot part of the wall. He rams his elbow into the door twice, knocking it open the second time. L'Ively staggers out onto the lawn, trying to shake the feeling of the accelerant away. Mulder runs out the door carrying Michael and Jimmie.)

LADY MARSDEN: Oh Michael! Jimmie!

MALCOLM MARSDEN: Michael! Jimmie! Thank God, thank God!

(The boys run into their parents' arms. L'Ively stops and turns back to the house. He laughs insanely as he bursts into flame.)

L'IVELY: You can't kill me!

(Scully slowly lowers her gun as they all watch him spin around, laughing.)

L'IVELY: You can't fight fire with fire!

(He finally stops laughing as he falls to the ground, his body burning.)



SCENE 20
X-FILES OFFICE
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Mulder sits at his desk, wearing glasses, thinking.)

SCULLY: (with English accent) Care to take me to lunch?

(Mulder looks back to see Scully at the door, smiling.)

Scare you?

MULDER: You have no idea.

SCULLY: Where is Phoebe?

(She sits down on the desk.)

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: You don't know? She didn't call?

MULDER: No. She did messenger this to me last night though.

(He holds up a tape.)

SCULLY: Did you play it?

MULDER: No.

(He looks at it.)

SCULLY: Why not? Aren't you curious what's on it?

MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.

(He gets up.)



SCENE 21
BOSTON MERCY HOSPITAL

(Scully does a voice-over of her report as a nurse walks into an enclosed room.)

SCULLY: X-File number 11214893. Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder. The arson suspect Cecil L'Ively was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital with fifth and sixth-degree burns over his entire body. Military burn specialists have been brought in to study the case which they're calling "extraordinary."

(Cut to Scully typing on her laptop.)

Not only for the fact that the suspect survived, but for the rapid regeneration of his basal cell tissue. Full recovery is anticipated in as little as a month.

(Cut back to the hospital. A man unlocks a door for the nurse.)

L'Ively is being held in a high-security medical facility...

GUARD: There you go.

NURSE: Thank you.

(She walks in.)

SCULLY: ...confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried on murder charges in the death of a Massachusetts caretaker. His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees.

(The nurse bends down and adjusts a control on the hyperbaric chamber.)

House technicians have removed everything flammable from his room due to several fires which have broken out in the vicinity. According to Agent Mulder, further incarceration remains a problem for federal penal authorities.

(The nurse walks around the chamber and looks into the glass casing in the front. L'Ively is laying there, his head visible. His face is charred almost completely black. He has no hair.)

NURSE: Can I get you anything, sir?

(L'Ively's eyes pop open. He looks around, then turns and looks at her.)

L'IVELY: I'm just dying for a cigarette.

(He licks his lips a little, staring at the nurse.)

[THE END]

                                          BEYOND THE SEA



SCENE 1
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(William Scully walks over to a small Christmas tree with an angel ornament on top.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Are you going to leave this up all year?

SCULLY: Yup. All year. Since you always made us take the Christmas tree down the day after Christmas, I'm making up for lost time.

(She starts piling plates on the kitchen table.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: If your idea of a good time is picking up dried pine needles, treat yourself.

MARGARET SCULLY: As if he's an authority on having a good time.

(She walks over, carrying plates from the dinner table. William crosses over to beside Scully.)

SCULLY: That's okay, Mom, I got that.

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, okay.

WILLIAM SCULLY: Okay, Maggie, let's shove off.

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, okay.

(She puts the plate down and goes over to Scully. She hugs her.)

Well, thank you for having us. Dinner was delicious as usual.

SCULLY: Thanks, Mom.

(Scully walks over to her father and salutes.)

Good sailing, Ahab.

(He hugs her.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Goodnight, Starbuck.

(Margaret gives William an urging look as if to ask his daughter a question.)

How's work? Good?

SCULLY: Yup. It's good.

WILLIAM SCULLY: Well...

(William and Margaret cross over to the coatrack by the door and put on their coats. Scully throws down the napkin in her hand onto the table and walks over.)

SCULLY: Well, drive carefully.

MARGARET SCULLY: Uh-huh.

(Scully unlocks the door and kisses her mother goodbye.)

SCULLY: Goodnight, Daddy.

(The parents walk out. She watches them go, then closes the door. Later. It is now 1:47. On TV, a man is talking on an informercial under his picture, it says:

"Ron Popeil
Inventor")

RON POPEIL ON TV: Here on Incredible Inventions though, you're not going to spend 110 dollars for it. You all know that. You're not even going to spend a hundred dollars.

(The caption changes to:

" Approximate One Month Supply
Time May Vary Depending On Frequency
of Use or Size of Area to be Covered")

There's an approximate one-month supply here...

(They show two videos, one in the upper right, the other in the lower left, of "hair" being sprayed onto bald people's heads. In the upper left it reads "Only $39.92.")

And all you'll spend for this entire package is just 39 dollars and 92 cents.

(There is applause and cheering. Scully is sleeping on the couch, a blanket draped over her.
Her eyes open.)

WOMAN ON TV: Mr. Johnson?

RON POPEIL ON TV: Yes?

(Scully sees her father sitting in a chair in front of her, blue light shining down on him. His mouth is moving but no words are coming out.)

WOMAN ON TV: I was kind of interested that Allen used a blond and I hadn't seen anyone use a blond.

SCULLY: Dad? I thought you guys left.

(She sits up.)

Where's Mom?

(There is no answer. He is talking but making no noise. The phone rings, startling her. She looks back at the phone, then to her father. The chair is empty. Scully is very confused as the phone rings again. She gets up, blanket still covering her, and starts walking to the phone. It rings twice more before she picks it up.)

Hello.

(There is no answer except for some muffled crying.)

Hello?

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana?

SCULLY: Mom? What's the matter?

MARGARET SCULLY: We, um... we lost your dad. He had a... a massive coronary... about an hour ago. He... he's gone.

(Scully looks back to where she saw her father sitting. The chair is still empty.)

SCENE 2
JACKSON UNIVERSITY; NORTH CAROLINA

(A teenage boy and girl are making out in a car on the side of the road.)

GIRL: I swear, Christmas Day... my whole family's opening presents and all and I'm just sitting there in my own little world, thinking "I just wish Jim were here."

BOY: Hmmm, I know.

(There is a knock on the window. They look at the window as a flashlight shines through. A police officer, Lucas Henry, is standing there.)

Oh man, busted.

(She gets off of him as he wipes his lips. He rolls down the window.)

Yes, sir?

HENRY: Out of the vehicle, please.

BOY: We're sorry, sir. We'll be on our way.

HENRY: I said, out of the vehicle

(The boy looks at the girl, rolls up the window and gets out of the car. He can't make out the officer's face because the light is shining in his face. He raises his hand to deflect the light.)

Keep your hands down. Let's see some ID.

(The boy looks down and sees that the "officer" is wearing jeans and boots.)

BOY: No, not till I see yours.

(Henry hits the boy in the face with the flashlight. The girl screams as the boy's face slams into the window and slides down, leaving a trail of blood.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is reading a file. Scully sneaks up behind him and looks over his shoulder.)

SCULLY: Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading the Adult Video News.

MULDER: I didn't think you'd be in today. How are you, Dana?

SCULLY: "Dana." I'm fine, thank you. What are you working on?

MULDER: Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University. Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers, both 19.

(Mulder shows her a picture of the couple.)

Last year, another couple was kidnapped to the day except that abduction occured at Duke University. One week later, they found both students' bodies dead.

(Scully looks over the file.)

SCULLY: They were kept alive, tortured through that period.

MULDER: No arrests were ever made. Police believed it to be a one-time offender but now it appears to be a serial incident. Anyway, if he holds true to form, we have five days to find those kids.

SCULLY: That's a grim deadline.

MULDER: Well, here's another grim deadline.

(He reaches over and picks up a folder off a desk. He gives it to her.)

In one week, Luther Lee Boggs will take a seat in the North Carolina gas chamber.

SCULLY: How is he related?

MULDER: He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping. He described Hawley's bracelet down to the last detail. This is information that only family members could have known.

SCULLY: Or the kidnapper.

MULDER: Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison.

SCULLY: His talents?

MULDER: He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmission.

(He goes over and sits at his desk.)

SCULLY: Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?

MULDER: Perhaps.

(She sits down opposite him.)

Boggs has been there before... in the chamber. My profile helped send him there. He was actually strapped to the chair before recieving an executive stay. He claims that this experience activated in him the ability to channel spirits and demons. I believe in psychic ability, without a doubt, but not
in this case. Not Boggs.

SCULLY: So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside.
A scam to save his life?

(Mulder nods. He hands her a file.)

MULDER: At the age of six, Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project. When he was thirty, he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter of the Detroit - Green Bay game. Some killers are projects of society. Some act out past abuses. Boggs kills because he likes it.

SCULLY: And they've requested you speak with him?

(Mulder gets up.)

MULDER: Actually, he's requested to speak to me.

SCULLY: Why you?

(He puts his gun in his holster.)

MULDER: He read my profile on him and he believes I'm the only one who truly understands what he is. Anyway, I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.

SCULLY: I'll go with you.

(She stands.)

The funeral's at noon.

MULDER: I think you should take some time.

SCULLY: I need to work.

MULDER: I'm sorry about your father.

(He puts his hand on her cheek. She nods. He starts out.)

I'll see you later.

SCULLY: (whispering) Okay.

(Mulder takes his coat and leaves. Scully goes to the file cabinet and pulls out a file that reads:

"Federal Bureau
of
Investigation

DC-X-167512

Visionary Encounters
w/ The Dead"

She puts hit back in the drawer and slams it shut.)



SCENE 4
WILLIAM SCULLY'S FUNERAL

(A man stands on a dock and dumps out William Scully's ashes into the air as Beyond the Sea plays loudly. On the shore stands Scully's family. Dana is standing next to her mother.)

SCULLY: As a captain, he was entitled to burial at Arlington with full ceremony.

MARGARET SCULLY: This is exactly how he wanted it. Just the family.

(There is an uncomfortable pause. The man dumping out the ashes holds up the empty urn and takes off his hat.)

This song was playing when his ship returned from the Cuban Blockade. He marched right off up to me... and he proposed.

(She starts to cry.)

SCULLY: I know that you and Dad were... disappointed that I chose the path I'm on instead of medicine but I need to know... was he at all proud of me?

MARGARET SCULLY: He was your father.

(A seagull cries out.)



SCENE 5
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Luther Lee Boggs sits in a chair, handcuffs on. On his left hand, the word "Kiss" is written on his knuckles. On the right, the word "Kill.")

BOGGS: The soul of Luther Boggs drowns in hell's sea of fire. We have him now.

(Scully is sitting, Mulder is standing.)

MULDER: We? You mean the souls of your victims?

BOGGS: The dead. The living. All souls are connected.

MULDER: And you're the conduit?

(Mulder sits. Boggs' breathing becomes labored. His whole speech and movement pattern changes to a more womanly tone.)

BOGGS: Uh... Dana... Fox... please understand that from here, we can return to the past.
We can see the present. We can know the future.

MULDER: From here? Where exactly are you?

(Boggs' mood changes back to the previous one.)

BOGGS: Mr. Boggs must be made redemptive for his transgressions.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: That's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do next week.

(Boggs' tone and movement becomes more of a Brooklyn man.)

BOGGS: No. Uh-uh. Let's deal. Boggs' life for the kids, you know what I'm saying?

MULDER: First you've got to prove you're telling the truth.

(Boggs looks at him warily. Mulder pulls a small package out of his pocket.)

Don't get me wrong, Luther. I want to believe.

(He pulls a piece of blue cloth out of the bag, which Boggs takes. Boggs' breathing becomes heavier as he rubs the cloth between his hands, bringing it up to his mouth.)

BOGGS: Oh... ah... oh, God, no. Must stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!
Pain! I'm in... pain, terrible pain...

(Mulder sits on the table, smiling slightly.)

Uh... the boy, uh, Jim... he's tied with twine. Uh, packing twine.

(He holds his wrists out. He begins spouting short screams, holding the cloth to his face, fists clenched.)

Uh, he, he whip, he whips them with a, a coat hanger, a wire coat hanger. Oh.

(His breathing becomes labored as he looks up at Mulder with wild eyes.)

Dark place. Cold. Cellar. Warehouse, condemned. An angel... of stone. Waterfall. Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall. Not water. They're there. Oh, God. I got to go. I got to go. I, I got to go.

(He slumps down in his chair. Mulder walks over slowly and kneels down in front of his face.
He takes the cloth out of his hand and holds it up.)

MULDER: I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt. It has nothing to do with the crime.

(He gets up and leaves. Scully picks up her briefcase and starts out.)

BOGGS: (singing) Somewhere... beyond the sea...

(She stops.)

Somewhere... waiting for me...

(She turns around. Boggs looks up. In her eyes, he is replaced by William Scully. She backs away a little, startled, in emotional pain, eyes closed. She opens them and looks at Boggs, who is back to normal. His tone has now assumed that of William Scully's.)

Did you get my message, Starbuck?

(Scully rushes out past Mulder, who is talking to a security guard.)

GUARD: Alright, thanks a lot.

(The guard goes back in his booth. Scully stops at the door. Mulder looks at her. She slowly turns around.)

MULDER: Scully, what's wrong? Did Boggs say something to you?

SCULLY: No. It's my father. I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

MULDER: It's alright. Why don't you go back to the motel? We've exposed Boggs as a fraud. Boggs is not what he claims to be. He may be orchestrating the kidnapping. Now he knows that we're on to him, he doesn't have a chance with this charade. I'm going to wait around a couple of hours and try to interrogate him. Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.

(Boggs walks out behind them, a security guard on each side leading him back to his cell.)

BOGGS: (singing) Somewhere... beyond the shore... we'll kiss just as before... happy we'll be... beyond the sea...

(The door opens and Scully rushes out.)

And never again...



SCENE 6
NORTH CAROLINA

(Scully sits in her car. She comes to a red light and closes her eyes, remembering what Boggs said.)

BOGGS: (flashback) Water falling. It's, it's not a waterfall.

(A honking car snaps her out of it. She opens her eyes and sees Hotel Niagara, a hotel with a sign that has a waterfall behind the letters. In her mind, she sees Boggs again.)

An angel of stone.

(She looks to her left and sees a stone statue of an angel holding another in it's arms, wings spread. Scully makes a sharp right turn and pulls into an alley. She stops the car at a door, which has a condemned sign on it. She walks in to the room, which is very quiet, except for water dripping. Two pigeons fly off and she is startled. She shines the flashlight on the ground and sees various candles and a beer bottle. Bending over, she picks up a small bracelet on the floor. She holds it up to the candle and looks at it, but something catches her eye. She looks across the floor and sees several wire coat hangers.)



SCENE 7
SCULLY'S MOTEL ROOM

(Scully sits in her chair. She sees another vision of her father, sitting across from her, speaking to her with no words. There is a knock at the door.)

MULDER: It's Mulder.

(She gets up to answer the door. No one is in that chair across from her. She opens the door.)

I just heard that Liz Hawley's family made a positive ID on the charm you found at the warehouse. The police are searching that place inch-by-inch but they haven't been able to find anything yet. I expected to find you at the crime scene.

(Scully goes over and puts the chairs away. Mulder comes in.)

SCULLY: Did Boggs confess?

MULDER: No, no, just five hours of Boggs' channeling. After three hours, I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested "All Along the Watchtower." You know the guy's been dead for twenty years and he still hasn't lost his edge.

SCULLY: I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse. I didn't notice any suspicious activities.

MULDER: Then how did you find it?

SCULLY: It was where Boggs said it would be.

MULDER: Scully, I told you about Boggs...

SCULLY: I didn't go looking for it! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of...

MULDER: That doesn't matter! That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could have been setting you up! You could be dead right now! Why did you lie in your police report?

SCULLY: I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances.

MULDER: What you're really saying is that you didn't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs! The bureau would expect something like that from "Spooky" Mulder, but not Dana Scully.

SCULLY: I thought that you'd be pleased that I opened myself to extreme possibilities.

MULDER: Why now? After all we've seen, why Boggs?

(Mulder sits down.)

Does this have to do with your father?

(She shakes her head.)

You said that he didn't approve of you becoming an FBI agent. Now, if being on the job now makes you feel guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy, I think you should back away because if it's clouding your judgement, you're putting yourself in danger.

SCULLY: I love this job.

MULDER: You love your father.

(About to cry she walks to the other side of the room.)

Dana... open yourself up to extreme possibilities only when they're the truth. That goes for Luther Boggs... and your father. As for Luther Boggs, he's the greatest of lies.

(He stands up and goes to her. They both sit down.)

I know he's working with someone on the outside and they planted that evidence. Now, we have to be very careful about planning our next move because he's five steps ahead. The one advantage we have is time.

(He holds up a newspaper. An article at the bottom has the headline "Gas Chamber Tested for Boggs' Execution.")



SCENE 8
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Scully sits at a desk, looking at her watch. Mulder comes over and puts a paper down in front of her.)

MULDER: Scully, look at this.

(The headline reads "Kidnapped College Students Found Safe." Under that, it reads "Police seek suspect.")

SCULLY: Incredible! They found them?

MULDER: That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.

(He sits down.)

SCULLY: I don't understand, why didn't the police notify us?

MULDER: They haven't been found, the article is bogus. The Carolinian made this one up just for us, only six people know about it. Later on today, Boggs gets his weekly phone priviliges. Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice to find out what happened.

(We see the small slot to Boggs' door open and a hand puts down the fake newspaper. Through the slot, we see Boggs get off his bed and pick up the newspaper. The slot closes. Mulder looks at a camera into Boggs' room, seeing Boggs sit down on his cot and read, and then his watch. Scully sits behind him.)

Phone privilige is in two hours.

(Boggs is lead down the hall by two security guards. Mulder, Scully, some security guards and some suit-and-ties watch as he is lead into a room with a phone. Boggs runs his hands through his hair then picks up the phone and starts dialing. Scully leans over to the man next to her.)

SCULLY: Go.

(The man starts the tape recorder. Boggs looks directly at the camera as he puts the phone to his ear. In the security room, a phone starts ringing.)

MULDER: Turn off that phone. Turn it off.

(They all look for the phone until Scully sees Mulder's jacket.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's you.

(Mulder reaches into his coat pocket, pulls out his cell phone, pulls up the antenna, pushes a button, and puts it to his ear.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Boggs is on the other end.)

BOGGS: (through phone) How come you don't believe me?

(Mulder looks at the monitor. Boggs is looking right back at him.)

Agent Scully believes me.

MULDER: Agent Scully believes what we all believe. That you have the kids. Now where are they?

(Boggs drops the phone and moans. Scully stands.)

SCULLY: Mulder... even if he is setting us up, we have to follow because in three days...

MULDER: Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.

SCULLY: And then a day later, our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber.

(In the monitor, Boggs is breathing heavy and labored.)

We have to deal.

(In the interrogation room before, Boggs sits in the same chair. His breathing is heavy. Mulder sits across from him.)

BOGGS: The kidnapper is aroused by the prospect of becoming a killer.

MULDER: What's the name?

BOGGS: Can't see... male...

MULDER: Describe him.

BOGGS: Small... thin... late twenties... skull...

(Flashes quickly to Henry's skull earring.)

Human skull...

(Flashes again to Henry's earring.)

Silver gray... his eyes, cold, very cold...

(Flashes to Henry whipping his head and facing the camera. His eyes are blue and look dead.)

Staring at Elizabeth...

(On the ground, Elizabeth is tied up and gagged, struggling at her bonds.
Boggs grimaces and chokes on his words.)

God, he's got the wire...

(Henry bends the wire coat hanger, thinning it out.)

No... please, no...

(Henry finishes thinning it and whips it down. Boggs reacts as if he was struck himself. We now see Scully is sitting in the back.)

MULDER: Where is he?

BOGGS: He's over... over... by the window...

(We see Henry looking down at a desk next to a hole in the wall. In the back, we see Elizabeth. Henry slowly looks up.)

Holding back... holding back his thoughts of killing us... waiting... there's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.

(Mulder looks back at Scully, who writes it down in her notepad.)

MULDER: Did you get that?

(Scully closes her notepad and puts it and her pen away. She and Mulder get up. A buzz is heard and the door opens. They start to walk out.)

BOGGS: Mulder...

(They turn back.)

Don't go near the white cross. We see you down... and your blood spills on the white cross.

(They walk out.)



SCENE 9
BOATHOUSE; LAKE JORDAN, RALEIGH, CAROLINA

(Henry walks towards Jim and Elizabeth, whipping his leg with the coat hanger. Michael and Elizabeth scream with every whip. Jim is tied to a pole and gagged. Henry bends down to Elizabeth and raises the coat hanger to strike her.)

ELIZABETH: (muffled) No, no, no, no, no more...

(A bang is heard and Henry looks up. Outside, agents surround the boathouse. Scully and Mulder lead the way as a team of FBI agents go to the main door. An agent kicks down the door and they all run in.)

AGENT: Do you see anything?

2ND AGENT: Negative.

(Scully and Mulder see Elizabeth on the floor. Scully runs over to check her.)

SCULLY: Sweep the docks!

(While the agents start filing out, Mulder checks down a passage way. He shines his flashlight with his gun right above. As he approaches the back, we see more visibly a giant white cross. Hearing a noise, he turns around. Across the water hangs some sheets draped over a line. He sees some rustling and points his gun.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(A gunshot goes off through the drape and hits Mulder. Mulder screams and falls. Scully hears the shot.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Henry, draped in the sheets, drives off in a motorboat. Scully rushes to Mulder's side. We hear agents shouting orders to each other illegibly.)

AGENT: Get in there, now!

SCULLY: We need an ambulance... officer down!

(She undoes her coat, takes it off and drapes it over Mulder. Turning around quickly, she sees a giant white cross towering over them. Mulder's blood is on it.)



SCENE 10
HOSPITAL; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Two men wheel Mulder into an emergency room. Mulder is wearing an oxygen mask.)

PARAMEDIC: What do we got?

DOCTOR: Through and through upper femur...

NURSE: Can't palpate a radial pulse...

DOCTOR: Okay, I want a B.P. on this stat... get him on the gurney.

PARAMEDIC: One, two, three...

(The paramedics lift him off the wheeler and onto the gurney. Mulder coughs and shakes. Scully walks in.)

NURSE: Blood pressure is 67 on palpatation.

DOCTOR: Okay, tighten him and screen him for six, I want two liters of normal saline in him now and give him two units of o-neg after the typing. Let's transfer now.



SCENE 11
ELIZABETH HAWLEY'S HOSPITAL BED

(Elizabeth is looking at pictures of different criminals. Scully is standing next to the bed as a man flips the cards for her. She looks at the first one.)

ELIZABETH: No.

(He flips to the next one.)

No.

(The next one.)

No.

(He flips to the next one and she looks away. The man gives the picture to Scully, and another man reads from a file.)

MAN: Lucas Jackson Henry, 28. Did some time at Angola in Louisiana for sexual assault, narcotics, nothing big, really. His personal history includes being witness to an auto accident in which his high school sweetheart was killed and his mother was decaptiated.

(He hands her the file. She looks at the profiles.)

The seven year anniversary of that accident is in three days.

SCULLY: He's reliving it. That would explain the deadline.

(She walks over to the window.)

MAN: The most important element we found is that there's substantial suspicion that Luther Lee Boggs' last five murders were commited with a partner. Now, the police up in Durham say they could never prove it in court but they know that partner was Lucas Henry.



SCENE 12
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(A buzz sounds and the door opens to the same room as before. A security guard walks out as Scully marches in. Boggs sits in the chair.)

SCULLY: You set us up. You're in on this with Lucas Henry. This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away. Well, I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you've done, four days from now, no one will be able to stop me from being the one that will throw the switch and gas you out of this life for good, you son of a bitch!

(She turns back to the door and waits for it to open.)

BOGGS: Dana...

(She turns back. Instead of seeing Boggs there, she sees Mulder.)

(as Mulder) You're the one that believed me!

(She covers her ears and closes her eyes.)

SCULLY: No! No, I do not believe you!

(She opens them and Boggs is back to normal.)

BOGGS: If you don't believe me, maybe you'll believe yourself.

(He pauses and starts playing with his hair. His mannerism changes again, this time to a little boy's.)

There was that one time when I was fourteen and my parents had gone to bed and I snuck downstairs all alone. Got one of my mom's cigarettes and went out onto the porch in the dark. I was so scared. My heart was beating, I mean, they would have killed me if they knew. But I was so excited. Not cause of the cigarette, I mean, it was gross, but because I wasn't supposed to.

SCULLY: That could be a moment from any kid's life.

(She is shaken by the story. Boggs reverts back to normal.)

BOGGS: I know what you want. And I know who you want to talk to. Why don't you just go ahead and ask me?

(Scully is on the verge of crying.)

SCULLY: I'll believe you... if you let... me talk to him.

(Boggs takes a deep breath, then slumps down and exhales it. He grunts twice. His breathing becomes heavier. He looks at her, his expression and mood like her father's.)

BOGGS: Starbuck...

(Boggs twitches and pulls at his handcuffs, grimacing. His mood and tone become almost demonic.)

No, no, no! Nobody talks to anybody until I get a deal! Don't underestimate my fear of dying and don't downplay my terror of going back to that chair. I know my hell's going to be to go on back to that chair over and over again but in this life, my one and only life, I don't ever want to go back again! Ever! The last time I went to death's door and looked inside...

(The screen grows bright until it goes to black-and-white of a priest reading Last Rites from the Bible. There is no audio.)

I had never talked to a minister before in my life ever until that day and he said, "He who doth not love remains in death and he who hates his brother is a murderer..."

(Boggs looks at the minister. A guard comes in and gives him his last meal.)

"And no murderer has eternal life abiding in him." My family, who I killed after their last meal, was right there to watch me over mine...

(Boggs looks to his left and sees his family standing there, watching him. Boggs is led down a hallway past his family, who is duplicated on either side of him.)

And their fear and their horror that I made them feel when I killed them was injected into me...

(Boggs is strapped into the chair and a wire that detects his heart beat is strapped to his chest.)

And their collective fear alone was just one taste of hell. And then I felt myself leave my body. I thought they had already killed me...

(Boggs tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Suddenly, spirits rush into his body, moaning, their clothes and features briefly replacing his as they move into him.)

And I saw thousands of souls rushing into my body.

(The screen brightens until we are back in the interrogation room.)

It is a cold, dark place, Scully. Mulder's looking in on it right now.

SCULLY: It may be a cold dark place for you but it's not for Mulder and it's not for my father.

BOGGS: I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself but I'm not going to let him.
Nobody speaks until you get me a deal.

SCULLY: I don't believe you.

BOGGS: Oh well, there's plenty of room in that cold, dark place for liars, Scully. You go ahead and play it like you need to but I know you believe me. But if you need to convince a judge I'm in on it with Lucas, go ahead. Cause either way, whether I'm running the show with Lucas or I'm channeling, no information's coming until I get a deal. Go on, man, I got nothing to lose.

(Scully turns around and faces the door.)

SCULLY: Guard!

(Boggs stands up behind her.)

BOGGS: If I die, that boy goes to that cold, dark place.

(There is a buzz and the cell door and outer door open. She walks out and stops as they slam behind her. She closes her eyes for a moment, then walks away.)



SCENE 13
MULDER'S HOSPITAL BED; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Scully sits at the side of Mulder's bed as he listens. Instruments are hooked up to him and machines beep in the background.)

SCULLY: There's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers. The Raliegh police said...

MULDER: No matter what, don't believe him. Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on death row. You'd be the next best thing.

SCULLY: Mulder, I never thought I'd say this... but what if there's another explanation?

MULDER: Don't... deal with him. He could be trying to claim you as his last victim.



SCENE 14
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(A buzz sounds and the door opens. Boggs is lead in by a security guard. The security guard walks out and we hear the door slam. Scully is sitting across from Boggs.)

SCULLY: All right, Mr. Boggs... you got your deal.

(Boggs nods and sheds a few tears.)

BOGGS: Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

SCULLY: Alright, where are they?

(Boggs exhales loudly and slumps back in his chair. Scully watches him with no emotion.
Boggs changes moods again. He looks up at the ceiling.)

BOGGS: Uh... I... uh... I see, like, uh... circles. Uh... I don't know, like... barrels. No, no, bigger, like, uh... huge, uh... vats, uh... factory. Uh, condemned. The old, uh, Blue Devil Brewery up by Morrisville. Oh, God, he's getting, uh, he's getting ready. He... he... he's getting ready to, um, uh... he's getting ready to kill, uh, to kill the d... whoo.

(He exhales and slumps back down. Scully puts her things in her briefcase.)

SCULLY: Luther, if you really were psychic...

BOGGS: I would have known you lied. That there never was a deal. I know you tried.

(She picks up her briefcase and goes to the door. A buzz sounds and it opens.)

Scully...

(She turns around.)

Avoid the devil. Don't follow Henry to the devil. Leave that to me.

(She walks out as a security guard walks in.)



SCENE 15
BLUE DEVIL BREWERY FACTORY; MORRISVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

(Henry waves an hatchet in the air and screams. He slams the axe head down into a table twice. Tied to a table and his mouth covered with masking tape, Jim groans and starts to cry. Henry walks over to a ledge and jumps down next to Jim. He grabs him by the hair and lifts the hatchet, ready to strike.)

AGENT: Freeze!

(Henry stops and turns around. Agents rush in, guns armed. Scully takes the point, aiming at Henry.)

SCULLY: Federal agents, we're armed! Drop your weapon.

(Henry slowly lowers his weapon. He raises it to throw but Scully shoots him in the side of the chest. He screams and recoils as Scully and a few agents start to chase after him. Henry drops the hatchet and runs as the other agents check on Jim.)

AGENT: There he is!

2ND AGENT: Get an ambulance...

AGENT: Hold it...

2ND AGENT: It's gonna be alright, kid...

(Scully's team turns a corner and runs down a hallway.)

AGENT: Somebody get over here! Go away!

(Henry runs down the hall, crashing into the wall and heaving. The agents stop at stairs, getting on either side of the fixture before it.)

SCULLY: Go!

(An agent runs up the stairs and is hit with a metal barrel in the face. The agent falls down the stairs as Henry runs. Scully and another agent run after Henry while another checks on the fallen one. Henry runs into a dark room where rats are squeaking. He turns left. Scully and the agent go into the room. She goes left, he goes right. Henry runs into another room and up some stairs onto a catwalk. In the background, painted on the wall, is a giant blue devil. Scully runs in, gun poised, but she lowers it when she sees the devil. Henry looks at her and hears a creak under his foot. He
looks down to see the boards breaking under his feet. He falls through, screaming until a crash is heard. Scully looks over the railing to see Henry, dead two or three flights down. Scully sits down on the stairs as another agent runs in.)

AGENT: Over here!

(Scully looks up at the blue devil on the wall.)



SCENE 16
CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(The devil's face fades away, replaced with Boggs, who is sitting on his cot. Scully walks over and looks through his cell bars.)

BOGGS: You come to say goodbye?

SCULLY: I believe... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping, Lucas Henry would have... been aware of the danger you warned me about. He never would have crossed that bridge. So you saved... Jim Summer's life. But you saved mine as well.

(Boggs nods, stands and walks to the cell bars.)

BOGGS: You come for some unfinished business? You want your father's message? Not now.
Be there tonight. Be my witness. And when they got me in that chair and they... open up that shield... you get your message.

(He sits back down on the cot. It is now 5:57. A security guard walks into Luther's cell and puts down his last meal. Boggs looks to the left and sees his dead family again, in black-and-white. Boggs is wearing shackles as he walks down the same hallway. He sees his family lining the halls again, the same way in black-and-white. They whisper to each other. Boggs stops and turns around in emotional pain, but the security guards turn him back around.)



SCENE 17
GAS CHAMBER; CENTRAL PRISON; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Boggs breathes heavily as he is strapped into the chair again. They put the same heart-detecting wire on his chest. The door opens in front of Boggs and two men stand there with a priest.)

PRIEST: Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven...

MAN: Would you like to make a statement?

PRIEST: ...our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.

(Another man walks into view. His witness. Boggs shakes his head no. The first man nods to another.)

And lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is thy kingdom, thy power and thy glory...

(The contents of the cup spill out into the liquid. The gas rises and the liquid bubbles.)

Forever and ever. Amen.

(The look on Boggs' face is that of pure terror.)



SCENE 18
MULDER'S HOSPITAL BED; RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Scully sits at the foot of Mulder's bed.)

SCULLY: I was considering Boggs. If he knew that I was your partner, he could have found out everything he knew about me. About my father...

MULDER: Scully.

(She gets up and walks around to him.)

SCULLY: "Beyond the Sea" was playing at my parents' wedding. Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena. If he knew that my father had...

MULDER: Dana. After all you've seen, after all the evidence, why can't you believe?

(She sighs and sits down on his bed.)

SCULLY: I'm afraid. I'm afraid to believe.

MULDER: You couldn't face that fear? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you?

SCULLY: But I do know.

MULDER: How?

SCULLY: He was my father.

(Mulder nods and puts his hand on her shoulder.)

[THE END]

                                          GENDERBENDER



SCENE 1
A DANCE CLUB

(Loud music is playing and strobe lights illuminate an otherwise dark club. A young man tries to strike up a conversation with a blonde woman, but without success as she walks away. He goes to a video machine to read his horoscope. A young woman comes alongside him and tries to get his attention, but he appears disinterested and looks back at the video screen. She takes his left hand in hers and suddenly he seems very interested in her. He leans over and she whispers something in his ear. They then walk away hand in hand.)



SCENE 2
A HOTEL ROOM

(Later, they are in bed and have just had sex. She gets off the bed and stands some distance away from the bed, while he tries to catch his breath.)

YOUNG MAN: Oh, my God! That was ... that was incredible. I mean it. You don't believe me. Can you hear me? Hey, I ... I don't even know your name.

(He sits up in bed but then shows signs of being in pain. He coughs and moans, clutching his throat, and falls back in the bed. A foam comes out of his mouth and he appears dead. Nearby, the woman drops her lingerie to the floor, walks across the room and starts to put on the man's clothes. As the camera pans upward, we see that it is now a man.)

SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE (THE HOTEL ROOM), GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND, OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

(A photographer is taking pictures of the scene while Mulder examines the man's body. Scully stands to the side talking with Detective Horton.)

HORTON: New York businessman calls his wife to say good night, then goes out and picks up some chippy. He brings her back here for sex. Beyond that, well, nothing makes a whole lot of sense.

SCULLY: How's that?

HORTON: Security monitor records the victim entering the room with a woman at 10:13. Same monitor records a male leaving just after midnight.

SCULLY: Couldn't she just have changed clothes?

HORTON: Thought of that. Male is definitely a different person - short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier. The video never recorded his entry, nor the chippy ever leaving.

SCULLY: Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?

HORTON: Guy blew an artery. Must have been some roll in the hay.

(Mulder looks up at Scully, who shows no reaction to the Detective's comment.)

SCULLY: Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex with a perfect stranger. Any sign of robbery?

HORTON: The male exited wearing the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase. The wallet's gone.

SCULLY: You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the first place.

HORTON: Really? Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo requesting any case involving this exact COD. I assumed it was ...

MULDER: Thanks for the call.



SCENE 4
MULDER'S OFFICE

(Mulder and Scully are looking at slides of several dead bodies, all lying in bed in various stages of undress.)

MULDER: Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston. In each case, the victim dies in the throes of passion. Two women and three men, including the last one.

SCULLY: All young, healthy adults.

MULDER: All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.

SCULLY: You think there's a new drug on the streets?

MULDER: The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.

SCULLY: The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants?

MULDER: Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature, strong enough to product anaphylactic shock or a coronary.

SCULLY: So you think somebody is synthesizing them?

MULDER: It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations and hold on to your hat, Scully, 'cause you're gonna love this. The pheromones we're talking about - they contain human DNA.

SCULLY: Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones. So how can that be?

MULDER: I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking aphrodysiac. He's the ultimate sex magnet.

SCULLY: He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.

MULDER: I know. That is a puzzle.

SCULLY: So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, weight, sex. Unarmed but extremely attractive.

MULDER: It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths matching this MO in the last six weeks - in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and here in Washington.

(Mulder circles the cities on a map that is being displayed with an overhead projector.)

SCULLY: The killer's moving south.

MULDER: There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms. A 32 year-old UMW labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts, home to a sect of religious isolationists called 'The Kindred'.

(Mulder shows some slides showing 'The Kindred'.)

SCULLY: Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, any modern amenities, a lot like the Amish.

MULDER: The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.

SCULLY: What's so weird about that?

MULDER: The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. It's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's sides.

SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?

MULDER: Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails.



SCENE 5
STEVESTON, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder and Scully are walking along what appears to be Main Street. They enter a store run by a man and woman.)

WOMAN: Hi.

MULDER: Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, I'm Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: We're investigating a possible murder.

WOMAN: Oh, there aren't many killings around here.

MULDER: What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?

MAN: Yeah, some folks say it's because they're doing ceremonies up there. Voodoo or something. I've got nothing against them, myself. They bring in the tourists.

(Mulder and Scully are looking at a number of framed pictures on the wall behind the counter. There are several spots where the frames have been taken down.)

SCULLY: Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?

MAN: Oh, those. Those are from back in the thirties.

MULDER: What about the missing ones?

MAN: I'm having them reframed. They're right here under the counter.

MULDER: Can I take a look at them?

MAN: Sure.

(The man brings out several additional photographs that Mulder inspects. Outside, a wagon with about a half dozen people, all clothed in black, is being pulled up the street by a pair of horses.)

MULDER: How would I get up to see them?

MAN: Oh, they don't like strangers up there much. Road's in pretty rough shape. (he hands Mulder a map) That's Steveston.

(The wagon passes the front of the store.)

MAN: That's them now. They usually shop at the feed store.

(The wagon stops in front of the feed store. Those riding in the wagon get off and all but one go into the store. One, Brother Andrew, stays with the horses. Mulder and Scully approach, and Mulder tries to get the attention of three of them as they are entering the store.)

MULDER: Excuse me. Ladies? (they pay no attention and enter the store) (to Scully) I think I'm gonna go inside. (in a "rural" accent) You need anything from the feed store?

(Scully shakes her head, remains outside and tries to strike up a conversation with the one tending the horses.)

SCULLY: (to Brother Andrew) Hi.

(Andrew doesn't respond. Scully walks past him and strokes the neck of one of the horses.)

SCULLY: She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever thrown a shoe? (Andrew looks away) What's her name?

BROTHER ANDREW: (shyly) Alice.

SCULLY: That's sweet. Did you name her?

BROTHER ANDREW: We named her all together. I'm not allowed to talk outside.

SCULLY: That's all right. (she extends her hand) I'm Dana Scully. I don't mean you any harm.

(Andrew hesitates, then reaches out and Scully smiles. As they shake hands, Andrew strokes the top of her hand with his thumb. Scully's expression becomes blank, then somewhat glassy-eyed. The other Kindred emerge from the store.)

KINDRED MAN: Brother Andrew.

(Andrew releases Scully's hand and gets back on the wagon. Scully appears disoriented. Mulder comes out of the store.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?

SCULLY: I was just talking ...

(Her voice falls off on the last syllable and she seems confused. Mulder notices her odd expression.)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

MULDER: You want to sit down?

(Scully doesn't respond. The wagon pulls away from the store, and Mulder and Scully watch them go up the street.)

MULDER: Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them?

SCULLY: There's something up there, Mulder.

MULDER: Oh, I've been saying that for years.



SCENE 6
OUTSIDE STEVESTON

(It is late afternoon. Mulder and Scully park the car as the road becomes very rough. Mulder pulls out the map that he was given at the store. He flips it several times, trying to orient it properly.)

MULDER: Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk.

SCULLY: After you.

(Shortly afterwards, Mulder is still struggling with the map.)

MULDER: Now ... this ... that's west.

SCULLY: What does the map say?

MULDER: (annoyed) That we should be there already.

(He crumples the map into a ball and punts it upwards. Scully catches it. She sighs, then hears a stick breaking and sees members of the Kindred approaching.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(They are quickly surrounded by about a dozen of the Kindred who close in on them.)

SCULLY: We're FBI agents. Federal police.

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to investigate a murder.

SCULLY: I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.

BROTHER OAKLEY: Your weapons are forbidden here. We can outlast you at this spot. You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our Council. You'll have them again, as you leave.

MULDER: We can't do that.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Please. I'm Sister Abby. This is Brother Oakley. We're all saddened by what has happened in your world, but it does not concern us. Up here, no one kills another - ever.

SCULLY: We just want to have a few questions answered.

SISTER ABIGAIL: It is your weapons that are unwelcome here, not you. Come and pray with us, be one of us, and you'll see that we harm no one. Please relinquish your weapons. (Scully and Mulder exhange a glance) Please.

(After several moments, Mulder nods and he and Scully remove the clips from their guns and hand the clips to the Kindred.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Now there is no reason to be afraid.

(Mulder and Scully walk with the Kindred back to their house. On the way, they see members working in a hayfield, chopping wood and hanging out clothes. They enter the dining room in the main house.)

BROTHER OAKLEY: Come. Sit.

(Mulder, Scully and eight members of the Kindred, including Brother Andrew, sit around the table.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us pray as one. We who are separate give thanks for our alloted time in this world. We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided.

(As they pray, one brother is coughing, and Scully and Andrew exchange an awkward glance.)

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We pray for the day of the coming, the moment of our release.

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us eat.

(Food is served.)

MULDER: I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. We're looking for someone we believe may have come from here.

SCULLY: We have pictures.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We do not allow pictures.

SCULLY: A crime has been committed. We have certain questions that we need answered, if you'll forgive us.

BROTHER ANDREW: What are these pictures?

SCULLY: Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder.

BROTHER ANDREW: Where was this crime committed?

SCULLY: In a hotel in Washington, DC.

MULDER: If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe you can identify the individual.

BROTHER ANDREW: How much violence has this person caused in your world?

MULDER: Five murders, so far.

SCULLY: And may kill again, which is why we need your help.

MULDER: Has anyone left here recently?

BROTHER WILTON: (slamming the table with his hand) Your world does not interest us. We have no need for your violence or your questions. I've said what is needed. They have no right to be here at this time.

(Sister Abigail, at the other end of the table from Brother Wilton, stands.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Brother Wilton, stand. (he does) Before we can accept any man's person, we must accept our own. And I ask, who can stand in your sight when once you are angry. I am ashamed to lift up my face, and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time. Make atonements for this wrath, Brother Wilton.

(Brother Wilton looks downward.)

MULDER: That's all right. We didn't take any offense.

BROTHER ANDREW: Anger, as violence, is not tolerated. Our brother must be admonished.

(The brother who was coughing earlier is now gagging, grasping his throat.)

SCULLY: He can't breathe.

SISTER ABIGAIL: He does not need your help.

SCULLY: He's choking to death!

(Scully stands and moves around the table to assist the man.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall.

(One of the brothers grabs Scully by the arm to stop her, while several brothers lift Brother Aaron and carry him out of the room.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: We did not invite you here to interfere.

BROTHER ANDREW: We take care of our own.



SCENE 7
A DANCE CLUB, THE SAME ONE AS IN THE TEASER

(A young man [Marty] approaches a blonde woman.)

MARTY (MALE): Would you like to dance?

BLONDE WOMAN: Not right now. (He takes her hand) Look, I'm really not interested, OK?

MARTY (MALE): Just one dance?

(As the man strokes her hand, the woman's expression changes and she smiles at him.)

BLONDE WOMAN: Hi.

MARTY (MALE): One dance?

(He takes her hand and she follows him to the dance floor.)



SCENE 8
NEAR THE KINDRED'S PROPERTY

(It is night, and members of the Kindred, carrying lanterns, have led Mulder and Scully into the woods.)

BROTHER WILTON: It's a mile to your car. Stay in the path.

MULDER: Thanks for your cooperation.

(Mulder and Scully leave the group, each carrying a lantern. They walk toward the car, now out of sight of the group.)

MULDER: The Addams family finds religion.

SCULLY: Take me back to the 20th century.

MULDER: You believe all that back there, Scully?

SCULLY: Believe all what?

MULDER: All that "we take care of our own" business?

SCULLY: Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.

MULDER: I think it was all an elaborate act.

SCULLY: What? The choking?

MULDER: No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. These people know something, Scully. You can see it in their eyes - the way they look at one another.

SCULLY: Do you think they know who the murderer is?

MULDER: Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours? And that outburst at the table was right on cue. Somehow, they got us to answer their questions. Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?

SCULLY: I know, that was odd.

(They've stopped along the path.)

MULDER: You want to know what was really odd? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today, the ones from the thirties? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight.

SCULLY: These people have probably been intermarrying for years.

MULDER: Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be.

(Mulder turns off his lantern.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm going to go back for a little look-see.

(Scully turns off her lantern and follows. As they get back to the property, they see that the main house is dark. They hear a distant chanting noise.)

MULDER: Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that?

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

(They follow the noise and see a group of people carry lanterns and chanting. They quietly approach as the group goes into a barn and closes the door behind them. Mulder and Scully creep to the barn and peer through spaces in the barn wall. They see a solemn procession, with members carrying the motionless body of Brother Aaron, the one who was choking earlier. A horse near the barn wall becomes agitated, and several members look around warily as part of the group goes through a cellar door in the barn. The rest go back out of the barn.)

SCULLY: What do you think?

MULDER: I think I want to see what's in that cellar.

(Mulder goes around to the door while Scully stays. Through the wall, she sees Mulder enter, walk to the cellar door and enter. Just then, Brother Andrew startles her, placing his hand on her shoulder from behind.)



SCENE 9
STILL OUTSIDE THE BARN

BROTHER ANDREW: Come with me. I can give you information.

(Scully rises and follows him.)

(Mulder has entered the cellar and is walking down a narrow tunnel. As he nears the chanting noise, he stops and observes though a hole in the wall. Members of the kindred are in a cave-like opening.)

(Brother Andrew and Scully enter a room in the house.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I know who did it.

SCULLY: The murders?

BROTHER ANDREW: You've heard our prayers. You've seen how we live our beliefs. I want you to find this killer. I want you to find him for me. He was my best friend.

SCULLY: What's his name?

BROTHER ANDREW: Brother Martin. I called him Marty.

(Back in the cellar, Mulder watches the others perform a ceremony around Brother Aaron's body. They mix spring water with clay material and rub the mixture onto his body.)

(In the house, Scully and Brother Andrew are in a darkened room, illuminated by a single lantern.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty was different.

SCULLY: What do you mean, different?

BROTHER ANDREW: How does he kill?

SCULLY: We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.

BROTHER ANDREW: He poisons them, doesn't he?

SCULLY: Maybe, how do you know that?

(Andrew wedges a chair under the door to block it. Scully shows some apprehension.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I need to show you something ... something about Marty.

(Back in the cellar, the group lifts Brother Aaron's body and leaves it in the cellar, although Mulder cannot see where they put it. They then head back out. After they leave, Mulder moves into the main opening of the cave.)

(In the house, Andrew has brought out a stack of magazines covered in a black cloth. He shows them to Scully.)

BROTHER ANDREW: We found them out on route 44. We were wandering. Marty and I used to do that - explore the edges of our world. Someone must have left them for garbage. They are garbage.

(Scully has looked through the magazines. One of them was entitled "Adventurer", another looks like "Bazaar".)

SCULLY: Why did you keep them?

BROTHER ANDREW: It was Martin who kept them. Some of what I saw in the magazines ... some of it was beautiful, but most of it I didn't like. It was garish. But Martin - Marty - he couldn't get enough. He liked even the paper it was printed on - slick. Marty was captured by your world. He left us to become one of you.

(In the cave, Mulder samples the clay mixture and examines the clay table that Brother Aaron's body was on. He also sees several holes in the clay wall, one of which has a light behind it and a spongy cover on the opening. He hears voices. Grabbing a lantern, he hurries back toward the entrance but sees that people are coming back into the cellar. He runs back into the main chamber and dives into one of the darkened holes in the wall just as several men enter.)

KINDRED MAN #1: Brother Wilton! The woman has returned.

BROTHER WILTON: Where is she?

KINDRED MAN #1: With Andrew, in the main house.

BROTHER WILTON: What about the other one?

KINDRED MAN #1: He's missing.

BROTHER WILTON: Come.

(They leave. Mulder, who has overheard their conversation, looks around where he has been hiding and sees Brother Aaron's body covered in the clay material. His hair seems longer and darker. As Mulder watches, Aaron's eyes open, startling him.)

(Scully and Andrew are still in the house.)

SCULLY: You said Marty was different.

BROTHER ANDREW: Yes.

SCULLY: How? How did he kill his victims?

BROTHER ANDREW: I could be banished.

SCULLY: Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?

(Andrew walks to Scully and takes her hand, rubbing it with his thumb.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

(Outside, Mulder has left the barn and runs next to a fence, near the house. He sees a light on in the house.)

MULDER: (loud whisper) Scully ...

(There is no answer, and Mulder heads toward the house. Inside, Andrew is still stroking Scully's hand and reaches to touch her face. Scully's expression is blank.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty is different. We're all different.

(He moves closer and nuzzles her neck.)

SCULLY: Oh ... oh.

(Scully's body goes limp and Andrew has no difficulty pushing her down on the bed and laying on top of her. The doorknob starts rattling.)

MULDER: (in the hallway) Scully?

(Mulder breaks through the door and sees them on the bed.)

MULDER: Get off of her!

(He grabs Andrew and shoves him aside, then lifts Scully, who is still limp, off the bed and helps her out of the room. Moments later, they exit the house, with Scully now walking by herself but still dazed. They encounter a group of the Kindred as they come out the door.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: I asked you not to interfere.

(They all stare at each other for several seconds. Sister Abigail stands aside, clearing a path for them to leave. Mulder nods. Scully is still dazed, and Mulder leads her away by the hand. The Kindred go into the house, as Mulder and Scully get out of hearing range. Mulder has his arm around Scully, who is still walking stiffly.)

MULDER: What the hell were you doing back there?

SCULLY: (weak voice) I don't know.

MULDER: You don't know?

SCULLY: No.

(Scully stops and stumbles a few steps back, coughing.)

MULDER: You all right?

(Scully bends over and becomes nauseous.)



SCENE 10
THE DANCE CLUB

(A young man, Michael, is on the phone as the loud music pounds in the background. As he speaks, a young woman, the same one from the opening scene, approaches and touches his hand.)

MICHAEL: (to phone) I wasn't ignoring you. No. Of course I saw you, I just didn't recognize you, that's all. (to the young woman) Excuse me, I'm having a conversation ...

(She moves to the other size of him and starts to stroke his other hand. He slowly turns to look at her. He puts the phone down and she then leads him away by the hand.)



SCENE 11
NEAR STEVESTON

(Mulder has stopped at a diner and brings two cups of coffee back to the car, giving one to Scully.)

SCULLY: Thanks.

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Better ... a little embarrassed, actually.

MULDER: Why? You don't remember any of it.

SCULLY: It's like I don't remember ...

MULDER: Why didn't you get out of there before he ...

SCULLY: Because he told me he knew who the killer was.

MULDER: How did you know he wasn't the killer?

SCULLY: I believed him.

(Mulder sighs as he drinks his coffee.)

SCULLY: So what did you see down in the cellar?

MULDER: Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher hole in the wall. Buried alive.

SCULLY: How do you know he was alive?

MULDER: Because I was in there with him. And his face was ... was different. Even his hair, it was almost feminine. It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.

SCULLY: Changing sexes?

MULDER: That would explain the hotel security video.

SCULLY: So you're saying these people ...

MULDER: I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger.

(Scully stares at him for a few moments.)

SCULLY: Think he was trying to kill me?

MULDER: Maybe it's the sex that kills.

SCULLY: Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He starts the car.)



SCENE 12
A PARKED CAR

(Michael and the young woman are making out in the front seat. She is sitting on his lap, kissing him. A figure with a flashlight approaches and knocks on the window.)

COP: All right. Let's break it up. (Michael groans) Out of the car.

MARTY (FEMALE): (getting out of the car) Sorry, officer.

COP: (to Michael, still in the car) You, too. (to Marty) You a pro?

MARTY (FEMALE): Pro?

(Michael starts groaning and gasping in pain. The cop hears him and looks over to see what's wrong.)

COP: What?

(Marty flattens the cop with a left hook to the jaw. As Michael continues to gasp in the car, the cop gets to his knees and Marty, who now looks like a man, delivers an uppercut to the cop's jaw, knocking him out. Michael wipes away the fog on the driver's window and looks out of the car, seeing a man staring back at him. The man runs away as a wide-eyed Michael coughs.)



SCENE 13
A HOSPITAL

(Michael is lying in a hospital bed, being questioned by Mulder and Scully.)

MICHAEL: On a scale of 1 to 10, she was a kind 3. But there was something about her.

SCULLY: Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner?

MICHAEL: Her touch was ... electric. But after that, I remember only vaguely.

MULDER: What do you remember?

MICHAEL: Nothing, actually.

MULDER: Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene supports what you said, but maybe there was something ... unusual about this woman. Something you wouldn't feel comfortable telling the police on the record.

MICHAEL: But this is off the record?

MULDER: Absolutely.

SCULLY: What did you see, Michael?

MICHAEL: After she left the car and she was fighting with the cop, I saw her in her clothes and she looked like ... (nervous laugh) ... she looked like a man.

(Mulder and Scully exchange glances.)

SCULLY: She was a man.

MICHAEL: Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple. (to Mulder) That's off the record.

MULDER: Scout's honor.

(Mulder and Scully are walking down a hallway in the hospital.)

SCULLY: Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking for is a transvestite.

MULDER: I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species.

SCULLY: I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop? She was a he.

(An agent runs toward them.)

AGENT #1: Agent Mulder? Agent Scully? The credit card that was stolen from the last victim in DC was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown, about 8 blocks from here.



SCENE 14
A HOTEL ROOM

MARTY (FEMALE): It was always forbidden, but after the first time I couldn't help myself. Touching a human man, or a woman, is as powerful for me as it was for you.

(Mulder and Scully are entering the hotel.)

SCULLY: This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street. It's the Hotel Catherine.

(Back in the hotel room, as Marty continues to talk, we see that she is talking to an apparently lifeless man lying in the bed.)

MARTY (FEMALE): Your world offers pleasures - pleasures we don't know because we're different. But you know that now. The others will punish me for what I've done. They'll find me, because the day is coming and they won't leave without me.

(Mulder and Scully have arrived on the floor and run down the hallway. Scully finds the room first.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Mulder runs to the door and they draw their weapons and take positions. Mulder knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Delivery!

(There is no answer. Mulder signals that he's going to break in and Scully steps in front of the door.)

MULDER: (breaking in door) FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!

(They don't see anyone inside. Scully goes into the adjoining room and finds the man on the bed.)

SCULLY: Dead body!

(Marty, who was hiding behind a curtain, emerges and hits Scully on the head from behind. She groans and falls to the floor. Marty runs back out into the hall.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (from the floor, weakly) I'm OK.

(Mulder runs out into the hall. He finds the next door open and starts to enter. From inside, Marty strikes him in the face, knocking him to the floor in the hall. As Mulder watches, the female Marty morphs into a male. Mulder reaches for his gun, but the male Marty kicks him in the face, kicks the gun down the hall and runs away, wearing only socks, a sweatshirt and underwear.)

(Back in the first room, Scully gets up and runs into the hall, seeing Mulder lying there, dazed.)

MULDER: (groggily) Scully. Down the stairs ...

(She jumps over him and down the stairs at the end of the hall. She bursts out into the alley below but doesn't see anyone. As she moves through the alley, she hears a noise and sees shadows appear on the side of one of the buildings. Suddenly, the male Marty runs toward her.)

SCULLY: Federal agent, I'm armed! (Marty stops) Back away!

(Suddenly, Marty is tackled by a figure dressed in black. He is surrounded by the Kindred, including Brother Andrew. They get him to his feet.)

SCULLY: Step away! Step away!

(Andrew turns to Scully and walks toward her, while the others hold Marty behind him.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Please. Don't hurt him.

SCULLY: No. Step away. (Andrew continues to approach her) I'm armed.

(Andrew continues to block the others from Scully's line of fire. As he gets close, she starts to lower her gun. Mulder comes out of the hotel and into the alley.)

MULDER: Scully!

(Scully turns to him, and Andrew knocks her gun out of her hand, then strikes her in the face. She falls. As Mulder runs to her aid, shadows on the building wall move away and the Kindred disappear as mysteriously as they appeared.)

(Later, there are police cars in the alley and an agent approaches Scully and Mulder.)

AGENT #2:MULDER: What if they did get through? There's only place they'd hide.



SCENE 15
THE KINDRED PROPERTY NEAR STEVESTON

(The next morning, several 4-wheel drive police vehicles approach. Mulder, Scully, the agent and others emerge and start to search the area. Scully heads to the house and finds no one in the dining area.)

SCULLY: They're gone.

(Mulder has run to the barn and opens the door to the cellar. He finds a solid clay wall behind it. The agent approaches from behind.)

AGENT #2: We found something in the hayfield.

(Mulder and Scully are walking through the hayfield.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. How can they just disappear? They have no means of transportation.

MULDER: No earthly means of transportation.

(They come to a large "crop circle" in the field.)

[THE END]

                                           LAZARUS



SCENE 1
A DANCE CLUB

(Loud music is playing and strobe lights illuminate an otherwise dark club. A young man tries to strike up a conversation with a blonde woman, but without success as she walks away. He goes to a video machine to read his horoscope. A young woman comes alongside him and tries to get his attention, but he appears disinterested and looks back at the video screen. She takes his left hand in hers and suddenly he seems very interested in her. He leans over and she whispers something in his ear. They then walk away hand in hand.)



SCENE 2
A HOTEL ROOM

(Later, they are in bed and have just had sex. She gets off the bed and stands some distance away from the bed, while he tries to catch his breath.)

YOUNG MAN: Oh, my God! That was ... that was incredible. I mean it. You don't believe me. Can you hear me? Hey, I ... I don't even know your name.

(He sits up in bed but then shows signs of being in pain. He coughs and moans, clutching his throat, and falls back in the bed. A foam comes out of his mouth and he appears dead. Nearby, the woman drops her lingerie to the floor, walks across the room and starts to put on the man's clothes. As the camera pans upward, we see that it is now a man.)

SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE (THE HOTEL ROOM), GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND, OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

(A photographer is taking pictures of the scene while Mulder examines the man's body. Scully stands to the side talking with Detective Horton.)

HORTON: New York businessman calls his wife to say good night, then goes out and picks up some chippy. He brings her back here for sex. Beyond that, well, nothing makes a whole lot of sense.

SCULLY: How's that?

HORTON: Security monitor records the victim entering the room with a woman at 10:13. Same monitor records a male leaving just after midnight.

SCULLY: Couldn't she just have changed clothes?

HORTON: Thought of that. Male is definitely a different person - short hair and at least 30 pounds heavier. The video never recorded his entry, nor the chippy ever leaving.

SCULLY: Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?

HORTON: Guy blew an artery. Must have been some roll in the hay.

(Mulder looks up at Scully, who shows no reaction to the Detective's comment.)

SCULLY: Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex with a perfect stranger. Any sign of robbery?

HORTON: The male exited wearing the victim's suit, carrying a suitcase. The wallet's gone.

SCULLY: You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the first place.

HORTON: Really? Somebody at the Bureau put out a memo requesting any case involving this exact COD. I assumed it was ...

MULDER: Thanks for the call.



SCENE 4
MULDER'S OFFICE

(Mulder and Scully are looking at slides of several dead bodies, all lying in bed in various stages of undress.)

MULDER: Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston. In each case, the victim dies in the throes of passion. Two women and three men, including the last one.

SCULLY: All young, healthy adults.

MULDER: All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.

SCULLY: You think there's a new drug on the streets?

MULDER: The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.

SCULLY: The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants?

MULDER: Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature, strong enough to product anaphylactic shock or a coronary.

SCULLY: So you think somebody is synthesizing them?

MULDER: It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations and hold on to your hat, Scully, 'cause you're gonna love this. The pheromones we're talking about - they contain human DNA.

SCULLY: Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones. So how can that be?

MULDER: I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking aphrodysiac. He's the ultimate sex magnet.

SCULLY: He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.

MULDER: I know. That is a puzzle.

SCULLY: So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, weight, sex. Unarmed but extremely attractive.

MULDER: It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths matching this MO in the last six weeks - in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and here in Washington.

(Mulder circles the cities on a map that is being displayed with an overhead projector.)

SCULLY: The killer's moving south.

MULDER: There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms. A 32 year-old UMW labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts, home to a sect of religious isolationists called 'The Kindred'.

(Mulder shows some slides showing 'The Kindred'.)

SCULLY: Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, any modern amenities, a lot like the Amish.

MULDER: The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.

SCULLY: What's so weird about that?

MULDER: The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. It's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's sides.

SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?

MULDER: Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails.



SCENE 5
STEVESTON, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder and Scully are walking along what appears to be Main Street. They enter a store run by a man and woman.)

WOMAN: Hi.

MULDER: Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, I'm Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: We're investigating a possible murder.

WOMAN: Oh, there aren't many killings around here.

MULDER: What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?

MAN: Yeah, some folks say it's because they're doing ceremonies up there. Voodoo or something. I've got nothing against them, myself. They bring in the tourists.

(Mulder and Scully are looking at a number of framed pictures on the wall behind the counter. There are several spots where the frames have been taken down.)

SCULLY: Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?

MAN: Oh, those. Those are from back in the thirties.

MULDER: What about the missing ones?

MAN: I'm having them reframed. They're right here under the counter.

MULDER: Can I take a look at them?

MAN: Sure.

(The man brings out several additional photographs that Mulder inspects. Outside, a wagon with about a half dozen people, all clothed in black, is being pulled up the street by a pair of horses.)

MULDER: How would I get up to see them?

MAN: Oh, they don't like strangers up there much. Road's in pretty rough shape. (he hands Mulder a map) That's Steveston.

(The wagon passes the front of the store.)

MAN: That's them now. They usually shop at the feed store.

(The wagon stops in front of the feed store. Those riding in the wagon get off and all but one go into the store. One, Brother Andrew, stays with the horses. Mulder and Scully approach, and Mulder tries to get the attention of three of them as they are entering the store.)

MULDER: Excuse me. Ladies? (they pay no attention and enter the store) (to Scully) I think I'm gonna go inside. (in a "rural" accent) You need anything from the feed store?

(Scully shakes her head, remains outside and tries to strike up a conversation with the one tending the horses.)

SCULLY: (to Brother Andrew) Hi.

(Andrew doesn't respond. Scully walks past him and strokes the neck of one of the horses.)

SCULLY: She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever thrown a shoe? (Andrew looks away) What's her name?

BROTHER ANDREW: (shyly) Alice.

SCULLY: That's sweet. Did you name her?

BROTHER ANDREW: We named her all together. I'm not allowed to talk outside.

SCULLY: That's all right. (she extends her hand) I'm Dana Scully. I don't mean you any harm.

(Andrew hesitates, then reaches out and Scully smiles. As they shake hands, Andrew strokes the top of her hand with his thumb. Scully's expression becomes blank, then somewhat glassy-eyed. The other Kindred emerge from the store.)

KINDRED MAN: Brother Andrew.

(Andrew releases Scully's hand and gets back on the wagon. Scully appears disoriented. Mulder comes out of the store.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?

SCULLY: I was just talking ...

(Her voice falls off on the last syllable and she seems confused. Mulder notices her odd expression.)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

MULDER: You want to sit down?

(Scully doesn't respond. The wagon pulls away from the store, and Mulder and Scully watch them go up the street.)

MULDER: Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them?

SCULLY: There's something up there, Mulder.

MULDER: Oh, I've been saying that for years.



SCENE 6
OUTSIDE STEVESTON

(It is late afternoon. Mulder and Scully park the car as the road becomes very rough. Mulder pulls out the map that he was given at the store. He flips it several times, trying to orient it properly.)

MULDER: Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk.

SCULLY: After you.

(Shortly afterwards, Mulder is still struggling with the map.)

MULDER: Now ... this ... that's west.

SCULLY: What does the map say?

MULDER: (annoyed) That we should be there already.

(He crumples the map into a ball and punts it upwards. Scully catches it. She sighs, then hears a stick breaking and sees members of the Kindred approaching.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(They are quickly surrounded by about a dozen of the Kindred who close in on them.)

SCULLY: We're FBI agents. Federal police.

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to investigate a murder.

SCULLY: I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.

BROTHER OAKLEY: Your weapons are forbidden here. We can outlast you at this spot. You're not leaving where we stand until your guns are handed to our Council. You'll have them again, as you leave.

MULDER: We can't do that.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Please. I'm Sister Abby. This is Brother Oakley. We're all saddened by what has happened in your world, but it does not concern us. Up here, no one kills another - ever.

SCULLY: We just want to have a few questions answered.

SISTER ABIGAIL: It is your weapons that are unwelcome here, not you. Come and pray with us, be one of us, and you'll see that we harm no one. Please relinquish your weapons. (Scully and Mulder exhange a glance) Please.

(After several moments, Mulder nods and he and Scully remove the clips from their guns and hand the clips to the Kindred.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Now there is no reason to be afraid.

(Mulder and Scully walk with the Kindred back to their house. On the way, they see members working in a hayfield, chopping wood and hanging out clothes. They enter the dining room in the main house.)

BROTHER OAKLEY: Come. Sit.

(Mulder, Scully and eight members of the Kindred, including Brother Andrew, sit around the table.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us pray as one. We who are separate give thanks for our alloted time in this world. We ask for strength that we may bring forth the bounty that God has provided.

(As they pray, one brother is coughing, and Scully and Andrew exchange an awkward glance.)

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We pray for the day of the coming, the moment of our release.

ALL: Amen.

SISTER ABIGAIL: Let us eat.

(Food is served.)

MULDER: I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. We're looking for someone we believe may have come from here.

SCULLY: We have pictures.

SISTER ABIGAIL: We do not allow pictures.

SCULLY: A crime has been committed. We have certain questions that we need answered, if you'll forgive us.

BROTHER ANDREW: What are these pictures?

SCULLY: Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder.

BROTHER ANDREW: Where was this crime committed?

SCULLY: In a hotel in Washington, DC.

MULDER: If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe you can identify the individual.

BROTHER ANDREW: How much violence has this person caused in your world?

MULDER: Five murders, so far.

SCULLY: And may kill again, which is why we need your help.

MULDER: Has anyone left here recently?

BROTHER WILTON: (slamming the table with his hand) Your world does not interest us. We have no need for your violence or your questions. I've said what is needed. They have no right to be here at this time.

(Sister Abigail, at the other end of the table from Brother Wilton, stands.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Brother Wilton, stand. (he does) Before we can accept any man's person, we must accept our own. And I ask, who can stand in your sight when once you are angry. I am ashamed to lift up my face, and I shall not be ashamed in this evil time. Make atonements for this wrath, Brother Wilton.

(Brother Wilton looks downward.)

MULDER: That's all right. We didn't take any offense.

BROTHER ANDREW: Anger, as violence, is not tolerated. Our brother must be admonished.

(The brother who was coughing earlier is now gagging, grasping his throat.)

SCULLY: He can't breathe.

SISTER ABIGAIL: He does not need your help.

SCULLY: He's choking to death!

(Scully stands and moves around the table to assist the man.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall.

(One of the brothers grabs Scully by the arm to stop her, while several brothers lift Brother Aaron and carry him out of the room.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: We did not invite you here to interfere.

BROTHER ANDREW: We take care of our own.



SCENE 7
A DANCE CLUB, THE SAME ONE AS IN THE TEASER

(A young man [Marty] approaches a blonde woman.)

MARTY (MALE): Would you like to dance?

BLONDE WOMAN: Not right now. (He takes her hand) Look, I'm really not interested, OK?

MARTY (MALE): Just one dance?

(As the man strokes her hand, the woman's expression changes and she smiles at him.)

BLONDE WOMAN: Hi.

MARTY (MALE): One dance?

(He takes her hand and she follows him to the dance floor.)



SCENE 8
NEAR THE KINDRED'S PROPERTY

(It is night, and members of the Kindred, carrying lanterns, have led Mulder and Scully into the woods.)

BROTHER WILTON: It's a mile to your car. Stay in the path.

MULDER: Thanks for your cooperation.

(Mulder and Scully leave the group, each carrying a lantern. They walk toward the car, now out of sight of the group.)

MULDER: The Addams family finds religion.

SCULLY: Take me back to the 20th century.

MULDER: You believe all that back there, Scully?

SCULLY: Believe all what?

MULDER: All that "we take care of our own" business?

SCULLY: Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.

MULDER: I think it was all an elaborate act.

SCULLY: What? The choking?

MULDER: No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. These people know something, Scully. You can see it in their eyes - the way they look at one another.

SCULLY: Do you think they know who the murderer is?

MULDER: Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours? And that outburst at the table was right on cue. Somehow, they got us to answer their questions. Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?

SCULLY: I know, that was odd.

(They've stopped along the path.)

MULDER: You want to know what was really odd? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today, the ones from the thirties? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight.

SCULLY: These people have probably been intermarrying for years.

MULDER: Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be.

(Mulder turns off his lantern.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm going to go back for a little look-see.

(Scully turns off her lantern and follows. As they get back to the property, they see that the main house is dark. They hear a distant chanting noise.)

MULDER: Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that?

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

(They follow the noise and see a group of people carry lanterns and chanting. They quietly approach as the group goes into a barn and closes the door behind them. Mulder and Scully creep to the barn and peer through spaces in the barn wall. They see a solemn procession, with members carrying the motionless body of Brother Aaron, the one who was choking earlier. A horse near the barn wall becomes agitated, and several members look around warily as part of the group goes through a cellar door in the barn. The rest go back out of the barn.)

SCULLY: What do you think?

MULDER: I think I want to see what's in that cellar.

(Mulder goes around to the door while Scully stays. Through the wall, she sees Mulder enter, walk to the cellar door and enter. Just then, Brother Andrew startles her, placing his hand on her shoulder from behind.)



SCENE 9
STILL OUTSIDE THE BARN

BROTHER ANDREW: Come with me. I can give you information.

(Scully rises and follows him.)

(Mulder has entered the cellar and is walking down a narrow tunnel. As he nears the chanting noise, he stops and observes though a hole in the wall. Members of the kindred are in a cave-like opening.)

(Brother Andrew and Scully enter a room in the house.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I know who did it.

SCULLY: The murders?

BROTHER ANDREW: You've heard our prayers. You've seen how we live our beliefs. I want you to find this killer. I want you to find him for me. He was my best friend.

SCULLY: What's his name?

BROTHER ANDREW: Brother Martin. I called him Marty.

(Back in the cellar, Mulder watches the others perform a ceremony around Brother Aaron's body. They mix spring water with clay material and rub the mixture onto his body.)

(In the house, Scully and Brother Andrew are in a darkened room, illuminated by a single lantern.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty was different.

SCULLY: What do you mean, different?

BROTHER ANDREW: How does he kill?

SCULLY: We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.

BROTHER ANDREW: He poisons them, doesn't he?

SCULLY: Maybe, how do you know that?

(Andrew wedges a chair under the door to block it. Scully shows some apprehension.)

BROTHER ANDREW: I need to show you something ... something about Marty.

(Back in the cellar, the group lifts Brother Aaron's body and leaves it in the cellar, although Mulder cannot see where they put it. They then head back out. After they leave, Mulder moves into the main opening of the cave.)

(In the house, Andrew has brought out a stack of magazines covered in a black cloth. He shows them to Scully.)

BROTHER ANDREW: We found them out on route 44. We were wandering. Marty and I used to do that - explore the edges of our world. Someone must have left them for garbage. They are garbage.

(Scully has looked through the magazines. One of them was entitled "Adventurer", another looks like "Bazaar".)

SCULLY: Why did you keep them?

BROTHER ANDREW: It was Martin who kept them. Some of what I saw in the magazines ... some of it was beautiful, but most of it I didn't like. It was garish. But Martin - Marty - he couldn't get enough. He liked even the paper it was printed on - slick. Marty was captured by your world. He left us to become one of you.

(In the cave, Mulder samples the clay mixture and examines the clay table that Brother Aaron's body was on. He also sees several holes in the clay wall, one of which has a light behind it and a spongy cover on the opening. He hears voices. Grabbing a lantern, he hurries back toward the entrance but sees that people are coming back into the cellar. He runs back into the main chamber and dives into one of the darkened holes in the wall just as several men enter.)

KINDRED MAN #1: Brother Wilton! The woman has returned.

BROTHER WILTON: Where is she?

KINDRED MAN #1: With Andrew, in the main house.

BROTHER WILTON: What about the other one?

KINDRED MAN #1: He's missing.

BROTHER WILTON: Come.

(They leave. Mulder, who has overheard their conversation, looks around where he has been hiding and sees Brother Aaron's body covered in the clay material. His hair seems longer and darker. As Mulder watches, Aaron's eyes open, startling him.)

(Scully and Andrew are still in the house.)

SCULLY: You said Marty was different.

BROTHER ANDREW: Yes.

SCULLY: How? How did he kill his victims?

BROTHER ANDREW: I could be banished.

SCULLY: Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?

(Andrew walks to Scully and takes her hand, rubbing it with his thumb.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

(Outside, Mulder has left the barn and runs next to a fence, near the house. He sees a light on in the house.)

MULDER: (loud whisper) Scully ...

(There is no answer, and Mulder heads toward the house. Inside, Andrew is still stroking Scully's hand and reaches to touch her face. Scully's expression is blank.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Marty is different. We're all different.

(He moves closer and nuzzles her neck.)

SCULLY: Oh ... oh.

(Scully's body goes limp and Andrew has no difficulty pushing her down on the bed and laying on top of her. The doorknob starts rattling.)

MULDER: (in the hallway) Scully?

(Mulder breaks through the door and sees them on the bed.)

MULDER: Get off of her!

(He grabs Andrew and shoves him aside, then lifts Scully, who is still limp, off the bed and helps her out of the room. Moments later, they exit the house, with Scully now walking by herself but still dazed. They encounter a group of the Kindred as they come out the door.)

SISTER ABIGAIL: I asked you not to interfere.

(They all stare at each other for several seconds. Sister Abigail stands aside, clearing a path for them to leave. Mulder nods. Scully is still dazed, and Mulder leads her away by the hand. The Kindred go into the house, as Mulder and Scully get out of hearing range. Mulder has his arm around Scully, who is still walking stiffly.)

MULDER: What the hell were you doing back there?

SCULLY: (weak voice) I don't know.

MULDER: You don't know?

SCULLY: No.

(Scully stops and stumbles a few steps back, coughing.)

MULDER: You all right?

(Scully bends over and becomes nauseous.)



SCENE 10
THE DANCE CLUB

(A young man, Michael, is on the phone as the loud music pounds in the background. As he speaks, a young woman, the same one from the opening scene, approaches and touches his hand.)

MICHAEL: (to phone) I wasn't ignoring you. No. Of course I saw you, I just didn't recognize you, that's all. (to the young woman) Excuse me, I'm having a conversation ...

(She moves to the other size of him and starts to stroke his other hand. He slowly turns to look at her. He puts the phone down and she then leads him away by the hand.)



SCENE 11
NEAR STEVESTON

(Mulder has stopped at a diner and brings two cups of coffee back to the car, giving one to Scully.)

SCULLY: Thanks.

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Better ... a little embarrassed, actually.

MULDER: Why? You don't remember any of it.

SCULLY: It's like I don't remember ...

MULDER: Why didn't you get out of there before he ...

SCULLY: Because he told me he knew who the killer was.

MULDER: How did you know he wasn't the killer?

SCULLY: I believed him.

(Mulder sighs as he drinks his coffee.)

SCULLY: So what did you see down in the cellar?

MULDER: Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher hole in the wall. Buried alive.

SCULLY: How do you know he was alive?

MULDER: Because I was in there with him. And his face was ... was different. Even his hair, it was almost feminine. It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.

SCULLY: Changing sexes?

MULDER: That would explain the hotel security video.

SCULLY: So you're saying these people ...

MULDER: I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger.

(Scully stares at him for a few moments.)

SCULLY: Think he was trying to kill me?

MULDER: Maybe it's the sex that kills.

SCULLY: Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He starts the car.)



SCENE 12
A PARKED CAR

(Michael and the young woman are making out in the front seat. She is sitting on his lap, kissing him. A figure with a flashlight approaches and knocks on the window.)

COP: All right. Let's break it up. (Michael groans) Out of the car.

MARTY (FEMALE): (getting out of the car) Sorry, officer.

COP: (to Michael, still in the car) You, too. (to Marty) You a pro?

MARTY (FEMALE): Pro?

(Michael starts groaning and gasping in pain. The cop hears him and looks over to see what's wrong.)

COP: What?

(Marty flattens the cop with a left hook to the jaw. As Michael continues to gasp in the car, the cop gets to his knees and Marty, who now looks like a man, delivers an uppercut to the cop's jaw, knocking him out. Michael wipes away the fog on the driver's window and looks out of the car, seeing a man staring back at him. The man runs away as a wide-eyed Michael coughs.)



SCENE 13
A HOSPITAL

(Michael is lying in a hospital bed, being questioned by Mulder and Scully.)

MICHAEL: On a scale of 1 to 10, she was a kind 3. But there was something about her.

SCULLY: Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner?

MICHAEL: Her touch was ... electric. But after that, I remember only vaguely.

MULDER: What do you remember?

MICHAEL: Nothing, actually.

MULDER: Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene supports what you said, but maybe there was something ... unusual about this woman. Something you wouldn't feel comfortable telling the police on the record.

MICHAEL: But this is off the record?

MULDER: Absolutely.

SCULLY: What did you see, Michael?

MICHAEL: After she left the car and she was fighting with the cop, I saw her in her clothes and she looked like ... (nervous laugh) ... she looked like a man.

(Mulder and Scully exchange glances.)

SCULLY: She was a man.

MICHAEL: Hustling in the club scene used to be so simple. (to Mulder) That's off the record.

MULDER: Scout's honor.

(Mulder and Scully are walking down a hallway in the hospital.)

SCULLY: Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking for is a transvestite.

MULDER: I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species.

SCULLY: I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop? She was a he.

(An agent runs toward them.)

AGENT #1: Agent Mulder? Agent Scully? The credit card that was stolen from the last victim in DC was just used to order takeout in a hotel downtown, about 8 blocks from here.



SCENE 14
A HOTEL ROOM

MARTY (FEMALE): It was always forbidden, but after the first time I couldn't help myself. Touching a human man, or a woman, is as powerful for me as it was for you.

(Mulder and Scully are entering the hotel.)

SCULLY: This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street. It's the Hotel Catherine.

(Back in the hotel room, as Marty continues to talk, we see that she is talking to an apparently lifeless man lying in the bed.)

MARTY (FEMALE): Your world offers pleasures - pleasures we don't know because we're different. But you know that now. The others will punish me for what I've done. They'll find me, because the day is coming and they won't leave without me.

(Mulder and Scully have arrived on the floor and run down the hallway. Scully finds the room first.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Mulder runs to the door and they draw their weapons and take positions. Mulder knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Delivery!

(There is no answer. Mulder signals that he's going to break in and Scully steps in front of the door.)

MULDER: (breaking in door) FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!

(They don't see anyone inside. Scully goes into the adjoining room and finds the man on the bed.)

SCULLY: Dead body!

(Marty, who was hiding behind a curtain, emerges and hits Scully on the head from behind. She groans and falls to the floor. Marty runs back out into the hall.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (from the floor, weakly) I'm OK.

(Mulder runs out into the hall. He finds the next door open and starts to enter. From inside, Marty strikes him in the face, knocking him to the floor in the hall. As Mulder watches, the female Marty morphs into a male. Mulder reaches for his gun, but the male Marty kicks him in the face, kicks the gun down the hall and runs away, wearing only socks, a sweatshirt and underwear.)

(Back in the first room, Scully gets up and runs into the hall, seeing Mulder lying there, dazed.)

MULDER: (groggily) Scully. Down the stairs ...

(She jumps over him and down the stairs at the end of the hall. She bursts out into the alley below but doesn't see anyone. As she moves through the alley, she hears a noise and sees shadows appear on the side of one of the buildings. Suddenly, the male Marty runs toward her.)

SCULLY: Federal agent, I'm armed! (Marty stops) Back away!

(Suddenly, Marty is tackled by a figure dressed in black. He is surrounded by the Kindred, including Brother Andrew. They get him to his feet.)

SCULLY: Step away! Step away!

(Andrew turns to Scully and walks toward her, while the others hold Marty behind him.)

BROTHER ANDREW: Please. Don't hurt him.

SCULLY: No. Step away. (Andrew continues to approach her) I'm armed.

(Andrew continues to block the others from Scully's line of fire. As he gets close, she starts to lower her gun. Mulder comes out of the hotel and into the alley.)

MULDER: Scully!

(Scully turns to him, and Andrew knocks her gun out of her hand, then strikes her in the face. She falls. As Mulder runs to her aid, shadows on the building wall move away and the Kindred disappear as mysteriously as they appeared.)

(Later, there are police cars in the alley and an agent approaches Scully and Mulder.)

AGENT #2:MULDER: What if they did get through? There's only place they'd hide.



SCENE 15
THE KINDRED PROPERTY NEAR STEVESTON

(The next morning, several 4-wheel drive police vehicles approach. Mulder, Scully, the agent and others emerge and start to search the area. Scully heads to the house and finds no one in the dining area.)

SCULLY: They're gone.

(Mulder has run to the barn and opens the door to the cellar. He finds a solid clay wall behind it. The agent approaches from behind.)

AGENT #2: We found something in the hayfield.

(Mulder and Scully are walking through the hayfield.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. How can they just disappear? They have no means of transportation.

MULDER: No earthly means of transportation.

(They come to a large "crop circle" in the field.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TASHMOO FEDERAL CORRECTION FACILITY
PENNSYLVANIA, 1989

(A wheelchair-bound man named Joe Crandell slowly rolls down a hallway past an empty bed that intrigues him. He hears screaming and rolls down in that direction. The screaming grows louder as he approaches a door. Opening it up, he slowly wheels in. He sees Doctor Ridley working over a man named John Barnett.)

JOE CRANDELL: What are you doing to Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Excuse me?

JOE CRANDELL: What are you doing to Johnny?

(Ridley puts down his knife.)

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Go on back to your ward. There's nothing you can do for your friend now.

JOE CRANDELL: What?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett is dead.

JOE CRANDELL: No, I heard him screaming.

(Ridley picks up a knife and walks over to him, then puts the knife up under Crandell's neck.)

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I said John Barnett is dead. You understand?

(Crandell nods and goes to leave. Barnett looks at him with dead, dull eyes, his pupils completely blue.)

Go on, Crandell, get out of here. There's nothing more to see here. You understand?

(Barnett blinks. Crandell leaves. Barnett blinks again.)

SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.; PRESENT DAY

(Mulder and Scully get out of their car and start into the jewelry store.)

SCULLY: I still don't get it. What does this have to do with us?

MULDER: Robbing a jewelry store is a federal crime.

SCULLY: Thank you.

MULDER: I don't know. I got a call from some guy I used to work with over at the violent crimes section, said it was important.

(The coroner wheels away a victim as Mulder and Scully walk over to Agent Reggie Purdue. Mulder starts chanting.)

MULDER: Reggie! Reggie!

(They shake hands.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, God, I hate it when you do that.

MULDER: This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue.

(Scully and Purdue shake hands.)

REGGIE PURDUE: How are you?

SCULLY: What happened here?

REGGIE PURDUE: Lone gunman took out a salesgirl after she filled up a bag for him.

MULDER: You guys turn up anything?

REGGIE PURDUE: Not much... except... this. It's going to blow your mind.

MULDER: Why?

REGGIE PURDUE: I'm telling you, Mulder, this is going to blow... your... mind.

(He hands Mulder an evidence bag with a piece of paper in it. Mulder reads the paper.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: Wait, wait a second...

REGGIE PURDUE: You see why I called you?

MULDER: What about witness descriptions?

REGGIE PURDUE: White male, five-eleven to six feet, ski mask.

(Mulder stares at him.)

MULDER: Damn it, Reggie, that's Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, but it can't be.

SCULLY: Who's Barnett?

(They stare at her. Mulder and Scully walk out.)

MULDER: It was my first case at the bureau. Barnett was doing armed jobs all over D.C. and getting away with it, very trigger-happy. Killed seven people. There was this big task force, Reggie was my ASAC. I was twenty-eight years old, right out of the academy. I had this theory on the case. Reggie thought I was full of it. I was full of it.

SCULLY: What was the theory?

MULDER: That Barnett had an inside connection. An employee at the armored car company was tipping him off about large shipments of cash. Turns out I was sort of right.

SCULLY: Sort of?

MULDER: Yeah, we planted bogus waybills, manifests with the armored car company to try to set a trap but Barnett was way ahead of us. That's... when the notes started.

(They stop walking. He hands Scully the bag with the note in it.)

SCULLY: "Fox can't guard the chicken coop."

MULDER: Clever, huh?

SCULLY: So you never caught him?

MULDER: No, we did. We did, but not, uh, not clean. An agent died because I screwed up.

(She stares at him for a second.)

SCULLY: And what happened to Barnett?

MULDER: He avoided the death penalty on a technicality. But he went down for every job he did. Consecutive terms, three-hundred-and-forty years. The judge promised me he would die in prison.

SCULLY: So you think he escaped?

MULDER: No, that's just it. He did die in prison, four years ago.

SCULLY: You're sure?

MULDER: I was paying attention.

(He walks away.)

(Agent Henderson is looking at the note under an electron-emission note. Mulder is looking as well through a second pair of lenses on the same machine.)

HENDERSON: This guy a friend of yours?

MULDER: Yeah, I play golf with him every Sunday. What do you think?

HENDERSON: You just brought this in ten minutes ago.

MULDER: You're slipping, Henderson.

HENDERSON: Ten minutes may be enough time for you, Mulder. Of course, I wouldn't know that from personal experience.

(Mulder looks at her, sitting down.)

MULDER: Yeah... seriously, what do you think?

HENDERSON: Okay, first impressions... the ink is fresh, the note was written in the last forty-eight hours. Ballpoint, but you knew that. A right-hander. Let's see... written by someone sitting down, but now I'm just showing off.

MULDER: Yeah, does it match Barnett?

HENDERSON: I'd say it's him.

MULDER: But you're not sure?

(Henderson looks at him.)

HENDERSON: Ninety-five percent. The writing's sloppy. Some of the ascenders and descenders are heavier.

MULDER: Could it have been traced over an old note of Barnett's?

HENDERSON: Could be, but it's a damn good job if it is.

MULDER: Thanks, Henderson, I owe you one.

HENDERSON: Promises, promises.

(Mulder leaves.)



SCENE 4
REGGIE PURDUE'S OFFICE

(Scully and Purdue are watching a video of the stake-out where they caught Barnett. Agents surround the track as Barnett steps out, holding a gun to his partner's head.)

REGGIE PURDUE: There's Barnett. We staked-out an airport warehouse but everything went to hell when Barnett took the driver of the armored truck hostage.

(Mulder sneaks up behind Barnett.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

REGGIE PURDUE: There, coming around back. Barnett doesn't see him.

SCULLY: He's got a clear shot.

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, he should've taken it.

SCULLY: But he couldn't.

REGGIE PURDUE: No, no, not with a hostage so close.

SCULLY: Because it's not by the book.

REGGIE PURDUE: It would have saved one life, maybe two. Bastard Barnett just started blasting away.

(Reggie stands. In the video, Barnett shoots his hostage then another agent before Mulder tags him twice.)

SCULLY: So, Mulder did shoot Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: Twice, in the shoulder and hand but not before Barnett killed the driver and Agent Steve Wallenberg. Mulder never forgave himself for that. You should have heard his testimony at Barnett's trial.

SCULLY: Probably had a lot to do with the sentence the judge gave Barnett.

REGGIE PURDUE: I'll never forget Mulder coming down from the witness stand and Barnett turning and saying he'd get Mulder. To tell you the truth, I wish Mulder had killed Barnett right there in the warehouse.

(He walks away. On the video is a still shot of the agents hovering over Barnett.)



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder takes a print-out out of the printer as Scully walks over.)

SCULLY: What did Henderson come up with?

MULDER: Ninety-five percent sure it's Barnett's handwriting.

(Scully looks at the paper.)

SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: Federal Bureau of Prisons sent me a copy of his death certificate. "Name of deceased, Barnett, John Irvin. Cause of death, cardiac arrest. Date, September sixteenth, 1989."

(They start off.)

SCULLY: Then it must be a very clever copycat.

MULDER: The note was written in the last forty-eight hours.

SCULLY: Pull any prints?

MULDER: No prints.

SCULLY: Barnett had a lot of time on his hands while he was in prison, maybe he planned it with someone on the outside.

(Mulder opens the door to an office.)

MULDER: Revenge from the grave? That'd be a neat trick.

SCULLY: He planned to get you, didn't he?

(Mulder stares at her.)

I was just down talking to Agent Purdue.

MULDER: And he showed you the videotape?

(She nods.)

SCULLY: You did the right thing, Mulder.

MULDER: Did I? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids. One of his boys is an all-star on his football team now. If I had pulled the trigger two seconds earlier and Wallenberg would be here to see his kid play. Instead, I got some dead man robbing jewelry stores and sending me haikus.

(He walks into the office.)



SCENE 6
FOOTBALL FIELD

(A young football team is playing in the mud. The coach is out on the field watching. The kids shout to one another. Parents watch on the bleachers. Mulder also sits there.)

COACH: Fire it in there!

(The quarterback throws a pass to his reciever.)

Yeah, that's better!

WOMAN: Very good! Way to go, Alex!

COACH: Hustle it up! Come on, guys, line it up. Let's go.

QUARTERBACK: Down! Set! Hut!

(The boys run another play.)

COACH: Go, go, go! You're the man, there it is!

(The quarterback fires another shot to the receiver.)

WOMAN: Very good!

COACH: That was over the line, let's go! Okay, watch the ball.

(Mulder starts off. He passes a strange man, heavily dressed. He walks over to his car as the screams fade. A package is on his car seat. He opens the door and takes it. Opening it up, he sees surveillance photos and a note that reads "A hunted Fox eventually dies." Mulder shuffles through the surveillance photos and looks around for Barnett.)

MULDER: I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

(The parents and kids on the bleachers look back at him. Mulder gets in his car and drives off. The strange man looks back at him, eyes glazed over, pupils completely blue and dead.)



SCENE 7
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Purdue, sitting at his desk, looks through the various pictures that were in the envelope.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Agent Mulder, and I think that somebody is messing with your head.

MULDER: Barnett said he'd get me, you were there.

REGGIE PURDUE: I don't care what Barnett said, he's dead, Mulder.

MULDER: Apparently not.

REGGIE PURDUE: Aw, come on. Let me tell you something, there are a lot of guys who know that Barnett made the threat.

MULDER: It's Barnett, Reggie.

REGGIE PURDUE: How could you say that?

MULDER: I don't know, I just feel it.

(Purdue stands and signals to a man, who walks out. Purdue closes the door.)

REGGIE PURDUE: You know, all this talk about you, about "Spooky" Mulder, I never used to pay it much mind. I figured it was just talk about how paranoid you were and all.

MULDER: And now?

REGGIE PURDUE: Remember the day you walked into my office wet from Quantico? You pissed me off just looking at you but then I saw how your mind worked. How you were always three jumps ahead. It was scary, Mulder. Everybody said so.

MULDER: I've heard this story.

(Mulder turns, but Reggie grabs his arm and turns him back around.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, well, maybe you ought to hear it again. You let a lot of people down here in the bureau. They had big plans for you. A lot of people are saying that "Spooky" Mulder has become an embarrassment, a liability.

MULDER: What? Are you saying that somebody from the bureau's behind this?

REGGIE PURDUE: Maybe, maybe not. It's always best to cover your ass in any event.

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: Sorry. This was just faxed.

(She hands Purdue a paper.)

This is a copy of John Barnett's last will and testament. No surviving relatives, left what little he had to another prisoner... a Joe Crandall... and instructions for his body to be cremated. His will was executed six months after his death and this document states that his ashes were spread along the bank of the Delaware River by an employee of the crematory used by the prison.

REGGIE PURDUE: It's like I said, I think somebody's messing with your head.

MULDER: Killing a sales clerk just to leave me a note? I'd say that's going a little out of your way.

(He picks up the pictures and leaves.)



SCENE 8
COMPUTER LAB

(Mulder is sitting next to the computer technician. On the screen is a picture of Barnett with the words "Subject: Barnett, John.")

MULDER: He's older now, he may have put on some weight.

COMPUTER TECHNICIAN: How much older?

MULDER: Five years.

(She presses some keys and on the screen, Barnett's face grows older and thinner.)

He could be wearing any kind of disguise.

(She presses some more keys and Barnett grows a beard. Mulder stands and thinks back to his day in court. He sits on the stand as the prosecutor walks around.)

PROSECUTOR: Take us back to the day in question. Was it your impression, Agent Mulder, that John Barnett took a kind of a perverse pleasure in his crimes? Didn't he send you notes to taunt you?

(She glares at Barnett as she passes him by.)

MULDER: Yes, I felt that he was, uh, daring us to catch him. That he killed his victims almost as if it were part of a game.

PROSECUTOR: Describe for the court if you would, Agent Mulder, what happened when you finally caught John Barnett.

MULDER: We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out. Now, we knew that Barnett had someone working for the armored car transport tipping him off about large cash shipments but we never figured that he would actually be inside the vehicle when it arrived. That's how Barnett was able to take the driver of the vehicle hostage.

PROSECUTOR: In other words, John Barnett used his own accomplice as a hostage?

MULDER: Yes, ma'am.

(He nods slightly. The judge is taking down notes.)

PROSECUTOR: And then what happened?

MULDER: We surrounded Barnett. We ordered him to surrender his hostage and his weapon.

PROSECUTOR: And where were you at this time, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I was right behind Barnett.

PROSECUTOR: With a clear shot at the suspect?

(Mulder hesitates, then nods and speaks softly.)

MULDER: Yes, ma'am.

PROSECUTOR: But you didn't fire. Why?

MULDER: Well, it's against F.B.I. regulations to unnecessarily endanger the life of a hostage.

(Purdue, in the front row, looks at Barnett at his seat at the defense table. Barnett, wearing handcuffs, seems to take great pleasure in Mulder's testimony.)

And I thought that with no means of escape, Barnett would give up.

PROSECUTOR: But what happened instead?

MULDER: The suspect, uh, John Barnett, fired his weapon point-blank at the hostage and then he turned his gun on Steve Wallenberg... shot him in the face.

(Mulder's resolve starts to break.)

PROSECUTOR: Thank you, Agent Mulder. No further questions at this time.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: He gunned him down just for spite.

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, we object...

JUDGE: Witness will step down.

MULDER: This is a man with a wife and two small children...

(The judge bangs her gavel.)

JUDGE: Please step down...

MULDER: ...and you, you shot him without hesitation, without conscience, without an ounce of humanity.

(The judge continues to bang the gavel.)

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, do something.

MULDER: Which is why you should die like an animal, you son of a bitch!

JUDGE: Agent Mulder, if you do not stop, I will find you in contempt of court.

(Barnett takes a sip of his water and smiles at Mulder. The crowd continues to murmur.)

Order, order in the court.

(Mulder steps down. The crowd continues to murmur and the judge continues to bang the gavel.)

If there is not order in this court, I will be forced to clear the courtroom.

DEFENSE LAWYER: Your honor, the defense finds they are highly irregular and inflammatory against the defendant now and we ask that they be stricken from the record.

(Mulder stops and glares at Barnett before sitting down.)

JUDGE: Duly noted, counsel. The jury will disregard the witness' last...

(Barnett looks at Mulder as he sits down next to Purdue. He whispers the words.)

JOHN BARNETT: I'll... get... you.

(He winks and blows a kiss, then turns around. Purdue mouths some words to Mulder as Barnett turns around. The present. Mulder leans over to the computer specialist.)

MULDER: I'll need printouts of every variation.

COMPUTER SPECIALIST: Right.

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with the prison.

MULDER: What did they come up with?

SCULLY: No, I called them on a hunch. John Barnett died of a heart attack, right? At least that's what it says on his death certificate. Well, I had them fax me all of his medical records. Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary for an infection in his right hand. There isn't any indication or diagnosis of coronary complications. In fact, on his physical six months earlier, he was given a clean bill of health.



SCENE 9
TASHMOO FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY

(An inmate standing next to Crandall points at Mulder and Scully in the doorway.)

INMATE: Crandall. Someone to see you.

(Mulder and Scully walk on either side of Crandall, still in his wheelchair.)

JOE CRANDALL: I don't get many visitors.

MULDER: You knew John Barnett?

JOE CRANDALL: Yes, sir.

MULDER: How well did you know him?

(A guard walks by Scully, squeezing past her.)

GUARD: Excuse me, ma'am.

JOE CRANDALL: Pretty well.

SCULLY: He left you everything he had in his will. You must've known him better than pretty well.

JOE CRANDALL: Used to change his bandages, and we just got to... know each other.

MULDER: Are you aware that Barnett died of cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989?

JOE CRANDALL: Cardiac arrest? Where does it say that?

SCULLY: On his death certificate.

(They stop.)

JOE CRANDALL: He ain't dead, is he?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

JOE CRANDALL: Last time I saw John Barnett, it was right in that room over there.

(He nods towards a door.)

Doctor working on him with a knife took his bad hand clean off.

SCULLY: What doctor?

MULDER: Was it Doctor Ridley?

JOE CRANDALL: Yeah, yeah, it was Doctor Ridley, that's the one. He told me Johnny was dead but, uh, I knew it was a lie. Put a knife right up under my chin just for asking.

SCULLY: How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?

(Crandall takes a deep breath.)

JOE CRANDALL: I saw him looking at me. I saw him blink. Man, I'll never forget those eyes.



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Jail photos are posted on the light screen as Mulder feeds the clip into his gun.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I know what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to hang around and wait for Barnett to send me another valentine.

SCULLY: You mean the ghost of John Barnett.

MULDER: I didn't know you believe in ghosts, Scully.

(The phone rings. Scully walks over and picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello? Yeah, just a minute.

(She looks back at Mulder.)

It's for you.

(He walks over and takes the phone.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Barnett, who is completely shrouded in shadow except for portions of his face.)

JOHN BARNETT: Fox Mulder.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Barnett?

(He signals to Scully.)

SCULLY: All right, all right...

(She runs off to trace the call.)

JOHN BARNETT: You sound surprised.

(He goes over to his tape recorder and presses record.)

MULDER: Well, you know, shouldn't I be?

JOHN BARNETT: You know, it's illegal to tape another's phone call...

(Cut back to Barnett.)

...without their express permission. Isn't that what they call it?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: In some states. What makes you think I'm taping you?

JOHN BARNETT: Same thing makes me think you're putting a trace on this call.

MULDER: What state are you in?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: The same state you are. I stood next to you in line for coffee this morning.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't think so.

(Cut back to Barnett, who laughs.)

JOHN BARNETT: Man, I'm everywhere you are. Everywhere. I own you.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: How do I know it's really you, Barnett?

(Cut to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: What did I say to you in the courtroom? Did you ever... doubt me?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't know, what did you tell me in the courtroom?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: Huh... if you think you're going to keep me on this phone with this clumsy act...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Listen, by all accounts, John Barnett is a dead man.

(Cut to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: Oh, you're the dead man... Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder, who tenses up a little.)

MULDER: Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.

(Cut back to Barnett.)

JOHN BARNETT: You want confirmation? You got it.

(He blows a kiss and hangs up. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Barnett? You there?

(He slams the phone down. Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: You lost him.

MULDER: Yeah, he was hip to the trace.

SCULLY: Was it Barnett?

MULDER: John Barnett was from New Hampshire. He had a slight accent. Listen to this.

(He stops the recorder and rewinds it, then presses stop and play.)

MULDER ON RECORDER: I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.

JOHN BARNETT ON RECORDER: You want confirmation? You got it.

(Mulder stops the recording and snaps his fingers.)

SCULLY: What did he mean by that?

MULDER: I don't know, but that is... John Barnett. I'm sure of it.



SCENE 11
AGENT REGGIE PURDUE'S HOUSE

(Purdue lays asleep in his bed, having fallen asleep reading. His crime book is still in his hand and his glasses are half on his face. The phone rings and he wakes up.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Oh...

(His glasses fall to the floor as he picks up the phone.)

Yeah.

MULDER: Reggie, it's Mulder.

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, what do you want? It's the middle of the night.

(Cut to Mulder, who looks at his watch and smiles.)

MULDER: IT'S ONLY 10:45, old man.

(Cut back to Purdue.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, well... I was sleeping.

MULDER: Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all.

REGGIE PURDUE: Now what?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I got an inmate at the prison who swears he saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.

(Cut to Purdue as he sits up.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Mulder, go home. Get some rest.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: No, listen, Reggie, there's just one thing that doesn't make sense to me.

(Cut to Purdue. A shadow creeps down his hallway in the back.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, what's that?

MULDER: That Agent Henderson said that that note that was left at the jewelry store was written by a right-hander.

(The person steps into the bedroom silently.)

REGGIE PURDUE: Yeah, so?

MULDER: Well, this inmate at the prison swears he saw Barnett's right hand amputated.

(The person, Barnett, steps on Purdue's glasses and wraps his deformed right hand around Purdue's throat, choking him. Purdue gags in pain, dropping his phone as he is lifted off the bed. Cut to Mulder.)

Reggie, you there? Hey, Reggie!

(Cut back to Barnett and Purdue. Purdue is thrown down onto the bed, dead.)

Reggie! Reggie, what's going on? Are you there? What the hell is going on, Reggie?

(Barnett tosses a note down onto Purdue's body. Cut to Mulder.)

Reggie! What happened? Hey, Reggie!

(Cut back to Purdue. Barnett slinks back into the shadows. The phone is still off the hook.)

What's going on? Are you there? What the hell's going on, Reggie?

(Later, Scully walks into to a melee of policemen, agents and crime photographers.)

SCULLY: I hope you guys brought your fine-toothed comb. I want every piece of lint collected and analyzed. If nothing turns up, run it through it again.

(She walks over to Mulder, who is staring at the desk.)

Mulder...

MULDER: His wife died of cancer six years ago. Never liked to talk about it.

(He walks around her.)

As long as I knew him, he was working on a mystery novel. He promised to show it to me once, but he never did. I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it. I'm probably the only guy on the bureau he trusted enough to even ask.

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

MULDER: I'm just thinking how different things would've been if I would've taken that shot at Barnett when I had it.

SCULLY: Mulder... we're still not a hundred percent sure that this is him.

(A siren is heard outside. Mulder points to a note on the desk wrapped in an evidence bag. She picks it up and reads it. The note reads:

"Funerals for Fox's friends
-- then for Fox"

She looks back at him. He seems stoic.)



SCENE 12
CRIME LABS

(Henderson is looking at the new note under the electron-emission microscope.)

HENDERSON: Fresh ink, slightly smeared... I hate to tell you, and I'm not known to be wrong about these things, but this note was most certainly written by a right-handed person.

(She pulls away from the microscope and he looks through.)

You see the pressure points inside the pen grooves? It's a dead giveaway.

MULDER: Would you be able to tell if this note was written by somebody using a prosthetic hand?

(She looks back through.)

HENDERSON: Well, this fellow... and I'm assuming from the cursive figures here that it is a male suspect... he has a fairly nice, fluid style. Judging from the pressure variations in the connectors, this person would need good finger dexterity. You're not going to get that with a prosthesis.

MULDER: So you think it's the same person that wrote the first note.

HENDERSON: Uh-huh.

(Mulder takes the note.)

This the guy you think killed Agent Purdue?

MULDER: Yeah.

(He walks around her.)

HENDERSON: You know what occured to me? You never got any prints off those notes.

(He reaches behind her and takes the other note.)

If this guy was wearing a glove on his pen hand, the note wouldn't be smeared like it is. For what it's worth.



SCENE 13
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is on the phone when Mulder walks in. The phone is still ringing on the other end, though. She hangs up.)

SCULLY: I was just trying to find you. Listen to this. According to the A.M.A., Doctor Ridley, who signed Barnett's death certificate, hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: His membership expired and wasn't renowed after the state of Maryland revoked his medical license for flagrant research malpractice and misuse of a government grant.

(He reaches for the papers she is holding.)

MULDER: Where does it say that?

SCULLY: Right here. In the federal journal for the National Institute of Health.

(She hands him the paper. They start towards the door.)

MULDER: What kind of research?

SCULLY: He was conducting experiments on young children afflicted with a disease called progeria.

(They walk out.)



SCENE 14
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH; BETHESDA, MA

(On the viewscreen is a movie of a young girl who looks very decrepit and old walking around.)

NIH DOCTOR: The patient you see is an eight-year-old girl suffering from the advanced stages of progeria.

(He walks in front of the screen and around to the agents. On the screen, the girl starts talking to a doctor.)

MULDER: She looks about ninety.

NIH DOCTOR: Only about a hundred cases have ever been reported so the disease is rare.

SCULLY: But fatal.

NIH DOCTOR: Some progeria patients make it to early adulthood but others become terminal at age seven or eight.

MULDER: What's the cause of death?

NIH DOCTOR: Clinically, it's cardiac or cerebral vascular disease but actually, these poor kids die of old age.

(The movie flips to that of Doctor Ridley with the young girl.)

MULDER: Is that Doctor Ridley?

NIH DOCTOR: Yes, in 1974. Joe Ridley thought that he could take their accelerated aging and slow it down. Initially, some of his lab work was promising but then... things got out of control. He wanted to begin human trials.

MULDER: Why wasn't he allowed to?

NIH DOCTOR: Because he hadn't met the criteria. It was all too hypothetical, too... dangerous. I mean... I knew Joe Ridley. He didn't care about those kids. He talked about them as if they were laboratory animals. This terrible disease, progeria... he saw it as "a wonderful opportunity." He used those exact words with me once. An opportunity to "unlock all the secrets." When they refused to allow the human trials, he became enraged. Do you know what they called Joe Ridley behind his back?

(On the viewscreen, Ridley is talking to the camera but there is no audio.)

MULDER: What?

NIH DOCTOR: Doktor Mengele.

SCULLY: So, how did Doctor Ridley eventually lose his medical license?

NIH DOCTOR: He went ahead with the human trials secretly on an out-patient basis.

(Mulder walks over to the viewscreen.)

When we learned about it, of course, we terminated his grant and filed charges with the state medical boards.

SCULLY: I'm afraid your colleague, Doctor Ridley, has dropped off the face of the earth.

NIH DOCTOR: Yeah. Although, it's rumored he went to South America to continue his work.

(Mulder and Scully leave and start down the hallway.)

SCULLY: You just don't reverse aging.

MULDER: Ridley's found a way.

SCULLY: Listen to what you're saying.

MULDER: He wanted human research subjects, right? Prisoners. Prisoners like John Barnett.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's science fiction.

MULDER: Well, what would you have said twenty years ago about gene splicing, DNA fingerprinting, cloning, artificial intelligence?

(He pushes the down button for the elevator.)

Maybe we're not looking for a man in his late forty's after all. Maybe John Barnett has found the perfect disguise... youth.

(The elevator door opens and they go inside. Scully pushes a button and the elevator door closes.)



SCENE 15
COMPUTER LAB

(On the computer screen is the original picture of John Barnett. The writing in the upper left hand says "Subject: Barnett, John.")

MULDER: I want to age him backwards now. Let's start with ten years.

(The technician types in some keys and the face becomes healthier, the hair thicker.)

Now, five years more.

(More keys are pressed and the face becomes even younger.)

And add twenty pounds. A healthy twenty pounds.

(Mulder looks at the final result.)



SCENE 16
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is typing on her laptop. We hear her voice over it.)

SCULLY: Ridley's notes from the human trials at N.I.H. indicate he didn't see aging as inevitable but as an opportunistic disease. A disease that could be prevented, reversed even, by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ridley's work yielded any results or that his theories, all hope to the contrary, hold any validity.

(John Barnett's lizard-like hand turns the doorknob to Scully's apartment. Scully hears the door creak, tries to hear any more discernible noises, and goes back to typing.)

According to the leading scientific journals, projections on this kind of genetic engineering are at best speculative and futuristic.

(Scully, worried about the noise, takes off her glasses and stands. She takes her gun off the mantle, takes it out of the holster and loads it. Walking warily, gun pointed out, she begins to check her apartment. In the shadows, Barnett watches her. There is a knock on the door and Scully slowly makes her way to the door. More knocking.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Doctor Joe Ridley.

(Scully, perplexed, unchaines her door and opens it up, pointing her gun at him. He instinctively raises his hands. Barnett, faced with this new challenge, skulks away into the shadows and out. Mulder, Scully, and Ridley are all sitting down in different chairs. Scully is taking notes. Ridley's eyes have the same dead glaze over them that Barnett does.)

MULDER: If you're really Doctor Joseph Ridley, where've you been for the past five years?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I originally continued my research in Mexico but for the last three years, I spent my time in Central America. In Belize, to be exact.

MULDER: What about Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett is the only patient left. The only one who survived the experiments.

MULDER: What about you?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: My appearance is decieving. I have no more than a month to live as I am dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease.

SCULLY: The same disease that kills the kids suffering from progeria?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: That's right.

(He laughs a little.)

An unfortunate side effect of the treatment. By using the genetic components of progeria, I was able to reverse the aging process in much the same way the disease expedited it. At the same time, I and my patients became genetically susceptible to the same ailments a child six or eight would if he had the disease.

MULDER: And what about Barnett?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: John Barnett. If I didn't so personally detest the man, I might call him my one triumph.

MULDER: Barnett's not dying.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Only his eyes, which for some reason do not respond to the gene therapy. Otherwise, John Barnett appears to be thriving.

SCULLY: But how?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: I varied Barnett's treatment. Once I isolated the progeria receptors, I stumbled onto something quite unexpected... these same genes related to the production of myelin.

SCULLY: The material that insulates neurons in the body.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Yes. You see, myelin is not present in the very young and by reversing the effects of aging, I found, with Barnett, I was able to regulate the production of myelin. Myelin being the material that prohibits you or I from, say, regenerating a new hand if we were to have ours cut off.

MULDER: You were able to grow John Barnett a new hand?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Not exactly. Not a human hand, anyway. I could never get the cells to divide or behave properly.

SCULLY: I, I'm afraid to ask. What kind of hand did you grow?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: There had been some successful work done in London. By taking samples of what we call cell morphegins from an amputated salamander arm and applying them to the back of the creature, they were able to grow a new limb on a completely different part of the body. But only on salamanders.

MULDER: Until John Barnett.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: Yeah.

SCULLY: Unbelievable.

JOSEPH RIDLEY: My work has cost me dearly. I'm an outcast in the medical community. I was called Doctor Mengele, Doctor Frankenstein but I didn't care.

SCULLY: Because you knew that if your theories panned out...

JOSEPH RIDLEY: The man who owns the fountain of youth controls the world. When the A.M.A. censured me, certain sponsors came out of the woodwork. One of them is the U.S. government.

MULDER: They financed your research?

JOSEPH RIDLEY: You might be more surprised to learn just how high up the ladder this dirty little secret goes.



SCENE 17
GERTIE'S BAR

(Deep Throat walks in and over to a table in the back, sitting down next to Mulder. He talks relatively quietly compared to the rest of the noise in the bar.)

DEEP THROAT: I know why you've contacted me. Listen and I'll explain. I am not particularly proud of the way in which this matter was handled but, uh, like it or not, John Barnett is a fact of life.

MULDER: I wish Agent Perdue were around to appreciate the irony.

DEEP THROAT: The government knew full well that Barnett was in the country. You, of course, know that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research.

MULDER: Yes, Ridley was...

DEEP THROAT: Well, what Ridley doesn't know is that our government is bargaining with Barnett to buy it from him.

(Mulder looks away and laughs, disgusted.)

MULDER: What does he want?

DEEP THROAT: A lot of money, immunity, safe haven.

MULDER: Will he get it?

(Deep Throat laughs.)

DEEP THROAT: He holds all the cards.

MULDER: You're aware that this... freak of science you're negotiating with is a murderer?

(Deep Throat nods.)

DEEP THROAT: The information he has... could change the course of mankind. Consider the options.

MULDER: I will.

(He gets up and leaves. Deep Throat sighs and takes a sip of his drink.)



SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(It is 7:20 in the morning. The sun is rising. The phone rings. Once nobody picks up, the machine clicks.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi. This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message after the tone.

(It beeps, then two more digits are dialed. Scully steps out of the shower.)

ANSWERING MACHINE: Reading messages.

(Scully looks down at the machine.)

MARGARET SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi, Dana, it's Mom. I just wanted to call and say hi. Um, give me a call, whenever. Okay, bye.

(Another beep and the next message plays. Scully looks shocked.)

KATHY ON MACHINE: Hi, Dana, it's Kathy. Look, I hope you're still going to meet me before my cello recital...



SCENE 19
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is looking at an artist's rendition of the younger Barnett. Scully puts her answering machine down on the desk.)

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: It's my private answering machine. Or at least it used to be.

(He puts down the paper as she on the desk.)

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: When I ran from the shower this morning, I heard someone dialing in my private code and replaying my messages. Last night, before Doctor Ridley, I could have sworn that someone was in my apartment. But when Ridley knocked, I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.

MULDER: Scully...

(She holds up the answering machine.)

SCULLY: This morning, I took this down to prints before I came here. John Barnett's left index oblique is on the underside of this unit.

(The phone rings and Scully puts the machine down as Mulder picks up.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Barnett, who moans. His face is in shadows except for his left eye, which is glazed over blue. Cut back to Mulder, who stands.)

Barnett?

(Barnett groans.)

JOHN BARNETT: Your new friend, Ridley?

(Cut back to Barnett.)

Don't grow to fond of him... huh? He's going to die soon like the rest of your friends.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: The rest of my friends?

(Cut to Barnett, who is smiling.)

JOHN BARNETT: One by one.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: You're not that smart.

(Cut back to Barnett. He chuckles and rubs his chin with a finger from his grotesque hand.)

JOHN BARNETT: Tell me, you're not going to make me prove it to you again, are you? Oh, well, no matter. It'll be your turn soon enough.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, you won't get that chance.

(Cut to Barnett, who finds this hilarious.)

JOHN BARNETT: Oh, no?

(He laughs.)

Who's going to stop me, huh? Man, this is... this is the land of the free!

(His laughing dies down.)

Well, I'm just checking in. Bye. For now.

(Rubbing his chin, he hangs up. Cut to Mulder, who hangs up as well.)

MULDER: What does Barnett know about your phone messages?

SCULLY: Uh, that my mother called for no reason and I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.

MULDER: Where's that?



SCENE 20
JANIE TAYLOR MEMORIAL RECITAL HALL; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is briefing his fellow agents. Scully hands out various pictures of the artist's renditions of Barnett.)

MULDER: Before the performance and during, we're working at a disadvantage because we don't know exactly what Barnett looks like. Study each of these faces. Know them, particularly the eyes.

SCULLY: I'm including a diagram of the theater. You have six front entrances and four more backstage.

(She finishes handing out fliers and stands next to Mulder.)

MULDER: We know that if he shows, he'll be keying on Scully. So wherever she is, she should not leave your sight. We've got two hours before the performance. Know this place inside and out. We don't want any shots fired if we can help it. We want to take Barnett alive, okay?

(The men walk off. Mulder and Scully start off as well.)

How are you feeling?

SCULLY: It's the first time I've ever played the target.

MULDER: Let's make sure it's not the last time.

(An agent walks out onto the stage as instruments are being tuned up. On the stage is Scully's friend Kathy with her cello. A man is tuning a piano. The agent walks down the center stairs and out. The man at the piano watches him go, using his grotesque hand to play with the sounds, his eyes glazed over in blue. Mulder walks into the main room, which is loud with people talking. He makes his way through the crowd and looks around at the incoming people. Scully looks at him. Barnett, wearing gloves, takes his revolver out of a case and stuffs it under his blue sweater in his pants. He walks offstage and down the aisleway calmly as the cello plays behind him. Walking into the main room, he makes his way through the crowd, looking around. He sees Scully and shoves through two people, whipping out his revolver.)

SCULLY: Gun!

(She pushes a man out of the way and is winged. The next shot is dead on in the chest and Scully falls like a ragdoll. Mulder runs over, gun drawn. He pushes a man out of the way.)

MULDER: Down!

(Barnett sneers, lowering his gun as people scream. He runs into the main room as Mulder runs over to Scully, looking down at her.)

Check her out!

(A man checks on Scully. Barnett runs down the aisle and on stage, grabbing Kathy by the neck and standing behind her, holding the gun to her head. Mulder runs in followed by two other agents. She struggles against his grip.)

JOHN BARNETT: Stay back, Mulder!

(She moans and gasps loudly.)

Shut up...

(Mulder turns back to the other agents.)

MULDER: Back off, back off...

(Mulder aims his gun.)

JOHN BARNETT: I'll kill her! Don't even think about it!

MULDER: Just let her go.

JOHN BARNETT: Go ahead and shoot. Go ahead, man. Shoot, Mulder! What are you afraid of, huh? What, it's against regulations... huh? No, man. You need me alive, don't you? Because I'm the only one who knows where the research is! Huh? So I could shoot her! And you just to live with it, don't you, huh?

MULDER: Shut up!

KATHY: Please, no. Please, please, please...

(Mulder lowers his gun.)

JOHN BARNETT: How about it, Mulder?

(Mulder raises it back up with steel resolve.)

KATHY: Please, please, please, please, please...

JOHN BARNETT: Just like old times, huh? Huh?

(Mulder pulls the trigger. Barnett's eyes glaze over differently as his whole body tenses up. Kathy gasps and he slowly falls. She screams and starts crying. Mulder stares at the stage for a second, then looks back at the other two agents.)

MULDER: Call an ambulance!

AGENT: Okay... it's okay, Scully, an ambulance is on the way.

(Scully eyes burst open. She moves slowly, her eyes focusing.)

You all right? Don't try to move...

(She moans and looks down at her chest, pulling open the shirt to reveal damaged kevlar. She lets her head fall back and sighs in relief. Sirens pull into earshot.)



SCENE 21
HOSPITAL

(Mulder looks in through the window as doctors and nurses work on Barnett. A man-in-black is interrogating Barnett as well.)

MAN-IN-BLACK: Where are they? Can you here me?

DOCTOR: One, two, three...

MAN-IN-BLACK: Where'd you hide them?

(Mulder looks back at Scully, who approaches him. The noise in the operating room becomes a low din.)

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.

MULDER: That bullet went through eight layers of kevlar, you're lucky to be alive.

SCULLY: What about him?

MULDER: Well, they flew in three specialists to try to save his life. That guy in the ugly suit there is probably C.I.A. Been trying to talk to him.

SCULLY: Is Barnett conscious?

MULDER: Yeah, but he's not talking.

(They stare at the melee in the emergency room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I know what you did wasn't by the book.

MULDER: Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?

(They stare at each other. Barnett tenses up as nurses hold his hands down.)

DOCTOR: Barnett! Barnett, come on!

(Barnett's salamander hand falls limp as he flatlines.)

MAN: Vitals dropping...

DOCTOR: Barnett... shock him, now!

(Barnett stares at Mulder through the glass, dead.)

SCULLY: They lost him.

MULDER: Bastard will take that research with him to the grave.

SCULLY: Where do you think it is?

(Cut to a busy airport. Mulder talks to Scully over the scene.)

MULDER: Who knows? If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could have stashed it anywhere. Which would have a cruel irony, wouldn't it? Scientific knowledge that could change the course of mankind buried out in a field somewhere or in some safe deposit box. Getting old, just like the rest of us.

SCULLY: If it didn't destroy it, chances are that somehow, someday, somebody will find it.

MULDER: And when they do... maybe he can get his revenge from beyond the grave but somehow, I feel like we haven't heard the last from John Barnett.

(Many people pass the airport locker numbered 935, never suspecting what lies inside.)

[THE END]

                                            E.B.E.



SCENE 1
THE SKIES OF IRAG; 37TH PARALLEL; PRESENT DAY

(An Iraqi fighter pilot is flying when he spots a UFO. He looks down at his radar and sees that the UFO does not show up.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) Base, this is patrol six. Request I.D. on object 25 miles from my position bearing three-four-one.

IRAQI BASE

(The UFO does not show up on Ground Controls radar either.)

IRAQI OFFICER: (Translated from Arabic) Negative on object. Are your bearings correct?

FIGHTER PLANE

(The pilot hears a loud hum and looks around for the plane.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) It was there a second ago.

(There is a bright flash, he screams.)

IRAQI BASE

(The radar now shows the plane and various other blips on the screen.)

IRAQI OFFICER: (Translated from Arabic) Youre under attack! Youre under attack!

FIGHTER PLANE

(The pilot attaches his helmet. We can hear the officer screaming various Arabic words over the intercom. There is another bright flash, and the pilot grunts. The UFO whizzes by as the pilot locks on.)

IRAQI PILOT: (Translated from Arabic) Im locked on!

(He fires a missle and a huge fireball erupts in the sky.)

(Translated from Arabic) I got him!



SCENE 2
HAKKARI, TURKEY; NATO SURVEILLANCE STATION; TURKEY/IRAQ BORDER

(Various military calls can be heard over the radio. There are officers sleeping. The lights grow a dimmer and a loud explosion is heard outside. The two men run over to the window and see the UFO exploding in the forest.)

1ST OFFICER: Oh, man.

(The second officer pulls up a seat at the radio and picks up the headphones.)

2ND OFFICER: This is Southern Crescent to Red Crescent. Weve got a downed plane at camp perimeter.

RADIO: This is Red Crescent, thats a negative, we have nothing in the sky at this time.

(The second officer looks back out the window briefly.)

2ND OFFICER: Well, weve got something down here. Advise Medivac unit to be on stand-by, were going to check it out.

RADIO: Roger.

(The two officers get up and put their hats on. The 1st Officer takes a fire extinguisher. The 2nd takes a first aid-kit.)

RADIO: Medivac One, Medivac One, this is Red Crescent, vector one reports downed aircraft in their area, over.

(Another UFO flies down and hovers over the crash site.)



SCENE 3
12:20 A.M. CENTRAL TIME; ROUTE 100; REAGAN, TENNESSEE

(An unmarked truck drives down the road.)

MAN ON C.B.: Breaker, breaker, this is Big Flight, anybody out there with me, come back to me, over.

WOMAN ON C.B.: I read you loud and clear, this is Betty Blue, come on

(The truck driver turns on the radio.)

RADIO: From Opryland, its the Grand Old Opry on WSM Radio 650. Brought to you by Goodys Headache Powder. When the nights been too long and the partys been too hardy, Goodys Headache Powder will straighten you right out.

(The truck driver looks down at his shotgun in the passenger seat.)

And you have my word on that. Good evening

(The radio grows very statticy and the channels rapidly change. The driver fiddles around with the controls, but to no avail. He turns it off.)

C.B. MALE CALLER #1: I saw it, it was cigar-shaped, red and green lights, fast as hell.

C.B. FEMALE CALLER: I seen three of them flying over Chester County.

C.B. MALE CALLER #2: Right, right, and six troopers were chasing them down 22! Whoa, I see one now! And hes over the watertower!

(The driver looks up at the C.B., then hears sirens. A police car races by his truck.)

C.B. FEMALE CALLER: I see him too! Red and green lights, just like you said!

(The C.B. grows garbled when suddenly everything in the truck shuts off. The truck skids along the road as the driver desperately tries to stop and steer the truck on the road. It finally stops, and the driver looks at the sky, takes his shotgun and flashlight, and gets out of the car. Another loud hum can be heard. He cocks his gun and walks around to the back. Looking up, he sees a UFO. The cargo doors behind him swing opening, revealing various brown boxes. He spins around and shines the flashlight. Some bushes near him start rustling, and he shoots his gun at the bushes three times.)

SCENE 4
ROUTE 100; REAGAN, TENNESSEE

(It is now morning. A person starts two stopwatches, leaving one on the truck. He pulls out a geiger counter and takes his backpack. We see it is Mulder. Scully picks up a shell off the ground and puts in an evidence bag. Mulder turns on the counter and starts walking around. The counter clicks.)

SCULLY: From the truckers description, the shape he fired on could conceivably have been a mountain lion.

MULDER: Conceivably.

SCULLY: The National Weather Service last night reported atmospheric conditions in this area that were possibly conducive to lightning.

MULDER: Possibly.

(The clicking grows stronger. Scully takes a picture of another shell on the ground. The geiger counter goes off the charts at a leaf that was crushed by something.)

SCULLY: It is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning, creating the electrical failure.

MULDER: Its feasible.

(He opens an evidence bag and takes a sample of the leaf. Scully stands up.)

SCULLY: And you know, theres a marsh over there. The lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas.

MULDER: Swamp gas?

SCULLY: Its a natural phenonemon in which phospine and methane rising from decaying organic matter ignite, creating globes of blue flame.

(She crosses over to him.)

MULDER: Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs. How can a dozen witnesses including a squad of police vehicles in three counties become hysterical over swamp gas?

(He gets up and walks back to the car. Scully follows.)

Ive investigated multiple sitings before: Chespeake Bay, the Okoboji Lakes, Area 51 in Nevada. None had this much supporting evidence. Anecdotal data, exhume residue, radiation levels five times the norm.

SCULLY: Mulder, none of that evidence is conclusive.

MULDER: The only question for me is, why was the truck driver singled out?

SCULLY: Isnt it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver became swept up in the hysteria and fired at hallucinations? I mean, after all, the road can play tricks on you.

MULDER: Yeah, it can play tricks on you. But not like this.

(Mulder stops both stopwatches. He places them down on the truck.)

I started these stopwatches at the same time.

(The one on the left, that he had taken with him, reads around 37 seconds. The one on the right, that he had left on the truck, reads about 28.)



SCENE 5
POLICE STATION; LEXINGTON, TENNESSEE

(The truck driver, named Ranheim, is sitting in an interrogation room with Mulder and Scully. The driver has rashes all over his face.)

RANHEIM: I dont know why theyre holding me. This firing a weapon on a county road charge is a lot of house manure. Im a vet and I know how to handle a gun.

MULDER: Mr. Ranheim, Id appreciate it if you could elaborate on the report you filed last night regarding your encounter.

(Ranheim rubs his eye and sighs. Pause.)

RANHEIM: Like a saucer and green and orange lights.

MULDER: Last night, you said it was cigar-shaped and black.

RANHEIM: I didnt ask for this to happen.

(coughs)

All I want to do is deliver my shipment of auto parts and forget

(He coughs wildly. Mulder and Scully watch momentarily, then Scully pours him some water. She pushes it over to him.)

SCULLY: Pardon me for asking, but how long have you had that cough?

(He pushes the water back.)

RANHEIM: Why?

SCULLY: Im just concerned, you said you were a veteran.

RANHEIM: Whats that got to do with this?

SCULLY: The cough, the fever, the rash. Those are all symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.

RANHEIM: I was never in the Gulf War.

MULDER: Ok. So, how long have you not been yourself?

(Pause.)

RANHEIM: Since the thing last night.

(Mulder is about to ask another question when a man in a suit, Police Chief Rivers, walks in with an officer.)

RIVERS: Mr. Ranheim, Im Police Chief Rivers.

(He shakes Ranheims hand.)

Please, forgive the misunderstanding. Your trucks squared away. You may go.

MULDER: Id like to examine the truck.

RIVERS: That wont be necessary.

(Ranheim gets up and leaves. Mulder starts to follow.)

MULDER: This man has had an alleged close encounter. The truck undoubtedly contains important trace evidence.

(Ranheim stops Mulder.)

Sir! If I may

RIVERS: Youve gotten all youre going to get out of this county. We will no longer cooperate in your investigation.

SCULLY: Why?

RIVERS: Just go away.

(He leaves. Scully looks at Mulder and is about to say something.)

MULDER: Not not here.

(They take their things, and Mulder holds the door for Scully as they leave. He closes the door behind him.)



SCENE 6
AIRPORT; TENNESSEE

(A man prints out a rent-a-car slip for the agents and hands it to Scully, who starts filling it out. Behind them, a woman is shaking her pen, which is obviously not working. She is trying to fill out a form as well. Her son is standing next to her and her daughter is sitting on the desk.)

MULDER: Its obvious someone got to the police chief. Ranheim was hiding something.

SCULLY: Ranheim was sick.

MULDER: He only became sick last night.

(A woman walks up to Scully.)

WOMAN: Excuse me, can I use your pen?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

(She hands the pen to the woman.)

What are you suggesting, that Gulf War Syndrome is caused by UFOs?

MULDER: UFOs are frequently witnessed by soldiers during wartime.

(The woman hands the pen back.)

WOMAN: Thanks.

(The two agents start off towards the bus.)

SCULLY: Mulder, the only UFOs people are likely to see are secret military aircraft.

MULDER: What if thats what made the soldiers in Iraq sick? The exhaust or fuel from a classified aircraft or its weapon.

(They board the bus and sit down.)

SCULLY: Well, there is a base in Little Rock. You think thats what the Air Force was flying that night?

MULDER: Theyd deny it, but it could possibly explain how Ranheim developed his symptoms.

SCULLY: Possibly.

(The bus starts moving.)

MULDER: I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington.

SCULLY: Mulder, the military isnt going to talk about classified aircraft.

MULDER: No, these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group. They publish a magazine called The Lone Gunman. Some of their information is first-rate; covert actions, classified weapons. Some of their ideas are downright spooky.



SCENE 7
THE LONE GUNMENS OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and Scully are sitting in front of the window. A man named Langly, long hair, unshaven, Ramones t-shirt on, is walking around. Another man named Byers, clean-cut, moustache and beard, suit and tie, is standing in the corner. The third man, named Frohike, is small and toad-like, takes a picture of Scully.)

LANGLY: So, check it out, Mulder, today I had breakfast with the guy who shot John F. Kennedy.

MULDER: Is that so?

LANGLY: Old dude now, but yeah. Says he was dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.

BYERS: And, Mulder, listen to this. Vladmir Zhirinovsky, the leader of the Russian Social Democrats? Hes being put into power by the most heinous and evil force of the 20th century.

MULDER: Barney?

(Scully smiles, Langly chuckles. Byers seems unamused.)

BYERS: The C.I.A.

SCULLY: Hmm.

LANGLY: Is this your skeptical partner?

(Frohike takes another picture.)

FROHIKE: Shes hot.

BYERS: You dont believe that the C.I.A., threatened by a loss of power and funding because of the collapse of the cold war, wouldnt dream of having the old enemy back?

SCULLY: I think you give the government too much credit.

(The phone rings. Langly walks over and picks up the phone and turns on a tape recorder.)

I mean, the government cant control the defecit or manage crime

LANGLY: (into phone) Lone Gunman.

SCULLY:what makes you think they could plan and execute such an elaborate conspiracy?

FROHIKE: She is hot.

MULDER: Settle down, Frohike.

(Byers walks over to them.)

BYERS: Im not talking about the bunch of idiots up on the hill trying to bone the capital pages. Were talking about a dark network, a government within a government, controlling our every move.

SCULLY: How can they do that?

BYERS: How? Ill show you how. You got a twenty dollar bill?

SCULLY: Hmmm Ill check.

(She digs into her back pocket, looking at Mulder, who smiles back. She pulls out a twenty.)

Um-hmmm.

(She hands it to Byers and he goes over to the table. Mulder waves his hands like I dont know.)

LANGLY: (still on phone) Uh-huh yeah

(Byers holds the bill in front of him and rips off its left side. Scully crosses over to him. Langly can still be heard intellegibly in the background.)

SCULLY: Hey!

(Mulder laughs. Scully looks back at him. Byers pulls out the magnetic anti-counterfeiting strip.)

BYERS: Thats just one method. They use this magnetic strip to track you. Whenever you go through a metal detector at an airport, they know exactly how much youre carrying.

MULDER: Hey, Byers, it is a federal crime to deface money.

(Scully crosses back to Mulder, holding the ripped bill. Langly hangs up.)

SCULLY: This strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.

LANGLY: How come its on the inside? Other countries put that strip on the outside.

BYERS: What are they hiding?

(Mulder waves his hands to get their attention.)

MULDER: O o ok, alright. What do you know about the Gulf War Syndrome?

LANGLY: Agent Orange of the 90s.

BYERS: Artillery shells coated with depleted uranium.

MULDER: Have you heard of any classified planes being flown during the Persian Gulf War?

BYERS: Why would you need to expose a secret plane to an air force that runs to Iran whenever you take to the air?

MULDER: What about UFO activity during that period?

(Langly and even Byers laugh.)

LANGLY: Yeah, UFOs caused the Gulf War Syndrome, thats a good one.

BYERS: Thats why we like you, Mulder, your ideas are weirder than ours.

(Mulder laughs a bit. Scully nods her head slightly in agreement.)



SCENE 8
X-FILES OFFICE; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is looking at the picture she took of the shell on the ground with a magnifying glass and another one of the road. Scully is writing.)

SCULLY: Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met. I dont know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible.

MULDER: I think its remotely plausible that someone might think youre hot.

(Scully looks at Mulder. She shakes her pen and smiles. It still doesnt write, so she pulls out ink and unscrews her pen.)

SCULLY: Did you see the way they answered the telephone? They probably think that every call that they get is monitored and theyre followed wherever they go. Its a form of self-delusion. It makes them think that what theyre doing is important enough that somebody would

(She looks at her pen, which has various forms of circuitry in it.)

MULDER: Whats the matter?

(He looks back and crosses over to Scully, who is holding the pen with her hand on her desk. Mulder kneels down and pulls her hand closer, inspecting the pen. It contains a listening device.)



SCENE 9
MULDERS APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder walks over to his light, unscrews the lightbulb and puts in a blue one. He opens the blinds, turns off all the other lights and sits down. The blue glow can be seen from outside. Hours have seemingly passed, and Mulder is asleep on the couch. The phone rings and Mulder wakes up. He gets up, crosses to his desk and picks up the phone.)

MULDER: Hello?

(A click is heard.)



SCENE 10
LINCOLN MEMORIAL; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is sitting on a park bench, eating an apple. Deep Throat walks up behind him and sits down.)

DEEP THROAT: Pitchers and catchers report for spring training this week.

MULDER: Yeah. What are we doing here?

(Deep Throat chuckles.)

DEEP THROAT: Missed your calling, did you, Mr. Mulder? Ah, maybe this year we can catch a game at Camden Yards. Of course, we wouldnt be able to sit together.

MULDER: Thats too bad. Something tells me you have the connections to get great seats.

DEEP THROAT: Any park in the country.

(A camera clicks. Deep Throat quickly turns away, facing Mulder, to avoid more pictures.)

MULDER: Its just a tourist.

DEEP THROAT: In our line, nothing is just what it seems.

MULDER: What am I onto? We go down to investigate a truck drivers encounter with a UFO and the next thing, were discovering electronic surveillance equipment. Whos listening to us?

(Deep Throat looks at him, then turns away.)

Why wont you tell me?

(Deep Throat sighs, pulls an envelope out of his trenchcoat, hands it to Mulder and walks away.)

What am I onto?

(Deep Throat stops and turns a bit.)

DEEP THROAT: A dangerous path.

(He keeps walking.)



SCENE 11
X-FILES OFFICE; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is reading a paper that reads this at the top:

SUBJECT: Response to Request for Inf --
Contact and Other Related I --
Via: INTERCEPT IRAQI TRANSMISSION
TO: Commanding Officer, Majestic Project,

The folder it is in reads TOP SECRET. We can hear the fight between the Iraqi pilot and the UFO in the background, we then switch to the same shots as before: the flash, the man screaming, the shot and the UFO explosion in the air. Scully walks in. She crosses over, hands some papers to Mulder, and sits down.)

SCULLY: The truck is bogus. And sos the truck driver, Ranheim. First I checked his manifest. It listed a truck carrying 180 cartons of auto parts weighing 3,100 pounds. Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route and they have it listed at 5,100 pounds. Theres something in that truck, Mulder, and its not auto parts. And of course, nobody ever reported him. Furthermore, Ranheim lied about being in the Gulf War. His real name is Frank Druce  and I worked hard to get this one. He was Special Operations Black Beret in Mosul, northern Iraq. Also, he didnt get sick from the encounter the other night. Hes been to the V.A. hospital for treatment three times this past year.

(Mulder shakes his head angrily.)

MULDER: We had it.

(He gets up.)

We had it and we let it go. Four days ago, an Iraqi pilot shot down an unidentified flying object. The wreckage, and possibly the occupants, were recovered by the army. Ranheim, the truck driver, would be the perfect escort for the wreckage and/or bodies out of Iraq and into a laboratory in the United States. That would explain why the truck weighs so much more than listed. The military has, in the past, transported dangerous materials and weapons across the country.

(He laughs. Scully looks perplexed.)

Im beginning to sound like those guys at The Lone Gunman, right?

SCULLY: Where did you obtain this information?

MULDER: Lets just say its a source with a deep background.

(Pause. Mulder sits down next to her.)

SCULLY: I want to know all about him.

MULDER: All I know is that hes guided us away from harm.

SCULLY: How do you know that? We work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and were being bugged. What does that tell you?

MULDER: That tells me that not everything is as it appears to be.

SCULLY: Exactly. And for all we know, this deep background is the one responsible for the bug.

MULDER: Hes never lied to me. I wont break that confidence. I trust him.

SCULLY: Mulder, youre the only one I trust.

MULDER: Then youre gonna have to trust me.

(Pause. Scully leans back in her chair.)

Did you find out where the truck is now?

SCULLY: Generally. Its heading west. Towards Colorado.

MULDER: Ok, weve got to try and intercept it and see whats on board.

(He gets up.)

Im gonna go get a few things, Ill meet you back at your place in an hour, okay?

(He takes his coat, then puts his hand on her shoulder. He walks out and she leans forward onto the desk.)



SCENE 12
MULDERS APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder unlocks his door and walks in. He tries the light switch, but it doesnt work.)

DEEP THROAT: I cut the main breaker.

(Mulder is about to pull his gun when he sees it is Deep Throat sitting in a chair. He sighs, closes the door and crosses over to him.)

MULDER: You risked exposure coming here.

(Deep Throat takes out another envelope.)

DEEP THROAT: What I have here is too important.

(He stands up, crosses over and hands Mulder the envelope.)

The photograph in that envelope was taken by an officer in Fort Benning, Georgia. 17 UFOs were spotted in one hour.

MULDER: Is that where the Iraqi wreckage is being held? Are UFOs monitoring the area?

DEEP THROAT: Nice place you have here.

(He turns and opens the door.)

MULDER: Wait, wait.

(Deep Throat stops in the doorway and looks back at Mulder.)

I, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you. Youve helped my work so much and never asked for anything in return. I know youve put yourself at great risk to do so.

(Deep Throat looks a bit ashamed and leaves, closing the door behind him. Mulder crosses over to the table and picks up the envelope. Opening it, he finds the picture.)



SCENE 13
SCULLYS APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The picture is of a policeman standing by a car with trees in the background. The UFO hovers above the trees next to the moon. The UFO is clearly visible in the windshield. Scully is looking at it with a magnifying glass.)

MULDER: This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen. When I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I knew they were a hoax but this this is the quality of evidence the government has amassed for decades at the highest classified levels. That business with the truck was just a decoy to keep anyone from looking closely away from Fort Benning where they are keeping the remains of the Iraqi UFO. We have to leave for Georgia immediately, Scully

SCULLY: Mulder, this photograph is a fake.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Look.

(He kneels down and she shows him the policeman through the magnifying glass.)

This soldiers shadow is alledgedly created by the lights from the UFO. But it falls in a direction contradictory to the crafts position.

MULDER: There can be an off-camera light source creating that shadow.

SCULLY: Now look closely at the color of the light reflected in the windshield. Now that reflection should be from the red lights in the UFO but it doesnt match the color of the ships light.

MULDER: Theres probably a degree of tint in the windshield or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions.

SCULLY: We should have it analyzed.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Why dont you just admit it, Scully? Youre determined not to believe him.

SCULLY: Well, maybe youre too determined to believe him.

(Mulder collects the pictures and takes his coat.)

MULDER: I am determined to follow a lead that may result in proof of the existence of extraterrestrial biological entities. I need to go.

(He starts off.)

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me.

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Please, will you just hear me?

(She stands. He stops and turns around.)

I have never met anyone so passionate and dedicated to a belief as you. Its so intense that sometimes its blinding. But there are others who are watching you, who know what I know and whereas I can respect and admire your passion, they will use it against you. Mulder, the truth is out there but so are lies.

MULDER: Thank you.

(He turns and leaves.)



SCENE 14
8:30 A.M. EASTERN TIME; F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully opens the door to her office, puts down her coat and briefcase, takes her cup and goes to get coffee. She pours some, then some sugar and then she stirs it. She returns to the room and is shocked to see that the desk lamp is on and her briefcase is now laying down on the desk instead of standing up. She turns to see Mulder walking towards her, photo in hand.)

MULDER: I had the photo analyzed by the bureaus computers. Initially, it appears to be legitimate. The film grain matches, the pattern and density, color levels, shading then I noticed this.

(He sits down and shows her the moon in the picture. He then shows her the reflection.)

Its the moon, half full. I had the reflection in this window enlarged to 25. Theres the moon again, a quarter full. Not to mention the fact that the window couldnt even catch the moons reflection from that angle. You were right, Scully. Its a fake. He tried to decieve us. Now were alone on this. Theres no one we can trust. They went to a lot of trouble to put us on the wrong track. Theres something here that no ones supposed to find.



SCENE 15
AN AQUARIUM; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is standing at the shark tank, watching them swim. Deep Throat comes over.)

DEEP THROAT: Why didnt you leave for Fort Benning?

MULDER: The photograph was a fake.

(No response.)

At least youre not insulting me further by feigning appaled surprise.

DEEP THROAT: On the contrary, I think a compliment is in order. That photo was performed by our very best.

MULDER: I thought you were my ally.

DEEP THROAT: Oh, I am.

MULDER: Yeah, imagine if Eisenhower told the rest of the Allies that D-Day would take place in Belgium.

DEEP THROAT: (angrier) Mr. Mulder, I place my life in great jeopardy every time we speak.

(Mulder looks away, calmer.)

Ive been a participant in some of the most insidious lies and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine. I spent years watching you from my, uh, lofty position to know that you were the one I could trust.

MULDER: Then why did you lie to me?

DEEP THROAT: I needed to divert you. You and Scully are excellent investigators and your motives are just. However, there are still some secrets that should remain secret  some truths that people are just not ready to know.

MULDER: Who are you to decide that for me?

DEEP THROAT: The worlds reaction to such knowledge would be far too dangerous.

MULDER: Dangerous. You mean in a sense of outrage like the reaction to the Kennedy assassinations or M.I.A.s or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments, where will it end? Oh, I guess it wont end as long as men like you decide what is truth. That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi pilot, that was the truth, wasnt it?

DEEP THROAT: Hmmmp. (in agreement.)

MULDER: Whyd you even bother to show it to me?

DEEP THROAT: Well, I knew that you were onto the truck so I knew that down the road I would have to steer you away. That I would have to lie to you. And a lie, Mr. Mulder, is most convincingly hidden between two truths.

(Mulder starts to walk away.)

Mulder.

(Mulder turns back.)

When a shark stops swimming, it will die. Dont stop swimming. Im not responsible for the electronic surveillance but I do know they can still hear you.

(Deep Throat walks away. Mulder watches the sharks swim.)



SCENE 16
MULDERS APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder tears apart his apartment looking for the surveillance. He finally finds the bug by unscrewing the plug fixture in the wall. The doorbell rings.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you home?

(Mulder goes to the door and opens it.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, glad you could drop by.

SCULLY: Mul

(Mulder signals for her to be quiet and leads her into the room.)

MULDER: I been thinking about this whole situation, yknow? And I think youre right. I think we won this one, I think we should just move on.

(He points down at the fixture. Scully kneels down, looks at it and stands up. Mulder rights on some paper We have to find the truck. Scully nods in agreement.)

SCULLY: I think this time youre right, Mulder.



SCENE 17
STREET; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and Scully drive down a busy street and pull over to the side. Another car keeps going and pulls over two cars ahead of them. Scully gets out of the passenger seat, as does a man from the other car. Mulder pulls out and drives down the street. The other car follows him. Scully starts to walk and looks back, seeing the man tail her. She signals for a taxi, gets in, and drives away.)

MAN: Taxi!

(He signals for the next taxi, but the taxi doesnt stop.)



SCENE 18
9:16 A.M. EASTERN TIME; DULLES AIRPORT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is standing on line, buying tickets. The woman hands her a ticket.)

WOMAN: Here you are, Ms. Scully, your round-trip ticket to Chicago.

(She hands Scully her credit card, which Scully puts in her pocketbook along with the ticket.)

And your credit card, and the plane departs at Gate 35.

SCULLY: Id also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles with a stop at Las Vegas, and Ill be paying cash.



SCENE 19
STREET; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is still being tailed by the man in the car. He comes to a red light and looks in his rearview mirror, seing the car two cars behind him. The light turns green and Mulder jams on the accelerator, making a sharp left turn, causing traffic to swerve to avoid him. The other car cannot follow for the moment, but eventually gets through. Mulder heads for the airport.)



SCENE 20
11:30 A.M. PACIFIC TIME; MCCARRAN AIRPORT; LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

(Scully is in the gift shop, looking at the small books. Mulder nonchalantly walks by, and neither acknowledge each other. Mulder heads for the magazine racks, and Scully follows. They both pick up magazines, pretending to read.)

MULDER: Called every weigh station and bureau office west of Colorado. Tied up an airphone for three hours. I dont speak Japanese, but I think some businessman told me to stick a piece of sushi where the sun dont shine.

SCULLY: My ears numb from being on hold for so many hours.

MULDER: At least we can be sure they didnt trace our call. I couldnt find the truck. Did you have any luck?

SCULLY: Yep. Its heading northwest on I-90.



SCENE 21
6:30 P.M. PACIFIC TIME; JUNCTION OF HIGHWAYS 90 & 283; WASHINGTON STATE

(The truck heads down I-90. Mulder and Scully are waiting in their rental car. Scully is looking through binoculars, and Mulder is eating sunflower seeds.)

MULDER: Yknow, think about it. This truck drove across America. People it passed on the road probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture. Yknow, livestock, whatever. Nobody would have suspected it was hauling a craft from another world.

SCULLY: Here we go.

(Scully lowers her binoculars as the truck passes by. Mulder starts the car and they turn onto the highway. Much later, they are still chasing the car. It is now dark outside. Mulder yawns.)

Mulder, weve been following this truck for hours. Maybe he knows were following him, and hes taking an evasive route.

MULDER: Well, if that were the case

(The radio turns on and starts flipping through channels rapidly. Hail starts hitting the car, there is a loud hum, and then a bright light. The car stops suddenly in front of the truck, which is now vacant and turned around. Mulder gets out of the car with his flashlight.)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Come on.

(Scully gets out of the car.)

SCULLY: Ranheim? Ranheim?

(They go to the back of the truck. The doors are open. Climbing in, they start moving boxes. Mulder pushes through until he is faced with a bright red glow. Scully is close behind.)

MULDER: Scully?

(They are looking at what looks to be a life-support unit.)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MULDER: It was an extraterrestrial biological entity alive.

SCULLY: Whered it go?

MULDER: I think we were just witness to a rescue mission.

(They look at the tubing and the platform where the alien was laying. Mulder start another stopwatch on the ground outside the truck then goes into and climbs out of the truck, having used his geiger counter. Scully is holding the flashlight. They start walking to the stopwatch.)

SCULLY: God, Mulder, I cant stop shaking. What we just saw  did it fit the profile?

MULDER: Are you asking me if it was real? Did we just have a close encounter?

(She nods yes. They stop. He bends down and picks up the stopwatch. He pulls out another stopwatch that had been going and stops them both.)

No, it was another hoax.

(He shows them to Scully. They both read 38. They start walking back to the car.)

SCULLY: But how could anyone generate such force?

MULDER: Whatever they used, we probably havent heard of it. Sound weapons, stealth helicopters with an ultra-intensity light. It doesnt matter, theres no evidence that this was a UFO.

SCULLY: So they created this elaborate show just to deflect us again. I mean, wouldnt it have been easier just for them to 

MULDER: Just to kill us? Yeah, I wondered that myself. Maybe theyre using me against myself like you said before. That I want to believe so badly that Id just accept the obvious conclusions and walk away.

(They stop at the car.)

SCULLY: Now we have nothing to go on. No one to turn to.

MULDER: Theres still one person in all this who hasnt lied to us. But its not quite someone we can turn to.



SCENE 22
HOTEL ROOM; WASHINGTON STATE

(Scully is writing at the desk. Mulder is on the phone with various maps in front of him.)

MULDER: (into phone) Leverling and Priest Rapids? East bank of the Columbia River? Did you send a field investigator? And you can substantiate the sighting? Ok, Nick, thanks a lot.

(He hangs up and crosses to Scully with a map.)

Ive contacted several organizations that have hotlines for UFO reports. Center of UFO Studies in Chicago, MUFON, NICAP none of them have ever reported a week of such activity. It began in Tennessee where Ranheim was encountered.

(He traces his finger down the line where the truck went, which is covered with red circles marking UFO sightings.)

SCULLY: The sightings are following the path of the truck.

MULDER: And after last nights hoax look at this.

(He takes out another map and circles another spot.)

Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington. Thats 100 miles away.

SCULLY: Aliens?

MULDER: Looks like they want their colleague back.



SCENE 23
MATTAWA, WASHINGTON STATE

(Mulder and Scully are driving in their car.)

SCULLY: Weve driven full circle through Mattawa twice. Theres nothing here.

(Mulder spots something and stops the car.)

MULDER: Whats over there?

(About 20 people are gathered around a fire in the woods. Loud music is blasting. Mulder and Scully get out of the car and go to the center of the campsite. There is a sign that says Welcome, Space Brothers. Many people are dressed like aliens as well.)

GUY IN ALIEN SUIT: We have been waiting! Welcome to our home! We are willing to go with you!

(Mulder waves to some people. They stop at a man dressed in all red carrying a beer.)

MAN: Ahh-doo-nay-va-so barahghas. Thats an intergalactic space greeting. That means, hello, space brothers.

MULDER: Hello.

SCULLY: Whats going on here?

MAN: A UFO party.

MULDER: Youve seen UFOs?

MAN: The last two nights. Theyre drawn to our electric power. They hover over our power plant down there.

(He points to the power plant.)

GUY IN ALIEN SUIT: Everyone! They are here! Space brothers!

(Mulder and Scully look at the plant. Ranheim is being led through a gate by a cop.)

COP: Alright. Back it up.

(Mulder and Scully are in the car. Mulder is looking through the binoculars.)

MULDER: This is it. Theres Ranheim.

SCULLY: This place has got to have the highest level of security.

MULDER: Just the kind of challenge theyre looking for.

SCULLY: Who?

(Mulder starts dials the phone. At The Lone Gunman Office, Langly picks up.)

LANGLY: Lone Gunman.

MULDER: Its Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.

(Langly pauses.)

LANGLY: Ok, its off.

MULDER: Turn it off!

LANGLY: Its off already.

MULDER: How would you like to have, on your front page, the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity?

LANGLY: No way, an E.B.E.? What do we have to do?

MULDER: Just hack me some identification numbers.



SCENE 24
POWER PLANT; MATTAWA, WASHINGTON STATE

(We see a printer printing up two security passes that read:

SECURITY PASS

Northwest Facility
Mattawa, WA

P.I.N. NAME LEVEL
7593 Braidwood, Tom 5
5311 Stefoff, Val 5

AUTHORIZED FOR SECURITY ACCESS
LEVEL INDICATED ABOVE

MULDER: Braidwood and Stefoff.

(A man tears off a pass and comes out of the booth.)

MAN: Personal identification number?

MULDER: 7-5-9-3.

SCULLY: 5-3-1-1.

MAN: Open the trunk, please.

(Mulder pops the trunk as the man goes to the back of the car. He looks through the trunk and closes it.)

Park in Lot 4.

(He puts a sticker on the windshield.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(The gate opens and Mulder starts the car. As they start to go through, the man comes out of the booth again.)

MAN: Hey, wait!

(Mulder and Scully look at each other. The man comes up the window with two clip-on passes.)

Display these at all times. Proceed.

(Mulder takes them and nods. The two walk through hallways where phones are ringing.)

MULDER: Langly said he couldnt get into Level 6, so thats where we

(They spot a security guard in front of a door which states:

LEVEL 6
CLEARANCE
AA ACCESS
ONLY

They keep walking until they get to a pair of double doors. They stop.)

MULDER: We have to go back, we have to go through that door.

SCULLY: Were gonna look suspicious going back.

MULDER: Well, well have to find another access, then. Come on.

SCULLY: Mulder, theyre not going to let us.

(They turn around to head back but are met by the security guard.)

SECURITY GUARD: You folks come with me, please?

MULDER: Yeah, were lost, were just looking for, were trying to

SECURITY GUARD: Just proceed down the hallway.

MULDER: Yeah, if you could help us

SCULLY: Mulder, stop. Were agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(She reaches for her badge, he reaches for his gun.)

Im reaching for my ID.

(He nods, she shows it.)

Were here conducting an investigation.

SECURITY GUARD: Proceed down the hallway, please.

(Scully sighs and they all walk down the hallway. The guard starts talking into his walkie-talkie.)

This is Level Two to Level Six. I have a male and a female who have identified themselves

(Mulder runs to the Level Six door. The guard pulls out his gun but Scully blocks his line of fire.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no!

SECURITY GUARD: Hey, stop!

(The guard shoves Scully out of his way. Mulder opens the door and dashes down the stairs. Many other guards with assault rifles charge the hall.)

He took the stairs! Go, go, go!

(The guards rush down the stairs, And the guard takes scully away. Mulder passes a sign that says:

NO ENTRY UNLESS:

1. Accompanied By a Staff Member Of High Voltage Research.
Or 2. Written Permission Obtained From Security Level 6

The security guards are close behind.)

SECURITY GUARD #2: Cmon guys!

(Mulder, about to go down a catwalk, tries to jump over a sign that says DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE but misses and hurts his leg. He gets up and limps down the catwalk.)

Stay armed and loaded!

(Mulder enters a room with a humongous, futuristic machine in the middle, with a red glass pane on one of the walls.)

Hold it! I said hold it!

(He limps over, but before he can look inside, the guards surround him.)

Halt!

(The guards cock their guns and Mulder turns around. One grabs him by the wrist and takes Mulders gun. Mulder puts his hands up.)

DEEP THROAT: Let him go.

(Deep Throat walks in, carrying a gun.)

Let him go! Youve done well. Youre dismissed.

(The guards walk out. Deep Throat takes Mulders gun back and gives it to Mulder, who warily takes it.)

I know how badly, how very badly you want to look through that window

(Mulder tries to look, but Deep Throat gets in his way.)

But it would be pointless. Its dead. After the Roswell incident in 1947, even at the brink of the Cold War, there was an ultrasecret conference attended by the United States, the Soviet Union, the Peoples Republic of China, Britain, both Germanies, France and it was agreed that should any extraterrestrial biological entity survive a crash, the country that held that being would be responsible for its extermination. I, uh have the distinction of being one of three men to have exterminated such a creature.

(Mulder looks at him in awe, yet betrayed. Deep Throat walks around.)

I was with the C.I.A. in Vietnam. A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi. The marines shot hit down and brought it to us. Maybe it didnt know what a gun was or perhaps they dont show emotion but that innocent and blank expression as I pulled the trigger has haunted me until I found you. Thats why I come to you, Mr. Mulder, and will continue to come to you to atone for what Ive done. And maybe sometime, through you, the truth will be known.

(Mulder looks through the window. There is an empty cot. Deep Throat looks through as well. The doors to the outside open and Mulder and Deep Throat step outside.)

Youre awfully quiet, Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: Im wondering which lie to believe.

(Deep Throat chuckles and walks off. The security guard shows Scully out, who crosses to Mulder. They watch Deep Throat walk off, shrouded in fog.)

[THE END]
                                        MIRACLE MAN



SCENE 1
KENWOOD, TENNESSEE, 1983

(A fire is raging in a building, and the fire chief is directing operations.)

FIRE CHIEF: Hurry and get him out of there. I need two men on the left side, now. (to an E.M.T. pushing a stretcher) Wait a second. Where are you going with him?

E.M.T.: He's dead.

FIRE CHIEF: Well, there's a woman over there who isn't, and she needs some oxygen.

(The E.M.T. leaves the stretcher. As policemen hold the crowd back, Reverend Samuel Hartley and a young boy, Samuel, make their way to the stretcher.)

FIRE CHIEF: (in background) Get on the horn, let them know we can release the hook and ladder in five minutes.

(Hartley unzips the body bag on the stretcher, and a lifeless, charred arm falls out.)

SAMUEL: I want you to rise. Rise up and heal!

FIRE CHIEF: (approaching them) What the hell are you doing?

REVEREND HARTLEY: The boy's laying on hands.

SAMUEL: Rise up and accept the miracle He has given you.

(Samuel holds the lifeless hand in his.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Amen. Hallelujah.

SAMUEL: I have the Holy Spirit of God within me tonight.

FIRE CHIEF: You don't understand. The man's dead.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Then the boy can't possibly do any harm, now can he?

SAMUEL: For this is the power of belief, the power to separate the light from the darkness. To create life from death.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Amen.

FIRE CHIEF: All right, everyone! Show's over! Let's clear the area! Go on home! Let's start getting that 1-inch back in the truck.

(The crowd begins to disperse and the fire chief walks away. The lifeless hand suddenly moves, reaching up and clasping Samuel's hand.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Hallelujah, Samuel. Hallelujah.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Scully is playing a video tape for Mulder. On it, Reverend Hartley is starting a Miracle Ministry revival in a tent. As the crowd sings and claps, he comes down the aisle to the stage.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, indeedy, oh hallelujah! Hallellujah, praise God! Yes, indeedy, praise God! Yes. I want everybody to say 'Hallelujah'!

CROWD: Hallelujah!

REVEREND HARTLEY: Praise the Lord!

(Scully pauses the tape. There is a woman lying on a table beside Hartley. Behind them sits Samuel.)

SCULLY: The woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine. This boy, here, is going to attempt to heal her by simply laying his hands on her.

MULDER: Where'd you get this?

SCULLY: It came in from the regional office in Tennessee. The preacher's name is ...

MULDER: Reverend Calvin Hartley.

SCULLY: You've heard of him?

MULDER: The boy's his adopted son, Samuel. He claims to have found him as an infant lying in the tall weeds on the banks of the muddy Mississippi.

SCULLY: Did you know that he also claims the boy brought a man back from the dead?

MULDER: It's more than a claim. The man he saved appears as a regular attraction in the Reverend's tent ministry. The boy's been performing miracles every week for the past ten years. Twice on Sundays.

SCULLY: Well, not according to the Kenwood Country sheriff. Local authorities think that Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam. They've been trying to shut him down for some time now, but without any luck, so they've turned to the FBI to try and get a prosecution.

MULDER: For what? Fraud?

SCULLY: No, murder. Watch the tape.

(She starts the tape, and Mulder watches while munching sunflower seeds.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Lucy Kelly has the cancer. Her doctors say it is inoperable. They say it is incurable. But I say to you that what the doctors cannot cure, the Lord can. (crowd cheers and shouts 'amen') Yes, indeedy, praise God! Because God can work miracles. Today the clear light of God's healing love is flowing through Samuel's healing hands.

(Samuel has laid his hands on Lucy Kelly. Scully stops the tape.)

SCULLY: Twenty minutes later Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital. She was pronounced dead on arrival.

MULDER: What was the cause of death?

SCULLY: I don't know, but it wasn't cancer. They've requested someone with a medical background to assist local police in the investigation. I know this isn't an X-File ...

MULDER: When do we leave for Tennessee?



SCENE 3
MIRACLE MINISTRY, KENWOOD TENNESSEE

(The sign on the front of the tent reads "Reverend Calvin Hartley presents his Miracle Ministry featuring healer Samuel Hartley. Come as you are ... leave as you always wanted to be." Mulder and Scully approach the tent, passing a souvenir stand selling shirts and baseball caps. There is a crowd around the stand and around the entrance to the tent.)

MULDER: I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock.

SCULLY: (smiling) Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.

MULDER: I saw the movie.

(They give their tickets to a man at the entrance and he hands them flyers. They enter the tent.)

(Nearby, Sheriff Daniels gets out of his van. He walks around to the passenger's door, and his wife Lillian is sitting in the van.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: You all right by yourself?

LILLIAN DANIELS: I'll be fine.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Good. I won't be long.

(He touches her cheek and she smiles at him. The Sheriff walks away. After he leaves, Lillian sighs and looks downward.)

(Hartley is addressing the crowd, which includes Mulder and Scully.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Most of you here today I know as neighbors and as cherished members of our Miracle Ministry. But some of you have come from far away, as far away as (points to one side of the crowd) Pensacola, Florida, (cheers) and (points toward the other side) Uniondale, Long Island. (more cheers) Wayne Ashton and his family. And it is especially to those of you who come from so far that I must apologize from the bottom of my heart, because unfortunately Samuel cannot be here this afternoon. (groans from the crowd) I know, I know how very deeply disappointed each and every one of you must be feeling right now, but I say unto you, do not be dismayed. Do not despair. Do not lose your hope ... because in two short days, Samuel will be back here at our very special Miracle Mission. (cheers) Yes, indeed, praise God, he will be back here ...

SCULLY: Maybe we should head backstage and see what the Reverend has to say.

MULDER: No, wait, wait, this is the part where they bring out Elvis.

REVEREND HARTLEY: ... on the faithful. Because as these blessed people up here are about to testify, Samuel can heal you. Samuel will heal you, but ... only if you believe. (several in the crowd shout "I believe!")

(Reverend Hartley is exiting from the back of the tent. He is followed by Leonard Vance, who is dressed in black with sunglasses, a black hat and black gloves. A man calls to Hartley as he steps out. Mulder and Scully are waiting for Hartley.)

MAN: Fine sermon, Reverend!

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Man) God bless you!

SCULLY: (flashing her badge) Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.

SCULLY: We just want to talk to Samuel for a couple of minutes, that's all.

REVEREND HARTLEY: He's not here.

MULDER: Well, where is he?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I don't know. I haven't seen him. The boy's been a bit troubled lately.

VANCE: We're running late, Reverend.

REVEREND HARTLEY: If you'll excuse me ...

(Hartley gets into the back of a white Cadillac. Vance stares at Mulder and Scully for a moment, then gets in the back seat as well. The car, which has license plate "B HEALD", then pulls away, passing Sheriff Daniels. Daniels approaches Mulder and Scully.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Sheriff Daniels. We spoke on the phone.

MULDER: Oh, yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

(Daniels shakes hands with both.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Right. (to Scully) You requested a copy of the coroner's report.

SCULLY: Right. Thank you.

(Daniels gives her an envelope. Scully opens it and reads the contents as they all walk along.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I see you folks got a chance to take in the Holy Rollers' Sideshow.

MULDER: Something tells me you're not a member of the Reverend Hartley's flock.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, I remember Hartley when he was a soapbox preacher collecting dollar bills in coffee cans. Since the boy joined the act, he's got himself a Cadillac for every day of the week ... bought for with money that should be used to improve our roads and schools.

MULDER: People want to believe, you know.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Ninety-nine percent of the people in this world are fools ... and the rest of us are in great danger of contagion.

MULDER: Well, even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still a long way from accusing the boy of murder.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I got witnesses that say the boy was there laying hands on those people when they died.

MULDER: You think that's how he killed them? With a touch?

SHERIFF DANIELS: I don't claim to know how or why he did it. But we've been looking for the boy since Tuesday, and he does not want to be found.

SCULLY: Well, there's nothing out of the ordinary about these reports, except that there were no autopsies performed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Hartley managed to block my autopsy requests on religious grounds. Also doesn't help that the country coroner is a dues-paying member of the Miracle Ministry.

SCULLY: Well, maybe we can arrange to have the bodies exhumed.



SCENE 4
CEMETERY

(That night, Mulder, Scully, the Sheriff and a deputy are in the cemetery as a backhoe digs up a grave. Mulder looks behind them and sees a group of people approaching, some carrying candles.)

MULDER: Sheriff.

SHERIFF DANIELS: It's Reverend Hartley's group. Damn. I told my people to keep quiet so this wouldn't happen.

MULDER: Looks like you may have a few believers on the payroll.

(The group approaches. They are led by Vance.)

VANCE: On behalf of the Miracle Ministry, we demand that you stop this sacrilege.

SHERIFF DANIELS: You're not just dealing with me any more, Vance. You're dealing with the FBI.

SCULLY: We don't mean you any disrespect. We're investigating a possible homicide, and federal law requires that we do a post-mortem examination on these bodies.

VANCE: I'm afraid we answer to an even higher authority than the U.S. government - one that considers grave digging and defiling corpses mortal sins.

(Vance is still wearing his all-black outfit. The skin on his face is rough, as if from skin grafts.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: We'll get that autopsy, Vance, sooner or later. You know we will.

VANCE: The deceased's family does not want her grave disturbed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Carol Wallace had no family.

(Daniels has been listening to traffic on his radio. He steps aside to talk to his deputy.)

VANCE: We were her family. We were her family, and it was hard enough to bury her once. So if you insist on going through with this, we are prepared to maintain a vigil and do whatever it takes to stop you.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Mulder? Scully? (they step aside with him) One of my men just spotted the boy's car downtown.

SCULLY: We can't do much here, anyway.

MULDER: Let's go.



SCENE 5
DOWNTOWN

(Their cars arrive downtown.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Not a very likely place to be saving souls.

(They enter a pool hall. A number of chairs are turned over. The proprieter, Zook, is uprighting them.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Where's the boy, Zook?

ZOOK: He's in the can.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What happened here?

ZOOK: That damned fool started a fight. Figures them Bible-thumpers wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.

(Samuel has staggered back to his seat at a table near the bar. His face is bruised. Daniels approaches him. Mulder and Scully follow.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Where you been, Samuel? We've been looking for you.

SAMUEL: (lighting a cigarette) Yeah. I've been thinking.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, you're gonna have plenty of time for that now, son. I'm putting you under arrest.

SAMUEL: For murder?

SHERIFF DANIELS: For suspicion of murder.

SAMUEL: Mind if I finish my beer first?

SHERIFF DANIELS: No, you go right on ahead. I'm gonna have someone take a statement from you. I'll see what I can do about getting your Caddy towed.

(Daniels starts away but Mulder calls after him.)

MULDER: Hey, Sheriff? What evidence do you have to charge the boy with murder?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, what more do you want? The boy's practically giving himself up.

MULDER: Look at him, though. He's drunk.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Then I'll add 'drunk and disorderly.' Let's get this straight. It's not a question about the boy's guilt - just how he did it.

MULDER: Let me have a minute with him?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Suit yourself.

MULDER: Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully - from the FBI. (they sit down with him) Looks like you took quite a beating there.

SAMUEL: Penance, Mr. Mulder.

SCULLY: Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.

SAMUEL: You know what they say - he giveth then he taketh away. A man gets too proud - sometimes it does him good to get the crap kicked out him. Saves God the trouble.

SCULLY: The trouble of what?

SAMUEL: Humbling the guilty sinner.

MULDER: Guilty of murder?

SAMUEL: Yes, sir.

MULDER: How'd you do it, Samuel?

SAMUEL: Apparently, my pride and weakness were an invitation to the Devil. I muddied the river of my own faith. Now my gift has been corrupted.

SCULLY: So you're saying that you killed those people with a touch?

SAMUEL: I've laid my hands on the ill. Given them health. I've healed the sick. I've even touched the dying and given them life. God has given me a special gift.

SCULLY: Did he buy you all that jewelry, too? I think there's something missing in your story, Samuel.

SAMUEL: (sharply) Do you doubt the power of God, ma'am?

SCULLY: No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims.

SAMUEL: I've looked on the infirm and seen their sickness ... their cancer. Just as I can see the pain on this man (points at Mulder) right here.

MULDER: Really? What pain is that?

SAMUEL: The pain you have regarding a brother or a sister. It's an old pain. It's never been healed.

SCULLY: Is this some kind of a trick?

SAMUEL: No trick, ma'am.

SCULLY: (standing up) I think we should get the sheriff ...

MULDER: (remaining seated) I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.

SAMUEL: I can see it, plain as day. It was a sister. You lost her, a sister quite young. Someone took her away.

MULDER: What else do you see?

SAMUEL: Strangers. A bright light.

SCULLY: Sheriff?

SAMUEL: You should have come here earlier. Chance I could have healed your pain.

SHERIFF DANIELS: All right, let's get this over with.

MULDER: Hey, I need another minute with him.

SAMUEL: I can't help you. Not any more. My gift is gone.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Cuff him. (the deputy does) All right, let's go. You have the right to remain silent ...

(As the sheriff and deputy lead Samuel away, Mulder puts his hand to his eyes, affected by Samuel's words.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: You have the right to an attorney ...

SAMUEL: (turning back to Mulder) I'll tell you, Mr. Mulder. God watches over his flock. He gives us signs every day. Open your heart. He might just open your eyes.

(Samuel is led away. Mulder is still shaken.)

SCULLY: How do you think he does it?

MULDER: I don't know.



SCENE 6
KENWOOD COUNTY COURTHOUSE

(A preliminary hearing is being held for Samuel. Mulder and Scully are in the gallery.)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Given his exemplary record, and the highly circumstatial nature of this case, I ask that my client be released on his own recognizance, without bail ...

SAMUEL: (stands up) Judge! That is not a good idea.

REVEREND HARTLEY: (from the gallery) Samuel!

SAMUEL: Let me go and it'll be on your head!

JUDGE: (banging gavel) Enough! This is not a pulpit. This is a court of law. Is that understood?

SAMUEL: Yes, sir. (he sits)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Sorry.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Your honor. Despite the defendant's avowed guilt, we see no reason to burden the county with his maintenance until trial. But we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.

JUDGE: All right. If there are no objections, bail is set at $100,000, to be deposited directly into the clerk's probation account.

(As the judge speaks, locusts start flying around the courtroom. There are scattered screams from the gallery. The judge stands and waves at the locusts flying around him.)

JUDGE: My God! What the ... Good God! What is this? What?

(The bench and tables are covered with locusts.)

DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Oh God!

SAMUEL: (standing and addressing the crowd) How much more will it take for you to believe? The Lord has testified against me. Does the serpent have to bite you all on the ass 'til you understand?

BALIFF: Everybody, clear this courtroom!

(Samuel raises his arms to heaven and clenches his fists as the rest hurry out of the courtroom. Reverend Hartley encounters Sheriff Daniels outside the courtroom and stops, as if to say something to him. From behind, Leonard Vance puts his hand on Hartley's shoulder. Hartley and Vance then leave.)



SCENE 7
MOTEL ROOM

(Mulder and Scully are in his motel room. Mulder reads from the Bible while Scully examines one of the locusts.)

MULDER: "And when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the ...

SCULLY: Why, Mulder?

MULDER: (lying down on the bed) ... land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left."

SCULLY: A few thousand grasshoppers does not constitute a plague. Besides which, we're in farm country. This area is an agricultural smorgasbord for this type of infestation.

MULDER: Yeah, maybe in a cornfield, but this happened in a courtroom.

SCULLY: So what's next? The slaying of the firstborn? (Mulder chuckles) Mulder, does this have something to do with what Samuel said in the bar last night - about your sister?

(Mulder closes the Bible and hands her a file that was lying on the bed. She looks through it.)

MULDER: I had these patient cases sent over from Kenwood County Hospital. These are physician-documented cases of patients who went to Samuel after conventional treatments failed.

SCULLY: "Spontaneous remission of metastatic cancer ... regenerated nerve growth after post-trauma paraplegia ..."

MULDER: I've encountered dozens of psychic healers in the X-Files, but none like this. I think the kid's for real.

SCULLY: Mulder, I admit this is intriguing, but there's a whole library of medical literature dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.

MULDER: Well, western medicine treats the human body in biochemical terms, right?

SCULLY: Um-hmm.

MULDER: But the body can also be treated as an electromagnetic system.

SCULLY: So your theory is that if Samuel can repair this energy field in order to heal, he can also destroy it in order to kill.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: OK, say that Samuel's touch can kill. Why would he want to?

MULDER: Well, you heard him, Scully. He muddied the river of his own faith. That means he's ...

(There's a knock on the door. Mulder answers. It is Leonard Vance.)

VANCE: If you're available, the Reverend would like to see you.



SCENE 8
REVEREND HARTLEY RESIDENCE

(Mulder and Scully visit Hartley in his home. He sits behind a large desk, his back to the window.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: I've been under a great deal of stress lately ... which I know doesn't excuse my rude behavior yesterday, but I hope, somehow, you found it in your hearts to forgive me.

MULDER: Why did you want to speak with us?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I need your help.

MULDER: Samuel's being tried for murder. I think what you need is a good lawyer.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Samuel is innocent.

MULDER: Well, how can you be sure of that?

REVEREND HARTLEY: Because he's my son.

MULDER: Somehow, I don't think that argument will work on a jury. And Samuel's confession won't help much, either.

REVEREND HARTLEY: You have to understand. Samuel is a very complicated young man. He feels things like no one else. To him, a pinprick becomes a gaping wound. His power comes from this ability to feel. But you see, some people fear that power. And out of their weakness and their fear, they seek to destroy it.

SCULLY: You mean Sheriff Daniels?

REVEREND HARTLEY: I mean, it's no secret Sheriff Daniels has been trying to shut me down since I first opened my tent ten years ago.

SCULLY: Well, he seems to think that your ministry is a fraud.

REVEREND HARTLEY: He's a faithless man, Agent Scully. His wife - she suffers from a most painful arthritis, her fingers twisted like bitter roots. Yet he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.

SCULLY: In light of recent events, you can't blame him.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I don't know how those poor people died. I can't explain that. Which is why I'm asking you to be there tonight so you could see for yourselves, Samuel doing God's work. Can I count on you both to be there?

(Mulder looks past Hartley and sees a young girl with long brown hair, wearing a red dress, in the yard.)

SCULLY: I think so. Mulder, what do you think?

MULDER: Excuse me.

(He leaves abruptly, to the surprise of Scully and Hartley. Mulder runs out the front door and looks around but sees no sign of the little girl. There is a man waxing one of the cars in the driveway.)

MULDER: (to Man) Hey, where'd she go?

MAN: Who?

MULDER: A little girl.

MAN: There's no little girl around here.

(Mulder looks upstairs and sees Samuel standing in the window. Scully comes out of the front door.)

SCULLY: Mulder. What is it?

MULDER: It's a girl.

SCULLY: Who? Jessica Hahn?

MULDER: A little girl.

(He looks back at the upstairs window but Samuel is no longer there.)



SCENE 9
MIRACLE MINISTRY TENT

(That evening, guests are entering the Miracle Ministry's tent, passing a table with refreshments. Leonard Vance is greeting them.)

VANCE: Well, brothers and sisters, help yourselves. Now, let folks with the wheelchairs though, now, that's right, don't be shy.

(Margaret Hohman, a young woman in a wheelchair, enters followed by her parents)

VANCE: Hello there, welcome to the Miracle Ministry. Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?

MARGARET'S MOTHER: Yes. Is he going to be here? The papers said ...

VANCE: Oh, and don't mind what you read in the papers. God's work will be done. (hands Margaret a cup) Young Samuel's here to cast out the Devil and heal the sick.

MARGARET'S FATHER: Did you hear that, honey?

MARGARET HOHMAN: Will he be able to see me?

VANCE: Well, I'll tell you what. I'm gonna put in a special word, hmm. What's your name, darling?

MARGARET HOHMAN: Margaret Hohman.

VANCE: Margaret? Well, Margaret, you wait right here. I'm gonna see if I can't get somebody to put you in the front row. How'd that be, huh?

(Margaret's mother hugs her as she takes a sip from the cup.)

(Backstage, Samuel sits at a dressing table. Hartley is behind him.)

SAMUEL: I can't go out there ... not after what's happened.

REVEREND HARTLEY: God tests the faith in us all, son. And because He's chosen you to act in His likeness, He's given you the toughest test of all. (Vance enters) Do not forsake your gifts, Samuel.

SAMUEL: Aw, man ...

(Hartley lifts Samuel by the shoulders and turns him around.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: I'm a preacher, son. That's my gift. But all the preaching in the world could not equal even a small miracle in consolidating the faith and hope of these people. Let this man - (puts a hand on Vance's shoulder) - whose life you saved, give witness tonight to the grace and goodness of your healing power.

VANCE: They're all waiting on you, Samuel.

(In the tent, the choir is singing "Ready, you got to be ready" over and over while the crowd claps and sings along. Mulder and Scully enter and find a seat.)

ANNOUNCER: Reverend Calvin Hartley.

(Hartley enters and waves to applause.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, indeedy, praise God. Hallelujah!

ALL: Hallelujah!

REVEREND HARTLEY: Praise the Lord!

ALL: Praise the Lord!

REVEREND HARTLEY: God is here tonight. Oh, yes!

(An assistant hands Mulder the collection plate.)

ASSISTANT: Pass it down please.

REVEREND HARTLEY: I feel his presence. Oh, amen.

(Mulder hands the plate to Scully, who notes the money in it. She passes it down.)

SCULLY: Apparently miracles don't come cheap.

REVEREND HARTLEY: God is here, and He is here to heal!

(The crowd cheers.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: Yes, heal. Hallelujah. There's a man I'd like to introduce to you - a man who has seen the face of God but who was not satisfied to go to that great place, oh no. No, God had work for him to do right here on earth ... as it is in heaven, mm-hmm. (crowd cheers) I saw this man come back from beyond death's door. (points to Vance) He stands here today as a living testament to the ability of God to work miracles. Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters, our beloved friend, Leonard Vance.

(He hands the microphone to Vance.)

VANCE: As it says in John, chapter 3, "no man can do these miracles unless God be with him." That man, to whom I owe my life, is Samuel Hartley, and he is here tonight to heal you.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Thank you, Leonard. Ladies and gentlemen, God's soldier ... Samuel Hartley.

(As Samuel comes out to cheers and singing, Mulder looks over and sees the little girl at the side of the tent. He rises and walks in that direction.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Samuel walks over to those on the front row.)

SAMUEL: (touching a woman's cheek) Receive God's love. (taking a young man's head in his hands) You have the power of God.

(Mulder is moving through the crowd but no longer sees the little girl. Samuel kneels in front of Margaret's wheelchair.)

SAMUEL: Pray with me.

(He touches her cheek. Margaret's parents, each with a hand on her shoulder, pray as well.)

(Mulder continues to move through the crowd but doesn't see the little girl.)

SAMUEL: Close your eyes.

(He continues to touch her cheek. Margaret gasps, then starts to heave loudly. Shocked, Samuel rises and backs away as Margaret's parents try to help her.)

MARGARET'S FATHER: What have you done, boy?

REVEREND HARTLEY: All right, everyone, remain calm. Let's give the young woman some room here.

(Scully is pushing her way through the crowd toward Margaret.)

SCULLY: I'm a doctor.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Everybody, praise God. Say hallelujah!

(Scully reaches Margaret and kneels in front of her. Margaret is having convulsions.)

SCULLY: Somebody get an ambulance!

REVEREND HARTLEY: All right now, don't panic. Just praise the Lord!

(Sheriff Daniels and Mulder approach the front as well. Margaret falls silent and Scully checks her pulse and then stands.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) She's dead.

(Margaret's mother sobs loudly and hugs her daughter. Hartley hustles Samuel, who is also in tears, off the stage.)



SCENE 10
KENWOOD COUNTY HOSPITAL

(Outside, Vance speaks with a group of mourners carrying candles.)

VANCE: ... a loving friend. Children of God. Brothers and sisters. If you desecrate the body, then you slay the soul. Let's keep this poor woman's body intact.

(Inside, Scully talks to Margaret's father in a hallway, as Mulder leans on the wall nearby.)

SCULLY: We know the Reverend Hartley's been pressuring you, but this is the third death linked with the Miracle Ministry.

MARGARET'S FATHER: Reverend Hartley says an autopsy is against scripture.

SCULLY: What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman?

MARGARET'S FATHER: She had M.S.

SCULLY: And has she ever had a siezure before this?

MARGARET'S FATHER: Not to my knowledge.

SCULLY: You see, I think that the siezure she had is indicative of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.

MARGARET'S FATHER: But the boy only touched her forehead.

SCULLY: And are you going to be content to bury her without knowing the true cause of death? Without knowing if there was foul play involved?

MARGARET'S FATHER: Give me a moment.

(He steps over and kneels beside his wife, who is sitting in a chair and crying. Mulder and Scully move farther down the hall and talk quietly.)

MULDER: Do you think the boy really did it?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: I was raised a Catholic, and I have a certain familiarity with the scripture. And God never lets the Devil steal the show.

MULDER: (smiling) You must have really liked 'The Exorcist'?

SCULLY: (nodding and smiling) One of my favorite movies.

(Mulder leans against the wall again, looking drained.)

SCULLY: So who were you pursuing in the crowd tonight?

MULDER: I thought I saw someone I knew.

SCULLY: That boy really has you going, doesn't he?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

SCULLY: In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister. Is it your sister you keep thinking you're seeing?

MULDER: I've seen her twice now.

SCULLY: Maybe you just want to see her.

MULDER: Oh ... I'm not delusional, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't discount the power of suggestion. A healer's greatest magic lies in the patient's willingness to believe. Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there. We learned that in med school.

MULDER: You think this is what Margaret Hohman and her parents were imagining?

(They start back up the hall. Margaret's father approaches.)

MARGARET'S FATHER: (nodding) We're gonna go along with your investigation.



SCENE 11
MORGUE

(Scully is in full surgical gear, preparing to conduct the autopsy. She sharpens a large knife.)

SCULLY: (Into microphone) 11:21 pm, March 7. Subject's name is Margaret Hohman, female, caucasian, 107 pounds.

(Mulder turns his head as she begins.)

(Time passes. It is now 12:29 am.)

SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.

MULDER: Do I have to?

SCULLY: (with a lung in her hands) Lesions on the lungs here. I'm finding them throughout the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. There's also a lot of damage to the mucous membranes. I think that she must have died from cellular hypoxia - a lack of oxygen to the cells.

MULDER: What would cause that?

SCULLY: My guess? Ingestion or injection of sodium or potassium cyanide, maybe arsenic. I won't know exactly until I run a toxicology screen on her.

MULDER: How soon?

SCULLY: Labs won't be open 'til morning.

MULDER: See who you can push to have it done, as soon as possible. (He leaves)



SCENE 12
KENWOOD COUNTY JAIL

(Samuel is lying on the cot in his cell. Mulder approaches with a deputy.)

MULDER: Samuel? It's Agent Mulder.

SAMUEL: Yeah. What do you want?

MULDER: I want to talk with you. If you'd prefer your attorney were present ...

SAMUEL: Whatever. No.

(The deputy opens the door and Mulder enters.)

MULDER: I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels. He's on his way down here. I'm gonna ask him to release you.

(The jailer closes the door. Samuel gets up.)

SAMUEL: Why are you doing this? You were there, man. You saw for yourself.

MULDER: Did you poison Margaret Hohman?

SAMUEL: Did I poison her?

MULDER: Did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide, because that's what killed her.

SAMUEL: What are you talking about? (he sits on the cot)

MULDER: You're innocent, Samuel - unless you had a hand in administering it, and I don't think you did.

SAMUEL: Whatever the cause, Mr. Mulder, I am responsible. (he lies back on the cot)

MULDER: Well, the evidence will be presented at your arraignment tomorrow. The habeas corpus law will force them to release you, so you might as well go home and get some rest anyway.

SAMUEL: Just leave me alone, OK?

MULDER: Look, Samuel, if you think that the punishment for your sins is the deaths of those people ...

SAMUEL: The Lord has testified against me, Mr. Mulder!

MULDER: I can't stand here and argue with your Biblical rhetoric, but I do know that the law will find you innocent!

(Samuel says nothing but looks down. Mulder kneels in front of him.)

MULDER: You said you could see my pain. Look at me. (Samuel does) What do you see now?

SAMUEL: I see nothing. I am blind.

MULDER: I don't believe you. I've seen her. It was her, wasn't it?

SAMUEL: Your sister?

MULDER: You made her appear to me, didn't you? Look at me.

SAMUEL: (sharply) I am very tired, Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: (loudly) Is she alive? Is that what I'm supposed to believe, or is this a trick?

SAMUEL: You mean ... a trick of the Devil?

MULDER: (sighs in exasperation) Jailer!

(Mulder, annoyed, strides out of the cell block, encountering Sheriff Daniels and another deputy.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I see I'm a little late for this ball.

MULDER: I called you down here to ask you to release the boy.

SHERIFF DANIELS: On what pretense?

MULDER: His innocence.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Aren't you a little out of your depth, Agent Mulder? This may be Hicksville to you, but we do try and hew to the legal system.

MULDER: I don't want to pick a fight. He seems determined to stay here anyway.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What does that tell you?

MULDER: It tells me that you're determined to have him charged, while your real homicide suspect is still at large. (he leaves)

(Later, the deputy, the same one that was standing with Daniels, brings two men into the cell block and opens the door to Samuel's cell.)

DEPUTY: I got some company for you, Sam.

(The men enter and the deputy closes the door and walks away. The men slam Samuel against the door. Down the corridor, a prisoner stares at the deputy as he walks by.)

DEPUTY: (to prisoner) What are you looking at?

(Back in Samuel's cell, the two men punch him repeatedly.)



SCENE 13

(The next morning, Deputy Tyson rings the bell at Sheriff Daniel's house. His wife starts for the door in her motorized wheelchair as the Sheriff comes down the stairs.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: I'll get it. I'll get it.

(They go together to the door. The sheriff opens it.)

DEPUTY TYSON: Ma'am. Sheriff.

LILLIAN DANIELS: Hey, Dennis. How are you?

DEPUTY TYSON: Just fine, ma'am, just fine. (to Sheriff) Except we had an incident down at the jail.

SHERIFF DANIELS: What incident would that be, Tyson?

DEPUTY TYSON: The preacher boy - he's dead.



SCENE 14
KENWOOD COUNTY JAIL

(Outside, Samuel's body is being taken away as a small crowd watches. Scully and Mulder are with the Sheriff.)

SCULLY: He was alone in his cell when Mulder left him this morning. How could this have happened?

SHERIFF DANIELS: The boy started a fight with a couple of rowdies we picked up on a DUI. He took some pretty mean blows to the head. He died before the ambulance got here.

(Hartley and Vance arrive in a car. Daniels starts to walk away.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Sheriff) His blood is spilled! And it's all over you! (points at him)

VANCE: Reverend ...

(The sheriff stops and Hartley approaches him.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: How much longer are you gonna hide behind that badge (pokes at the badge) before the truth is revealed.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I have work to do.

(He walks away. Hartley starts to follow, but Vance grabs him by the arm. Scully approaches them.)

SCULLY: Reverend Hartley. We're sorry for your loss.

REVEREND HARTLEY: (near tears) That boy ... he was blessed. He never hurt a soul.

VANCE: Come on now, Reverend. Our friends will be finding out about Samuel sooner than later, and well, it's probably best if they hear it from you. Come on. (to Scully) Ma'am.

(They leave. Scully steps back to Mulder, who has been standing alone gazing into space.)

SCULLY: You've got that look on your face, Mulder.

MULDER: What look is that?

SCULLY: The kind when you've forgotten your keys and you're trying to figure out how to get back in the house.

(He gives her a tight-lipped grin.)



SCENE 15
COURTROOM

(Later, they are in the empty courtroom. Mulder looks around the judge's bench.)

SCULLY: What exactly are we trying to find?

MULDER: Clues.

SCULLY: Oh.

(Mulder walks over and steps on a dead locust. He picks it up and examines it.)

SCULLY: What does it mean?

(They look up and see a couple more dead locusts in the vent overhead.)

MULDER: Let's find out.

(On the roof, Mulder finds a small morsel near the ventilation intake. He calls Scully over.)

MULDER: Scully. (showing it to her) It's potato. (looking into the intake) Someone left a trail of food in the ventilation system, leading to the courtroom. You dump your locusts in here ... instant plague.

SCULLY: Well, where did they all come from?

MULDER: Biological supply houses usually hatch them on order to farms and universities. It shouldn't be too hard to find out who set this up.

SCULLY: And you think whoever did this is responsible for the murders.

(Mulder nods.)



SCENE 16
HARTLEY RESIDENCE

(That night, a thunderstorm rages outside. Vance tosses and turns in an upstairs bedroom at Hartley's mansion. There is a crash of thunder and Vance sees Samuel standing in front of the bed. There is an aura around Samuel's body. Vance gasps and climbs out of bed.)

VANCE: You're dead. They killed you.

SAMUEL: I was dead. But here I am.

VANCE: No!

SAMUEL: Why did you betray me?

(Vance swings his cane at Samuel but hits nothing. Now Samuel is behind him.)

SAMUEL: You murdered those people. (Vance turns and gasps again) They came to me to be healed, and you murdered them. Why? After I gave you back your life?

VANCE: (holding out his damaged hands) You call this life?

(Later, Hartley answers a knock on the door. It's Sheriff Daniels with Mulder and Scully.)

REVEREND HARTLEY: (to Sheriff) What in tarnation do you want?

SHERIFF DANIELS: We have a warrant for the arrest of Leonard Vance. Where is he?

REVEREND HARTLEY: You must be mistaken.

SCULLY: I'm afraid not, Reverend. We've traced a pesticide order to him from a chemical company in Knoxville. Cyanogen bromide - it's a cyanide derivative.

REVEREND HARTLEY: Leonard poisoned those people?

(As they enter his bedroom, Vance lies on his bed, whimpering.)

SHERIFF DANIELS: Get your clothes on, Vance. You're under arrest.

VANCE: (gasping) I betrayed him.

(Scully sniffs the contents of a glass by his bedside.)

SCULLY: Cyanide - there's no way to tell how much he's ingested.

MULDER: I'll call an ambulance.

SCULLY: It's too late, we have to get him to the hospital ourselves.

VANCE: (breathlessly) I thought, "why didn't he let me die?" Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves. That's what I thought he was, because who else would bring me back ... looking like this. He was here.

MULDER: Who?

VANCE: Samuel.

SHERIFF DANIELS: The man's delirious.

VANCE: He was here, Reverend. Right in this room. And he forgave me.

(Vance gasps again and dies.)



SCENE 17
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Later that night, Scully types on her laptop computer.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him. We have conclusive evidence connecting him both to the courtroom infestation and to the poisoning deaths of three members of the ministry. Vance's obsession outlived Samuel, however. His conscience haunted him until he became delusory and finally took his own life, effectively ending our investigation. In light of this information, it is highly doubtful that there have ever been any miracles in Kenwood, Tennessee.

(Mulder is in his room, packing his things, including a framed photograph of young Samantha. His phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.

(As Scully closes her computer, there's a knock on her door.)

MULDER: (from outside the door) Scully. (she opens it) Sheriff Daniels just called. Samuel's body is missing from the morgue.



SCENE 18
MORGUE

(At the morgue, Mulder pulls out the empty tray where Samuel's body was being kept. He is with Scully, Sheriff Daniels and Deputy Tyson.)

MULDER: Any witnesses?

DEPUTY TYSON: One, so far. The night nurse who made the report - Beatrice Salinger.

MULDER: She saw somebody take the body?

DEPUTY TYSON: Not actually.

MULDER: What do you mean, not actually?

SHERIFF DANIELS: Talk sense, deputy.

DEPUTY TYSON: She didn't exactly see anyone taking the body.

SHERIFF DANIELS: Well, what then?

DEPUTY TYSON: She, uh, she claims she saw Samuel walking out by himself. Sounds crazy, I know, but that's what she told me.

MULDER: (heading out of the morgue) You coming, Sheriff?

(Mulder, Scully and the sheriff are now talking to Beatrice Salinger.)

BEATRICE SALINGER: I was drinking my coffee and going over the night orders for my ward, 7 South, when he walked right by me. His face was all black and blue.

MULDER: And you're sure it was him?

BEATRICE SALINGER: Well, at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks, which happens a lot on graveyard. So I got up to look again, but I lost him around the corner. He just vanished. Then I went to check the morgue, and his body was gone.

SHERIFF DANIELS: I don't believe this. This is insane. I'm not gonna listen to any more of this woman's crazy talk. (he starts to leave)

BEATRICE SALINGER: I'm not the only one who saw him, Sheriff, so I know I'm not crazy. Other people saw him, too. (the sheriff leaves) (to Mulder and Scully) I'm not crazy. It was Samuel.



SCENE 19
SHERIFF DANIELS' RESIDENCE

(Daniels returns home the next morning. He pauses on a wooden bridge over a culvert in his front yard and sits on the railing, thinking.)

(Later, his wife reads the morning paper, which has a large headline that reads "MURDERED FAITH HEALER RISES FROM DEAD / NURSE CLAIMS TO BE WITNESS." The sheriff sits quietly near her.)

LILLIAN DANIELS: This isn't true, Maurice? Is it? The boy was an awful fake, just like you said, wasn't he Maurice? (emotionally) Wasn't he, Maurice?

(He looks at her but doesn't answer. She starts to cry. There's a knock on the door. The sheriff opens to door to the flashing lights of Deputy Tyson's car beacons.)

DEPUTY TYSON: Sir ... gonna have to ask you to come with me. District Attorney wants to ask you some questions concerning the boy's death.



SCENE 20
OUTSIDE MINISTRY TENT

(Later, Scully and Mulder are in front of the ministry's tent as workers carry a large sign by that reads "Miracle Ministry - Samuel Saves." They are also discarding "Samuel Heals" posters.)

SCULLY: Sundays will probably never be the same again in these parts.

MULDER: I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley's not going to be able to give up the pulpit.

SCULLY: Even without his son?

MULDER: It might even strengthen his faith. Remember, the boy did rise from the dead. That kind of thing happens only once or twice every two thousand years or so.

SCULLY: Yeah, and I have a story about a plague of locusts. I just hope Reverend Hartley didn't arrange this body snatching as his miracle of miracles.

MULDER: Somehow, I don't think so.

SCULLY: What exactly do you think?

MULDER: I think people are looking hard for miracles ... so hard that maybe they make themselves see what they want to see.

(He steps to the car and unlocks the door. In the door window, he sees the reflection of the little girl again. He whirls but doesn't see her. As he stares at the area, Scully gets into the passenger's seat.)

SCULLY: You coming, Mulder?

(He gets in and they drive away, passing a trash can with several "Samuel Heals" posters.)

[THE END]

                                              SHAPES



SCENE 1
TWO MEDICINE RANCH,
BROWNING, MONTANA

(It is a dark and stormy night. Inside their home, Jim and Lyle Parker load their shotguns. The sound of an animal roaring can be heard. The Parkers step outside and walk toward their barn. Lyle, the son, enters a stall in the barn to check on a horse. He then steps out of the barn and finds a bull lying dead. He hears a growl nearby and looks around. With his gun raised, he enters the barn again. A hideous face is seen watching him, and then Lyle is attacked from behind by a large animal and falls on the barn floor. Jim Parker hears the roar. The animal, which looks like a man-beast of some sort, swipes at Lyle, then throws him outside the barn and through a fence. Jim Parker fires his shotgun, and the beast is hit in the back and falls. Jim runs to assist Lyle, who is still lying on the ground. He looks over at the beast, but instead sees a dead man lying on his back, blood flowing from his chest.)

SCENE 2

(Mulder and Scully are talking with Jim and Lyle Parker in their ranchhouse. There are numerous mounted animal heads on the walls. The Parker's attorney, David Gates, is also in the room.)

JIM PARKER: I'm not a killer ... and I never meant to hurt no one. But I'm tired of my cattle being butchered a hundred miles from the slaughterhouse. That's the fourth one this month alone.

MULDER: Then who or what do you think was responsible?

JIM PARKER: Look, mister. That cow looked like a piece of paper that had gone through a shredder. I don't know of no animal that could have done that.

MULDER: Then are you saying that a person or persons was responsible for this?

DAVID GATES: I want to remind you that Mr. Parker is free on bond pending trial. He's willfully speaking with you solely in regards to this incident and not about any other pending litigation.

SCULLY: So we can't talk about Mr. Parkers federal court case against the Trego indian reservation?

DAVID GATES: That's exactly what I mean.

JIM PARKER: Now wait just a damned second ...

DAVID GATES: Jim, don't say a word.

JIM PARKER: (angrily) No, this ain't the time for that lawyer crap. I want to get this out in the open. You people think I went and killed me an Indian just because we're having an argument about where my land ends and their land begins.

LYLE PARKER: We want to settle that peacefully, in court.

SCULLY: Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead with a wound from your shotgun to indicate otherwise.

JIM PARKER: All I'm saying, it was no kind of animal that I know of. But it damn well didn't seem human neither, that night. Take a look at my boy's scars. (Mulder walks over to look at Lyle) It was dark, we heard a growl and we went out there to protect the cattle. I could have swore I saw ... red eyes and fangs. I thought my boy Lyle was ... look, nobody - nobody - was more shocked and upset than I was to find out it was that young Indian boy, but if he was the one that was killing our cattle, I'm very, very sorry that we had to find out about it that way, but as far as I'm concerned, that's the end of it.

MULDER: Can we see the corral?

LYLE PARKER: I'll take you out there.

(Lyle takes Scully and Mulder outside, closing a sliding door behind them. They stop to talk on the porch.)

LYLE PARKER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

LYLE PARKER: Agent Scully? I suppose if I were hearing our side of the story, it might not hold up too well. Parts I don't understand myself - things my father could never try to explain to a stranger.

MULDER: What kinds of things?

LYLE PARKER: For the last few months, whenever we'd go outside at night and check on the cattle - never saw anything out of the ordinary. Not a mountain lion, not a coyote, not even any Tregos, Agent Scully. But I could feel it. Something not human ... out there ... watching me. The air was more still, the night animals more quiet. It was like nature herself was terrified. It gave me the creeps.

SCULLY: The creeps?

LYLE PARKER: Yeah, the creeps. (to Scully) Don't you ever get the creeps?

(Mulder is staring at Scully as Lyle walks away. Scully sees Mulder, then self-consciously looks away from him and follows Lyle.)

(Mulder and Scully are inspecting the corral. They are carrying umbrellas, as a light rain is falling.)

SCULLY: The victim was shot there, about three meters from where Parker fired. There's no way he could have mistaken a person for an animal. It's open-and-shut, Mulder. You know, I'm surprised you volunteered for this assignment. Any Bureau agent could have investigated this reservation homicide. Why are you interested?

(Mulder has found an unusual set of tracks in the mud. The tracks look like boot footprints at first, but change to a barefoot animal track.)

(Later, they are preparing to leave the ranch. Scully walks out of the barn to join Mulder.)

SCULLY: Well, there seems to be nothing unexplainable about this case.

MULDER: Nope. Not a thing.

(He holds up a large, thin piece of skinlike material.)

(Scully is examining the skinlike material as they drive away.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this is so odd. It's almost like a snakeskin that's been shed. I suspect that the Parkers knowingly killed Joe Goodensnake, but they hardly seem the type to skin their victim.

MULDER: Besides which, police and coroner's report make no mention of such an act.

SCULLY: Well, we're going to have to take a look at the body ourselves.

MULDER: The body's been transferred to the reservation authorities. We're supposed to get in touch with, uh, um, Sheriff Charlie Tskany.



SCENE 3
TREGO INDIAN RESERVATION, NORTHWEST MONTANA

(They pull into the main area of the reservation, which is an area made muddy by the rains. They enter a small diner and approach the man behind the counter.)

MULDER: Excuse me, uh, we're not from around here. We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.

(The man behind the counter walks away without answering. A young woman playing pool notices Mulder and Scully. Mulder turns from the counter and addresses the diner patrons.)

MULDER: Anyone, uh, know Charlie Tskany?

ISH: Go home, FBI.

(They've been answered by Ish, an old man sitting in the shadows behind a pool table at the back of the diner. They walk toward him.)

MULDER: How'd you know?

ISH: I could smell you a mile away.

MULDER: Well, they told me that even though my deodorant's made for a woman, it's strong enough for a man.

(The old man does not smile.)

ISH: I was at Wounded Knee in 1973. What I learned fighting the FBI is you don't believe in us and we don't believe in you.

MULDER: I want to believe.

ISH: Why you here? What are you looking for?

MULDER: I think you already know what we're looking for.

ISH: You tell me what I know.

SCULLY: We're looking for any individuals who might be able to provide information on the homicide of Joe Goodensnake ...

MULDER: (interrupting her) We're looking for anything that can create human tracks in one step and animal tracks in the next.

ISH: Parker. He found what you're looking for. He killed what you're looking for, FBI.

(The young woman, Gwen Goodensnake, slams a pool cue down on the table.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: What Parker and his kid killed was my brother ... and you're all too afraid of some stupid Indian legend to do anything. I hate it.

ISH: Gwen!

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: And I hate suits who are always here when they need something from us, but when we need help, they're nowhere to be found.

(She walks out of the diner, passing a man wearing a sheriff's badge. Scully walks over to meet him.)

SCULLY: Sheriff Tskany? (she extends her hand but the sheriff does not extend his) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Goodensnake's body is in my office.

(They follow him out of the diner. Outside, they approach the sheriff's office. There are two Trego men standing in front of the door.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: (to the men) Bill, Tom. Let 'em through. Come on, boys, let 'em through.

(They stand aside and let them through into the office.)

MULDER: Who were they?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Guardians of the dead. They escort the deceased's spirits to the new world. I only let them as far as the front door. Anybody that knows me knows that I keep the ancient beliefs out there and the police work in here.

MULDER: The woman in the pool hall said that people were afraid of some Indian legend. What do they believe happened in the Parker case?

SHERIFF TSKANY: (annoyed) Look, I'm not a park ranger here to answer all your questions about Indians. Whenever I need federal help, I never get it. Since this case falls under the jurisdiction of the FBI, you're entitled to examine the body. So let's get it over with.

(They walk into a back room where the body is kept.)

MULDER: Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Gwen. She and Joe are primarily responsible for fueling the boundary dispute with Parker. They felt that he had been grazing his cattle farther and farther onto the reservation. Parker probably told you it was his idea to settle in court. Joe and Gwen filed the suit.

(Mulder has pulled the sheet from the man's body, and he and Scully see four partially-healed scars, as if from an animal, on his upper chest.)

SCULLY: Take a look at that scar tissue.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Looks like he'd been attacked by an animal as well.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Could Joe have been attacked also? Maybe the Parkers did see an animal.

SCULLY: No. Those wounds have been healing for quite some time. The shotgun wound indicates point-blank range. The pellets entered the body in a single mass. The assailant couldn't have been more than three feet away.

(Mulder is examining the dead man's mouth and teeth.)

MULDER: We're gonna need to take a look at Joe Goodensnake's dental records.

(Scully comes closer to look as Mulder holds his mouth open. Two of his upper teeth are sharp, pointed fangs.)



SCENE 4

(Mulder and Scully are looking over dental X-rays.)

MULDER: See, these are the canine cuspids. They're normal.

SCULLY: Well, could his records have been switched or misplaced?

MULDER: No, you see the second incisor here is chipped just like the ones in his mouth. These match Joe Goodensnakes'.

SCULLY: Well, there are cases of calcium phosphate salts developing abnormally with age, but ...

(Mulder shakes his head, mildly annoyed with Scully's attempt at an explanation.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: That could account for what Jim Parker claims to have seen. He was out that night, expecting to see a mountain lion killing his cattle. He gets rattled and the flashlight beam catches Joe, here.

SCULLY: So Parker saw what he wanted to see, an animal.

MULDER: Lyle Parker was attacked, he has scars just like Joe. Do you have a facility where we can perform an autopsy?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Why?

MULDER: Well, if Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might reveal abnormalities in the interior of his anatomy as well.

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't allow that.

(Tskany walks back to the front office and sits at his desk. Scully and Mulder follow him.)

SCULLY: I'm fully qualified.

SHERIFF TSKANY: No. I can't let you do an autopsy. The funeral is tonight.

MULDER: It's a cremation. After that, we'll have nothing.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Tregoes believe that the recent dead are unsettled by their new condition as spirits. Any desecration of the body angers the spirit and keeps it haunting this world.

SCULLY: But you're a law enforcement officer. You can't destroy evidence.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Don't tell me what I can't do. Native Americans believe that their law is greater and more just than that of the U.S. government. If they want Joe at rest rather than used as a piece of evidence, that's the way it's gonna be. If you want to make an issue out of it - your higher authority - go right ahead.

(He walks away from them.)

MULDER: Charlie? Do you believe that the spirit of Joe Goodensnake is in that room?

SHERIFF TSKANY: (turning back to him) All I know is - tomorrow, day after - you're gonna leave. But I have to stay here. I've gotta answer to these people. You can continue your investigation, but you're gonna have to do it without Joe Goodensnake's body.

(Mulder hands him the dental records, and he and Scully leave.)

(It is late afternoon, and the dead man's body is lying on a cremation platform. The two Trego guardians are in front of the platform, while a third, in ceremonial attire, chants and performs a ritualistic dance. Mulder and Scully are sitting in their car a short distance away.)

SCULLY: Mulder, since we've been here, you've acted as if you've expected to find every piece of evidence that we've come across. What aren't you telling me? Why are we here?

MULDER: A true piece of history, Scully. (he reaches behind the seat to get a file) The very first X-file, initiated by J. Edgar Hoover himself in 1946. (he hands it to Scully) During World War II, a series of murders occurred in and around the northwest, seven here in Browning alone. Each victim was basically ripped to shreds and eaten, as if by a wild animal. However, many of the victims were found at home, as if they allowed their killer to enter. In 1946, police cornered what they believed to be such an animal in a cabin in Glacier National Park. They shot it, but when they went in to retrieve the carcass, they found only the body of Richard Watkins.

SCULLY: Sounds like the Parker scenario.

MULDER: The murders stopped that year. Because the cases were unsolved and considered so bizarre, Hoover locked them away, hoping that in time people around here would forget about them.

SCULLY: This file indicates that they started again in 1954.

MULDER: In '59, '64, '78 and now again in '94. But ... (he reaches back for something else from the back seat)

SCULLY: Here it comes.

MULDER: ... these animal-man related murders predate the oldest X-file by 150 years. Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition wrote of Indian men who could change their shape into that of a wolf.

(He is looking at a drawing showing a large, wolf-like creature with a man between his jaws.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what this, what this folder describes is called lycanthropy. (Mulder bites his lip and looks away) It's a type of insanity in which an individual believes that he can turn into a wolf. I mean, no one can physically change into an animal.

(She gets out of the car. Mulder gets out as well and follows her.)

MULDER: How can you just dismiss the evidence - the tracks in the mud, the shredded skin, a man with the teeth of an animal?

SCULLY: Mulder, even if you're right and Joe Goodensnake did somehow have the ability to transform physically into an animal, he's dead. Jim Parker shot him and in a couple of moments, his body will be burned. End of mystery.

MULDER: Let's hope so.

(Scully walks closer to observe the ceremony. Gwen Goodensnake stands near the platform. Mulder remains farther back. He and Ish nod to each other. Scully approaches Gwen.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (to Scully, but not looking at her) You don't belong here.

SCULLY: Gwen ...

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: You're only around to wrap up your investigation.

SCULLY: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about your brother. I feel sad for anyone who loses a part of their family.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: A part? He was my whole family. I'm it now. As a demonstration of sorrow ... I'm supposed to give away all my brother's possessions.

(She hands Scully what appears to be a bracelet with several large animal claws.)

SCULLY: Gwen, I don't know what to say. I'm ...

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: It's no big deal. He had more possessions than he had friends.

(She walks away, and Scully looks at the claws. Sheriff Tskany pulls up in his vehicle and approaches. Mulder steps over toward him.)

MULDER: I read the report of your investigation into the Goodensnake homicide. It was very good, thorough, professional. But what I want to know is off the record. What do you think really happened?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Your explanation, Agent Mulder, is lying on that burial platform. Why don't you just accept that and go home?

MULDER: Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?

SHERIFF TSKANY: This is a funeral.

(It is now dark, and drums are beating as the funeral pyre is lit. A Trego begins a chant and is then joined by other members of the tribe. Lyle Parker rides up on his horse. He removes his hat. Gwen Goodensnake hears his horse and runs back toward him. Tskany, Mulder and Scully follow her.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: Get out of here!

LYLE PARKER: Please, I just want to show my respects.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: I don't want your respects. I want your heart to grow cold. I want you to feel what I'm feeling.

(She spits on the ground.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: I think you better leave, Mr. Parker.

LYLE PARKER: (putting his hat back on) I wish your brother could be here. I wish that more than anything else.

(He rides off, and Gwen angrily walks back to the funeral platform, which burns brightly in the night.)

(Charlie Parker is sitting alone on the porch of his ranchhouse. He lights a cigar and then hears a faint growl. He sets down his drink and quietly walks down from the porch, looking around. The wind causes a set of riding gear to jingle nearby, and Charlie assumes that it was the wind that he heard. As he walks back to the porch, the hideous face appears and Charlie is attacked from behind. He falls onto the porch, then is picked up and shaken by the beast, then thrown across the porch. The beast then slashes at him wildly.)



SCENE 5

(The next day, the authorities are at the ranchhouse investigating Charlie Parker's death. Scully lifts the plastic covering over the body, then approaches Tskany.)

SCULLY: By the way the body's been mutilated, I'd say he's been attacked by a large predator, or someone wanted it to look that way. Do you think this is retaliation for the death of Joe Goodensnake?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I don't know.

SCULLY: Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake? She seemed pretty upset last night.

SHERIFF TSKANY: She's gone. Nobody's seen her since the funeral. I put an APB out on her.

SCULLY: And what about Lyle Parker?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't find him either.

SCULLY: He could be dead as well. I'll take a look around.

(Mulder is searching an area near the ranchhouse. He finds a fist-sized clump of animal fur and another skin nearby.)

(Scully finds some small animal cages next to a gate. From behind her, she hears a loud growl and turns to see a caged mountain lion snarling at her. She gasps in surprise as the mountain lion claws the metal bars of his cage. She then sees Lyle Parker lying in a field a short distance away.)

(Tskany pulls a very large claw from Charlie Parker's body.)

MULDER: That's not from any animal I've ever seen. Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk. An exchange of ideas?

(Scully approaches with Lyle Parker, who is wrapped in a blanket.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital. He's suffering from exposure, and when he's been checked out, I'm gonna question him.

(Scully and Parker get into the car and she drives off.)

MULDER: (to Tskany) What are you hiding?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I thought it was over.

MULDER: Over? Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe Goodensnake's body? You thought it would all end when he was cremated? What were you afraid we'd find?

SHERIFF TSKANY: I can't tell you. But I'll take you to somebody who can.



SCENE 6
GROVE MEDICAL CLINIC, BROWNING, MONTANA

(Lyle Parker is lying in a hospital bed. A nurse exits with a blood sample, leaving Scully to question him.)

LYLE PARKER: I'm ashamed to say it after what happened after the funeral. I picked up some bourbon, and I don't remember a thing after that. Sometimes when I'm down, I go out to where me and my dad keep stray animals that wander in on the ranch. I just watch them, you know, it keeps things in perspective. (Scully sits in a chair beside the bed) Anyway, my mom, when she was alive, was the one that started keeping those animals. I guess I go out there and think about her, too. God, I must have been really wasted to run around there naked. You must have thought I was one of those animals.

SCULLY: When you did go home, did you talk to your father?

LYLE PARKER: No, he'd have been mad I even went to the funeral. I, I have an, uh, image of him sitting on the front porch but ... I don't remember talking to him. Why?

SCULLY: Your father's dead. I'm sorry. (Lyle closes his eyes) It appears as if he's been attacked by an animal, but I suspect it may be homicide. Lyle, I lost my father recently and I know how overwhelming ...

LYLE PARKER: (in a shaky voice) Was it my fault? By going to the funeral, did it anger them into killing my father?

SCULLY: I don't know.

LYLE PARKER: I can deal with death, you know, living on the ranch, being close to nature and all, you see how it all works. Things are born, things die, everything else falls in between. (near tears) But if I caused it, I brought it on, I couldn't, uh, I, I ...

(He can't finish the sentence. Scully touches his arm in sympathy.)

(Mulder and Tskany are in Ish's house.)

ISH: I saw it once with my own eyes. It was a long time ago. It seems like a dream. I was a boy.

(The three sit close together on the floor.)

MULDER: In 1946? The Watkins case?

ISH: I sense you are different, FBI. You're more open to Native American belief than some Native Americans. (looks at Tskany, who looks downward) You even have an Indian name - Fox. You should be "Running Fox", or "Sneaky Fox".

MULDER: (smiling) Just as long as it's not "Spooky Fox". Tell me, Ish ... what did you see?

ISH: Watkins had been attacked by an animal when he was alone in the woods. His scars healed. He was forgotten, then the murders began. The Tregoes, we realized that Watkins had been attacked by what the Algonquins called the manitou ... an evil spirit capable of changing a man into a beast. To be attacked by a manitou causes the victim to become one.

MULDER: The healed scars on Joe Goodensnake's body.

ISH: A manitou overtakes a man by night, not by full moon. But when its blood lust builds to an uncontrollable level, a man changes to a sickening creature. It kills, releasing the savage energy. The man returns to his true self, unaware of what has happened. The cycle begins anew the next day. This continues until death. One night, when I was 16 years old, I was coming back from fishing at the Cut Bank Creek. I knew a shortcut behind Watkins' house. There was a groan, not animal but not human. I looked into his window. He was covered in sweat and blood. He was in a great, great pain. His arm - the skin ripped. It tore up and fell to the floor. Claws sprang from his fingernails. He turned, screaming, and he saw me. His eyes ... his eyes were still human. They begged me to kill him. If I had been hunting and had my gun, I'd have done it without a second thought, but being a boy and scared to death, I ran away.

MULDER: Shortly after, the police killed him.

ISH: But the manitou rose again.

MULDER: Eight years later. But with Watkins dead, how could there have been an attack by manitou?

ISH: Watkins had a son. It could be passed along blood lines.

SHERIFF TSKANY: Gwen. If Joe Goodensnake was this creature, then perhaps it didn't originate in him by the first attack but was handed down through the blood lines. This means Gwen could have it also. Gwen could have killed Parker.

(There is a noise outside the door. The three, all armed, rush outside but don't see anything at first. Mulder waves Ish back. Ish's truck starts, and Gwen appears in the front seat. She backs out toward the road.)

MULDER: Gwen!

(Mulder and Tskany run after her.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: Hey!

(Tskany reaches the truck as it comes to a stop. He reaches in and shuts off the motor.)

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: No! No!

(Tskany pulls her out of the car and onto the ground.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: You're under arrest, Gwen, for stealing Ish's car!

ISH: What happened, Gwen? What are you running away from?

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (breathless) I saw it. I, I saw it kill Parker.

MULDER: Let her up.

GWEN GOODENSNAKE: (crying) I went there after the funeral. I was gonna mess up the kid, and so I waited. But Parker was on the porch, and then this thing, this animal - oh my God. I've never been so scared. I ran and I hid in the woods all day. I wanted to get out ... I wanted to get out of here. I wanted to get out of here. (Tskany puts his arms around her) Oh, oh.

ISH: Bring her inside.

(Mulder and Ish nod to each other as Tskany helps her back to the house.)

(At the hospital, a nurse hands the phone to a doctor.)

DR. JOSEPHS: (to nurse) Thank you. (to phone) Hello, this is Dr. Josephs.

(Mulder is calling from Ish's house.)

MULDER: Yeah, this is Agent Mulder from the FBI. I was told I could reach Agent Scully at this number.

DR. JOSEPHS: Oh, yes, we released Lyle Parker from the hosptial and she's taking him back to the ranch.

MULDER: So I can reach her there?

DR. JOSEPHS: Uh-huh. They just left. (pauses) Agent Mulder, there's something I feel you should know. I received a blood test performed on Lyle Parker, and there's something rather unsettling.

MULDER: What's that?

DR. JOSEPHS: Traces of his father's blood type. It can only be there by ingestion.

(In late twilight, Scully drives Lyle Parker back to the ranch. Lyle appears to be dozing, but opens his eyes ominously.)



SCENE 7

(Under a full moon, Scully and Lyle have arrived at the ranch. They enter and Scully tries the light switch.)

SCULLY: Power's out.

LYLE PARKER: Yep. Happens to us all the time, being out here in the sticks. I'll fire up the generator.

(He walks across the room but doubles over in pain, leaning over a railing. Scully comes to assist him.)

SCULLY: You OK?

LYLE PARKER: (gasping) I feel sick. Please, help me into the bathroom.

(Scully does.)

(Mulder and Tskany are speeding down a road, with the lights flashing on top of the vehicle. Mulder is trying his cell phone.)

MULDER: Damn! It keeps disconnecting. The mountain must be blocking the signal. How much farther?

SHERIFF TSKANY: About 7 miles.

(He speeds up.)

(At the ranch, Lyle is in the bathroom. He takes off his coat and runs the water, while Scully calls to him from outside.)

SCULLY: Lyle? Let me come in. Lyle, I want to take you back to the hospital, OK?

LYLE PARKER: No. I'll be all right.

(Mulder and Tskany are still speeding toward the ranch.)

SCULLY: Lyle? Lyle, answer me. Lyle, are you all right?

(Lyle rips off his shirt and flexes his back. Scully squats to inspect the lock on the door. Inside, Lyle begins to transform, showing large fangs. Scully starts unscrewing the door lock with a screwdriver, while Lyle gasps and rips at the curtains inside. He growls and his skin starts to tear.)

(Mulder and Tskany are just entering the ranch.)

(Scully has gotten one screw out of the door. Suddenly a large, furry arm breaks through the upper part of the door, startling Scully. She drops her flashlight as she falls backward.)

(Mulder and Tskany pull up at the ranchhouse. Mulder enters and tries the light switch. He doesn't see or hear any sign of either Scully or Lyle. He quietly moves through the house and turns on a small flashlight, seeing a large set of scratches on the wall. He picks up Scully's flashlight.)

MULDER: (whispering loudly) Scully?

(Tskany is looking around outside. His flashlight catches the mountain lion, still in its cage.)

(Mulder continues through the house, moving into the kitchen. He hears a roar behind him and turns to see a large, furry creature run into the next room. He fires twice but doesn't hit it. He follows the creature and starts up the stairs. As he nears the landing, there is another roar and Mulder turns, instinctively firing above him at something. It is only a mounted bear head. Mulder gets up and continues to the top of the stairs. A nearby noise startles him.)

MULDER: Augh!

SCULLY: (coming out of the shadows) It's OK, it's me. It's me. I don't know what happened. Something jumped me downstairs and I lost my gun.

MULDER: I heard it come up here. Come on.

SCULLY: (breathless) OK.

(They continue into the next room, Mulder leading the way with a flashlight. They hear a faint growl. They move into the next room. From the corner, a beast springs out to attack. Mulder wheels to fire, but before he can, a rifle blast is heard. Tskany has shot the beast.)

SHERIFF TSKANY: You all right?

(Mulder shines the flashlight at the beast.)

SCULLY: Oh my God! (Lyle lies dead in the corner) He was in the bathroom, sick, and then the next thing I knew we were attacked by the mountain lion.

MULDER: It wasn't a mountain lion, Scully.

SHERIFF TSKANY: It's still in a cage out back.

(The next day, Mulder, Scully and Tskany come out of the sheriff's office.)

MULDER: Where's Gwen? She said she'd come see us before we left.

SHERIFF TSKANY: She left last night. Gave away all her possessions to her friends.

MULDER: Just pulled up and left? Why would she do that?

SHERIFF TSKANY: Brother's gone, no family. Trouble with Parker is all over. Maybe she saw something that she wasn't ready to understand.

SCULLY: Maybe.

MULDER: (shaking Tskany's hand) Thank you.

(He walks off. Scully shakes Tskany's hand as well, then follows Mulder. Mulder opens the car door.)

ISH: (standing on a porch) FBI! See you in about ... eight years.

MULDER: I hope not.

(They smile and nod at each other.)

(Mulder and Scully drive off through the fog-shrouded mountains.)

[THE END]

                                          DARKNESS FALLS


SCENE 1
OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST; NORTHWEST WASHINGTON STATE; PRESENT DAY

(In the forest, a large group of loggers are congregated loosely around two people in the center, who are arguing.)

DYER: Youre supposed to be in charge here, Perkins.

PERKINS: I am in charge.

DYER: Well, these men want some answers. They want to know what youre plan is.
Lets face it, this thing could kill us all.

PERKINS: We shouldve been gone two days ago. Nobody would listen to me.

DYER: Nobody knew what it was two days ago, Perkins. Nobody knows now.

PERKINS: Somebody has to go for help.

DYER: What about the rest of us? What are we supposed to do? Just wait here until help arrives?

PERKINS: We have to take a chance, one of us has to hike out!

DYER: That person might not make it in time. He might not make it down to the road before nightfall! Then what? I say we make a run for it, split up, take our chances!

(The men murmur and yell in agreement.)

PERKINS: Its suicide, Dyer.

(Dyer walks right up to him.)

DYER: Fine. You stay here. Tell us how it turns out.

(He pushes past him. The men start to run. Perkins runs with them. Indiscernible yells can be heard.)

MAN: Hurry up!

(Perkins runs after Dyer.)

ANOTHER MAN: Youre going the wrong way!

(It is sundown, and now nightfall. Animals screech and howl. Dyer trips over a log and grunts. Perkins jumps over the log and kneels down beside him. Dyer checks his ankle.)

DYER: I think its broken.

PERKINS: Come on, you got to get up.

DYER: I dont think I can make it.

(Perkins lifts Dyer to his feet. He tries to help Dyer, but Dyer grunts and moans in pain.)

PERKINS: We gotta keep moving.

(Dyer falls to his knees.)

DYER: Were not going to make it. Were not going...

(A humming starts within the forest. Perkins and Dyer look around frantically. The humming grows louder and louder. They look up to see a giant swarm of green bugs coming down towards them. Dyer screams. Perkins can do nothing but look on in horror.)

SCENE 2
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(A slide is up of the loggers. Scully is sitting at a desk. Mulder sits down in front of the slide.)

MULDER: Take a good look, Scully.

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

MULDER: Thirty loggers working a clear-cutting contract in Washington State.
Rugged, manly men in the full bloom of their manhood.

SCULLY: Right, but what am I looking for?

MULDER: Anything strange, unexplainable, unlikely... boyfriend?

SCULLY: I dont know, I... I give up, Mulder.

MULDER: You give up? Funny, thats apparently what the Federal Forest Service has done as well.

SCULLY: Why, what happened to them?

(Mulder changes the slide to a blank screen.)

MULDER: In a word, they vanished. Or so it would appear.

(He changes the slide to two men.)

This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague. They call themselves "monkey wrenchers." The guys who drive spikes into trees, sabotage logging equipment and otherwise make life miserable for lumberjacks and lumbermills.

(Scully stands and walks towards him.)

SCULLY: Ecoterrorists or militant environmentalists.

MULDER: Right. Two weeks ago, the group of loggers I just showed you radioed a message that Spinney and Teague had gone on a spree. Spiking trees, sabotaging equipment, causing general mischief. One week later, all radio communication was cut off.

SCULLY: Do they know why?

MULDER: No. The lumber company that employs the men has asked the Federal Forest Service to look into the matter. Two officials were sent in a week ago and no one has heard from them since.

SCULLY: It appears as if these monkey wrenchers are doing more than just a little mischief-making.

MULDER: Thats what the lumber company and the Federal Forest Service are accusing.
Theyve asked the F.B.I. to investigate. I had to pull a few strings to make sure we got the case.

(He walks over to his desk.)

SCULLY: For an ecoterrorism case? Do I dare ask why?

(He changes the slide to an old picture of some lumberjacks dressed in 1930s clothes.)

MULDER: In 1934, long before anyone even knew what an ecoterrorist was, a W.P.A. crew vanished from that same area without a trace. Not one of those men was ever found or heard from again.

SCULLY: And you suspect what? Bigfoot?

MULDER: Not likely. Thats a lot of flannel to be choking down even for Bigfoot.

(Scully smiles.)

Come on, Scully, itll be a nice trip to the forest.

(Scully looks back at the picture.)



SCENE 3
RANGER STATION; OLYMPIC NATIONAL FOREST; NORTHWEST WASHINGTON STATE

(A truck carrying lumber drives by as Mulder and Scully pull into the parking spaces. Ranger Moore is looking at a map on the hood of his truck. He looks up at them as they walk over.)

MULDER: Hi. Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully, were with the F.B.I.

MOORE: Larry Moore, Federal Forest Service.

(He shakes both their hands.)

You can put your gear in the back of the truck.

(Mulder takes Scullys bag and puts it and his bag into the back.)

SCULLY: Must be pretty rugged where were going, huh?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: Whats that in your windshield there? Is that a bullet hole?

MOORE: .22 caliber.

MULDER: Somebody took a shot at you?

MOORE: So it would appear. Theres not much to hunt around here with that type of ammo except Freddies.

SCULLY: "Freddies?"

MOORE: Employees of the Federal Forest Service. Its, uh, its what the ecoterrorists call us.

MULDER: Is that who you think took a shot at you?

MOORE: Let me get this out of the way. I have no quarrel with these ecoterrorists in principle. And Im as concerned for this forest and the environment as anybody. Its their methods I cant condone.

SCULLY: Do you think theyd go so far as to kill a man?

MOORE: Well, theres thirty men up there unaccounted for, each with survival experience. Something happened to them.

(He takes his papers off of the hood and walks around them. A man walks over to them with a bag and some other things.)

HUMPHREYS: Sorry Im late. I was down talking to Bob Perkins wife. Hes one of our missing loggers. Hey, Larry.

MOORE: Hey.

(He hands Moore a yellow box.)

HUMPHREYS: Steve Humphreys, head of security for Schiff-Immergut Lumber.

(He shakes both their hands.)

MULDER: Mulder, Scully.

HUMPHREYS: Well, weve got a four hour drive ahead of us. Plenty of time to get to know each other.

(Moore gets in the drivers seat, Humphreys gets into the passengers side.)

SCULLY: Get the impression that weve walked into the middle of a war thats already started?

(Mulder smiles as Scully heads towards the back. Later, down the road, theyre driving.
Its drizzling and the windshield wipers are on.)

Why do these men work so far up in the wilderness?

HUMPHREYS: Thats where the trees are.

SCULLY: Youre kidding, right?

HUMPHREYS: No, environmentalists have pretty much made sure that all the land you see here is untouchable. Were forced to take our timber where we can get it. Even then, we plant saplings for every tree we take.

MULDER: So why do the ecoterrorists target you?

HUMPHREYS: See, these tree-huggers comes from the same kind of boys that went up to Canada during the Vietnam war. Theyre cowardly and so are their tactics.

(The car starts shaking wildly.)

MOORE: Damn it.

(They get out and we see that there is a spike in the tire.)

Homemade tire spike. Clear through the sidewall. Its unfixable.

MULDER: You got a spare, dont you?

HUMPHREYS: Right tires history too.

(Humphreys holds up a weird-shaped piece of metal almost completely made up of jagged edges.)

Monkey wrenchers call it a caltrop. The roads back here are littered with them. Indiscriminate terrorism. Can you imagine somebody putting these down or spiking the roads of Washington, D.C.? Id like to see how much sympathy they get then.

SCULLY: So how are we going to get up to the camp?

(Moore walks past them and puts his bag over his shoulder.)

MOORE: Were going to have to hike.

(They watch him walk. The mountains are practically steaming as the rain releases the heat on the ground. The four get to the campsite, which is abandoned. There is scattered machinery and cars.)

Anybody here?

(Mulder and Scully walk into the cabin and see that there is still dinner sitting on the table, food intact.)

MULDER: Someone forgot to clean their plate.

SCULLY: Looks like they left in a hurry too.

(Scully walks into the bathroom. Mulder rubs his finger across the top of the refrigerator door and picks up some sticky film on his finger. He picks a plastic bag up, opens it, smells it, and closes it. Humphreys walks in.)

HUMPHREYS: Find anything?

(Mulder holds up the bag.)

MULDER: Party favors.

(Scully walks out of the bathroom.)

HUMPHREYS: All the vehicles have all been monkey wrenched, power generators busted.

SCULLY: Somebody really turned this place upside-down.

HUMPHREYS: Whoever did it didnt want the fact broadcast, either.

(The radio on the desk next to him is smashed in. He picks up a piece and throws it back down. Outside, Moore opens up the radiator and pulls out some rice. Mulder, Scully and Humphreys walk over to the side of him.)

MOORE: Radiators are all full of rice. Looks like sugar or sand in the crankcases. They really did a number here.

(Humphreys looks at his watch.)

HUMPHREYS: Suns going down in an hour and a half.

MOORE: Better take a look around before it gets dark.

(He picks up his bag and walks off.)

HUMPHREYS: Ill see if I can get that generator working.

(He walks off too.)

SCULLY: Well, you were right about one thing.

MULDER: Whats that?

SCULLY: It definitely wasnt Bigfoot.

(Scully, Mulder and Moore walk through a wasteland full of broken branches and giant tree stumps. They soon come back to actual forest. Mulder spots a cocoon-ish sort of web tied to a long branch horizontally.)

MULDER: Look at that.

SCULLY: What is it?

MOORE: Looks like a hive. Maybe a cocoon of some kind.

MULDER: Made by what?

MOORE: I dont know, Ive never seen anything like it.

(Moore and Mulder hoist Scully up on a pulley swing to the cocoon. She grabs the branch.)

SCULLY: Got it.

MOORE: Can you cut it down?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

(She takes out a swiss army knife and is about to cut through the webbing when something catches her eye. Rotting fingers protruding through a part of the web.)

MULDER: You alright, Scully?

(Soon after, Moore cuts open the cocoon. He and Scully pull it apart to reveal a half-rotted human.)

SCULLY: Oh God...

(She reaches in and feels the bodys neck and face.)

It feels, uh... it feels dessicated and hard and dry, almost... preserved.

MOORE: Like its been enbalmed.

SCULLY: No, more like all the fluids have been bled from this body. Almost like its been cured.

(She feels the body some more.)

I think... its a male.

MULDER: Barely.

MOORE: Id say its, uh, some kind of spiders nest or insect cocoon.

SCULLY: What kind of an insect could have gotten a man all the way up into that tree?

(Mulder stands and looks up.)

MULDER: Itsy-bitsy spider.

(Back at camp, Humphreys tries to fix the generator when he hears the door creaking. He picks up his shotgun and moves around to the front, looking around. He hears a clanking inside the house. Somebody is eating and drinking the leftover food. He puts a cup to his mouth when Humphreys comes in.)

HUMPHREYS: Dont move. Who are you?

(The man puts the cup down and turns around.)

Doug Spinney. I oughta shoot you where you stand.

SPINNEY: Might as well shoot yourself too.

HUMPHREYS: Youre in a hell of a spot to be testing me. What happened to my men?

(Spinney walks over to the cupboard. Humphreys walks the same way, still aiming his gun at him.)

SPINNEY: What men?

HUMPHREYS: The men who were working this camp.

SPINNEY: I dont know what happened to them. Probably the same thing thatll happen to us when the sun goes down.

(Spinney looks out the window. Mulder, Scully and Moore come in.)

MULDER: What are you doing?

HUMPHREYS: This animal is Doug Spinney. Hes the man responsible for all the monkey wrenching. Hes probably a murderer as well.

SPINNEY: Im no murderer.

HUMPHREYS: Youre a liar.

MULDER: Lets just hear what he has to say.

(Mulder puts his hand on Humphreys shotgun. Humpreys lowers it.)

SPINNEY: If we stand around here talking, therell be nothing left to say. Id start thinking about how to get that generator started. Darkness is our enemy.

(Spinney walks past them to the door, where Scully and Moore are standing.)

HUMPHREYS: Whats he talking about?

SPINNEY: Someone want to give me a hand?

(He and Moore walk out.)

HUMPHREYS: Now hes giving orders? Im the one who fixed the damn thing!

MULDER: Hey, its alright.

(Spinney, followed by the other four, walks to the generator, unscrewing the cap off of a gas tank.)

Why did you say that darkness was our enemy?

SPINNEY: Thats when they come.

(He pours some petroleum in.)

SCULLY: When who comes?

SPINNEY: I dont know what it is. They come from the sky, take a man right off his feet and devour him alive. I saw it happen.

MULDER: Happen to who?

(Moore screws the cap back on as Spinney starts the generator. It works.)

SPINNEY: I need to eat. I havent eaten in three days.

(He walks past them back into the cabin.)

HUMPHREYS: What kind of a B.S. story is that, huh? You believe that?

SCULLY: We found something in the forest.

HUMPHREYS: What?

MOORE: A man caught in some kind of insect cocoon.

(In the cabin, Spinney starts to devour a bowl of stew. Mulder sits across from him. Scully is sitting next to them. Moore stands behind them and Humphreys sits off to the side.)

MULDER: What happened here?

SPINNEY: We camped two valleys over, four of us. Three now.

HUMPHREYS: More rats for the wood pile.

SPINNEY: Our truck has a dead battery so we drew straws to see who would make the hike over here to steal one from the loggers.

(Moore pours Mulder and Scully some tea.)

MULDER: Why not just hike out?

SPINNEY: More than a days hike. No way wed want to be caught out in the forest after dark.
Not after what happened to Teague.

SCULLY: Thats the man you said that was devoured alive?

SPINNEY: Yeah.

MULDER: What are you guys doing out here?

SPINNEY: Camping.

HUMPHREYS: Yeah, right. The kind of camping you do is a federal offense.

(Moore sits down.)

MULDER: Just, just hold off a second, okay?

MOORE: No, hes right. This man is an admitted felon. He could be placed under arrest.

SPINNEY: (to Humphreys) What about your offense, my friend, huh? What about the offense against nature you perpetrate?

HUMPHREYS: We operate completely within the law. We pay for the right to take those trees.

SPINNEY: Oh, yeah? Well, I got news for you. Your logging crew has taken trees that nobody has the right to, trees that are marked and protected so dont talk to me about breaking the law! Sir.

MOORE: Theyve been taking marked trees?

SPINNEY: Yes sir, marked in orange.

MOORE: Old growth trees? You know anything about that, Steve?

HUMPHREYS: No.

(He gets up and takes his coat.)

You going to take this mans word over mine?

(No answer. He puts his coat on.)

SPINNEY: You dont want to go out in the night. Take my word on that. Its out there.

HUMPHREYS: What? If I go out that door, somethings going to attack me, eat me alive and spin me in its web?

SPINNEY: Yes.

HUMPHREYS: What, its too polite to come in here and get me?

SPINNEY: For some reason, its, uh, afraid of the light.

HUMPHREYS: Its afraid of the light.

MOORE: There may be something to what hes saying, Steve.

HUMPHREYS: You know what I think? I think this man is a liar and a murderer and just clever enough to make up a story like that. Even whip up that cocoon just to save a few trees and Im going to prove Im right.

(He walks out, shotgun in hand.)

This is ridiculous. Where is it, Spinney?

(Mulder and Scully walk outside a little. Spinney and Moore stand in the doorway.)

I thought it was going to come and, uh, devour me!

(The bug zapper starts going off fairly rapidly.)

Hey! Here I am! Come out, come out wherever you! Aw, dont be shy!

(Behind a tree crawls millions of the same little green bugs as before.)

Come on! Huh?

(He starts back.)

Its just like a told ya. Theres nothing out here but a bunch of trees. Trees that this man values more than human life. And Im going to see him tried on murder charges.

(He walks past them and into the cabin.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) What do you think?

MULDER: I think Im going to suggest that we sleep with the lights on.

(Scully sighs and they walk inside, Mulder closing the door behind him. The bug zapper goes off a few more times. Morning. Spinney leads the other to a huge tree cut down. It has an orange "X" on it.)

SPINNEY: You see this Douglas Fir? Its been standing here since before your time and your men cut it down.

SCULLY: Who marks these trees?

MOORE: Federal Forest Service. Theyre only supposed to cut trees with a blue "X."

(Mulder stands on the stump.)

MULDER: This tree must be hundreds of years old.

MOORE: At least.

SCULLY: You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree like this.

SPINNEY: Thousands of boards. Hell of a lot easier than taking a lot of smaller, younger trees.

HUMPHREYS: Well, let me remind you that monkey wrenchers like Spinney here are not above marking trees with their own paint.

MOORE: This trees 500 years old if its a day, Steve.

MULDER: Hey, look at this.

(Moore walks over. Mulder points out a yellowish-green ring near the center.)

What would this represent?

MOORE: I dont know. Ive never seen a ring like that before.

SCULLY: Those center rings are the older rings, right?

MOORE: Yeah. Every ring represents a season growth. And you see these?

(He points out the very center rings.)

These are 500, 600 years old. Theyre a recorded history of rainfall and climate. But this one... I dont know. I should take a core sample.

(He takes off his backpack.)

HUMPHREYS: Have we finished with this nature walk? I want an answer to what happened to those loggers.

SCULLY: Thats what were trying to determine, sir.

HUMPHREYS: Looking at a tree stump? Dont you think you should be interrogating this man?

(He points to Spinney.)

MULDER: I dont think he did it.

HUMPHREYS: Well, I think he did and I want him arrested.

MULDER: Well, hes not going anywhere!

HUMPHREYS: No, not with a gun on him. But what happens when youre poking around and his three buddies show up and do to you what they probably did to those two Federal Forest officers? Huh? Larry?

MOORE: I just want to take a core sample of this tree, Steve.

HUMPHREYS: Hey, I got families down there who want some answers about their loved ones and so do you! Answers that arent going to be found in that tree.

SPINNEY: Only crime were here to investigate is the death of that tree.

HUMPHREYS: Yeah, well see about that.

(He starts off.)

MOORE: Steve, where you going?

(He stops and turns around.)

HUMPHREYS: Im going to hike down to your truck, get on the horn and get some people up here wholl take some action!

MOORE: Steve!

SPINNEY: Aw, let him go. Let him find out for himself.

(Humphreys walks off. Back at the cabin, Moore is looking at the core sample through a microscope.)

MOORE: This is odd. This yellow rings got something living in it, some kind of tiny bug. It doesnt make sense.

(Mulder looks into the scope.)

SCULLY: Why not?

(Inside the sample are thousands of tiny bugs scampering around.)

MOORE: Well, parasites attack a tree in a variety of ways, but they always attack the living parts. The leaves, the roots, the new growth rings. Even if theyre borers of something, they wouldnt be working so deep in the tree.

MULDER: Maybe the wood in this ring is different. Theyre feeding on it.

SCULLY: Can you identify them?

(Mulder gets up. She slides the microscope over and looks in.)

MOORE: Its a wood mite of some kind. Its nothing Ive ever seen before.

MULDER: Could they have been living in that tree for hundreds of years?

MOORE: I dont see how. I mean, these inner rings are essentially dead wood. The trees vascular system is limited to the outer few rings, they need water to survive.

SCULLY: Well, they appear to be hatching out of the porous wood. Maybe when you drew out this core, you tapped into a larger nest.

SPINNEY: Can they build a cocoon?

(They turn to see Spinney walk in.)

Right after that tree was cut down is when Teague died. Its about the same time the loggers disappeared too.

SCULLY: You think these mites are what killed the men?

SPINNEY: Maybe they been lying there dormant for hundreds of years. Maybe they woke up hungry.

(Humphreys marches through the woods and gets in the truck. He puts his bag down and notices there is no key. He checks around but cannot find one.)

HUMPHREYS: Damn it!

(He sighs. Night falls as he tries to hotwire the car. With no success, he gets out and goes to the front hood. He looks around with a flashlight, turning knobs. A humming begins. He looks around, then picks up his shotgun.)

Alright, you monkey wrenchers! Come on out now!

(He shines it into the trees. Nothing.)

I know what youre up to!

(Still nothing. The humming grows louder. He looks to see the mites swarming down to him. He runs into the car and closes both doors. Looking up at them through the windshield, he tries to jumpstart the car again. The engine finally turns. He shifts gears and pushes down on the accelerator, but the car doesnt move. He shifts gears and tries again, but still nothing. The swarm grows closer. He finally pulls out but hits a rock in front of him. He pushes forward into the steering wheel, honking the horn. He shifts gears but sees the swarm gather around the car. They seep in through the filtration. He tries to open the door but it is jammed by another rock. He tries to push the door open repeatedly with no luck until the bugs overwhelm him. He claws at the window, screaming. Back at the cabin, the generator keeps running. Scully is still looking through the microscope as Moore and Mulder walk around. Spinney sits on a table.)

MOORE: Humphreys should have been back by now.

SCULLY: These bugs arent moving anymore. Theyre either dead or theyre asleep.

SPINNEY: Its the light. They dont like the light.

SCULLY: Thats weird, I mean, usually bugs are attracted to light.

SPINNEY: These obviously are not your ordinary bugs to say the least.

(Mulder runs his fingers over more surfaces. He picks up more of the film he found before.)

MULDER: What do you know about insects, Scully?

SCULLY: Uh, just what I learned in my biology courses. That theyre the foundation of our ecosystem. That theres lots of them, something like 200 million per person on this planet.

MULDER: And theyve been around a long time, right?

SCULLY: Yeah, something like 600 million years, even before the dinosaurs. Why?

MULDER: And this tree is what, 5, 6, 700 years old?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: And these rings represent a history of climatic changes, which means that in this year or season in the life of the tree, there was some kind of strange event that produced an abnormal ring.

SCULLY: Well, like what, exactly?

MULDER: A volcanic eruption. This whole chain of mountains running from Washington to Oregon is still extremely active. Remember Mt. St. Helens?

SCULLY: Yeah, but how does that explain the bugs?

MULDER: When Mt. St. Helens erupted, there was a large amount of radiation that was released from inside the earth. Strange things started to grow. Theres actually this lake where theyve discovered a kind of amoeba that can literally suck a mans brains out.

SCULLY: Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba.

SPINNEY: No, its true. Spirit Lake. And theres documented cases of swimmers being infected.

SCULLY: But an amoeba is a single-celled organism. It can be mutated. An insect is a complex animal. It would take years and years to evolve.

MULDER: Well, then maybe what were dealing with isnt a mutation at all. What if its some kind of... extinct insect larvae in that ring, deposited during a period of volcanic activity, brought up through the trees root system. Ancient insect eggs. Thousands, maybe millions of years old lying
dormant until...

SPINNEY: Until those loggers cut down that tree.

(He stands.)

That would be rather poetic justice, dont you think? Unleashing the very thing that would end up killing them and your friend Humphreys?

(He walks past Moore to the bedroom door.)

And who knows? Maybe us. Sweet dreams.

(He goes inside.)

MOORE: Humphreys might have just hiked out of here. We dont know that he didnt.
Maybe were letting ourselves get carried away with this bug story.

MULDER: Yeah, maybe.

(Sunrise. Spinney skulks through the cabin, grabs his bag and goes outside. He goes to the side of the cabin and takes the gas tank. He starts unscrewing a truck battery when Mulder sneaks up on him and points a gun.)

Going somewhere?

SPINNEY: No, I was just...

MULDER: Doing a little auto repair. Looks to me like youre planning on cutting out of here.

SPINNEY: I gotta save my friends. They only had enough gas to keep their generator running fifteen, twenty hours max. Theyre gonna die if I dont get back there.

MULDER: So why are you sneaking around?

SPINNEY: Freddy. Forest Service guy, he wouldnt go for it. Hed never trust me.

MULDER: Hes got no reason to. Neither do I.

SPINNEY: Look, I can save us all, man. Weve got a jeep over there, its just two valleys over, all it needs is a battery. Now, I can get there, I can get back here in the morning. We can all drive out tomorrow. You got to trust me, man.

(Later. Mulder is fixing the radio. It turns on, but all it gets is static.)

MULDER: Radio is back up.

(Scully runs in.)

SCULLY: Its working?

MULDER: Im not getting any reception so the reciever could be trashed.

SCULLY: What about transmissions, could we send a message?

MULDER: We could try.

(He picks up the transmitter.)

This is a call for help, is there anyone at this frequency?

(Static. He adjusts the frequency control, but still only gets static.)

This is Special Agent Mulder of the F.B.I., we have an emergency and a possible quarantine situation. Our position is...

(He nudges Scully to go get the map, which she does. Suddenly, the generator goes out.
They walk to the side of the house where Moore is.)

What happened to the generator?

MOORE: I turned it off.

MULDER: Well, turn it back on, I got the radio working.

MOORE: What happened to the gas can?

MULDER: Spinney took it.

MOORE: He took it? You mean hes gone?

MULDER: He left earlier this morning. He took a battery and some gas. Hes gonna come back for us in the morning.

MOORE: Yeah, what, he gave you his personal guarantee on that?

MULDER: He gave me his word, yeah.

MOORE: Did you stop to think that the man who gave you his word has made an art out of sabotage? And defying authority? And is probably the same man who put the bullet through my windshield?

MULDER: Well, what would you have done? At least now weve got one chance of getting out of here alive which is one more chance than we had before.

MOORE: Or one less.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MOORE: Your partner let Spinney leave with the last of the gas. This generators got about a quarter tank left, maybe less.

SCULLY: What about the gas in the trucks?

MULDER: There is no more gas, the other tanks have all been ruptured or filled with sugar.

MOORE: By the same man who we are now trusting to keep his word and come back for us.

SCULLY: Well, then weve got to get back on the radio, weve got to send out a mayday.

MOORE: Every drop of fuel we waste is fuel thats gonna keep this gennie powered tonight. I mean, I dont want to be waiting around hoping somebody heard that transmission when this thing quits running about two oclock in the morning. Do you?

(He walks back in the cabin. Scully looks at Mulder, who does not look back. He sighs. Mulder walks into the cabin and groans, knowing he made the wrong move. Scully walks in and closes the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Look, its done. I shouldnt have let him go. Lets just move past it, okay?

SCULLY: Fine. What do you suggest?

MULDER: I dont know. Well think of something.

SCULLY: Look, I think we both have a pretty good idea of what happened to those loggers and what happened to the group in 1934.

MULDER: We only found one cocoon.

(He stands and crosses to the door.)

SCULLY: Its a big forest.

MULDER: Look, Scully, what would you have done?

SCULLY: You mean, would I have made a decision by myself that would have affected the whole group?

MULDER: Oh, will you cut the sanctimonious crap?

SCULLY: Well, what do you want me to say? Lets face it, Mulder, we might die up here! If were lucky, theyll find our bodies spun up in a tree or they may not find us at all!

MULDER: Youre right. And were wasting time arguing about it.

(Mulder walks past her to the window. She walks over to him after a few seconds.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: Button this place up. If were gonna spend the night in here, weve got to do everything we can to make sure the bugs stay out there.

(Mulder hammers some sheets to the wall with boards. Moore walks in carrying more supplies. Scully is screwing in the light bulb.)

MOORE: Id be careful with that. Its the only bulb that works.

(Nightfall. The generator keeps running, rougher. Mulder and Scully lay on cots, Moore sits on his bed. They all watch the lightbulb work. Scully looks into the corner and sees the mites running around in the shadows.)

SCULLY: I can see them. You guys, look at this.

(She walks over to the corner. They follow.)

Look, theyre coming through the wall down where its dark. You see them?

(She leans forward and looks at her hand. As her shadow covers it, she sees mites crawling all over her. She lets out a loud gasp. She stands and starts trying to brush them off.)

Theyre on me.

MULDER: Its alright, Scully, Scully...

(She walks backwards, rubbing her arms.)

SCULLY: Get them off me!

MULDER: Stop moving! Stop!

(She flails her arms wildly, smacking the lightbulb. Moore reaches forward and grabs it.)

MOORE: Whoa, watch it!

(Mulder grabs her and holds her against the wall.)

MULDER: Stand still! Stand still!

SCULLY: Can you see them? Mulder, get them off me!

MULDER: Theyre not just on you. Theyre everywhere. I think thats what that greasy residue is over everything.

SCULLY: I thought we were supposed to be safe in the light!

MULDER: We are. I think the light keeps them from swarming. Well be safe as long as we stay in the light.

(The mites continue to crawl in the shadows. Later. The tank on the generator is nearly empty. Everyone is sitting back down.)

How are you doing?

SCULLY: Im okay.

(They both take a deep breath. Later, they sit together and watch the mites crawl around.)

Theyre oxidizing enzymes. Just like fireflies. Maybe thats why they cocoon their prey... so they can oxidize the proteins taken from the fluids in the body.

(The light nearly fades out. They look at it. It builds back to normal again. We can hear the generator running out of fuel outside.)

What if the generator goes? Are they all going to swarm in here and drain the life out of us?

MULDER: We got an hour and a half till sunrise.

SCULLY: And then what? Its over a days hike out of here. We wont make it on foot by nightfall.

MULDER: Maybe somebody heard our radio transmission. Help could be on the way.

SCULLY: Oh, you sent that call hours ago. I mean, help would have been here by now.

MULDER: Well, Im not going to give up on Spinney. He gave me his word hed come back to get us.

SCULLY: And if he doesnt?

MULDER: Well think of something.

(The generator sputters out and dies. The light bulb slowly fades out. But light still shines through the other way. Mulder and Scully turn around to see that the sun is rising slowly. Mulder and Moore run out to the truck and check the tires.)

You got a patch kit or an extra tube in your truck?

MOORE: Yeah.

MULDER: Maybe we can patch this or at least get it to hold some air. With the spare in your truck, maybe we can limp down the mountain. If not, at least we can get on the radio and warn them whats out there.

(Mulder, Scully and Moore hike down to the truck. Mulder is rolling the spare tire. They get to the truck and walk towards it.)

MOORE: See it?

MULDER: Yeah.

(They look through the drivers side window to see whats left of Humphreys leaning against the door, cocooned. They hear a low humming.)

MOORE: Listen. You hear that? Its a car!

(They turn to see a jeep barreling down the road.)

MULDER: No, its a jeep!

(The jeep swerves to a stop and the three run to it. Spinney opens the door.)

SPINNEY: We gotta move, lets go! Lets go!

MOORE: Wait! What about the body... Humphreys body?

SPINNEY: Leave it, Ive radioed for help.

(Scully gets into the passenger side.)

MULDER: What happened to your friends?

SPINNEY: They didnt make it. Were not going to make it either unless we haul ass!

(The two get in the car and they drive back the way they came. The headlights go on as a fog envelopes the road and it grows dark. Everything is fine until they hit a row of caltrops.)

Damn it!

(He gets out of the car and looks at the tires.)

I dont believe it.

MOORE: When you talk about shooting yourself in the foot...

(Moore opens the door and looks out. A familiar buzzing grows. Suddenly, Spinney is attacked by the swarm. Moore watches from outside the car.)

MULDER: Get out of there! Get back in the car!

(Moore gets back in the car and they watch as Spinney helplessly tries to stop the onslaught. Spinney slams his fists down on the hood, moaning and screaming, until he runs off. The mites begin to seep into the car. The three try to brush the mites away as they moan and groan. Their yelling grows louder and longer as they are overwhelmed. Morning. A helicopter flies in as three trucks pull up to the jeep. Men file out, all wearing containment suits. They open up the door and look in the jeep. It is a mess of cocooning and bodies.)

MAN: We have an emergency evacuation situation. Requesting quarantine facility for two, possibly three victims with undiagnosed infection or exposure to unknown biological vectors. Repeat, thats an emergency evacuation situation. Two, possibly three victims...

(Scully stirs under the cocooning.)



SCENE 4
HIGH CONTAINMENT FACILITY; WINTHROP, WASHINGTON

(A small door slides up and a man in a containment suit takes out a canister.)

ANNOUNCER: Attention, all personnel. High level bio-clearance required on third floor.

(He carrys it into a room with many other containment suited men walking around. One man walks over to Moore, who is on a gurney with machines hooked up. He presses a few buttons on a machine, then does the same for Scully. Mulder walks in, severly burned, dressed in white, wheeling an oxygen tank that is hooked up through his nose.)

MAN: How are you feeling?

MULDER: Better. How did the tests come back?

(The man walks over to a desk and picks up a chart.)

MAN: Your respiratory charts were good. Were more concerned with the extent of damage due to inhalation. There were large concentrations of the chemical determined as Luciferene.

MULDER: Which is what?

MAN: The same enzymes we find in fireflies and other bioluminescent insects. Our entomologists are still trying to determine the specific epithet of the insects you encountered.

(Mulder and the man walk over to Scully.)

MULDER: Scully?

(She is unconscious with severe burns as well.)

How is she doing?

MAN: Shes still not out of the woods, so to speak. She lost a lot of fluids. Two or three more hours of exposure, she might not have made it.

MULDER: I told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest.

(The man starts to walk away.)

How you going to contain it to the forest.

(He turns back.)

What if the swarm migrates?

MAN: The government has initiated eradication procedures. Theyre quite certain that by using a combination of controlled burns and pesticides, they will be successful.

MULDER: And if theyre not?

MAN: That is not an option, Mr. Mulder.

(He walks out, leaving Mulder to his thoughts.)

[THE END]
                                            TOOMS


SCENE 1
DRUID HILL SANITARIUM; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Barbed wire surroundes a tall reddish-building. Going down a hallway, we can hear screaming, moaning and indiscernible babbling. On various doors, we see name plates like "Walter L, Robbie" and "Schalin, Scott." Under each of the name plates is a small door through which food is passed through. We stop at a door where the name plate reads: "Tooms, Eugene Victor." A face appears through the small door, with evil yellowish eyes. He peers down the hallway then sticks his hand through the slot. He reaches up towards the latch, growling. As he sticks his arm further through, we hear a dull pop as his shoulder dislocates. He smiles and lets out a dull sigh. His breathing becomes slow and heavy, his hand and arm stretching out beyond normal human proportions. His fingers actually grow until they are almost at the lock. The main door in the hallway opens, flooding the dark hallway with light. A man, Dr. Aaron Monte, and a security guard walk down to Tooms' door. Monte knocks on the door.)

AARON MONTE: Eugene?

(He knocks again.)

Eugene, it's Dr. Monte.

(Hearing no answer, he signals to the security guard. The guard unlatches the door and Monte walks inside.)

Eugene, are you asleep?

(Tooms sits up on his bed.)

EUGENE TOOMS: No.

AARON MONTE: I was on my way out and wanted to stop by and see how you were feeling.

EUGENE TOOMS: Fine.

(Monte sits down.)

AARON MONTE: Good. You nervous about tomorrow? Don't be. I know you think they won't let you out so I snuck a peek at the reports of the doctors that will testify at your review tomorrow and they concur with my opinion that you're ready to be released from here...

EUGENE TOOMS: Hmmm...

AARON MONTE: And rejoin the community. So...

(He stands.)

Why don't we get some sleep and relax and I'll see you tomorrow at the review, okay?

(He goes over and picks up his coat.)

Let's just keep our fingers crossed.

(He walks out and the security guard closes and latches the door. Tooms looks up from the floor, the same evil yellowish glow as before. Slowly, he crosses his fingers.)

SCENE 2
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is sitting at his desk, Scully sitting at the opposite side. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is standing behind Skinner next to the window, smoking.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, we have reviewed your reports and frankly we are quite displeased. Irregular procedure, untenable evidence, anonymous witnesses, inconclusive findings aggravated by vague opinion.

SCULLY: But sir, the very nature of the X-Files cases often precludes orthodox investigation.

SKINNER: Are you suggesting that the bureau adopt separate standards for you and Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: No, sir.

SKINNER: Are you suggesting that Agent Mulder obstructs you from proper procedure?

SCULLY: No, sir. If anything, I'm suggesting that these cases be reviewed with... an open mind.

SKINNER: Maybe your mind has become too open.

SCULLY: On X-Files cases investigated by Agent Mulder and myself to date, we have a conviction or case solution of seventy-five percent. That's well above the current bureau standard.

SKINNER: And that is your only saving grace.

SCULLY: May I ask, sir, what more you require?

(Skinner looks away towards the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who looks out the window. Scully looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man as well. Skinner looks back at Scully.)

SKINNER: What I require is increased frequency of reports. Conventional investigation. In short, Agent Scully, it is your responsibility to see that these cases are by-the-book.

SCULLY: I understand, however... conventional investigation of these cases may decrease the rate of success.

(Scully watches as the Cigarette-Smoking Man puts out his cigarette. We hear a gavel pounding.)



SCENE 3
COURT HEARING OF EUGENE VICTOR TOOMS; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

JUDGE KANN: By order of the state of Maryland, the court shall review the psychological status of Eugene Victor Tooms. We'll begin with the court-appointed expert witnesses. The court calls Dr. Pamela Karetzky.

(Eugene Tooms is sitting at a table with a female, obviously his attorney. A board of three judges are seated at a table at the front of the room. Dr. Karetzky gets up and we see Mulder is sitting behind her. He looks at his watch.)

DR. KARETZKY: I performed several diagnostic procedures on Mr. Tooms in order to determine any organic physiological dysfunction - an electroencephalogram, chromosomal analysis, a computerized axial tomograph. All of these were negative.

(Cut to an overlapping picture of another doctor sitting in the chair talking. He is reading off a paper.)

DR. COLLINS: "Mr. Tooms had recently lost his job," Parenthesis: "Baltimore Animal Regulation" slash "Dog Catcher," close parenthesis. "Aggravated by a false arrest incident with the FBI, his assault on Agent Scully was," quote, "frustration directed at the wrong person," end quote.

(Cut to another overlapping picture, this one of Dr. Aaron Monte in the same seat.)

AARON MONTE: I'm reading from a recent interview I did with Mr. Tooms at the Druid Hill Sanitarium. "Question: If you were released, what is the first thing you would do? Answer: I'd like my old job back. Question: Why? Answer: The animal shelter made me feel I was helping everyone, people and animals."

(Mulder leans back in his chair, disgusted. Monte taps his pen in time with the emphasized words.)

So you see, what is occuring here is that Mr. Tooms is learning to articulate his feelings and invest his emotional energy towards creative and constructive activity...

(Tooms looks at Dr. Monte with the yellowish eyes. From Tooms' point of view, the audio fades away and everything becomes black-and-white except for Monte. Monte looks back at Tooms, who looks down. The audio and visual status return to normal.)

...strategem neurotic build-up in himself.

(Tooms looks up, his eyes back to normal.)

It is my opinion that Mr. Tooms has had a very excellent response to the months of treatment and therapy and I would see no reason why he would be considered of any danger to himself or any member of society.

(Mulder takes the stand. He is being sworn in.)

WOMAN: Do you swear that the testimony you are about to deliver is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

MULDER: I do.

(He is seated. The prosecution attorney stands up and walks towards Mulder.)

PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Mr. Mulder, as an expert witness for the state of Maryland, can you list your qualifications?

MULDER: I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I worked for three years at the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit profiling serial killers.

DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: Your honor, I know where he's going this. May I remind the court that Mr. Tooms was placed in psychiatric care solely for the previous assault on Agent Scully. He has never been charged, nor has any evidence linked him to another crime.

JUDGE KANN: You may proceed... with caution.

(Mulder sees Scully walk in and take a seat in the back.)

PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Agent Mulder, I understand that you've drawn upon your experience and developed a profile on Mr. Tooms.

MULDER: Yes, I have.

PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: Please.

(He motions for Mulder to show it. Mulder starts a slideshow. The first picture is of a woman, face down.)

MULDER: These murders span nearly a century. Nineteen homicides, five occuring every thirty years since 1903, all in the Baltimore area. In each case, the liver was extracted and presumably eaten.

(The slides cycle through, showing various people lying face down. The judges are disturbed by the pictures. The pictures change to knick-knacks with a tag marked "Evidence" next to them.)

A trophy was taken, many of which were found in the living quarters of Eugene Tooms at 66 Exeter Street. Records show that a Eugene Tooms has resided at that same address since 1903, the same year a man was murdered in that building.

(Scully looks down, knowing the testimony seems incredulous. The judge looks at Mulder warily.)

Besides the liver extraction, the most notable element connecting these cases is the undetermined point of entry. Many of the victims were found with their windows and doors locked from the inside.

(Various fingerprints are shown in the slides.)

These elongated fingerprints found at seven of the nineteen crime sites match Eugene Victor Tooms.

(Mulder motions to Tooms.)

JUDGE KANN: Agent Mulder! Look at his fingers. Look at him! 100 years old?

MULDER: I contend that perhaps through genetic mutation, Eugene Tooms is capable of contorting and elongating his body in order to gain access to victims so that he may extract the livers which provide him with sustenance for the hibernation period of 30 years. He needs one more liver to complete this cycle.

(Everybody finds this testimony incredulous, and slight murmuring can be heard from the back.)

DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: Your honor...

MULDER: A preliminary examination done at the time of Tooms' arrest revealed abnormalities in his striated muscles and axial bones. His attorney blocked further study...

PROSECTION COUNSEL MYERS: Thank you, Agent Mulder!

MULDER: I must ask that you place the safety of...

JUDGE KANN: Counsel?

MULDER: ...the people first and foremost...

DEFENSE COUNSEL NELSON: No further questions, your honor.

MULDER: This is a rare and unusual human creature...

JUDGE KANN: Agent Mulder!

MULDER: ...who should not be released, but should be retained for further study.

JUDGE KANN: You may step down!

MULDER: If you release Eugene Tooms, he will kill again. It's in his genetic make-up.

(The judge bangs her gavel. Cut to Mulder, sitting on a bench in the hallway outside the courtroom. Scully walks out and over to Mulder.)

You think they would have taken me more seriously if I wore the grey suit?

(She sits down next to him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so...

MULDER: I don't care how it sounded as long as it was the truth.

(Scully sighs.)

And where were you? Your testimony was important.

SCULLY: I was called into a meeting by Assistant Director Skinner.

MULDER: What did he want?

SCULLY: Just wanted to reel me in.

(The door opens and Prosecution Council Myers walks out.)

PROSECUTION COUNSEL MYERS: They're ready.

(Back in the courtroom, Tooms and Defense Counsel Nelson are standing. Mulder and Scully sit in the back of the room.)

JUDGE KANN: It is the opinion of this court that Eugene Victor Tooms shall on this daybe released from Druid Hill Sanitarium.

(Tooms smiles. Mulder sighs a heavy breath.)

The court also attaches these conditions. One, that Mr. Tooms remain in counseling under the care of Dr. Aaron Monte; that he retain his job at the Baltimore Regulations Animal Shelter; and last, that he take residence in the house of Mr. and Mrs. Arlan Green...

(Mr. and Mrs. Green stand. Tooms looks back at them.)

... trained in a program to assist patients released from Druid Hill in their transition to society.

(They nod at him.)

Mr. Tooms?

(He looks back at her.)

Do you understand and accept these conditions?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes, your honor.

(He nods.)

JUDGE KANN: Very well. You're free to go.

(She bangs her gavel again. Mulder and Scully walk out of the courtroom.)

MULDER: I'm not taking my eyes off him.

SCULLY: Mulder, wait...

MULDER: He needs to kill, he'll do it the first chance he can but he won't kill the old couple. He won't be that obvious. Tooms didn't remain a secret for a hundred years by not being careful. Think of him as an animal. He'll only kill out of necessity or self-defense. If he makes an attempt, I'll be there to stop him.

(They stop walking.)

SCULLY: Okay, well then I'll keep surveillance with you.

MULDER: No, I'll watch him. If he can't be tied to the most recent evidence, you'll have to go back to the earlier murders to prove it was him.

SCULLY: That was thirty or sixty years ago.

MULDER: There's no statute of limitation on murder.

SCULLY: Mulder, that's going to entail unorthodox methods of investigation.

MULDER: Look, Scully, if you're resistant because you don't believe, I'll respect that. But if you're resistant because of some bureaucratic pressure, they've not only reeled you in. They've already skinned you.

(Tooms walks out of the courtroom followed by Mr. and Mrs. Green. Tooms slows down a bit as he passes Mulder and Scully and smiles at them. They keep walking, turning the next corner.)

ARLAN GREEN: I hope you'll be comfortable, Eugene. The room in the back is small, but I'm sure you'll be able to squeeze in.

EUGENE TOOMS: I'm sure.



SCENE 4
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Tooms steps out of his Baltimore Animal Regulation van, walks to the back, takes out a garbage bag, puts on rubber gloves, walks a little down the street, bends over and picks up a rat. He puts the rat in the bag and the bag in the van. He licks the glove where he had touched the rat. He slams the door shut and goes around to the front of the truck again. Before he gets in, he looks over at a woman buying a cappucino at a stand. His breathing becomes heavy and the audio goes out. His eyes turn yellowish. As she starts walking down the street towards him, he starts walking towards her. Everything fades to black-and-white again except for the woman. He growls and his point of view is suddenly interrupted. He looks at the man in front of him and sees it is Agent Mulder. He snarls at him.)

MULDER: Excuse me.

(Tooms' eyes go back to normal.)

Could you help me find my dog?

(Tooms walks back to the car and opens the door.)

He's a Norweigan Elkhound. His name is Heinrich. I use him to hunt moose.

(Tooms gets in and drives away. Mulder watches him drive by.)



SCENE 5
LYNNE ACRES RETIREMENT HOME; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Detective Frank Briggs looks at a newspaper clipping with the headline "Suspect Caught in Serial Killings." Under the title is a picture of Tooms. Briggs crumples up the paper and throws it down. He rubs his forehead and sighs. Scully is standing.)

FRANK BRIGGS: If Tooms gets away now then the next time he takes a life, you'll be nearly my age.

SCULLY: Detective Briggs, you've helped us so much before. Now we have to prove that Tooms was involved in the killings you investigated thirty years ago. You've lived with this case half your life.

(She walks towards him and sits down.)

There must be something. Maybe a connection between the victims. Now, I know that we've seen all the evidence, but is there anything, anything at all amongst the evidence that doesn't fit?

FRANK BRIGGS: There was something that never did sit quite right with me. All of the victims that I investigated in '63 were found at the crime scene, liver extracted. All five.

SCULLY: As were the four most recent murders.

(Briggs wheels himself over to the bed with a box on it.)

FRANK BRIGGS: When I was a sherrif during the Powhatan Mill killings of 1933, only four of the victims were found at the crime scene. However, there was a fifth person who was missing and never found.

(Scully walks over to him. He takes out a piece of liver in a jar marked "Evidence.")

But this, this was discovered at the Ruxton Chemical Plant when it was under construction.

(He hands the jar to her. She sits down.)

But it doesn't belong to the other victims.

SCULLY: That doesn't prove that it belongs to a person murdered by Tooms.

FRANK BRIGGS: I'm positive that Tooms hid this one victim because there was something about the body that could prove he was the killer.

SCULLY: And what makes you positive?

FRANK BRIGGS: A hunch. A good old-fashioned hunch. You've got to trust your instincts.

SCULLY: And what does your instincts say about where Tooms buried the body?

FRANK BRIGGS: In the cement where they poured the foundation of the chemical plant.



SCENE 6
RUXTON CHEMICAL PLANT; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(A man with some sort of scanner moves the machine along the foundation as a read-out is being printed from the machine. The rock inside the foundation is shown on a screen. Scully and Briggs are behind a man who is watching the screen and making notes on the print-out.)

SCULLY: Ground-penetrating radar. It bounces signals off of objects or cavities.

FRANK BRIGGS: Tells you where the body is.

SCULLY: Well, it signals if something inordinate is present. An experienced operator attempts to differentiate if the signal is a body or is stone or a hole in the ground.

FRANK BRIGGS: Differentiate?

SCULLY: Mm-hmmm.

FRANK BRIGGS: You mean he guesses?

SCULLY: Well, it's an educated guess.

FRANK BRIGGS: Mm-hmmm.

(Scully walks over to the man at the machine.)

SCULLY: How are we doing?

OPERATOR: Well, it's really hard to tell. There are some possibilities... very few places...

(The sound of the man's voice trails off as Briggs wheels around some pipes and columns. He stops at a piece of the ground.)

FRANK BRIGGS: It's here. Here!

(He points at the ground as Scully and a few men run around the corner.)

MAN: What is it?

FRANK BRIGGS: It's here. It's right here!



SCENE 7
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Tooms puts an unidentifyable roadkill of some sort into another garbage bag. As he stands up, a man in a blue trenchcoat walks by. Tooms turns to look at him. He gets in the back of the van and watches the man get in his car. His eyes turn yellow and the noises of the crowd fade away. Everything fades to black-and-white but the man. Tooms slams the door shut and watches him through the glass.)



SCENE 8
RUXTON CHEMICAL PLANT; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(A man with a jackhammer digs through the foundation at the part Briggs pointed out. Scully, Briggs, and various men watch. They all have protective earpieces and safety goggles. He stops and another man bends down with an air hose, blowing away the loose dirt.)

AIR HOSE MAN: Agent Scully? Look at this.

(Scully takes off her earpieces and goes over to the spot. Scully bends down and pushes away the dirt with a brush. Briggs goes over as well. Looking closely, Scully sees that there are three bone fingers, one with a silver ring on it.)



SCENE 9
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(The man in the blue trenchcoat pulls up in his car at a house. Tooms pulls up in his van, followed by Mulder in his car. Inside the house, the man, Frank Ranford, is in a sweatshirt looking at data charts on his computer. His wife, Christine, is standing next to him.)

CHRISTINE RANFORD: Robotoddler's finally asleep. I'm going to go to bed.

FRANK RANFORD: Okay.

(She walks out of the room. Outside, we hear a dog barking. Mulder is sleeping, but a passing car wakes him up. He looks at his watch and gets out of the car. He goes to the Baltimore Animal Regulation van and shines his flashlight in the front seat. He goes to the back of the van, opens the door, and shines his flashlight in. He looks out and runs off to the house. Under the van, we see the manhole cover close. Inside the bathroom, Christine Ranford fixes her hair. She blows her nose and goes over to the toilet. Looking in, she sees the water is green and bubbling. Mulder skulks around outside. In the bathroom, Christine tries to unclog the toilet. The toilet flushes and the baby starts crying.)

CHRISTINE RANFORD: I'm coming, honey. Mommy's right here. Shh, shh.

(She goes out of the bathroom. The wire on the tool she was using starts being pulled down the toilet drain. Frank is still typing on his keyboard. Christine comes in wearing gloves.)

Screw it.

(She goes to pull out the wire but it is pulled back in. She yanks it again, pulling it out this time. She starts to walk out, but turns around, puts the lid down and latches the child-proof lock. We see Mulder searching outside and Frank writing something down. Tooms skulks around to the side of the house. His fingers slide under the small hole between the window and the windowledge. He pulls open the window. As Frank continues typing, Tooms, covered with sludge, puts his foot through the iron bars on the window and steps on the desk. He struggles to pull himself through. He gets through, growls, and moves off towards his prey. Frank pulls a paper out of a desk drawer as yellow eyes watch him. The area around Frank grows black-and-white, and all we can hear is heavy breathing. Frank sits down at his computer. Mulder spots marks, hand prints, on the windowsill. He hurries off towards the house and knocks on the door. Christine calls to her husband.)

Would you go down and get that?

(Frank sighs and closes the door behind him. He goes down and moves the curtain away, looking through the door. Mulder is standing there, holding his badge.)

MULDER: F.B.I.

(Frank opens the door.)

I suspect an intruder in your house.

FRANK RANFORD: What?

(Mulder walks into the room, followed by Christine and Frank. Frank points at the open window.)

Someone opened my window.

(Mulder walks over to the window and shines his flashlight outside. He looks down at the windowsill and sees the same handprints as before, this time from the inside. He rushes out the front door and sees that the van has gone, the manhole that was under it releasing steam.)



SCENE 10
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE; FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY LAB

(Doctor Collins and Scully walk in and over to the block of cement containing the skeleton, which was apparently dug up.)

DR. PLITH: I suspect the year of death to be in the mid-1930s. The anterior surface of the right femur was green indicating a long-term exposure to copper. So we concentrated on the area and we found several pennies.

(They walk over to his desk, where he picks up a few pennies and shows them to Scully.)

1933, 31, 1933...

SCULLY: Can you determine the cause of death? My instinct says that burial in cement is murder.

DR. PLITH: Ah, no. At the moment, I have found no definite proof of murder. There are gnawing marks near the ribs, however, I suspect thats the result of rodent activity prior to the body being set in cement. Well need to see much more of the remains to determine cause of death. As you know, its a slow but necessary process. Uh, I did try a little something. Its a little premature if were going to go by-the-book.

SCULLY: Well, well keep it off the record.

DR. PLITH: Good, thank you.

(He walks over to a computer. Scully follows.)

The old man, Briggs, he gave me a photograph of the missing person in 1933 suspected of being a murder victim. I ran a computer-assisted photographic superimposition on what we have of the skull.

(He holds up a picture of a man with glasses.)

Now, this is not official... but that skeleton was that person.

(He holds up a picture, half of which is the skull, half of which is the man. The basic structures seem to match.)



SCENE 11
MULDERS CAR

(Mulder is looking at the picture. He is in the drivers seat, Scullys in the passenger seat.)

MULDER: Its not enough. It doesnt tie it to Tooms.

SCULLY: Well, its a start.

(Mulder nods. Scully looks at the various take-out food trays.)

Mulder, its getting a bit ripe in here, dont you think?

(Mulder reaches over into the glove compartment, pulls out an air freshener, and tears off the wrapper. He holds it up.)

MULDER: Pine-scented.

(He smells it, then puts it in front of Scullys nose.)

SCULLY: Ooh!

(He hangs it on the rear-view mirror. He sniffs the air.)

MULDER: Better?

(He exhales. Scully looks at him, a slight smile.)

Tooms hasnt come out of the house all day. I sat through a Phillies game, an Orioles game, and four hours of Ba-Ba-Booey. When it got dark, I took a walk around the block. Do you have that sandwich that I asked you to bring?

(Scully digs through a paper bag and pulls out a sandwich.)

SCULLY: Its liverwurst.

MULDER: Ha-ha.

(He opens up the wrapper.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you know that proper surveillance requires two pairs of agents, one pair relieving the other after twelve hours.

MULDER: Article 30, paragraph 8.7?

SCULLY: This isnt about doing it by the book. This is about you not having slept for three days. Mulder, youre going to get sloppy and youre going to get hurt. Its inevitable at this point.

MULDER: A request for other agents to stake-out Tooms would be denied. Then we have no grounds.

SCULLY: Well, then Ill stay here. You go home.

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: Theyre out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully. I dont know why, but any excuse will do. Now, I dont really care about my record, but youd be in trouble just for sitting in this car and Id hate to see you to carry an official reprimand in your file because of me.

(Scully sighs.)

SCULLY: Fox...

(Mulder laughs. Scully looks at him.)

MULDER: And I... I even made my parents call me Mulder. So... Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, I wouldnt put myself on the line for anybody but you.

(They look at each other.)

MULDER: If theres an ice tea in that bag, could be love.

(She takes out the drink.)

SCULLY: Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer.

(Mulder kiddingly sighs.)

Youre delirious. Go home and get some sleep.

(Mulder hands her the sandwich.)

MULDER: Here. Take my sandwich, I only had one bite. Youre gonna want it later, believe me. And youll call me if anything happens, immediately. Ill be here.

(She starts to get out of the car.)

Oh, and 11:30, station 790, Pete Rose Late Night Sports Talk Radio Show.

(He nods grinning. Scully, grinning in a half-doubting-his-sanity sort of way, gets out of the car and walks away. We hear a dog barking.)

SCULLY: Wouldnt miss it for the world.

(Mulder starts the car. We see the trunk latch shut before he drives away. Scully gets in the car and looks at the sandwich.)



SCENE 12
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder is asleep on the couch. The original movie version of "The Fly" is on the TV. In it, David Hedison's character Andre Delambre walks out of his chamber with a black cloth over his head.)

NURSE ON TV: It has worked, hasnt it? Youll be all right now. I know it worked!

(She pulls the black hood off Delambres head to reveal a flys head. She screams as dramatic music plays. Mulder sleeps soundly through it all. A screw on the air vent loosens, squeaking.)

No! No! Nooo!!!!

(The screw falls to the floor. The next one starts turning and squeaking. Mulder wakes up and the screw stops turning. He goes back to sleep and the screw falls out. Tooms steps in and looks at Mulder, yellow eyes blazing. He puts his finger to his face and pushes in. Blood pours down his face. He drags the blood down his cheek with his finger. He groans.)



SCENE 13
HOSPITAL; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Tooms is sitting on an examination table. Detective Talbot takes down notes as Doctor Richmond looks at him.)

DETECTIVE TALBOT: Yeah, they found him out cold in the street.

DR. RICHMOND: Hes been beaten up pretty badly. Contusions, multiple lacerations. Shoulders been pulled right out of joint. Lets get him prepped for some blood work and X-rays.

MALE NURSE: Yes, doctor.

(She looks at his face. We see Tooms face now, bloodied in various places. A shoeprint is on his face.)

DR. RICHMOND: Hes been kicked in the jaw and it may be fractured. Look, theres a partial shoeprint.

DETECTIVE TALBOT: I want to get a photo of that, we might be able to find the shoe that matches it later.

DR. RICHMOND: Do you know who did this to you?

(Tooms mouths some words. The doctor leans in and Tooms is barely audible, so much that he cannot be understood.)

Well be right back, Mr. Tooms.

(She goes to the back room with Talbot.)

Says its an F.B.I. agent named Mulder.

DETECTIVE TALBOT: So would you say hes delusional or just schizophrenic?

DR. RICHMOND: Well, its just a cursory exam, but theres nothing to indicate that.

(Tooms snaps his shoulder back into place with a resounding pop. He smiles slightly.)



SCENE 14
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder is awakened by a knock on the door. He gets up and opens it. Talbot shows him his badge.)

DETECTIVE TALBOT: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Talbot comes in followed by a police officer. Talbot motions for the officer to check out the back room where the couch is.)

Whats going on?

(Mulder follows the officer and sees him kneel over and pick up a pair of Mulders sneakers.)

Whats this about?

DETECTIVE TALBOT: Agent Mulder, get your things. Youre in some trouble.

(The officer and Talbot start out the door. Mulder starts to follow when he steps on something metallic, hearing a click. He bends down and picks up the screw from the air vent. He looks at the vent and sees it is missing a screw.)



SCENE 15
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner walks from the door to his desk, around Mulder and Scully, both are seated. The Cigarette-Smoking Man is seated off to the side.)

SKINNER: These are serious allegations, Agent Mulder, the evidence is incriminating.

MULDER: A good forensic scientist would know that there is not only a shoe print but also an impact point from inside the shoe. An indepth analysis of Tooms injury would show that my foot was not inside the shoe at the time of impact.

SKINNER: Mulder, are you suggesting that Tooms is framing you?

MULDER: Of course.

SKINNER: If indeed you were engaged in an unauthorized round-the-clock surviellance of Tooms, how could he possibly gain access to your shoe without you seeing him?

(Mulder goes to speak, but Scully cuts him off.)

SCULLY: Sir? I was engaged in the unauthorized surveillance as well and Agent Mulder was orienting me on the situation at the time Tooms was admitted into the hospital. Agent Mulder could not have done it because he was with me.

SKINNER: Agent Scully, you wouldnt be lying in me, would you?

SCULLY: Sir, I would expect you to place the same trust in me as I do in you.

SKINNER: Agent Scully, may I have a word with Agent Mulder, please?

(Scully looks at Mulder, sighs, and leaves. The Cigarette-Smoking Man lights a cigarette. Skinner gets up, takes off his glasses and walks around to Mulder.)

Fox, you are one of the finest, most unique agents in the nearly sixty-year history of this institution.

(He sits down where Scully was sitting.)

I mean, we were talking about you when you were in the academy. Now, most of us, including the director, feel that your talents are wasted on the X-Files but we respect that youre deeply invested in those areas. But if these areas are creating such stress as to not only cause you to act inappropriately but those agents close to you as well then may I advise you to step away... for a while. Clear your head, take an extended vacation.

MULDER: Thats a good idea. Thanks for your concern.

(Skinner looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who takes a drag. He gets up, sighs, goes back around his desk and puts on his glasses.)

SKINNER: Youre forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.

(Mulder gets up and goes to the door.)

Mulder...

(Mulder stops. The Cigarette-Smoking Man crosses to Skinner.)

This was close. Any closer and a thousand friends at the capitol wont be able to help you.



SCENE 16
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE; FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGY LAB

(Mulder is looking at an x-ray of Tooms dental x-rays.)

SCULLY: These are Eugene Tooms dental x-rays obtained from the Druid Hill Sanitarium. Your sandwich the other night gave me an idea. Dr. Plith had mentioned that he found gnawing on the rib cage near the location of the liver.

(They walk over to the skeleton in cement.)

Further excavation revealed more pronounced bite marks, human teeth marks.

MULDER: Tooms will never voluntarily submit to a dental cast.

(Scully walks over to Dr. Plith, who is seated at the computer, and sits down. Mulder follows.)

SCULLY: This software can create an exact three-dimensional model of Tooms mouth from the dental radiograph.

(A three-dimensional image appears of Tooms mouth on the computer, followed by a 3-D image of the bitten rib.)

DR. PLITH: Weve also mapped out the bite marks on the skeletons rib... there.

(He points out the bite marks on the image. He presses a few buttons and the jaws appear above and below the bone. The areas around the bites and teeth blink green.)

They match.



SCENE 17
THE GREEN HOUSE; BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Tooms is tearing up newspaper at his desk to make his nest when there is a knocking at the door. Arlan Green comes in followed by Dr. Monte.)

ARLAN GREEN: Eugene, Doctor Monte.

AARON MONTE: Hi, Eugene. I just wanted to stop by and see how everything was going.

ARLAN GREEN: Susan and I are going out for the evening. See you later.

(He shakes Montes hand.)

AARON MONTE: Thanks.

(Green leaves.)

Great place. Wonderful place. How are you feeling?

(Tooms breathing becomes erratic. The color fades out of the room and Monte is no longer audible. Monte sits on the bed. Suddenly, it all goes back to normal.)

Why the newspaper strips, Eugene? Are you making some paper-mache?

EUGENE TOOMS: Yes.

AARON MONTE: Thats terrific. Wonderful, I had no idea you were interested in art.

(Tooms stands.)

EUGENE TOOMS: I like art.

AARON MONTE: I do too and Im very proud of you.

(Tooms goes to the door and his eyes turn yellow.)

You know, art can provide a window to your thoughts and your feelings...what are you doing, Eugene?

(Tooms closes the door.)

Eugene? Are you alright?

(We hear a short scream, a bang, and a long scream. Obviously, Monte is the one screaming. Mulder and Scully pull up to the house. They get out and Mulder knocks on the door. Mulder opens the door and they go inside. They go into Tooms room. Mulder tries the light switch, but it does not work. He takes out his flashlight. We see a bloody hand laying across the top of a chair.)

MULDER: That makes five.

(He walks over to the desk and picks up a piece of bloody newspaper.)

Hes building his nest. Thirty year hibernation.

SCULLY: Where would he go?

MULDER: Where hes gone for the last ninty years, 66 Exeter Street.

SCULLY: No, I already checked on that. They tore down that apartment building he lived in.

MULDER: Whats there now?



SCENE 18
66 EXETER STREET; BALTIMORE

(A giant shopping mall with the words "City Square" is in place of the run-down apartment building. A security guard unlocks the door for Mulder and Scully.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(They walk through, both carrying flashlights.)

Hes got to be here.

SCULLY: If he is drawn to this location for some reason, maybe this nest is in the approximate location of his previous nest.

(They stop.)

This is the area. Theres a storage facility on the second floor.

(Mulder starts up the escalator but stops and turns around, shining the light at Scully.)

What?

(Mulder shines the light down at the door leading to under the escalator for utility purposes. They open up the door.)

Theres only room for one.

(Scully starts to take off her trenchcoat, but Mulder stops her.)

MULDER: You can get the next mutant.

(Mulder takes off his coat and tie, unbuttons the top of his shirt, puts his gun in the holster and, flashlight in hand, climbs down into the crawlspace. He shines the flashlight down on the floor and sees some traces of bile. He takes out his gun and starts crawling through the passage. He shakes off a grate and continues on his way. Down the passageway, we can barely make out the same kind of nest that he previously had: a yellowish paper construct.)

SCULLY: (off in distance) Mulder?

(Scully shines her flashlight down into the hole, trying to see Mulder. Mulder shuffles through left-over newspaper and comes right up to the nest. Mulder inspects the nest closer and sees a tiny hole with bile dripping off of it. Suddenly, a hand bursts through and grabs Mulders shoulder. Mulder drops the gun as he starts to be pushed into the nest. He breaks free and Tooms tears through the rest of the hole, naked, covered in bile, yellow eyes, growling.)

(off in distance) Mulder!

(He charges at Mulder but is smashed in the face by the flashlight. A quick backhand with the flashlight sends Tooms down. Mulder shimmies down the vent, closely followed by Tooms. Mulder comes to the opening and Scully offers her hand to pull him up.)

Mulder! Mulder, here! Quick, grab my hand! Come on! Just a little...

(Before he can do so, Tooms, growling, grabs his ankle and pulls him back into the hole. Mulder struggles to not get pulled in. He kicks Tooms in the face and grabs Scullys hand. Scully pulls him up as Tooms struggles to get out. Mulder jumps forward and presses a button, turning the elevator on. Tooms screams and is dragged under. Blood rolls up on the stairs. Mulder and Scully watch as they recover from their ordeal.)



SCENE 19
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner looks at the file for Tooms. A picture and fingerprints are on a paper. He closes the file, which reads on the cover:

"Federal Bureau
Of
Investigation
Bureau file number: X 129202
Eugene Victor Tooms - Closed")

SKINNER: You read this report?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks towards the window. Skinner looks at him.)

Do you believe them?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Of course I do.



SCENE 20
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

(Mulder is looking at a caterpillar cocoon hanging off a branch. Scully walks up next to him.)

SCULLY: Okay, lets go.

MULDER: Its amazing how things change, isnt it?

(Scully looks at the cocoon.)

SCULLY: The caterpillar?

MULDER: No, a change for us. Its coming.

SCULLY: How do you know?

MULDER: A hunch.

(He walks away. Scully looks at the caterpillar, turns and follows.)

[THE END]


                                         BORN AGAIN



SCENE 1
14TH PRECINCT HOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK

(A car pulls up in front of the precinct house, and two detectives enter the building. One of them, Detective Rudy Barbala, greets Detective Sharon Lazard, who is at her desk.)

DET. BARBALA: What ho.

DET. LAZARD: What ho.

DET. BARBALA: Hey, Lazard. Now why do the night guys get a piece like you when we're stuck with old eel breath?

DET. LAZARD: It's fate, Detective, conspiring to keep us apart. All right, I'm outta here. (to Barbala) See ya. (to another co-worker) Tomorrow.

(She leaves the building and walks down the street. In an alley, she sees a little girl sitting alone near some trash bags. She enters the alley and walks toward the little girl.)

DET. LAZARD: You all right? You lost?

(The little girl doesn't respond at first, then nods.)

(Lazard and Barbala are walking through the station house.)

DET. LAZARD: Anyway, I got her in the holding room. She's not talking, she won't say a word ... at least not to me.

DET. BARBALA: (smiling) And you're asking me because you know how good I am with kids, right?

DET. LAZARD: (also smiling) Yeah, a regular Mr. Greenjeans.

(They enter the holding room, where the little girl, Michelle Bishop, is sitting at a table facing the window.)

DET. LAZARD: Hi. This is Detective Barbala. He's gonna help you find your parents.

DET. BARBALA: Hi ya sweetheart. What's your name?

MICHELLE: Michelle.

DET. LAZARD: Everything's gonna be all right. OK? Don't be scared now.

(Lazard leaves the room, closing the door behind her. Barbala moves around the table and sits facing Michelle, his back to the window.)

DET. BARBALA: Michelle what? (she stares at him but doesn't respond at first) Well, you said your first name was Michelle, now what's your last name?

MICHELLE: Bishop.

DET. BARBALA: (writing on his note pad) Bishop. Michelle Bishop. And where do you live, Michelle? Here in Buffalo?

(She stares at him again. Moments later, we see something crashing through the window. A loud crash is heard in the precinct house.)

VARIOUS IN PRECINCT HOUSE: What was that? Did you hear that?

(Lazard runs back to the holding room and enters. She sees the broken window and approaches it.)

MAN FROM STREET BELOW: Somebody call an ambulance!

(She looks out the window and sees a body lying on the roof of a car below. She turns to look at the little girl, who stares back at her.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Outside the station house, news crews and police cars surround the scene. Inside, Lazard talks with Mulder and Scully.)

MULDER: How'd you hear about us?

DET. LAZARD: My brother. My, uh, my brother's a cop. Baltimore. He told me about your work on the Tooms case, said you gotta good feel for things out of the ordinary. (Mulder and Scully exchange a brief glance) Look, the truth is Barbala never won any popularity contests here at the one-four, but he's, he's still a cop, you know. I guess that's why I can't just let this rest.

SCULLY: You said there was one witness, a little girl. What did she say happened?

DET. LAZARD: She said there was another man in the room.

SCULLY: Well, it stands to reason that somebody ...

DET. LAZARD: I was right outside. I'm telling you, there was nobody else there except for Barbala and the kid.

(They start walking through the station house.)

MULDER: So you didn't get a description of who the kid saw?

DET. LAZARD: I'm telling you, there was no one else. Listen. The department is treating this as a suicide, but I gotta tell you. I knew this guy. There's no way he did himself.

SCULLY: Was he depressed or under psychiatric care of any kind?

DET. LAZARD: No. Only time he ever looked at himself was in the mirror. And he always liked what he saw.

(They've reached the holding room. Mulder walks toward the window.)

MULDER: Plus jumpers tend to open the window before they jump. Where's the kid now?

DET. LAZARD: She was released about an hour ago. Her mother came to pick her up.

SCULLY: You don't really think the girl had anything to do with it, do you?

DET. LAZARD: I don't know what to believe any more. You know, eight years I've been on this force, I've seen a lot of strange things. But I'm telling you ... this kid ... something's just not right about her.

(At the Bishop residence, Michelle is sitting next to Harry Linhart, an FBI technician. He is developing a sketch on a computer based on her description. Mulder stands behind them.)

LINHART: Did he have long hair or short hair?

MICHELLE: Short.

(Linhart hits a key, and the face on the computer fills in short hair.)

MULDER: Like that? (she nods) Was his hair dark like mine or lighter like yours?

MICHELLE: Like mine.

(Linhart types some more and the hair color lightens.)

LINHART: What about a beard or a moustache?

MICHELLE: Moustache.

(Mulder whispers something in Linhart's ear and he nods.)

LINHART: Like this? (a very long, pointed moustache appears on the screen; Michelle smiles) Or this?

(The moustache curls at the ends into a handlebar moustache. Michelle laughs. Suddenly the computer monitor flashes and the screen shows a man with a normal mustache.)

LINHART: Whoa! What happened? Weird. I didn't even hit a key. Must be a glitch in the new software.

MULDER: Michelle? Was his mustache like that? (she nods)

(Meanwhile, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are talking in the living room.)

SCULLY: Do you have any idea how your daughter might have gotten there? Buffalo's half an hour away by train and the station is a five minute car ride.

MRS. BISHOP: When I came home, Mrs. Dougherty was locked in the wine cellar. I called the police immediately.

SCULLY: And Mrs. Dougherty is?

MRS. BISHOP: Michelle's nanny. The latest, that is. She's already gone through four this year, and it's only April.

SCULLY: What seems to be the problem?

MRS. BISHOP: Michelle is the problem.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

MRS. BISHOP: As hard as it is for a mother to admit ... Michelle is a disturbed child. Oh, I know this sounds terrible to say, but the truth is that sometimes she frightens me.

SCULLY: Frightens you how?

MRS. BISHOP: She's not like other girls, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Tell me.

MRS. BISHOP: She just isn't. She doesn't have any friends. She hardly ever smiles. It breaks my heart that I can't comfort her. She says she sees things that I can't see. She hears people yelling in her head.

(They've stepped outside and are walking next to a covered swimming pool.)

MRS. BISHOP: Last summer we had to cover our pool. Jim was trying to teach her how to swim, but every time that Michelle would get close to the water, she would just start to scream - scream like you've never heard in all your life.

SCULLY: Your husband? Where is he now?

MRS. BISHOP: We're divorced.

(Mulder comes out of the house carrying the finished sketch.)

MULDER: Mrs. Bishop?

MRS. BISHOP: Um-hmm.

MULDER: (showing her the sketch) This is the man Michelle says she saw at the police station. Do you recognize him?

MRS. BISHOP: No, I'm sorry.

MULDER: She also mentioned a friend ... someone named Sheila. Do you know who that is?

MRS. BISHOP: That would be Dr. Braun. She's the developmental psychologist over at Brylin Hospital. Michelle sees her twice a week.

(Mulder looks up to see Michelle looking at them from an upstairs window. She tosses something out and it flutters to the ground next to them. Mulder picks it up - blue paper folded in the shape of a bird.)

MULDER: Look at that? Looks like a hawk or a falcon.

SCULLY: It's beautiful.

MRS. BISHOP: It's called origami.

MULDER: Japanese paper folding. Where'd she learn how to do that?

MRS. BISHOP: I have no idea.

(Out front, Linhart has his computer equipment in the back of a car. He feeds the sketch into a fax machine as Mulder and Scully approach.)

MULDER: So Harry, you'll put that face into the system?

LINHART: As we speak.

MULDER: Can you give Scully a ride back into the city?

SCULLY: Wait a minute. We have an autopsy at 7.

MULDER: That's your department. I'm gonna go over to Brylin Hospital, see if I can have a little chat with Michelle's shrink.

(He starts away but stops and turns back to her.)

MULDER: Oh, oh, and check for burns or lesions on Barbala's body.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: Psychokinesis is usually associated with an electrical charge.

SCULLY: Are you saying Michelle possesses the ability to psychically project her own will?

MULDER: How else could a 60-pound kid throw a 200-pound detective out the window?



SCENE 3
BRYLIN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL,
BUFFALO, NEW YORK

(Mulder talks to Dr. Sheila Braun in her office.)

DR. BRAUN: (handing the sketch back to him) Nope. I don't recognize him. I have no idea who this man is.

MULDER: Could Michelle have fabricated him?

DR. BRAUN: Quite possibly. As with many dissociative disorders, the intensity of the patient's emotions is often too much for one personality to process. So in defense, part of the personality splits itself off.

MULDER: As in schizophrenia?

DR. BRAUN: I'm afraid Michelle's diagnosis is not quite that simple. You see, my primary challenge has been to discover the source of her extreme rage. In most cases, it's a traumatic event in the patient's past.

MULDER: And in Michelle's case?

DR. BRAUN: (sighs and steps to a cabinet next to her desk) Occasionally, I would leave Michelle alone for part of our session - with this doll. (opens the cabinet, which has several identical dolls on a shelf) Each time a new doll, anatomically intact. (she hands one to Mulder) And each time, she dismembers and disfigures it in exactly the same way. (the doll is missing an arm and an eye) First I thought she was being abused, but after a number of sessions with her parents, I became convinced that there was something else behind Michelle's anxiety. Something much deeper, much more elusive.

MULDER: Any theories?

DR. BRAUN: Frankly, no. I'm at a loss.

MULDER: Have you tried deep regression hypnosis?

DR. BRAUN: I've found hypnosis an unreliable approach at best.

MULDER: OK. Well, in the meantime, how have you been treating Michelle?

DR. BRAUN: Well, the thorazine has been quite effective in regulating her more bizarre behavior.

MULDER: I'm sure. Have you observed any unexplained phenomena in Michelle's presence?

DR. BRAUN: Unexplained phenomena?

MULDER: Inordinate physical strength, psychic ability, telekinesis...

DR. BRAUN: You're joking, of course.

(He shakes his head. She looks at her watch.)

DR. BRAUN: I have a patient waiting, Agent Mulder. If you'll excuse me.

(Scully is performing an autopsy on Barbala. A photographer works with her.)

SCULLY: Note postmortem examination is being conducted 11 hours and 45 minutes after subject was pronounced. (she sees a large red area on the body's lower chest) Note raised lesion approximately 7 centimeters below sternum. Deep necrosis inconsistent with cause of death as pronounced by Dr. Gilder, and suggests localized electrocution ... but a further tissue analysis will be necessary.

(Lazard sticks her head through the door, looking none too eager to come any further into the room.)

DET. LAZARD: Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a second?

SCULLY: I just started the autopsy.

DET. LAZARD: Yeah. Um, I don't think he's going anywhere.

SCULLY: (to photographer) Will you, uh, take a couple for scale, please. Thank you. I'll be right back.

(She steps out to speak with Lazard, who hands her the sketch along with a photograph of a man.)

DET. LAZARD: So what do you think?

SCULLY: Looks like a match.

DET. LAZARD: Yeah. Name's Charlie Morris. Officer Charlie Morris. Used to work narcotics out at the two-seven.

SCULLY: Do you know him?

DET. LAZARD: No. Before my time.

SCULLY: Where is he now? Has he been transferred?

DET. LAZARD: You could say that. Agent Scully, this guy's been dead for nine years. Which means that little girl saw ... a ghost.



SCENE 4
14TH PRECINCT HOUSE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK

(Scully enters with a case file and walks toward Mulder, who is looking at Charlie Morris' photograph.)

SCULLY: He was killed in Chinatown - gangland style, allegedly by the Triads, although no arrests were ever made. Now Mulder, if you're gonna tell me that you think Michelle Bishop saw a poltergeist ...

MULDER: Hey, you're the one that found a lesion on Barbala's body. You said it could have been caused by an intense concentration of electrothermal energy.

SCULLY: "Could have been" being the operative phrase. Now, I'm not going to know for sure until the lab results are in, and even then ...

MULDER: Why is it still so hard for you to believe, even when all the evidence suggests extraordinary phenomena?

SCULLY: Because sometimes ...

(She starts walking across the room. Mulder follows.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: ... looking for extreme possibilities makes you blind to the probable explanation right in front of you.

(She has walked to a trophy case along the wall near the holding room. In it is a plaque with Charlie Morris' picture on it.)

SCULLY: This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw. She walked right by here and she saw the face of Charlie Morris ... which means that there weren't any ghosts flying around the precinct.

MULDER: You have the police report describing Morris' death?

SCULLY: Yeah, I have what's been declassified. Why?

MULDER: Does it describe how he was murdered?

SCULLY: Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit.

MULDER: Give me the grisly details.

SCULLY: His arm was severed just below the shoulder, presumably by a chainsaw, and his right eye was gouged out.

(Mulder walks to his briefcase and pulls out the doll that Dr. Braun showed him.)

MULDER: This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls in her shrink's office. Hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you say? Now before we discount anything, I think we should find out more about Charlie Morris. I got the address of his partner on the force. Hopefully, he can tell us something.



SCENE 5
FIORE RESIDENCE, KENMORE, NEW YORK

(Mulder and Scully drive up, then knock on the front door. A man answers.)

MULDER: Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI. Can we talk to you for a minute? Do you know this man?

(The man closes the door, unlatches the chain, and comes out onto the porch, closing the door behind him.)

DET. FIORE: You mind if we do this out here? Uh, I don't want to wake my wife.

SCULLY: Yeah, this won't take long.

DET. FIORE: Yeah, sure I know him. That's, uh, Charlie. Charlie Morris.

MULDER: You two were partners?

DET. FIORE: Yeah, we rode together his first nine months out of the academy.

MULDER: What can you tell us about the circumstances surrounding his death?

(Fiore looks back toward the house, then moves farther from the door, toward the end of the porch.)

DET. FIORE: That matter is still under investigation and so I can't comment on it.

SCULLY: Detective, we're under the direct authority of Captain Gershom at the 14th precinct.

DET. FIORE: 14th precinct? I never worked out of the one-four. What's all this about?

MULDER: Well, we believe that the death of Detective Rudy Barbala yesterday can be linked to the death of Officer Morris nine years ago.

DET. FIORE: Linked how? I thought this Barbala flipped his wig and jumped out of a window.

SCULLY: Did you know the detective?

DET. FIORE: By reputation. Look, what's all this got to do with Charlie?

MULDER: Well, that's what we need your help with. The police report said that Officer Morris was killed off-duty.

DET. FIORE: That's right. Best we can figure, it was some kind of payback.

MULDER: For what?

DET. FIORE: Well, around that time, the organized crime division was doing a major sweep in Chinatown.

MULDER: The Triads.

DET. FIORE: Yeah. Some very heavy busts went down against the Woo Shing Woo. A lot of smack never made it to the street. You can bet there were some pretty pissed off people playing Mah-Jongg that week.

MULDER: So you think that Charlie Morris was killed as a warning to back off?

DET. FIORE: I think they picked a cop - any cop - and they whacked him.

MRS. FIORE: (stepping out the front door) Who is it, Tony?

DET. FIORE: Oh, it's nothing to worry about, honey. Just some people from the FBI asking about a case I'm working.

SCULLY: Sir, would you mind ...

DET. FIORE: Hey, it's the weekend. You guys mind? You can get me at the squad, first thing Monday morning, OK?

SCULLY: Sure.

DET. FIORE: Good luck.

(He closes the door. Mulder and Scully walk down the steps and sidewalk toward their car.)

MULDER: Is it me or did we just get the brush-off?

SCULLY: Did you notice her hands?

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: He said she was sleeping, but her hands were dusted with baking flour.



SCENE 6
BUFFALO MUTUAL LIFE, MAIN OFFICE,
BUFFALO, NEW YORK

(Detective Fiore is pacing the floor, talking nervously with another man, Felder.)

FELDER: Not a big deal, all right? Don't jerk yourself around Tony. You're acting like a little bug.

DET. FIORE: They were FBI.

FELDER: So what?

DET. FIORE: They start sniffing around too much, they're gonna turn something up.

FELDER: Relax. They're just people like us, going through the motions.

DET. FIORE: Oh, yeah? Then how are they connecting Charlie to Barbala?

FELDER: And what do they know? Huh? Nothing.

DET. FIORE: Come on. We're going to Citibank right now.

FELDER: For what?

DET. FIORE: The safety box.

FELDER: And what should we do, Tony? Huh? Make a donation to the Little Sisters for the Poor?

DET. FIORE: Dump it somewhere.

FELDER: Tony. There's only two of us left now. That's over a million each.

DET. FIORE: Take it all, I don't care! Do your dream on the beach in Costa Rica or wherever the hell it is you want to do it.

FELDER: You think I like this? Selling disability insurance to morons? "Well sir, uh, excuse me, but what if you should break your neck on the shore on lose your leg in a car crash?" You listen to me, Tony. We agreed to wait ten years, and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

DET. FIORE: I listened to you once before and look what happened.

FELDER: Nobody - not me, not Barbala - wanted to see Charlie wind up like that. We were just trying to scare a little sense into him. It was an accident. End of story. And you better pull yourself together, Tony.

(That evening, Felder walks along a city street. An old woman comes out of an alley.)

OLD WOMAN: Excuse me, sir.

(He ignores her. He gets onto a bus. Later, the bus comes to another stop and he gets off at the door at the rear of the bus. He throws his scarf over his shoulder. The end of the scarf mysteriously rises and extends back into the bus, wrapping itself around the railing. When the bus door closes, Felder feels the tug around his neck.)

FELDER: Hey, what? Hey! Hey, open the door! Hey!

(The bus starts to pull away. Felder pounds the door and runs along with the bus.)

FELDER: Hey, open the door! Hey! Open the door! Hey! Open the door! Open the door! Hey! Open the door!

(The driver hears him shouting and sees him in his side rearview mirror. He hits the break, but the accelerator mysteriously floors itself. The bus picks up speed and Felder is now running at full speed.)

FELDER: Hey! Hey! Open the door! For God's sake! Help me!

(Felder can't keep up and falls, now being dragged by the bus. The driver still sees him and pumps the brake but the bus doesn't slow down and Felder screams. Finally the accelerator releases and the bus comes to a halt. The driver runs back to Felder. As he approaches, we see that Michelle Bishop is sitting on the bus just behind the door.)



SCENE 7

(Mulder, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are in the precinct house.)

MULDER: A patrol unit picked her up a few blocks away from the bus stop.

MRS. BISHOP: (crying) What's going on?

SCULLY: We don't know. All we know is that your daughter has witnessed two deaths in the past two days.

MRS. BISHOP: She's only eight years old. She couldn't have possibly done anything.

MULDER: Mrs. Bishop, no one is accusing Michelle of anything.

MRS. BISHOP: She's just a little girl.

SCULLY: Is there anything that you haven't told us? Is there anything at all that you can think of that might shed some light on what happened tonight?

MRS. BISHOP: No.

SCULLY: Well, this police station has a designated room at the Sheraton. An officer will take you and Michelle over there.

MRS. BISHOP: Why is this happening to us. Why?

(Scully puts a hand on her shoulder. Detective Lazard approaches and motions Mulder aside.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, excuse me.

(They step a short distance away.)

DET. LAZARD: Listen to this. You know that guy that bought it tonight - Leon Felder? Before he started peddling life insurance, he was a cop out of the one-four. Guess who his partner used to be? Rudy Barbala.

(Mulder and Scully are in a room at the precinct reviewing the case files. Mulder has written on a blackboard. Under "Precinct 27" he has Morris' and Fiore's names. Under "Precinct 14" are Felder's and Barbala's names.)

SCULLY: Four cops.

MULDER: Three of whom are now dead.

(He crosses through the names of Morris, Felder and Barbala and circles Fiore's.)

SCULLY: Their only connection being a drug bust in Chinatown almost nine years ago.

MULDER: And a little girl from Orchard Park.

(He looks at a photo of a half dozen officers surrounding a cache of money from a bust and points out individual officers.)

MULDER: Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder. What's wrong with this picture?

SCULLY: Well, for one thing Fiore said he only knew Barbala by reputation.

MULDER: Right. Why would he say that?

SCULLY: I don't know.

(Scully pages through the file, looking puzzled.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: There's a page gone from Morris' homicide file. Wonder where it could be?

MULDER: Is there a log sheet?

SCULLY: Should be. Yeah. (she reads from the log sheet on the file folder) Tony Fiore - checked out this afternoon.

(Scully and Mulder are back at Detective Fiore's residence. She knocks and Mrs. Fiore answers.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour, but is your husband home?

MRS. FIORE: No, he's not. He never came home last night.

MULDER: May we come in?

(Mulder looks around in the living room. He sees a salt-water aquarium with a "diver" giving off bubbles at the bottom. He also sees a cabinet with a number of origami figures of animals. There is a painting of animals on the wall behind it.)

MULDER: Scully. Look familiar?

(Mrs. Fiore enters with coffee.)

MRS. FIORE: He said he was working a double shift, but when I called the precinct, he wasn't scheduled. It's just not like him not to call.

SCULLY: Does your husband have any family or close friends in the area that he might go to if he were in trouble?

MRS. FIORE: I've been on the phone all night. Is he in any trouble?

SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, did your husband ever mention a detective by the name of Rudy Barbala or an ex-police officer named Leon Felder?

MRS. FIORE: I don't think so.

MULDER: Someone you might have had dinner with once, a friend of Tony's from work? A name you can't remember, anything?

MRS. FIORE: We don't normally socialize with other cops.

MULDER: Mrs. Fiore, I couldn't help noticing your origami collection. Did you do all these yourself?

MRS. FIORE: Oh, no, not me. No, that was Charlie's hobby.

MULDER: Charlie?

MRS. FIORE: My first husband. He was born in Japan, his father was stationed there.

SCULLY: Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner?

MRS. FIORE: Yeah. (Mulder and Scully exchange a glance) I was waiting for him to come home too, nine years ago. Just like this. He was working on a whole set, you know, from the painting. The only animal he never got to was the giraffe - see, right there behind the zebra.

(Mulder and Scully leave the Fiore house and walk down the street.)

MULDER: Michelle is eight years old, that means that she was conceived at roughly the same time that Officer Morris was killed.

SCULLY: Do me a favor, Mulder. Let me say it. Reincarnation.

MULDER: Metempsychosis, transmigration, reimbodiment, call it what you will.

SCULLY: All based on the coincidence that Michelle Bishop and Officer Morris both practice the obscure art of paper folding?

MULDER: Well, what about the composite drawing and the dolls and the fact that Michelle was witness to two deaths that can be tied to Charlie Morris?

SCULLY: So what, you think he's back like Peter Proud to avenge his murder?

MULDER: It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation is a basic tenet of many major religions.

SCULLY: That still doesn't explain how an eight-year-old girl can kill two grown men.

MULDER: Well, individuals with strong past-life memories often exhibit enhanced psychic abilities - ESP, telekinesis.

SCULLY: So where does that leave us?

MULDER: One short step away from proving the pre-existence of the human soul.

(Michelle Bishop is being hypnotized by a Dr. Spitz. The session is being videotaped, and Dr. Braun is in the room with the two of them. Mulder, Scully and Mrs. Bishop are watching through a window from the next room.)

DR. SPITZ: On a count of five, tell me where you are now ... one ... two ... three ... four ... five. Do you know where you are?

MICHELLE: Yes.

DR. SPITZ: Where? Tell me where you are.

MICHELLE: At home.

DR. SPITZ: What time of day is it?

MICHELLE: Night time.

DR. SPITZ: And how old are you?

MICHELLE: Twenty-four. (she suddenly becomes agitated) No! We can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!

DR. SPITZ: What's wrong? What can't you do? (she doesn't respond but breathes rapidly) It's all right, you can trust me.

MICHELLE: No! I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't!

(Dr. Braun has come out of the room and angrily confronts Mulder.)

DR. BRAUN: This is dangerous and irresponsible!

MULDER: Dr. Spitz has conducted hundreds of these sessions and ...

DR. BRAUN: (to Mrs. Bishop) If you allow this to continue, you could push Michelle deeper into withdrawal, maybe permanently.

MULDER: Is it any more dangerous than pumping her full of thorazine?

MICHELLE: (from the other room) They're killing me! They're killing me!

(Mrs. Bishop heads for her daughter.)

MRS. BISHOP: That's enough!

MICHELLE: No! No! No!

MRS. BISHOP: (hugging Michelle) It's OK. It's over. It's over. It's over.

(Later, Scully comes out of the office, finding Mulder in the hall.)

SCULLY: They just left.

MULDER: We almost had it, Scully. We were right there.

SCULLY: I know.

MULDER: We'll have to try it again.

SCULLY: Mrs. Bishop won't go for that, not in this lifetime anyway.

MULDER: Well, we have to change her mind.

SCULLY: How? And to what end? I mean, what exactly do you hope to discover by all this?

MULDER: The truth. What really happened to Charlie Morris nine years ago.

SCULLY: We'll find the truth when we find Fiore.

MULDER: If we find Fiore. And if he's still alive. Scully, you saw what happened in there.

SCULLY: What I saw was some traumatized little girl who for no apparent reason has some connection to Charlie Morris.

MULDER: All evidence suggests that Michelle Bishop IS Charlie Morris.

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Short of her growing a moustache, how much more apparent does it have to become for you to accept it?

SCULLY: OK. Let's just say that, by some small miracle, you manage to convince Michelle's mother, and the next hypno-regression provides you with everything you could possible hope for. No grand jury is gonna listen to that kind of testimony. We still will not have an actionable case.

(Both are annoyed. Scully walks away.)

(Mulder is writing in his case journal. The video of Michelle's hypnosis session is playing on a monitor.)

MULDER: (voice-over) The inconclusive results of Michelle's past life regression do not shake my basic belief in hypnosis as a tool for psychological healing. Whether or not it offers us definitive proof of previous lifetimes is another matter. However, in this particular case, all other explanations seem to be even more wanting.

(He glances up at the monitor.)

ON VIDEO: And how old are you? Twenty-four. No, we can't! We can't do this! It's wrong! What's wrong? What can't you do?

(Mulder has noticed a burst of static just as Michelle become agitated. He rewinds and looks again.)

ON VIDEO: And how old are you? Twenty-four. No we can't!

(He sees the static again, just before Michelle says "no we can't". He rewinds.)

ON VIDEO: Twenty-four.

(He advances the tape frame-by-frame, isolating the static-filled image.)

(At the Fiore residence, Mrs. Fiore is on the phone.)

MRS. FIORE: (to phone) No, no, I, I, I want to be here. In case he shows up. Thanks again. I'll, uh, I'll call you the minute I hear anything. OK, yeah, OK, bye-bye.

(She hangs up, turns off the light and heads upstairs for the night. As she nears the top, she hears a knock on the door and hurries to it.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony! (she opens the door) Tony? Tony?

(No one is there. She looks down and finds an origami figure of a giraffe on the porch.)



SCENE 8
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, BUFFALO, NEW YORK

(Linhart is working in front of a series of video monitors. Scully and Mulder are behind him.)

LINHART: I checked the windup profiles. They're up to speed.

SCULLY: Which means?

LINHART: Whatever this image is, was recorded in the room with that girl.

SCULLY: How is that possible?

MULDER: There was a documented case in the early seventies of a man from Porlock, Ohio, who could influence undeveloped film. He could create shapes on the negative from his mind.

LINHART: I don't know how much of this noise I can clean up. It depends on the strength of the latent image.

(Lazard enters.)

DET. LAZARD: I tracked him down. He's retired in Palm Beach. You were right, Agent Scully. He backed up all his records on disk.

SCULLY: Pathologists are paranoid by nature.

DET. LAZARD: Well, he faxed me the missing page from the autopsy report.

SCULLY: Great. (reads it) Apparently, Charlie Morris did not die as a result of his wounds. Says here there's a frothing of fluid in the respiratory tract. That indicates death by drowning.

MULDER: So you're saying he was drowned first and then mutilated to make it look like a signature execution?

DET. LAZARD: Dr. Yamaguchi said on the phone that there were no signs of submersion such as goose skin or wrinkled flesh except for around the face and head.

SCULLY: Um-hmm. That's right. Suggesting that he was killed in either a bathtub or a toilet. Except ...

MULDER: Except for what?

SCULLY: The marked bradycardia. That indicates a raised plasma sodium level. He was killed in sea water.

(A car screeches to a halt in front of the Fiore residence. Detective Fiore emerges carrying a tote bag. He runs into the house.)

DET. FIORE: Anita! Anita!

MRS. FIORE: (rushing downstairs and hugging him) Tony! Tony! What's going on? Where've you been? I know something's going on.

DET. FIORE: I need you to listen to me right now. I need you to go upstairs and pack a bag.

MRS. FIORE: Why? What kind of trouble are you in?

DET. FIORE: I think someone's trying to kill me.

MRS. FIORE: Who?

DET. FIORE: I don't know.

MRS. FIORE: Why would anybody want to kill you? Tell me what's going on.

DET. FIORE: (angrily) Will you please just do what I'm asking you? (calms down) Please, I'm your husband and I love you and I need you to trust me on this, OK?

(He goes upstairs. Through the window we can see Michelle Bishop on the front porch.)

(Linhart is still working on the image from the video.)

LINHART: Almost there. (Mulder and Scully walk toward him) What I've done is to map the frequencies of the interference. Coefficients for sine on this monitor, cosine on that one. Now using an algorithm program, I can remove the frequencies, like this. Presto! What the hell?

(The image clears up, showing a diver in a pressure suit with helmet. Mulder recognizes it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what is it?

MULDER: You said salt water, right?

SCULLY: Right. So?

MULDER: So Charlie Morris was drowned in his own tropical fish tank, and that's the last thing he saw before he died. We better hope Michelle Bishop is at home, tucked in bed.

(At the Fiore residence, Detective Fiore is packing some clothes, and we see that the tote bag is full of money. Mrs. Fiore enters the room and he quickly zips up the bag.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony? Tony, somebody, somebody left this on our doorstep tonight. (shows him the origami giraffe) Do you know who? (he doesn't reply) Answer me, Tony!

(The lights go off. Fiore draws his gun.)

DET. FIORE: Right, you stay here and keep the door closed.

(He closes the door. The key in the lock mysteriously turns, locking the door.)

(He comes downstairs slowly, gun raised. As he steps across the living room, an electrical cord unplugs itself from the wall and quickly wraps around his legs, tripping him to the floor. He drops his gun onto the floor in front of him. Mrs. Fiore hears the commotion.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Tony, are you all right? Tony, answer me!

(Fiore reaches for the gun, but it slides farther away from him, out of reach. He looks up and sees Michelle standing in front of him.)

(Mulder and Scully pull up in front. They hear a crash from inside the house and run up to the porch. Mulder tries the door but it slams and locks in his face. They hear Mrs. Fiore.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Tony! Tony, please! Who's there? What's happening?

(Mulder walks across the porch to the window but the shutters slam closed in his face.)

(Inside, Michelle looks around the room and glass shatters and other items go crashing to the floor.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Scully has called Mulder to the side of the house, where there is a door to the basement with a glass window. They shield their eyes, and Mulder breaks the glass with his elbow, reaches in and unlocks the door.)

(Back in the living room, Detective Fiore has gotten to his knees in front of Michelle.)

DET. FIORE: (emotionally) They said they were just gonna talk to you. Talk some sense into you. What was I supposed to do, huh? All you had to do was take the money, man! Why didn't you just take the money?

(Michelle looks aside, and a fireplace poker hurtles across the room, catching Fiore a glancing blow. He falls over and moans in pain. Several vases fly across the room and break across his head as well.)

(Mulder and Scully have climbed the stairs from the basement to the main floor.)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) What's going on, Tony? Let me out!

MULDER: (to Scully) Go check out upstairs. (she heads up the stairs)

MRS. FIORE: (from upstairs) Please open the door! I'm scared! Tony!

(More objects are flying off cabinets in the living room as Mulder enters. He sees Michelle with Fiore on the floor.)

MULDER: Michelle! This won't make right what happened.

MRS. FIORE: (from the upstairs bedroom) Please, I can't get out! Who's there? I can't get out!

(Scully unlocks the bedroom door, and they both then run down to the living room. Mrs. Fiore rushes to her husband and sees Michelle. She kneels on the floor behind him.)

MRS. FIORE: Tony! Tony! Tony ...

(Fiore starts to look back at her, then just looks downward at the floor.)

DET. FIORE: (to Mrs. Fiore) I'm sorry! I knew what they did to Charlie. I was a part of it and I never said anything. I couldn't.

MRS. FIORE: No.

DET. FIORE: (now looking back at her) I just wanted to take care of you. Who else would have taken care of you?

(The room is filled with a bluish light and the aquarium shakes. Glass in the room shatters and plaster flies off.)

DET. FIORE: Oh, God. No. No more.

MRS. FIORE: (to Michelle, pleadingly) Please, please don't hurt him any more.

(Michelle looks quickly at the aquarium, and its walls shatter, sending water to the floor. The lights come back on. Scully walks across and picks up Fiore's gun. The diver ornament from the aquarium is on the floor nearby.)

(Some time later, Mulder and Mrs. Bishop walk alongside her pool. Michelle is laughing and playing in the pool with a friend and an instructor. Mrs. Bishop smiles as she watches the scene, and Mulder has traces of a smile as well.)

MULDER: (voice-over) Closing entry, file number X-40271. Detective Anthony Fiore pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court to charges of first-degree murder after the fact, grand larceny and obstruction of justice. The deaths of Detective Rudy Barbala and former police officer Leon Felder are being ruled as accidental, although their complicity in the murder of Officer Charlie Morris has been definitively established. No charges were brought against Michelle Bishop, who today took her first swimming lesson. She claims no memory of the preceding events and both her mother and Dr. Braun have denied my request for a second past-life regression. End of field journal, April 19, 1994.

Agents of record: Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
Status: Unexplained.

SCENE 1
MAHAN PROPULSION LABORATORY,
WASHINGTON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, COLSON, WASHINGON

(A janitor, Roland Fuller, is cleaning the floor in a hallway. He swipes his badge through a reader and then enters a code on the keypad, but the door doesn't open. Another man, Dr. Keats, approaches as Roland tries it again, unsuccessfully. Impatiently, the man grabs the badge from Roland.)

DR. KEATS: Here, let me do it. Put your number in, then your card. What's your number, Roland?

ROLAND: 315.

(Keats punches in the code and then swipes the card through the reader. The door opens.)

DR. KEATS: See how easy it is?

(As Keats enters, a jet engine is running in a wind tunnel. Drs. Nollette and Surnow are in front of the controls.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Engine efficiency?

DR. SURNOW: 94%.

(The mach indicator climbs above 13.0.)

DR. NOLLETTE: We need more. How's the backpressure holding?

DR. SURNOW: What do you think? It's climbing.

DR. NOLLETTE: Increase the blade inclination. I said, increase the blade inclination!

DR. SURNOW: The inclination of the blade is pi over 9. We've reached maximum velocity.

(Surnow reaches for a switch on the controls but Nollette grabs his hand.)

DR. NOLLETTE: No. Let it go! It will work!

DR. SURNOW: The engine's going to destroy itself! I'm not going to do that!

(Surnow hits a key on the keyboard. The engine starts to wind down.)

DR. NOLLETTE: It's not going to destroy itself. Come on, we're almost there!

DR. SURNOW: There's something wrong with our equation.

(The engine continues to wind down as Keats approaches from behind.)

DR. KEATS: What happened?

DR. NOLLETTE: Nothing. Because Surnow pulled the plug.

DR. SURNOW: I'm just protecting the baby ... and four years of work, Frank!

DR. NOLLETTE: Four years of work that's going to add up to zilch, because unless we show some progress, they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.

(Nollette leaves.)

DR. KEATS: He's right, you know. We should have continued with the test.

DR. SURNOW: Somebody's going to crack Mach 15, and I want that someone to be us. I'm not going to jeopardize everything just because you two guys can't wait to see your name in print!

DR. KEATS: It's the print that gets the money, Ron.

DR. SURNOW: If you want to go down in flames together, fine. You go ahead. I'm gonna do the math.

(Keats leaves.)

ROLAND: Good night, Dr. Keats.

(Surnow is writing an equation on a whiteboard while Roland cleans the floor. Surnow then hits a key and the door to the wind tunnel opens. He steps in and opens an interior panel to get at the controls. Roland goes to the keyboard and hits a key. The door to the wind tunnel closes with Surnow still inside.)

DR. SURNOW: What the hell?

(He looks through a window and sees Roland at the keyboard.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland, open the door. Open the door. Roland, I want you to listen to me very carefully. We have to open this door, Roland. Stop typing, Roland!

(Roland has continued typing at the keyboard, and the inlet vanes for the wind tunnel open. Then the engine starts and the wind velocity begins to climb.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland, open the door! What are you doing? Open the door!

(The mach indicator approaches 1.0, and Surnow's clipboard is carried into the engine by the wind.)

DR. SURNOW: Roland! Are you listening?

(Roland stops typing and moves to the whiteboard, as Surnow struggles against the wind to the inlet end of the tunnel. Roland erases the equation that Surnow had written. Surnow hooks his fingers on the metal grating at the end of the tunnel as the wind lifts his feet. Surnow screams as the mach indicator passes 3.0. Roland starts writing his own equation on the whiteboard. The mach indicator passes 4.0, and Surnow is now horizontal, hanging onto the screen and screaming. Roland finishes writing the equation, and the mach indicator approaches 7.0. As Roland walks back to the keyboard, through the window Surnow is seen flying down the tunnel toward the jet engine. There is a squishing noise. Roland resumes cleaning the floor.)

SCENE 2

(Mulder and Scully walk down the hallway leading to the wind tunnel control room.)

MULDER: How was the wedding?

SCULLY: You mean the part where the groom passed out or the dog bit the drummer?

MULDER: Did you catch the bouquet?

SCULLY: May-be. (looking at a folder in Mulder's hand) So is that what you couldn't talk to me about over the phone?

MULDER: (handing her the folder) The project that everyone says doesn't exist, does exist.

SCULLY: (reading the label on it) The Icarus project?

MULDER: The next generation in jet engine design, capable of doubling current supersonic speeds using half the fuel. At least in theory.

SCULLY: And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist who worked on it here at the university.

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: How close are they?

MULDER: I'm not sure, but Surnow is the second scientist on the team to die in the last six months.

SCULLY: OK, but how is this an X-file? Mulder, you don't think this has anything to do with UFO technology?

MULDER: There's something unexplainable here, Scully, but it's certainly not unidentifiable.

(They enter the control room.)

MULDER: (to a man inside the door) Keats?

MAN: (pointing at Keats) There.

MULDER: Dr. Keats? We're with the FBI. I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. (Mulder flashes his badge and they shake hands) We understand you discovered Dr. Surnow this morning.

DR. KEATS: What was left of him.

(They walk into the wind tunnel, where several other scientists, including Nollette, are inspecting the engine.)

SCULLY: How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel?

DR. KEATS: Someone must have shut him in. The door can only be opened or locked from in there.

SCULLY: By computer?

DR. KEATS: We've already been through this with the police. How many times do we have to rehash it?

SCULLY: Another member of your team died a short time ago. Isn't that correct?

DR. NOLLETTE: (walking over to them) Yes. Arthur Grable. He was killed in an automobile accident in November. I'm Frank Nollette. I'm also on the project.

(He shakes hands with Mulder and Scully.)

SCULLY: Are you certain it was an accident?

DR. KEATS: What are you driving at?

(Mulder exits the wind tunnel.)

SCULLY: Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial espionage.

(Keats and Nollette exchange glances. Mulder is in the control room, looking at the whiteboard, which has several equations written on it.)

MULDER: (pointing at the bottom line) Who wrote this?

(The other three join Mulder in the control room.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Ron was working on it when I left.

MULDER: You see, the handwriting here doesn't seem to match any of the other handwriting on the board.

DR. KEATS: It isn't mine.

MULDER: (checking the folder) What about Roland Fuller?

DR. NOLLETTE: Uh, Roland's the, uh, janitor.

MULDER: Well, according to the police report, he was the only other person here last night.

DR. KEATS: Roland didn't do that.

SCULLY: How do you know?

DR. KEATS: Let's just say Roland isn't exactly a rocket scientist.



SCENE 3
HERITAGE HALFWAY HOUSE, COLSON, WASHINGTON

(Roland is licking and applying adhesive stars to a poster that has "Tracy" written on it. He pushes it across the table to Tracy.)

ROLAND: Here.

TRACY: "Tracy."

ROLAND: With stars.

MRS. STODIE: (walking in with Mulder and Scully) Roland? There are some people here would like to talk with you.

ROLAND: Uh-oh. I went off the paper. Sorry.

MRS. STODIE: That's all right, Roland. Tracy, would you like to come help me in the TV room?

TRACY: OK.

(Mrs. Stodie and Tracy exit.)

MULDER: Hi, Roland. Do you mind if we sit down?

ROLAND: OK.

MULDER: Thanks. You mind if we ask you a couple of questions? Do you remember working last night?

ROLAND: Uh-huh.

SCULLY: Do you remember seeing anything unusual? Seeing any strangers? (Roland shakes his head.) Did, um, did Dr. Surnow or Dr. Keats or Dr. Nollette do anything unusual?

ROLAND: Nope.

SCULLY: You must like stars.

ROLAND: One hundred and forty-seven.

SCULLY: Sorry?

ROLAND: (pointing at Scully's blouse) Stars.

(Scully looks down at her blouse, which has stars on it.)

MULDER: You like numbers, too.

(Roland has a sudden vision in which Dr. Keats' head is frozen. He reacts violently, pushing the container of stars off the table. He runs around and starts to gather them. Scully comes around to help.)

SCULLY: Roland, let me help you.

ROLAND: (as he picks up the stars) One, two, three, four, five ...

(Mulder looks down at a piece of paper that Roland was working on. It has the number 15626 written on it in several places.)

ROLAND: ... six ...

MRS. STODIE: (entering the room) Roland.

ROLAND: ... seven ...

MRS. STODIE: Is everything ok?

ROLAND: ... eight, nine ...

(Mulder folds and pockets the piece of paper.)

MRS. STODIE: Roland, are you all right?

ROLAND: ... ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen ...

MRS. STODIE: What happened?

ROLAND: ... fourteen ...

MRS. STODIE: What did you say to upset him so?

ROLAND: ... fifteen, sixteen, seventeen ...



SCENE 4
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

(Mulder and Scully are consulting with a handwriting analyst, who has the whiteboard writing displayed on the wall with an overhead projector.)

ANALYST: It's definitely the work of a fourth and distinct individual. Dr. Surnow's, Dr. Keats', and Dr. Nollette's cursive standards don't match what you found on the whiteboard.

MULDER: Would you do me a favor and try this?

(He hands the analyst the paper that he took from Roland.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: It's something Roland was doodling at the home.

SCULLY: You don't really think that Roland ...

MULDER: Besides Nollette and Keats, he's the only person we can prove was in the lab that night.

SCULLY: Yes, but we're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation. Roland Fuller barely has an IQ of 70.

MULDER: Well, you saw his facility with mathematics. Don't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities?

SCULLY: Yes, but even savants behave only as human calculators. I mean, they can perform certain functions but they can't tell you the value of anything or even the meaning of a number.

ANALYST: I hate to take sides, guys, but the bottom line is no. The terminal stroke on the 6, the roof on the 5 - I'm sorry. He didn't write it.

(Roland is tossing and turning in his sleep. He sees a fleeting vision of Dr. Keats struggling with someone. He awakens.)



SCENE 5
MAHAN PROPULSON LABORATORY, BUILDING 214

(Keats is working in the laboratory. He is listening to music through headphones as he sits at a terminal. The door to the lab opens and Roland enters. He sneaks up on Keats from behind and smashes his coffee cup over his head. He then drags the unconscious Keats over to a large container of liquid nitrogen and takes off the lid.

Wearing cryogenic gloves, he grabs Keats and tries to put his head down into the liquid nitrogen. Keats revives and struggles, but Roland grabs his hair and forces his head down into it. Seconds later, he lifts his frozen head out of the container and throws his body to the side. There is a shattering noise. As Roland walks away, there are pieces of Keats' head on the floor. Roland steps on what looks like an ear. There is the sound of typing on a keyboard.)



SCENE 6

(Scully and Mulder are at the scene of Keats' murder. On the floor is the usual outline of the body, except there is no head. There are a couple dozen "X" marks around the body as well as the outlines of several larger pieces. A policeman, detective and police photographer are also there.)

SCULLY: An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees will become frozen, exhibiting great tensile strength, but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact. Now, I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before ...

MULDER: I don't think they'll be performing this experiment on Beakman's World. (he walks over to the detective and points at the computer) Has this been dusted?

DETECTIVE: Treat yourself.

(Mulder sits at the terminal and pulls up a file directory. The directory shows the last two entries are KMAN.DOC and ARTHUR.DOC. Below is a password prompt.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully! Look at these files. KMAN, must be Keats. His file was turned off at 12:31 last night.

SCULLY: But look, someone else entered a file under the name Arthur after 12:31.

MULDER: And worked on it for nearly 5 hours.

SCULLY: Well, it couldn't have been Keats. Judging from the rigor of the body, he was dead around 12:30.

MULDER: So you're saying someone came in here, killed Keats, and then just did some work on an old Dr. Arthur Grable file?

(Scully tries to look at the file but gets an "access denied" message.)

SCULLY: Well, I can't access the ARTHUR file. We're gonna need the password.

MULDER: Try 15626.

(Scully looks puzzled but tries it. A graph of turbine entry temperature appears on the screen.)

SCULLY: How did you know that that ...

MULDER: This is Arthur Grable's work on the same fluid dynamics equation the others were working on. (he pages through other graphs) Look at all those entries. Someone has been continuing his work in the six months since he died.

SCULLY: How did you know what the password was?

(He shows her Roland's page of doodling that has 15626 written on it.)

(Roland is dreaming.)

[A small child stands on a porch in front of a woman who says "Wave bye. Wave goodbye." Another child, a twin of the first, is crying as a woman puts him into the back seat of a car. The woman's voice continues to say "Wave goodbye."]

(Roland awakens. He is in bed but wearing his work clothes. Mrs. Stodie enters.)

MRS. STODIE: Roland? Why did you sleep in your clothes last night? Well, let's get you dressed. You have visitors.

(Mulder and Scully walk in behind her.)

ROLAND: (to Mrs. Stodie) I'm not supposed to talk to them.

MRS. STODIE: Who told you that? Remember that talk we had about being shy. These are nice people, Roland.

(Mulder has ducked into Roland's closet.)

MULDER: Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do. (holds up a navy blue shirt with white patterns on it) I think this one would look stylin' today. What do you think?

ROLAND: The green one.

MULDER: The green one?

ROLAND: Please.

SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I talk to you a second? See you later, Roland.

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie leave the room.)

MULDER: (pulls out the green shirt) This one? Here you go. So you like your job at the college, Roland?

ROLAND: (putting on the shirt) Yes.

MULDER: I hear you're very good at it. You remember how you got your job?

ROLAND: A man talked to Mrs. Stodie.

MULDER: What man?

ROLAND: Dr. Grable.

MULDER: Was Dr. Grable nice to you?

ROLAND: Yes.

MULDER: When was the last time you spoke to him? Last week, the day before?

ROLAND: Dr. Grable died.

MULDER: I'm sorry.

ROLAND: Yeah. People die. They go away ... and they're not supposed to come back.

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie talk in another room. Lisa is cleaning the floor nearby.)

SCULLY: Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur?

MRS. STODIE: That was Dr. Grable's first name. But we only called him Dr. Grable. I doubt Roland even knew his first name was Arthur.

(Lisa has stopped cleaning and is eavesdropping.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy of Roland's file and past history?

MRS. STODIE: Our patients' histories are confidential.

SCULLY: I understand, but I have grounds to obtain them, and the less time we have to spend in court, the more time we have to help Roland.

(Mulder and Scully are sitting at a table in a library.)

MULDER: Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable. He went to the halfway house specifically to find a mentally challenged person.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that Arthur Grable hired Roland in order to use him? (Mulder arches his eyebrows) And are you suggesting that Arthur Grable is not dead?

MULDER: Well, if he had intentions of killing Nollette, Keats and Surnow, why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect?

SCULLY: Yeah, but by the look of this, (she holds up a photo of Grable's accident scene) he's hamburger.

MULDER: Maybe he staged it. That would explain why his work is continuing on, six months after his "death".

SCULLY: (reading from Grable's file) This obituary says that Arthur Grable was born in Seattle. His father was a big banker, his mother was active in a number of charities. Only child. Summa cum laude in physics. Doctoral and post-doctoral in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd. Brilliant future, tragically cut short.

MULDER: (reading from Roland's file) Roland's also from Seattle. He spent most of his life at the Heritage Halfway House. The identity of his parents has been sealed by the courts. There's very little information on Roland before the age of three. That's when he was put in the Heritage program.

SCULLY: Does it say when he was born?

MULDER: (flipping through some pages) July 15, 1952.

SCULLY: (also flipping through pages) That's also Arthur's birthdate.

(Tracy and Roland are at the halfway house, drawing. Roland is drawing an airplane.)

ROLAND: Don't you wish you could fly?

TRACY: I can ... when I dream. (walks over to him) People can do anything in a dream, you know. Once, one time I had a dream we were married and lived in a house. Do you have dreams, Roland?

(He looks agitated. Tracy kneels next to him.)

TRACY: You can tell me. Roland? Who's Arthur?

(Roland turns to her suddenly. He has a vision of pushing Tracy to the floor and choking her. He screams, pushes her aside and runs out of the room.)

TRACY: (crying) I'm sorry, Roland. I'm sorry!

(Roland has run upstairs and locked himself in the bathroom. He sits on the floor.)

TRACY: (knocking on the door) Roland! Roland.

ROLAND: (shouting) Go away!

(He has another vision of him choking Tracy.)

TRACY: Roland, what's the matter?

ROLAND: Go away! I don't want to hurt you. Go away! (Tracy is crying at the door) Go away.



SCENE 7

(Mulder and Scully are with Nollette in his office. Mulder points at a photo showing some "hippie" students in an office. There is a Volkswagen behind them.)

MULDER: Is that you?

DR. NOLLETTE: Yes.

MULDER: Cool 'do. What's the story here?

DR. NOLLETTE: (sighs) Um, a quantum physics professor of mine at Harvey Mudd flunked me. He challenged the tenets of one of my theories - a theory I later published in 'Nature'. Anyway, uh, to get back him, (laughs) one afternoon we decided to take his car apart and put it back together again in his office and left it running.

MULDER: (to Scully) Hmmm, an egghead classic.

DR. NOLLETTE: It was Arthur Grable's idea.

SCULLY: Is that Arthur Grable there, sitting on the chair?

(She's referring to a bearded man sitting in the foreground.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Yeah.

SCULLY: Was he a practical joker?

DR. NOLLETTE: On top of all his brilliance, he had a genius for executing elaborate schemes.

MULDER: Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 IQ is gaining access to and, uh, operating his old computer files?

DR. NOLLETTE: Arthur would still have to be alive.

SCULLY: Could he have faked his own death?

DR. NOLLETTE: No.

MULDER: The police report on the auto accident that killed Arthur Grable is woefully incomplete. The dry road surface, no mechanical problems found. The body was never admitted to the county morgue and there was no funeral.

DR. NOLLETTE: (standing) If, uh, you are trying to suggest that Arthur Grable killed Surnow and Keats and is after me next, you're way off. Art could not have done the murders.

SCULLY: How can you be so certain?



SCENE 8
AVALON FOUNDATION,
WASHINGTON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, COLSON, WASHINGTON

(Mulder and Scully are talking to a Dr. Barrington. They are looking at a stainless steel tank, numbered '18', that has a temperature indicator on it that reads -320F.)

BARRINGTON: This is Arthur Grable. Uh, because of the massive internal damage to his body caused by the car accident, we could only preserve the head.

SCULLY: Wouldn't your client find it somewhat inconvenient to be thawed out in the future, only to discover he had no functional mobility?

BARRINGTON: We believe that by the time science figures a way to revive our clients ...

MULDER: ... you'll also know how to clone new bodies for them.

BARRINGTON: Exactly. This technology is progressing faster than anyone thought possible. Ask anyone here at the university. So, while for us the passing of each second brings our bodies closer to death, for our clients it brings them closer to life.

(Mulder notices that the temperature indicator is fluctuating between -319 and -320.)

MULDER: These fluctuations in temperature - do they happen often?

BARRINGTON: No, we've had some problems with Dr. Grable's capsule, and the technicians have checked it for possible malfunctions but they found nothing.

MULDER: Is it possible the brain is causing the fluctuation?

BARRINGTON: No, but we are looking for the explanation. The patient's in no danger. He remains perfectly preserved as long as there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.

SCULLY: May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records? (he hands her a file) Thank you. Dr. Barrington, in your conception of future medical science, what requirements will exist to be an organ or tissue donor?

BARRINGTON: Same requirements as there are today, compatible genetic make-up. It's best if the donor's related.

(The temperature indicator fluctuates again and beeps. Barrington walks over to investigate. Scully calls Mulder over to her.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Arthur Grable put down only one donor.

(The form lists Roland Fuller.)

MULDER: Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday. I think they're twins.

(Mulder and Scully are working with a technician in front of a computer. They are altering a photo of Arthur Grable.)

TECHNICIAN: Older or younger?

MULDER: Same age, just less hairy and with better eyesight.

TECHNICIAN: Gotcha. And the moustache?

SCULLY: No, lose the whole beard.

(As the technician types, Arthur Grable's glasses disappear as well as his beard and moustache.)

TECHNICIAN: Next?

MULDER: Close cropped hair, with a slightly receding widow's peak. Lose the glasses.

(The face on the screen looks exactly like Roland.)

SCULLY: That's Roland.

MULDER: Give or take a few pounds.

(Mulder is talking to Roland at the halfway house.)

ROLAND: Tell me about your dreams, Roland. (he doesn't respond) It's all right, I won't tell anybody. (still no response) You know, I had a dream last night. I dreamt I was, uh, swimming in this pool. And I could see my father underwater, but when I dove down, the water stung my eyes. Then there was another man at the pool, watching me. He upset me. He was asking me questions I didn't want to answer. And I had to leave. I couldn't find my father.

ROLAND: I can't tell you my dreams.

MULDER: Why not?

ROLAND: Bad.

MULDER: (putting his hand on Roland's shoulder) Your dreams are bad, Roland. Not you. You're a good person.

ROLAND: I hit Tracy.

(Nearby, Tracy looks over at Roland.)

MULDER: Your dreams make you hit Tracy?

(He nods. Mulder sees a remote control spaceship toy on the shelf. He picks it up.)

MULDER: You know how to work this toy, Roland?

ROLAND: Yeah.

(Mulder puts the toy on the floor and gives the remote control to Roland. He operates the control and the ship scoots across the floor.)

MULDER: Now, you see the way you work that toy is like what's happening to you. You're the spaceship, Roland, and your dreams are the controls.

ROLAND: But who ... who runs the controls?

MULDER: (showing him a photo of Arthur Grable) Have you seen this man recently?

(Roland looks at the photo and reacts strongly. He sees visions of two small boys, twins, running out on a porch. One, crying, is loaded into a car, while the other stays on the porch. A voice says "wave bye-bye to Roland." He then sees the coffee cup being broken over Keats' head, Surnow flying toward the jet engine, Keats' frozen head and Tracy being choked. Roland screams and thrashes about in his chair.)

MULDER: (trying to calm him) Roland! Roland! Roland, stop!

(He runs out of the room, screaming. Tracy follows him.)

TRACY: Roland!

(Scully and Mrs. Stodie have heard the commotion and come out to see Tracy following Roland up the stairs. Roland locks himself in the bathroom again.)

TRACY: Roland! Roland!

MULDER: (heading upstairs with Scully and Mrs. Stodie) We need to arrange to keep Roland under observation.

TRACY: (at the bathroom door) Roland! Roland!

(Roland sees a vision of the bathroom window broken. Moments later, there is a crashing sound.)

MULDER: He's trying to get away.

TRACY: Roland! Roland!

(Mulder runs downstairs and out the door, looking for Roland.)

MULDER: Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland!

(He doesn't find him. Upstairs, Scully looks out the broken window.)



SCENE 9
MAHAN PROPULSION LABORATORY

(It is late evening. Mulder and Scully are in a hallway. He has just gotten off the phone.)

MULDER: Nollette's gone. We should arrange a security guard to find him.

SCULLY: Mulder, no one's gonna provide you with anything once you explain your theory on how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders.

MULDER: You've got a brother, don't you Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah. I've got an older one and a younger one.

MULDER: Well, have you ever thought about calling one of them all day long and then all of a sudden the phone rings and it's one of them calling you?

SCULLY: Does this pitch somehow end with a way for me to lower my long distance charges?

MULDER: I believe in psychic connections, and evidence suggests that it's stronger between family members, strongest of all between twin siblings that shared the same womb.

SCULLY: OK, maybe. But in this case, one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgesicle than he does to his own brother.

MULDER: Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of consciousness that no human has ever returned from. And what if that state allows one to develop psychic ability to a potential that the conscious mind is too preoccupied to explore or believe in? He could use that ability to control his brother to kill those scientists.

SCULLY: But why? He's been working with these colleagues for years.

MULDER: Well, that's a question that only Dr. Nollette can answer.

SCULLY: OK. Let's go. I have to call my brother.

(As they walk away, Nollette is watching them on a security TV monitor. He has heard their conversation. The monitor shows them walking down the hall.)

MULDER: We've got to find Nollette.

SCULLY: Let's talk to campus security.

MULDER: We go this way? (pointing straight ahead)

SCULLY: No, we go left.

(Mulder follows Scully.)

(Later, Nollette is at the Avalon Foundation.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Well, wherever you are, Arthur, I'm sure you'll appreciate this.

(Nollette wraps aluminum foil over a badge and swipes it through a reader. The door opens and he walks to Arthur Grable's tank. Using a pen, he punches buttons on the control panel. The temperature display begins to rise, up to -312 as Nollette leaves.)

(Back at the Mahan Propulsion Laboratory, Roland is writing, with both hands, on either side of a notebook. The temperature in Grable's tank reaches -307 and Roland reacts, looking slightly ill. He continues to write equations in the notebook.)



SCENE 10
FBI REGIONAL HEADQUARTERS, SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

(Scully and Mulder are reviewing the case. Scully reads from a file.)

SCULLY: Arthur and Roland Grable, born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr. and Mrs. Louis Grable on July 15, 1952. Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.

(She puts the file in front of him.)

MULDER: Identical twins.

SCULLY: Which means that they're the result of a single egg fertilized by a single sperm.

MULDER: I've read studies which suggest that in some cases the identical twin arises very early in the embryonic stage when a mutation in one cell is rejected by the other cells as foreign.

SCULLY: So that maybe Roland's condition is the result of a damaged chromosome rejected by one of Arthur's cells?

MULDER: In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius and Roland's strange mathematical gift.

SCULLY: In a way. (the phone rings) (to phone) Agent Scully.

BARRINGTON: (on phone) This is Larry Barrington at the Avalon Foundation. We've, uh, got a situation here.

(Barrington is talking on a cell phone. He is near Arthur Grable's tank, which now reads -168.

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

BARRINGTON: Last night we had a break-in at the facility. That's right. Yeah, it's Arthur Grable's storage unit. His internal thermostat's been compromised.

SCULLY: Was there any tissue damage?

BARRINGTON: We're trying to assess that now. The temperature's still rising. Something's blocking our access to the cooling program.

SCULLY: (hangs up) (to Mulder) Someone tampered with Arthur Grable's capsule. They're attempting to stabilize it now.

MULDER: Nollette?

(At the laboratory, Roland is operating the wind tunnel, typing rapidly on the keyboard. Roland is sweating. The temperature on Arthur Grable's tank continues to rise. The mach indicator hovers at 13.8 as Roland looks ill. He types some more on the keyboard and groans.)

ROLAND: What? What is it?

(He concentrates, and the temperature on Arthur Grable's tank goes from -158 to -161. He types again and the engine speeds up and the mach reading rises, to a high of 15.13. A bell sounds, and Nollette appears behind Roland.)

DR. NOLLETTE: "If I've seen further than other men, it's because I have stood on the shoulders of giants."

ROLAND: No. This isn't yours!

DR. NOLLETTE: It's amazing. There's this body, sitting there in front of me, talking. But you're controlling it, Arthur.

ROLAND: You ... took my work!

DR. NOLLETTE: What good was your work going to do you? You died before you could finish it, before you could publish it.

ROLAND: It was mine!

DR. NOLLETTE: And a brilliant piece of work, too. When I saw the writing on the whiteboard, I knew someone had found the key. Mach 15 was within our reach. Our futures were guaranteed. Ironic, isn't it? You did all the work, and I get all the glory.

ROLAND: (screaming) No!

(Nollette produces a gun from his pocket.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Yes. Yes, Arthur. I was here, working on the intake problem, moments away from a solution when you attacked me. (he backs Roland away and sits at the controls) Fortunately, I was carrying a gun. After the murder of my colleagues, who could blame me?

(Roland sees a vision of Nollette flying toward the jet engine.)

ROLAND: No!

(Nollette is looking at Roland's work on the computer screen and typing.)

DR. NOLLETTE: That's, that's interesting. (laughs) I've got it. That's it. I've got it.

(Roland picks up a nearby keyboard and hits Nollette with it, knocking him to the floor.)

(Mulder and Scully arrive outside the laboratory. They pound on the door and flash their badges, and a guard lets them in.)

(The wind tunnel door closes with Nollette inside. At the controls, Roland struggles, then types. Nollette revives in the wind tunnel just as the engine starts. He goes to the window and pounds on it, looking at Roland.)

DR. NOLLETTE: Arthur! Arthur, open the door! Arthur!

(Mulder and Scully are running through the halls. Nollette moves back toward the tunnel inlet as the Mach indicator reaches 1.0. Scully swipes a badge through the door and they enter as Nollette grabs the metal grating in the tunnel. Mulder goes to the controls but doesn't know how to operate them. The wind speed is over mach 3.0, and Nollette is now hanging horizontally to the grate.)

MULDER: (to Roland) Arthur, how do you stop this? Tell me how! Arthur!

(Scully moves between Roland and Mulder.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) Wait. (to Roland) Roland, we need you to help us. Please, we need you to help us to stop the machine.

(Roland is having flashbacks to the separation of the twins. A woman is saying "Bye-bye, Roland. Arthur, say goodbye to your brother.")

SCULLY: Try to remember how. Roland, you've got to help him or he's going to die.

(The tunnel is at mach 4.0. Nollette is barely hanging on. Roland has a flashback of the car carrying him away while the woman's voice says "Wave good-bye, Arthur." As the tunnel reaches mach 7.0, Roland goes to the keyboard but seems uncertain.)

MULDER: Come on, Roland.

ROLAND: I can't remember.

(He finally enters a command and the engine starts to slow just as Nollette loses his grip. He flies down the tunnel but lands several feet in front of the engine. Scully puts her hand on Roland's shoulder and gives him a reassuring nod.)

(The temperature of Arthur Grable's tank reaches -150 and an alarm goes off.)

(A Colson police car is in front of the halfway house.)

SCULLY: He'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation.

MRS. STODIE: Is he being charged with a crime?

SCULLY: The D.A. hasn't made that determination yet.

MULDER: But we've recommended that he be remanded to your custody as soon as the court deems it appropriate.

MRS. STODIE: How could this happen? Roland never exhibited any violent tendencies.

MULDER: It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition.

(Scully gives Mulder a stare.)

MRS. STODIE: What do you mean?

(Mulder opens a notebook and shows it to her.)

MULDER: This is the work of Arthur Grable, Roland's brother. It's a new theory of jet propulsion, unfinished at the time of his death. In the last two weeks, Roland has completed the calculations.

MRS. STODIE: How?

(Mulder is about to answer but Scully interrupts.)

SCULLY: We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie. All we know is that Roland was somehow able to finish his brother's research.

(Roland is folding a shirt and putting it into a suitcase. Tracy enters the room.)

TRACY: Roland? Where are you going? Roland, don't go.

ROLAND: I have to.

TRACY: OK. Fine.

(Hurt, she walks toward the door. Roland calls her back.)

ROLAND: Tracy. Wait.

(He picks up his jar of stars and hands it to her.)

ROLAND: Keep my stars.

(She starts to cry as he walks past her.)

TRACY: I love you.

ROLAND: Me too.

(He passes Mulder and Scully in the hall, giving them a gesture of good-bye. He stops in front of a mirror to bursh his hair and stares into the mirror before walking away.)

[THE END]


                                        THE ERLENMEYER FLASK


SCENE 1
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND

(A car speeds down a small hill in the road, followed by a police car with sirens blaring. The car goes up a short hill and catches a few feet of air before hitting the ground. The police car does the same. The car does a sharp left turn as it passes a train. The train honks its horn as the police car follows pattern. The man in the car looks in his rear-view mirror.)

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: About your request for assistance, Fifty, what is your present location? Unit Fifty, go ahead.

(The man in the passenger's side talks into the transmitter. The cars race through a gate into a shipworks.)

OFFICER #1: Suspect is now westbound. Has entered the shade of the shipworks off April Street. Unit Fifty still in pursuit, over.

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: A roger, Unit Fifty, I copy. Be advised when you are...

(A truck backs up and the man swerves around it. The officer looks to his partner, a heavy-set man, who slams on the brakes and swerves to a halt. They drive around the truck. The man drives into a pier area with a dead end. He smashes into some boxes, seeing the police behind him. The skinnier officer gets on the bullhorn.)

OFFICER #1: This is the police! Pull your vehicle over and step out! Stop your vehicle. Put your hands on the roof and freeze!

(He turns around and sees the car coming towards him. He gets out. Nearly stumbling over a box, he runs to the fence behind him and jumps up. The heavier officer hits him in the back of the knee with the nightstick, sending him falling.)

Hold it!

(The suspect tries to get up but is met with more nightstick shots to the back.)

OFFICER #2: Get down there!

OFFICER #1: On the ground! Do it!

(The fatter one continues to prod him with it.)

OFFICER #2: Did you hear me?

OFFICER #1: Face down! Do it!

OFFICER #2: Stay there! Get down!

(A second police car pulls up. The suspect shrugs off the last shot to the head and grabs the first officer's nightstick. He swings it into his kneecap, nearly shattering it. The officer goes down in pain. A third officer gets out as the man drives the nightstick into the fat officer's gut, then smashes him in the face with it. The cop flies back into some boxes. The third officer runs to their aid, only to be greeted with a blow to the chest. A fourth officer, a young man, gets out and aims his taser at the man, who looks on his shock. The two conductors fly out and hit the man on his chest. He simply looks at them and pulls them out, then runs up a flight of stairs for boats. Two more cars pull up.)

OFFICER #4: Stop! Armed officer!

(The fourth officer takes out his gun and shoots the man in the side. He flinches. The officer shoots at him again as the man jumps off the stairs and into the water an incredible distance. The fourth officer and another one run up and look at the rippling water.)

I hit him. I know I hit him. Where the hell did he go? He'd be bleeding bad.

(The fourth officer notices some strange green spots on the last step. They look at each other, confused.)

SCENE 2
SUNDAY, MAY 8, 1994

(Mulder is asleep on his couch. The TV is playing. Two scientists are talking in the show.)

MAN #1: ...off the coast of Italy.

MAN #2: But, but theirs is a very light larvae.

MAN #1: That's exactly what stumped me. Because inside there must be something, the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.

MAN #2: But, professor, that... that would be Icelandic peridotite.

MAN #1: Precisely.

MAN #2: There's a piece chipped off.

MAN #1: By me.

MAN #2: Well, what, what's the rock inside?

MAN #1: Icelandic peridotite, naturally.

(The phone rings. Mulder wakes up.)

When I saw this, I stopped chipping.

MAN #2: In a rock from Iceland?

(Mulder picks up the phone.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Deep Throat, at an unknown dark location.)

DEEP THROAT: Are you watching channel eight?

(Deep Throat hangs up. Mulder hangs up the phone and sits up.)

MAN #2: ...across the world.

MAN #1: What's your conclusion?

MAN #2: Science does not jump to conclusions. Science is not a guessing game...

(Mulder changes the channel to channel eight, where the news is on. They are at the pier where the man jumped in.)

FEMALE REPORTER: ...Shipworks, where a sixty-mile high speed car chase ended early this evening. The suspect eluded capture by leaping into the harbor but not before reportedly injuring several Ardis officers.

(Mulder takes a video tape and puts into the VCR, then presses record.)

We have Captain Roy Lacerio standing by. Captain? How was the man able to escape and how seriously injured were the officers involved?

LACERIO: Those details are still unclear, I'll be talking with several of the off...

(A man comes over.)

MAN: We need you, Captain.

LACERIO: I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

FEMALE REPORTER: Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense manhunt.

(Lacerio walks past a number of people, a few of which are not police officers and are wearing trenchcoats. Mulder rewinds the tape.)

Captain Roy Lacerio here being pulled away during an intense...



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(He pauses the tape.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through this tape a hundred times. What exactly are you hoping to find?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He presses a button on a machine and a picture prints out of the current shot. It is of the various men in trenchcoats as Lacerio walks by. He looks at the picture. A man in the front is very evident.)

SCULLY: And all he told you to was to watch channel eight?

MULDER: Yeah, that's all he said.

SCULLY: Do we even know why the suspect was being chased?

MULDER: As far as I can tell, he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.

SCULLY: Well, that ought to put him in the Ten Most Wanted list.

MULDER: There's got to be something here. Some detail. Something we're not seeing.

(He prints out a picture of the silver Ciera the suspect was driving. Scully looks at it.)

SCULLY: How do you know he's not just yanking your chain, this Deep Throat character?

MULDER: Why would he do that?

SCULLY: Well, he has lied to you by his own admission.

MULDER: I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here... something I was supposed to see. Something he wants me to see.

SCULLY: Then what are you missing?



SCENE 4
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND

(Lacerio looks at the picture of the various people as Mulder and Scully look at him. Various people talk to each other in the background. Lacerio gives the picture back.)

LACERIO: Well, I don't know if you were aware but there were three different law enforcement agencies out here last night.

MULDER: Hunting a man on a moving violation?

LACERIO: I know it's not "Silence of the Lambs," but it's what we do.

MULDER: The man in the photograph doesn't appear to be wearing a badge or a uniform. He's not one of yours?

LACERIO: No, sir. But like I said, it was a zoo out here.

MULDER: You say the suspect was shot.

(They look at a scuba diver falling backwards off of a boat, searching the water.)

Any explanation why the body hasn't been recovered?

LACERIO: Well, has you can see, we've got our search ongoing. Divers' down there in shifts. We're quite certain he'll be found.

MULDER: It's been almost eighteen hours, Captain. Where could the body be?

LACERIO: Well, there are cables and debris all over the bottom. It's a painstaking business. Can I ask what the F.B.I.'s interest in this case would be?

(Scully looks at Mulder.)

MULDER: The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive.

LACERIO: Really? How's that? No description of the suspect has been released.

(Mulder looks away, slightly embarrassed.)

MULDER: If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please?

LACERIO: It's been taken to impound.



SCENE 5
IMPOUND

(Scully looks at a folder as Mulder is sitting in the front seat of the car.)

SCULLY: The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg. They had no idea that the car was even missing. You know, Mulder, I think that we're wasting our time here.

(Mulder gets out.)

MULDER: I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find.

(He picks up the pictures, which he accidentally dropped, and moves to the front of the car.)

You can't make out the license plate in this photo.

(He leans up against the red van in back of him. He looks at the picture again, then at Scully, who is reaching through the car window.)

Hey, Scully, look at this.

SCULLY: What?

(She walks around to him.)

MULDER: Look at the car in this photo. Look at the windshield.

(She looks at the photo and sees there is a sticker on the windshield. The car in front of them does not have it.)

SCULLY: It's not the same car.

(Mulder shakes his head.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully looks at the picture of the windshield and the sticker under a magnifying glass.)

SCULLY: It's called a caduceus. It's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession.

MULDER: So, probably, only a doctor would have that on his car.

SCULLY: Mm-hmmm. (in agreement.)

(Mulder fast-forwards the tape frame-by-frame. The quality looks to be better.)

MULDER: I had the picture enhanced and the plate is different. "3-A-Y-F."

SCULLY: Fast-forward.

MULDER: That's all you can make out. The rest is obscured.

(Scully advances the tape frame-by-frame as Mulder picks up the phone and dials someone's number.)

Hey, Danny, it's Mulder. I need you to run a Maryland plate for me. All I got is a partial. Registered to a doctor. Or used to be. Yeah, I'll hold.

(He looks at Scully, who notices something on the tape.)

They switched cars on us, Scully, and they lied about it.

SCULLY: Why would they do that?

MULDER: Maybe the, uh, real owner of the car has got something to hide.



SCENE 7
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND

(Doctor Berube pours some reddish liquid into a container from an Erlenmeyer flask and closes the lid. His hands are in side a glass case with gloves on. Monkeys squeal in the back. Mulder and Scully walk in.)

MULDER: Doctor Berube?

BERUBE: Yes?

(Mulder walks over to him and shows him his badge.)

MULDER: We're with the F.B.I., can we have a minute of your time?

BERUBE: I'm actually very busy.

MULDER: I'm sorry. Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Arlis yesterday?

BERUBE: Excuse me?

MULDER: A silver Ciera, doctor. Do you own a silver Ciera?

BERUBE: Yes. It was used for what?

MULDER: A crime. Were you aware that it was even missing?

BERUBE: Not until you mentioned it. I have a housekeeper and she often uses the car.

(Scully looks at a monkey in a cage next to her.)

It's a second car...

(Scully taps the cage bars and the monkey lunges at her fingers. Scully pulls her hand away as Berube and Mulder look at her. Other monkeys start making noises again.)

Please! They should not be excited. Nothing should be touched.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly.

BERUBE: They're part of an experiment.

MULDER: What kind of experiment?

BERUBE: Am I under some kind of suspicion?

MULDER: No.

BERUBE: Then I think I've answered all your questions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have more work than time.

MULDER: Thank you.

(He and Scully walk out. They stop outside the door.)

Did he bite you?

SCULLY: No, but he tried to.

(Mulder looks at his watch.)

MULDER: Well, IT'S ALMOST 5:00. We should check with the doctor's housekeeper about the car while we're out here.

(He starts off.)

SCULLY: No.

(Mulder stops and looks back at her.)

MULDER: "No?" What do you mean, "no?"

SCULLY: I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder. We're out here on half a hunch off of a cryptic phone call chasing down a, a clue that's based on nothing but speculation.

MULDER: Well, that's all we've got.

SCULLY: That's all he's given us. Who is this Deep Throat character? I mean, we don't know anything about him. What his name is, what he does...

MULDER: He's in a delicate position. He has access to information and indiscretion could expose him.

SCULLY: You don't know that this isn't just a game with him. He's toying with you. Rationing out the facts.

MULDER: You think he does it because he gets off on it?

SCULLY: No. I think he does it because you do.

(She walks into the ladies' room, stopping and looking back at him for a moment.)



SCENE 8
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder gets out of his car and starts walking to his building. Deep Throat walks up behind him.)

DEEP THROAT: Calling it a night, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on.

(Deep Throat walks up to him and they start walking.)

DEEP THROAT: I'm surprised at you.

MULDER: Why?

DEEP THROAT: Your level of commitment seems to have diminished.

MULDER: My level of commitment?

DEEP THROAT: I should have expected that you'd be working through the night trying to put the pieces together.

MULDER: Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with.

DEEP THROAT: Under the circumstances, I've given you all I can.

MULDER: A news report?

DEEP THROAT: And where has it led you?

MULDER: Not very far.

(Deep Throat chuckles a little.)

DEEP THROAT: It may be further than you realized.

(Mulder stops in front of him.)

MULDER: You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms. I've gone along. Been the dutiful son. But maybe this time, we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble.

DEEP THROAT: I fear you've become to dependent on me.

MULDER: Let me tell you something. I've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic. Maybe it's you who's become too dependent on me... on my willingness to play your games.

(Mulder starts off.)

DEEP THROAT: Mister Mulder?

(Mulder turns back.)

MULDER: What?

(Deep Throat walks up to him.)

DEEP THROAT: Don't give up on this one. Trust me. You've never been closer.

MULDER: Closer to what?

(Deep Throat sighs and walks away. Mulder sighs.)



SCENE 9
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND

(Berube sits at his desk, looking through a microscope. A monkey rolls around in his cage and squeaks. Berube looks at him for a second, then goes back to his work. The door unlocks and a man walks in, remaining in the shadows.)

BERUBE: Hello? Hello? Who's there?

CREW-CUT MAN: Working late tonight, doctor?

(Berube stands.)

BERUBE: What do you want here?

(The man steps partially into the light. He is the Crew-Cut Man, and he is the man in Mulder's picture.)

CREW-CUT MAN: He's alive, isn't he? Has he contacted you?

BERUBE: Please. You're going to have to leave.

(The Crew-Cut Man bangs on the cages, sending the monkeys screaming. Berube runs over to him.)

If you're from the F.B.I., I've already answered all your questions!

(The Crew-Cut Man walks over to Berube's desk.)

CREW-CUT MAN: What questions?

BERUBE: I had nothing to say to them. I have nothing to say to you.

CREW-CUT MAN: Where's Doctor Secare?

BERUBE: I don't know what you're talking about.

(The Crew-Cut Man chuckles to himself slightly. Berube walks over to him.)

Please. My work is very important. I must get on with my work.

CREW-CUT MAN: I'm afraid...

(He turns and faces Berube.)

Your work is done.

(Sounds of equipment breaking, glass falling and Berube groaning as the monkeys run around their cages, screaming.



SCENE 10
SHIPWORKS; ARLIS, MARYLAND

(The men on the boat talk.)

MAN #1: Anybody see anything?

MAN #2: No.

(The scuba diver pops out of the water. Lacerio and a few other people watch on the shore.)

SCUBA DIVER: Nothing!

LACERIO: That's it. I'm calling it off. Get those guys out of the water.

(He walks off. Another man takes out his walkie-talkie.)

OFFICER: Yes, sir. Shore to R.C. One, bring it in.

(The men on the boat pull the scuba diver out of the water. )

MAN #1: Visibility...

(They talk as the boat starts moving.)

MAN #2: ...been down there for two days. Forget it.

(As they drive by, they do not notice Doctor Secare sticking his head out of the water and looking around.)



SCENE 11
EMGEN CORPORATION; GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND

(Scully is reading the folder and Mulder stands next to her. In the photos, there are pictures of Berube lying face down, a roll of medical gauze around his neck. The next one is from a different angle, and the next is somebody's hand holding the medical gauze that is tied around his neck with another man pointing to a knot near is neck. Berube's shirt is open. The fourth picture is an even further close-up of the third. The final picture is of broken flasks covering the floor. Various policemen, agents and men in suits are in the background. The room is in shambles.)

SCULLY: The county sheriff's office is conducting the investigation. On the preliminary reports, it's being listed as a suicide.

MULDER: Suicide?

SCULLY: Yeah, they think that for whatever reason, he trashed his lab and then killed himself.

MULDER: How?

(He walks over to a desk with some glass containers on it. Scully follows.)

SCULLY: Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet.

(She puts her hand on a gas outlet that has medical gauze tied around it.)

Then he jumped.

MULDER: I don't suppose there were any witnesses?

SCULLY: Nope.

MULDER: The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up. I would have never pegged him as someone to do all this... or a Greg Louganis out the window.

(He looks out the broken window next to him.)

SCULLY: I know, that gauze is troubling.

MULDER: It's a bit too calculated, huh?

(He holds the gauze.)

Almost as if someone wanted to make doubly sure he'd break his neck before he hit the ground.

(He throws the gauze away and starts walking. Scully follows.)

What else do we know about Doctor Berube?

SCULLY: Ummm... "Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med., 1974." He was working on the Human Genome Project. Are you familiar with that?

MULDER: Yeah. The mapping of all human genes. Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history of mankind.

(He walks past her.)

SCULLY: Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that. I mean, there were thousands of scientists working on that project.

(Mulder looks at a glass, then puts it down.)

MULDER: Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungie-jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.

(Mulder opens up a metal case.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder. I'm seeing the pieces but I'm not seeing the connection.

(He takes out the Erlenmeyer flask containing the red liquid. It has a label on the bottom that reads "Purity Control.")

MULDER: Well, maybe that's just it. Maybe we're not seeing it because it can't be seen, not in any obvious way. What do you think this is?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Well, can you find out for me?

(Scully sighs and takes the vial.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: I'll see what else I can find out about Doctor Terrance Allen Berube.

SCULLY: Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you... if this is monkey pee, you're on your own.



SCENE 12
6:30 P.M.

(Mulder pulls up to Berube's house. He gets out of the car and rings The doorbell twice. He takes a piece of mail that reads:

"Dr. T.A. Berube
2650 W. 1st
Ardis Maryland
149376"

He goes back to the door, then walks around the side of the house. He sees that a window to the cellar is open and he climbs inside.)



SCENE 13
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT

(Dr. Carpenter, a woman who works there, feeds a sample of the bacteria into a machine with a microscope. Scully stands next to the computer.)

CARPENTER: My first impression is it's some kind of bacteria sample. Can I ask you where you got it?

SCULLY: It was recovered at a crime scene.

CARPENTER: Well, we've come a long way from Colonel Mustard in the den with the rope, haven't we?

(Scully laughs as Carpenter types.)

SCULLY: No, I'm expecting it to turn out to be nothing.

(Carpenter looks at the computer screen.)

CARPENTER: No... no, you've definitely got something here.

(There are a few white balls on the screen which have little holes, looking like some sort of bacteria. She zooms in.)

Wow... look at this.

(It zooms in slowly.)

SCULLY: What are they?

CARPENTER: Well, they're the size of bacteria but no bacteria I've ever seen.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

CARPENTER: Well, most bacteria are symmetrical and smooth. These are... I don't know.
It's strange.

SCULLY: You have no way of identifying them?

CARPENTER: Well, we could do a freeze fracture. Take a thin slice off and see what's going on inside these babies. If you don't mind waiting.

SCULLY: No, no, I'll wait.



SCENE 14
7:45 P.M.

(Mulder turns on Berube's desk lamp and sits down in his chair. He opens up a drawer and looks through the files. Stopping at a telephone bill, he takes it out and sees that there are many calls to the same number: "(301) 555-2804." He picks up the phone and starts dialing.)

MULDER: Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again. Look, I got a number this time. 555-2804. Area code 301. I need an address, a name if you can get it for me. All right, I'm at... same prefix... fifteen-seventeen. All right, thanks, Danny.

(He hangs up and puts the telephone bill away. A white van pulls up outside the house. Mulder opens up the top drawer and pulls out a set of keys. He pockets them and the phone rings. Outside, the Crew-Cut Man sits in the front seat, headphones on, a satellite dish in hand to pick up the phone call. Mulder picks up the phone.)

That was fast.

SECARE: Terry? Is that you?

(Mulder pauses.)

MULDER: Yeah. Who's this?

(Cut to Secare, standing at a phone booth.)

SECARE: They shot me, Terry. Oh, God.

(Cut to the Crew-Cut Man, who listens intently.)

I've been in the water for three days. I'm hurt.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Where are you now?

(Cut to Secare.)

SECARE: I'm at a pay phone.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm going to pick you up. Where are you?

(Cut to Secare, who grabs his bulletwound in pain. A man in a leather jacket walks by.)

SECARE: Terry...

(He slumps down against the glass. The man stops.)

MULDER: Hello?

MAN: Are you okay?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Are you there? Hello?

(Cut to the man, who takes the phone.)

MAN: Hello? This man's been hurt here. I, I think he needs medical attention.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

He's in pretty bad shape...

MULDER: What's the street? What's the street?

(Cut to the man.)

MAN: I'm gonna call an ambulance.

MULDER: Sir?

(The man hangs up. Cut to Mulder, who slams the phone down in anger. He stands and the phone rings. He picks up and sits down.)

Don't hang up.

DANNY: I got it.

MULDER: Hi, Danny.

(The Crew-Cut Man takes off his headphones.)

Let me get the address...

DANNY: All right, you ready?

(Mulder reaches over and takes some paper. As he does, he sees the white van.)

Mulder?

MULDER: I'm just writing it down now, go ahead.

(The van speeds off.)

DANNY: All right, the number belongs to a company called Zeus Storage.

MULDER: Yeah...

DANNY: Sixteen-sixteen...

MULDER: Sixteen...

(Mulder writes this down.)

DANNY: Pandora Street.

MULDER: Sixteen... Pandora Street.

DANNY: That's it.

MULDER: All right, thanks.

(Danny hangs up. Mulder does right after.)



SCENE 15
MARYLAND

(An ambulance speeds down a road carrying Secare, who does not have a shirt on.. A man is pumping an oxygen mask over his mouth while another is talking to headphones.)

MAN: All right, we've got a white male, forty, weak vitals and signs of severe dysnea and hypertension. He also has what appears to be a green fluid coming from a wound in his right upper quadrant.

(The other man takes off the oxygen pump and starts taping the wound.)

MAN AT HOSPITAL: I don't know what the hell that is. Is he responding to ventilation?

MAN: No and we're noticing those rope veins at the neck and a hypersonant sounding chest. He's going real blue on us now.

MAN AT HOSPITAL: Okay, you've got a tension to a thorax. I want you to perform a thorachotomy and release the pressure in his chest.

(The man turns to the other man.)

MAN: Okay, we're going to need a cannula. We're going to do a needle decompression.

(The second paramedic hands the first one a needle and a cannula. Secare's head lifts up as the paramedic pushes the needle in. He looks at the two as air rushes out and they cringe, holding their eyes. The second man coughs. The ambulance swerves off the road.)

MAN AT HOSPITAL: Mobile van, what's going on?

(The driver falls out of the car. Secare plucks the needle out.)

Mobile van, can you hear me?

(Secare opens the doors and runs out.)

Mobile van, answer me! Mobile van, what is the problem? Mobile van, come in please!



SCENE 16
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT

(Scully is calling Mulder. It's ringing.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: It's me.

(Cut to Mulder, who is driving.)

MULDER: He's alive, Scully.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera. He called the doctor's house while I was there.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Where is he now?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't know. Where are you?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department.

(She sighs.)

I've got something for you.

MULDER: Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?

(She walks over to Carpenter, who is sitting at a computer.)

SCULLY: Much. And it's not silver, it's green.

MULDER: What is it?

(On the computer, there is a picture of the freeze fracture. It is green with little blue spots.)

SCULLY: Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus and it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them.

(Cut to Mulder.)

They also contain something that looks like chloroplasts...

(Cut to Scully.)

Plant cells. But they, they've never seen anything like it here.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Any idea what he could have been doing with them?

SCULLY: Well, the only reason why you clone a virus inside a bacteria...

(Cut to Scully.)

...is in order to inject it into something living. It's called gene therapy and it's still highly experimental.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys. Can they tell you anything else there?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence.

(She walks away from Carpenter.)

Now, I may be understating the strangeness of this, Mulder. Bacteria like this... it may have existed, but not for millions of years, not since before our ancestors first crawled out of the sea.

(Cut to Mulder, who pulls up at Zeus Storage.)

Are you there, Mulder?

(Mulder does not answer.)

Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, Scully. Keep up the good work.

(Cut to Scully. She exhales sharply, feeling cast away.)



SCENE 17
ZEUS STORAGE

(Mulder walks in and down a flight of stairs. He sees a number of doors. He looks through the keys and sees one marked "1056." Walking to the door with the same number, he unlocks it and slides the door open. Inside, he sees five glass cases, like aquariums, each hooked up to various computers. Inside each case is a naked man, perfectly still. As he walks past them, he looks at them in disbelief. Suddenly, one of them moves. Mulder realizes that they are all alive and breathing underwater.)



SCENE 18
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY; MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT; 11:45 P.M.

(Scully is sleeping on a couch in the employee's lounge. Dr. Carpenter walks in and closes the door. She nudges Scully on the shoulder.)

CARPENTER: Agent Scully?

(Scully wakes up.)

SCULLY: Oh, Doctor Carpenter. I fell asleep.

(Dr. Carpenter sits down next to Scully. She holds out a piece of paper that has a pattern of dashes up and down the paper until a point where they become sparser.)

CARPENTER: I've done some work. These are the DNA sequences from the bacteria sample you brought in. You seem to know something about molecular biology. Do you know what you're looking at?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think those are genes.

CARPENTER: Right. They're called base pairs. Each pair is made up of something called a nucleotide. Only four nucleotides exist in DNA. Four. And through some miracle of design that we have yet to fathom, every living thing is created out of these four basic building blocks. What you're
looking at is a sequence of genes from the bacteria sample. Normally, we'd find no gaps in the sequence. But with these bacteria, we do.

SCULLY: Why is that?

CARPENTER: I don't know why. But I tell you, under any other circumstances, my first call would have been to the government.

SCULLY: What exactly did you find?

CARPENTER: A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide. A new base pair. Agent Scully, what are you looking at... it exists nowhere in nature. IT would have to be, by definition... extraterrestrial.



SCENE 19
ZEUS STORAGE

(Mulder walks out of the building and sees a white van pull up. Two men get out. He starts walking the other way and sees that they are following him. A third man comes running at him. He runs down an alley and jumps the fence. He runs down that side of the alley as fast as he can until he turns a corner, stops and draws his gun. Seeing no one, he runs the other way.)



SCENE 20
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(It is morning. Mulder walks in and sees his phone is ringing.)

MULDER: Hello.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been? I've been trying to call you all night.

MULDER: I had a situation. I left my phone in the car.

SCULLY: Mulder... that bacteria I had analyzed... they're saying that it doesn't exist in nature.

(Cut to Mulder, who sits down.)

They're saying that it could be extraterrestrial.

MULDER: Scully...

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: How soon can you be here? There's something I got to show you.



SCENE 21
7:30 A.M.

(Mulder and Scully pull up. A car is parked out front. Mulder walks to the building and Scully follows.)

SCULLY: Wait a second... Mulder?

(He stops.)

I, I just want to say that I was wrong.

MULDER: It's all right, don't worry about it.

SCULLY: No, um... if you'd had listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now. I should know by now to trust your instincts.

MULDER: Why? Nobody else does.

(She smiles.)

SCULLY: You know, I've always held science as sacred. I've, I've always put my trust in the accepted facts. And what I saw last night... for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.

MULDER: Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully... when you walk into that room? Nothing sacred will hold.

(He looks at her and walks in. She follows. Downstairs, he unlocks the sliding door and walks in, flicking on the switch. The room is completely barren except for a table. He walks to the middle of the room and she follows.)

There were tanks here and five bodies suspended in solution. There were computers monitoring them. They were alive, Scully, underwater.

SCULLY: What happened to them?

DEEP THROAT: God only knows.

(They turn to see Deep Throat standing in the doorway, carrying an envelope. He walks over to them.)

Most likely, they've been destroyed.

(He looks at Scully and nods to her.)

Miss Scully. I believe we met ever so briefly.

MULDER: Destroyed by whom?

DEEP THROAT: I don't know.

MULDER: I don't believe you.

DEEP THROAT: There are limits to my knowledge, Mister Mulder. Inside the intelligence community, there are so-called "black organizations." Groups within groups conducting covert activities, unknown at the highest levels of power.

MULDER: There were three men last night, I was chased.

DEEP THROAT: Hmmm. If you were chased, you would have been killed. Those men are trained for that sort of business and they are trained well.

SCULLY: Were those the same men who killed Doctor Berube?

DEEP THROAT: Presumably.

SCULLY: Why?

DEEP THROAT: "Why?" Good lord, you've worked so hard and you still don't see it.

MULDER: Doctor Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses.

DEEP THROAT: Yes, but that's been going on for years. We've had the tissue since 1947 but not the technology.

MULDER: Roswell?

DEEP THROAT: Roswell was a smoke screen, we've had a half-a-dozen better salvage operations. Doctor Berube was killed because his work was too successful. You're standing in the room where the first DNA transplant took, the first human-alien hybrid was created.

(He puts the envelope down on the table and opens it up, spreading pictures over the table.)

Six volunteer patients, all terminally ill.

(He holds up a picture of Secare.)

One, Doctor William Secare, an old friend of Doctor Berube's, was dying of melanoma cancer. And as a result of the E.T. gene therapy, all six patients treated in this room began to recover from their illnesses. Doctor Secare was able to live a more or less normal life. As normal as possible for a man who has developed inhuman strength and the ability to breathe underwater.

(Mulder starts to walk around.)

MULDER: That's how he was able to elude capture.

DEEP THROAT: Hmmm. (in agreement.)

SCULLY: What was he running from?

DEEP THROAT: Doctor Secare was never supposed to have survived. Doctor Berube's research was part of a top secret government project being run out of Los Alamos. All they were interested in was the technology, the science. To have a hybrid living out in the real world? Too great a liability. What if he should need emergency medical procedure? The man has a blood chemistry that is alien and very likely toxic. That story should hit the press.

MULDER: It was just easier to kill Doctor Secare.

DEEP THROAT: Of course, there was only one problem. He was Doctor Berube's old friend and he was able to warn him.

SCULLY: There's just one thing I don't understand. Why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning and why are you giving us so much now?

DEEP THROAT: I didn't anticipate the speed and precision of their clean-up operation. They're systematically destroying all the evidence... Doctor Berube, the bodies here. Without the evidence, you two have no case. Who would believe the story I just told you? You must put together everything that you have found and you must find Doctor Secare before they do. I'll have no further contact with you on this matter.

(He walks out. Mulder and Scully look at each other. After, they walk out.)

SCULLY: I'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work.

MULDER: I'm going to find Doctor Secare.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts.



SCENE 22
GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY

(Scully walks into the employee's lounge and sees various female doctor lounging around, drinking coffee, eating lunch and reading.)

SCULLY: Excuse me? I'm looking for Doctor Ann Carpenter. I've been unable to reach her by phone and she's not in her office.

WOMAN: She was in a terrible car accident, her whole family. And Doctor Carpenter is, um... dead.



SCENE 23
BERUBE RESIDENCE; ARDIS, MARYLAND

(Mulder unlocks the front door and goes inside. He looks around and hears a thump from upstairs. He draws his gun and slowly walks up the stairs, waiting before turning each corner. Another thump comes from the attic door above him. He goes up and looks around the dark room.)

MULDER: Doctor Secare?

(He starts walking to the back of the attic when Secare jumps out from behind him and tackles him into the wall, knocking the gun out of his hand.)

Wait!

(Secare punches him, literally sending him flying across the room into a pile of boxes. Secare picks him up by his trenchcoat.)

I'll protect you.

(Secare looks at him strangely. A gunshot sounds and Secare's head jerks back. He falls to the floor, letting Mulder see the Crew-Cut Man standing up through the doorway, gun in hand and gas mask on. Mulder looks down at Secare and sees that he has been shot in the back of the neck, green ooze fizzing out. He gasps in pain and starts holding his eyes, coughing. He falls to his knees. Later, Mulder lies on the floor, hands and feet tied. His phone is ringing. Two men in the back carry the doctor's body down the stairs, both wearing gas masks. The Crew-Cut Man walks over, kneels next to Mulder, and takes off his gas mask. Mulder's eyelids, nose and mouth are inflamed.)

CREW-CUT MAN: Your cellular phone's been ringing off the hook.

MULDER: I'm a popular guy. Why don't you answer it for me?

CREW-CUT MAN: Oh, I don't like talking on the phone. I have this thing about unsecured lines. When you feel like talking, let me know, though.



SCENE 24
MULDER'S APARTMENT; 6:10 A.M.

(Scully pulls up and gets out of the car. She walks over to the door and presses the button to the buzzer in Mulder's apartment. Deep Throat walks around the column and looks at her.)

DEEP THROAT: He's not home.

(She looks at him.)

SCULLY: Where is he? He's been gone all night.

DEEP THROAT: I wish I knew.

SCULLY: Something's happened to him.

DEEP THROAT: They won't kill him.

SCULLY: How do you know that?

DEEP THROAT: He's become too high-profile and you've got evidence that could expose them.

SCULLY: I don't have any evidence. They took the evidence and they may have killed in order to get it.

DEEP THROAT: Listen to me. Evidence still exists.

SCULLY: Where?

DEEP THROAT: It might be difficult to obtain but with your medical background, I might be able to get you inside.

SCULLY: Inside where?

DEEP THROAT: The high containment facility at Fort Marlene, Maryland.

SCULLY: What do they have there?

DEEP THROAT: The wellspring, Miss Scully. The original tissue. If they've got Agent Mulder, they might be willing to make a deal. It could save his life.



SCENE 25
FORT MARLENE; HIGH CONTAINMENT FACILITY

(Scully walks in carrying a briefcase, an I.D. attached to her trenchcoat. Two doctors walk up to a guard in front of a door. The guard checks one of their credentials and pushes a button, opening the door. The first doctor walks out. Scully looks up at the video camera positioned above the door.
The second doctor leaves and Scully walks up to the guard. She shows him her I.D. which reads:

"6D
Dana Scully, MD
26-38-90 Class A
Bio-Medical Division"

There is a picture of her next to the writing.)

GUARD: Clear.

(He pushes the button and the door opens. She walks through and turns right. A man closes a filing cabinet and walks past her. He looks back at her for a second, then keeps walking. Scully looks back at the man and puts the briefcase in the other hand. She walks past a few more doctors until she reaches the elevator. The board next to it reads:

"Level 7 Cryology
Level 6 Virology
Level 5 Oncology
Level 4 Radiology
Level 3 Immunology
Level 2 Toxicology
Level 1 Admin
Level G Security"

She plucks the I.D. off her trenchcoat and runs it through the keycard sensor. The machine beeps and the doors slide opens. She walks in and pushes a button. The doors close. On the seventh floor, she walks out of the elevator and to a door with a sign that says "Cryology." She slides her I.D. through the keycard sensor, which beeps. She opens the door and closes it behind her. She slides her I.D. through the next keycard sensor, which beeps a different way and does not switch from a green light to a red light. There is a speaker above the sensor. A guard speaks through it.)

GUARD: Name?

(She looks at the speaker, then walks over to the glass pane. She sees the guard sitting there.)

SCULLY: Dana Scully.

GUARD: Company or institution?

SCULLY: Federal government.

GUARD: Project password?

(He takes a pen and prepares to write something down. Her face goes blank, she looks at the alarm bell, then at the video camera. The guard looks at her and presses the intercom button again.)

Project password?

(She thinks back.)

SCULLY: Purity control.

(He writes it down, then starts tapping number out on a keypad. The door unlocks. She opens it and walks over to the guard.)

GUARD: Log in, please?

(He holds up a clipboard, which she signs. She walks through an open door down a hallway past a number of canisters. Wearing rubber gloves now, she opens a door marked "Purity Control." She slides out the nitrogen canister and takes off the lid. Reaching in, she pulls out a metal container with glass all around it. It contains a small alien fetus-like creature.)



SCENE 26
BRIDGE

(Scully sits in her car on the bridge, waiting. Another car drives up behind her. She gets out of the car, carrying a box that presumably contains the evidence. Walking over to the door, Deep Throat rolls down the window.)

SCULLY: You're late.

DEEP THROAT: Do you have it?

SCULLY: Yes.

DEEP THROAT: Good. They're willing to make the exchange.

SCULLY: You spoke to them?

DEEP THROAT: Yes.

(He reaches out his window.)

I'll take the parcel.

SCULLY: No, sir. I'll make the exchange.

(He pulls his hand back in.)

DEEP THROAT: I made the deal, Scully, they're expecting me.

SCULLY: I don't trust you.

DEEP THROAT: You've got no one else to trust.

SCULLY: I don't know who you are. I know nothing about you.

DEEP THROAT: Oh, for God's sake, don't screw this up! Let me tell you something you should know. In 1987, a group of children from a southern state were given what their parents thought was a routine inoculation. What they were injected with was a clone DNA from the contents of that package you're holding as a test. That's the kind of people you're dealing with!

SCULLY: So why give it back to them?

DEEP THROAT: To save Mulder's life.

SCULLY: At the risk of so many other lives?

DEEP THROAT: Oh, it's the tip of the iceberg. You and Mulder are the only ones who can bring it to light.

(He reaches out again.)

Now, give me the parcel.

(She stares at him, not knowing what to do. A white van pulls up in front of Scully's car.)

Give me the parcel, Scully.

(She hands him the package and runs back to her car. As the car passes her, she looks at the man driving the car. He is the Crew-Cut Man. He looks at her as he drives by. She gets in the car. The van pulls up next to Deep Throat's car. The two men step out of their cars as Scully breathes deeply, watching in her rear-view mirrors. Deep Throat hands the Crew-Cut Man the package. Scully turns around and watches through her back window. The Crew-Cut Man walks over to his open door, puts the package, turns around to face Deep Throat, and shoots him.)

SCULLY: No!

(Deep Throat falls to the ground. The back doors to the van open and a man pushes Mulder out onto the concrete. Scully runs towards the van with her gun in hand. She goes to Mulder as the van drives away.)

Mulder. Mulder!

(He groans. She checks his pulse and runs over to Deep Throat. She feels her neck and opens up his jacket, revealing the gunshot wound.)

DEEP THROAT: Trust...

(She lifts his head up so he can speak.)

Trust... no one.

(He exhales sharply. And with that, Deep Throat dies in Scully's arms.)



SCENE 27
WASHINGTON, D.C.; THIRTEEN DAYS LATER

(Scully is asleep on her bed. She wakes with a startle. Looking at the clock, which reads 11:21, she takes deep breaths. The phone rings and she picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: Hey, Scully. It's me.

SCULLY: Where are you?

(Cut to Mulder, sitting in his apartment with the lights off.)

They're shutting us down, Scully.

(Cut to Scully, who sits up.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: They called me in tonight...

(Cut to Mulder.)

...and they said they're going to reassign us to other sections.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Who said that?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Skinner.

(He spits out the word.)

He said word came down from the top...

(Cut to Scully.)

...of the executive branch.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Cut to Mulder, who still seems amazingly placid.)

MULDER: It's over, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully, who is in disbelief.)

SCULLY: Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yes, they can.

(He nods to himself. Cut to Scully, who sits in silence for a few seconds.)

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm... not going to give up. I can't give up. Not as long as the truth is out there.

(Cut to Scully, who hears a click. She lowers the phone from her ear.)



SCENE 28
HIDDEN ROOM; PENTAGON

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man turns a corner and walks through a narrow row of shelves in the same room that he hid the communications device taken out of Billy Miles so long ago. He walks over to a box that is labeled "Evidence, 16604." He holds up a jar that contains the alien fetus in it. He looks at it, then puts it in the box, which contains many others like it. He pushes the box back onto the shelf and walks all the way down the hallway. He walks out and closes the door, then runs his keycard through it's sensor. The sign on the door reads:

"In Case Of Fire Or Emergency
Know Your Exits
PENTAGON
Evacuation Procedure"

There is a map of the Pentagon next to it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks away.)

[THE END]
                                           LITTLE GREEN MEN



SCENE 1

(The vast emptiness of space. Mulder speaks over the scenes.)

MULDER: We wanted... to believe. We wanted to call out.

(Two satellites fly by.)

On August 20th and September 5th, 1977, two spacecraft were launched from the Kennedy Space Flight Center, Florida. They were called Voyager.

(The shot flies back at incredible speeds past planets, moons and stars, until we are outside the Milky Way. The image moves down to the lower-right side of the screen. Bachs "Brandenburg Concerto Number Two" starts playing.)

Each one carries a message.

KURT WALDHEIM ON MESSAGE: I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet. We step out of our solar system into the universe, seeking only peace...

(Waldheim continues talking. A diagram of an amino acid group, followed by a diagram of the human muscular system, a map of the world, a math chart and many charts of unborn babies.)

MULDER: A gold-plated record depicting images, music and sounds of our planet, arranged so that it may be understood if ever intercepted by a technologically mature extraterrestrial civilization.

(A woman starts talking in another language, possible Japanese, in the background and a picture of the earth comes up, stating the measurement of 12,756 kilometers.)

BOY ON MESSAGE: Hello from the children of planet Earth.

(The picture turns into the real Earth, then zooms back from it.)

MULDER: Thirteen years after its launch, Voyager One passed the orbital plane of Neptune and essentially leaving our solar system. Within that time, there were no further messages sent. Nor are any planned.

(The shot moves down to a row of satellite dishes.)

We wanted to listen. On October 12th, 1992, NASA initiated the high-resolution microwave survey.



SCENE 2
ARECIBO IONOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY; ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO

(An aerial shot of the extraordinary telescope. Mulder continues talking.)

MULDER: A decade long-search by radio telescope, scanning ten million frequencies for any transmission by extraterrestrial intelligence.

(The birds chirp and the monkeys howl outside of the observatory.)

Less than one year later, first-term Nevada Senator Richard Bryan successfully championed an amendment which terminated the project.

(The letters on the outside of the building read: "Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; Control Room.")

I wanted to believe but the tools have been taken away.

(Inside, the machines are covered and off.)

The X-Files have been shut down. They closed our eyes. Our voices have been silenced... our ears now deaf to the realms of extreme possibilities.

(A machine turns on and starts beeping. Slowly, all the machines turn on. One indicates that it is receiving information. The printers begin pumping out papers. The reel player starts. Bachs "Brandenburg Concerto Number Two" starts playing. The voice is scratchy and rough.)

KURT WALDHEIM ON MESSAGE: I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet. We step out of our solar system into the universe, seeking only peace and friendship... to teach...



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
LONGSTREET MOTEL; WASHINGTON, D.C.; WIRETAP #5A21147

(Mulder sits at a desk with a tape recorder that is on. He is transcribing a conversation between two men. Mulder has poured out a bag of sunflower seeds on his desk and is eating them. The shells surround his chair on the floor.)

MAN #1: Do you remember that one strip joint?

MAN #2: Yeah. You treat yourself?

MAN #1: Oh, man, let me tell you. You know that one, Tuesday?

MAN #2: Wait, wait, you went on Tuesday?

MAN #1: No, no. Thats the strippers name, Tuesday.

MAN #2: Yeah, yeah, I know her.

MAN #1: Well, anyway, shes onstage dancing to that Offspring song, "Come Out and Play."

MAN #2: Nice touch.

MAN #1: Very hot.

MAN #2: So keep going.

MAN #1: So Im tipping her big. No ones, five spots. Im laying them down on the rail, boom boom boom.

MAN #2: Yeah, right.

MAN #1: By the end of the song, I had like forty dollars laid out on the rail.

MAN #2: Its not a long song, is it?



SCENE 4
F.B.I. ACADEMY; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(A dead man is laid out on a table under a sheet with only the top of the head exposed. A dotted line is across it. Scully stands over him, dressed in her doctors garb. A class of students is off to the side taking notes.)

SCULLY: It is advantageous to begin an autopsy with removal of the cranium. The cranium is opened with a horizontal division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.

(She looks at the body. The students murmur a little.)

FEMALE STUDENT: Something wrong?

SCULLY: What this man imagined... his dreams, who he loved, saw, heard, remembered... what he feared... somehow its... all locked inside this small mass of tissue and fluid.

FEMALE STUDENT: Are you okay, Agent Scully? You kind of sounded a... little spooky.

(Scully looks at her when she hears Mulders nickname.)



SCENE 5
F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder turns a corner and walks down a hallway filled with people talking. Scully turns another corner and sees him coming towards her. She smiles slightly and walks up to him.)

SCULLY: Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.

(Mulder keeps walking, turning the corner she came out of. She watches him walk away in dismay. Mulder walks to his desk and sees the picture of Samantha face down. He stands it up and takes of a note attached to it that covers her face. He stares at the picture.)



SCENE 6
WATERGATE HOTEL & OFFICE COMPLEX

(Scully paces back and forth in the parking lot. She hears a door opening and turns to see a man walking towards her. She starts towards him and sees that it is Mulder.)

MULDER: Four dollars for the first hour of parking is criminal. What you got better be worth at least forty-five minutes.

(She sighs in a little relief and smiles at him.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, from... from back there, you look like him.

MULDER: Him?

SCULLY: Deep Throat.

MULDER: Hes dead, Scully. I attended his funeral at Arlington through eight-power binoculars from a thousand yards away. Now, the picture frame was turned down, you wanted to talk. What have you found?

SCULLY: I wanted to talk but I havent found anything.

(A car starts and the headlights cast upon the duo. He moves closer to her.)

MULDER: Its dangerous for us just to have a little chat, Scully. We must assume were being watched.

SCULLY: Mulder, I havent seen any indication...

MULDER: No, no, of course not. These people are the best.

SCULLY: Ive taken all of the necessary precautions. I have doubled back over my tracks to make sure that I havent been followed and no one has ever followed me. The X-Files have been terminated, Mulder. We have been reassigned. I mean, what makes you think they care about us anymore anyway?

MULDER: So why have you bothered to come here covertly?

SCULLY: Because I realized that it was the only way that you would see me.

MULDER: So what do you want?

SCULLY: To know that youre all right. Mulder, you passed me today within a foot, but you were miles away.

MULDER: Theyve got me on electronic surveillance. White-bread cases, bank fraud, insurance fraud, health care swindles.

SCULLY: Mulder, I know that you feel... frustrated that without the bureaus resources, its impossible for you to continue...

MULDER: No, it...

SCULLY: Well, what then? When the bureau first shut us down, you said that you would go on for as long as the truth was out there. But I no longer feel that from you.

(She stares at him, waiting for a response.)

MULDER: Have you ever been to San Diego?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Did you check out the Palomar observatory?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: From 1948 until recently, it was the largest telescope in the world. The idea and design came from a brilliant and wealthy astronomer named George Ellery Hale. Actually, the idea was presented to Hale one night. While he was playing billiards, an elf climbed in his window and told him to get money from the Rockefeller Foundation for a telescope.

SCULLY: And youre worried that all your life, youve been seeing elves?

(He slumps down against the wall, kneeling.)

MULDER: In my case... little green men.

(She kneels down next to him.)

SCULLY: But, Mulder... during your time with the X-Files, youve seen so much.

MULDER: Thats just the point. Seeing is not enough, I should have something to hold onto. Some solid evidence. I learned that from you.

(They look at each other in silence for a second.)

SCULLY: Your sisters abduction, youve held onto that.

(Mulder looks away.)

MULDER: Im beginning to wonder if... if that ever even happened.

SCULLY: Mulder, even if George Hale only saw elves in his mind, the telescope still got built.
Dont give up. And next time...

(She sighs and stands up.)

We meet out in the open.

(She walks away. He stays there, his eyes closed. He opens them slowly and sighs, then looks at a sign that says "This parking reserved for the staff of the Watergate Hotel.")



SCENE 7
NOVEMBER 27, 1973; CHILMARK, MASS.; 8:53 P.M.

(The TV is on and a tape recorder is playing on it, with a picture of Nixon in the corner. A young Fox lays down across a Stratego board from Samantha, who is sitting. He moves a piece.)

MAN: ...she had erased a conversation between President Nixon and H.R. Haldeman while transcribing the subpoenaed tape. Woods testified that she had erased only about five minutes of the conversation but the tape contained an eighteen-minute gap. Under investigation...

SAMANTHA MULDER: Scout.

MAN: ...from Senator Howard Baker, H.R. Haldeman reiterated the White House explanation that Rosemary Woods...

(Fox takes a piece and smiles.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Do we have to watch this, Fox?

MULDER: Leave it, Im watching "The Magician" at nine.

SAMANTHA MULDER: Mom and Dad said I could watch the movie, buttmunch.

MULDER: Theyre next door at the Galbrands and they said Im in charge.

(Samantha gets up and changes the channel to a western. Mulder sits up.)

Hey! Get out of my life!

(He changes it to a channel with static. She screams in his ear. He changes it back to the news and stands, towering over her.)

Im watching "The Magician."

(He starts to walk when the power goes out.)

Now, look. The fuse is blown.

(A painting of Mulder and his dog starts moving against the wall.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Fox!

(They look around as the Stratego pieces shake along the board. On the fireplace mantel, pictures fall and knickknacks topple over. The plug in the wall socket explodes in sparks. They look towards the window, where weird red and blue lights flash through. Fox moves up to the window and looks through. The chandelier is shaking, and Fox looks at that. A weird glow starts emanating through the door. The doorknob slowly turns. The door opens and a bright light shines through. Foxs eyes open widely as he makes out a strange-looking silhouette that doesnt quite look human. Samantha screams and he turns. Samantha is suspended in the air.)

MULDER: Samantha! Samantha!

(She floats towards the window. He climbs on a chair and throws down a case, which breaks, exposing a gun. He looks at the figure in the door, who raises a hand up invitingly. The white glow fills the room as Samantha moves out the window.)

Samantha... Samantha! No!

(Mulder is left kneeling on the floor, alone, the white glow all around him.)



SCENE 8
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder wakes with a start. He gets up and closes the blinds on his window.
A man opens his door.)

MAN: Were going to the hill.



SCENE 9
OFFICE OF SENATOR RICHARD MATHESON

("Brandenburg Concerto Number Two" plays as the man opens the door and walks in, followed by Mulder. Senator Matheson is by his stereo, facing the wall.)

MAN: Senator Matheson!

(Matheson points to a chair. Mulder walks over to it and sits down as the man leaves.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Do you know this, Fox?

MULDER: Its Bach. "Brandenburg Concerto Number Three."

(Matheson holds up two fingers like a peace sign.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Two.

MULDER: Good thing it wasnt a Double Jeopardy question.

(Matheson turns around and looks at him.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Do you know the significance of this piece?

MULDER: Well, uh... recalling music appreciation with Professor Ganz, Bach had a genius for polyphonic...

RICHARD MATHESON: This is the first selection of music on the Voyager spacecraft. The first.

(Mulder nods.)

Four and a half billion years from now, when the sun exhausts its fuel and swells to engulf the earth, this expression will still be out there, traveling four and a half billion years. That is, if its not intercepted first. Imagine, Fox. If another civilization out there were to hear this, they would think "what a wonderful place the earth must be."

(He walks over to his small bar.)

I would want this to be the first contact with another lifeform.

(He pours a drink.)

MULDER: I know Ive let you down. Youve supported me at great risk to your reputation. I realized when they shut us down, there was nothing you could do.

(Matheson sits at his desk across from Mulder.)

All I can say is, I think we were close. To what, I dont know.

(Matheson takes a sip and smiles. The song slowly ends.)

What?

(Matheson makes a halting motion. He takes a pen and paper and starts writing.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Do you like Bach, Mulder?

MULDER: I live for Bach.

RICHARD MATHESON: Then lets hear it again.

(He hands Mulder the paper which reads "They may be listening." He then walks over to the stereo and plays it very loudly. They walk away from the desk and talk quieter.)

I take it youre familiar with the high-resolution microwave survey?

MULDER: The search for extraterrestrial radio signals. They shut it down.

RICHARD MATHESON: You have to get to the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico. Ill try to delay them as long as I can but my guess is youll have at least twenty-four hours. After that, I can no longer hold off the Blue Beret U.F.O. Retrieval Team. And they have been authorized to display terminal force.

MULDER: What am I looking for?

(Matheson hands him a computer print-out of something. He then walks around Mulder as he reads the paper and leans over to his ear.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Contact.



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner sits at his desk. A tape recorder is playing.)

SKINNER ON TAPE: When did you last see Agent Mulder?

SCULLY ON TAPE: Yesterday.

SKINNER ON TAPE: Where?

SCULLY ON TAPE: In the bullpen hallway.

SKINNER ON TAPE: Did you speak with him?

SCULLY ON TAPE: No. Is he in some kind of trouble?

SKINNER ON TAPE: Agent Mulder failed to appear at his assignment this morning. His, uh... his whereabouts are unknown.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man picks up his pack of cigarettes off the table.)

SCULLY ON TAPE: Sir, Ill volunteer my time to assist in any search.

SKINNER ON TAPE: No, Agent Scully, the bureau can handle...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stops the tape.)

SKINNER: She doesnt know where he is.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: How can you be so sure?

SKINNER: Because if she knew, she wouldnt be so worried about him.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man opens up the pack and sees that its empty. He looks at Skinner.)

I dont smoke.

(The pack is crushed in the Cigarette-Smoking Mans hand.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Shell find him.



SCENE 11
ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO

(Mulder is riding in the back of a truck, sunglasses on, shirt drenched with sweat. The truck stops. He walks over to the driver, carrying his bag.)

MULDER: Gracias.

MAN: De nada.

(He drives off. Mulder hikes up to a gate that says "National Astronomy & Ionosphere Center; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; No trespassing." He takes off his sunglasses and looks around. After trying the lock, he decides to hike around the gate. Later, Mulder makes his way through the jungle, climbing up hills until he sees the satellite sticking out over the canopy of the trees. He arrives at the control room and puts his bag down on a barrel. He takes out his tape recorder.)

MULDER: No trace evidence immediately apparent around the exterior of the control room which is locked with chains.

(He puts the tape recorder away and cuts the chains with a clipper he takes out of his backpack. He walks into the dark room, carrying a flashlight. Everything is still draped over with sheets. He flicks the light switch on and off, then talks into the recorder.)

The power has been turned off. Although, the control panel lights are still on. The room is about thirty by fifteen. I see no signs of any recent occupation. Theres quite an odor of mildew in the air... the air is stale. If anyones been here recently... I see no indications.

(He hears a machine whirring and turns around to see the tape recorder running.)



SCENE 12
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Scully presses a button on Mulders answering machine. It rewinds then plays.)

WOMAN: Mulder... you hounded me to have lunch with you today and then you dont show. Youre a pig.

(There is a click and three beeps. She sits down and opens the drawer, rifling through the papers. Turning on the computer, a DOS directory screen comes up. Putting on her glasses, she clicks on the directory marked files. A prompt comes up that reads "Volume Protected; Enter Password." There is a text box underneath. She looks at it, thinks, and types in "spooky." The screen blinks "Access denied" three times over the words "Volume Protected" and it beeps three times. Thinking more, she types in "Samantha." Access denied. She stares at the screen and types another word. "Trustno1." The "ok" box turns black and the file that Senator Matheson gave Mulder comes up on screen. She reads some of it.)

SCULLY: "Galactic latitude?"

(She hears footsteps approaching and clicks on print. The printer starts up. She turns off the computer and stands. The paper drops out of the printer in time to avoid the two men walking in to see it.)

MORRIS: May I ask what youre doing here, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Are you following me?

MORRIS: Agent Mulders residence is under surveillance. Please explain why youre here.

SCULLY: I was told by the Assistant Director that Mulder was gone.

MORRIS: So?

SCULLY: So, whenever hes away, I feed his fish.

(They look at the fish tank. Scully smiles and walks to it as another man picks up the paper.)

MAN: What the hell is this?

(He gives it to Morris.)

MORRIS: Looks like a self-test the computer does.

(He crumples it up and tosses it in the wastebasket. Scully watches him then pulls off the lid and spills out some of the food on the shelf.)

SCULLY: Damn.

MORRIS: Just dump it in the tank.

(Scully looks at him.)

SCULLY: That would be bad for the fish.

(She takes the paper out of the wastebasket, uncrumples it, and sweeps the food into the paper. She crumples the paper up and bends down to the wastebasket. While pretending to throw it away, she sticks it up her trenchcoat sleeve. She then leaves.)



SCENE 13
NATIONAL ASTRONOMY & IONOSPHERE CENTER; ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO

(Mulder rewinds the tape on the recorder to the beginning. He then feeds the reel into the other and takes a drink of water. He turns on the flashlight and looks towards the door that reads "Lavatory." He walks over to it and opens the door. As he opens it, a man screams and throws a washbasin at him.)

JORGE CONCEPCION: No me lastime! No me lastime!
(TRANSLATION: Dont hurt me! Dont hurt me!)

MULDER: Who are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?

JORGE CONCEPCION: Por favor, no me lastime! Yo tengo mucho miedo!
(TRANSLATION: "Please, dont hurt me! I have a lot of fear!")

(The man whimpers in the corner. Mulder looks at him and walks towards him slowly.)

MULDER: Thats all right, settle down. Settle down.

JORGE CONCEPCION: Tenemos que irnos aqui.
(TRANSLATION: "We have to leave now.")

MULDER: Hablo inglese? (TRANSLATION:> Mulder probably wants to say "Hablas ingles?" which means "You speak english?")

(The man shakes his head no.)

MULDER: Name? Nombre? Nombre? (TRANSLATION:> "Name? Name?")

JORGE CONCEPCION: Jorge... me llamo Jorge Concepcion. (TRANSLATION:> "Jorge... my name is Jorge Concepcion.")

MULDER: Jorge, why are you so afraid? What have you seen?

(He points to his eyes. Concepcion points up.)

JORGE CONCEPCION: Luces en el cielo. Rojo, azul, anaranjaro. Pense que una avioneta habia entrado de los arboles. Pero cuando llegue... vi hombres... como animales... pero no hombres. Me agarraron y me pusieron aqui. Todavia estan en el bosque! (TRANSLATION: "Lights in the sky. Red, blue, orange. I thought it was an airplane that had to go through the trees. But when I got there... I saw men... like animals... but not men. They took me and put me here. Theyre still out in the woods!")

MULDER: Jorge, no comprende! Did you say men? Hombres?

(Concepcion grabs Mulders pen and draws on the wall. Mulder looks at the picture in wonder. It is obviously of something not of this world.)



SCENE 14
U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Dr. Troisky is looking at the print-out. Scully sits across from him at the desk.)

TROISKY: Looks like the "wow" signal.

SCULLY: The "wow" signal?

TROISKY: Ohio State has a radio telescope that conducts electronic searches for extraterrestrial intelligence. In August 1977, my buddy, Jerry Ehman, found a transmission on the print-out like this. He was so excited, he wrote "wow" in the margins.

SCULLY: What was there?

(He takes off his glasses and stands.)

TROISKY: A signal thirty times stronger than galactic background noise. It came through on the twenty-one centimeter frequency which no satellite transmitters are allowed to use.

(He sits down on the desk.)

TROISKY: The signal was intermittent... like morse code. And more importantly, the signal seemed to turn itself on while in the telescopes beam. The "Wow" signal is the best evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence. But this... this is better. Where did you get this?

SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me. Is that from Ohio State?

(He looks at it then stands, going back to his desk.)

TROISKY: Cant tell. There are a few nickel-and-dime S.E.T.I. projects around. U.C. Berkeley has one. The Planetary Society has one in Harvard and in Argentina.

(He sits.)

TROISKY: NASA was working out of one in, uh... Goldstone in California and Arecibo in Puerto Rico.

(Scully sighs.)



SCENE 15
F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully has stacks and stacks of papers on her desk. She pulls another one off of a pile. The heading reads:

"AIRLINE PASSENGER MANIFEST
Washington DC - Buenos Aires, AR
WAS BUE
SCA # 397 7 JUL"

There is a list of people underneath. She flips to the next one. It reads:

"AIRLINE PASSENGER MANIFEST

Her finger traces down the list, then goes back up to Hale.)

SCULLY: Mulder.



SCENE 16
NATIONAL ASTRONOMY & IONOSPHERE CENTER; ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO

(All the machines are uncovered and on. Concepcion walks around looking at them while Mulder sits, looking at the print-out. He starts talking into his tape recorder. The rain pours hard outside.)

MULDER: The signal from 0630, Tuesday. The narrow band and exact matching of the antenna pattern indicates that it originated from beyond lunar distance. But the same message is trans...

(Jorge pushes a button and the machine beeps twice. Mulder spins around.)

No, Jorge! Dont touch that red button. No-ho on the rojo.

(Jorge nods slightly.)

Thanks.

(He turns back to the print-out as thunder cracks outside. He speaks into the recorder.)

The same message was transmitted four hours later on a wide band... which puts its point of origin very close... just miles away from...

(The reel player in the back flips on and Mulder stands. Concepcion has a look of fear on his face. The message is the Voyager transmission again. Bach plays in the back. The voice is very scratchy and rough.)

KURT WALDHEIM ON MACHINE: I send greetings on behalf of the people of our planet.

(The speaking continues in the background.)

JORGE CONCEPCION: Son ellos! Han regresaron! (TRANSLATION: "Its them! Theyve come back!")

MULDER: Its just a tape machine, Jorge!

(Concepcion grabs Mulders arms.)

JORGE CONCEPCION: Vamanos! Vamanos immediamente, por favor! (TRANSLATION: "We go! We go immediately, please!")

MULDER: Where are we going to go? Theres a storm outside.

(The message turns into a high-pitched ringing so bad that Mulder and Concepcion both cover their ears. Concepcion inches back towards the door as Mulder moves towards the machine.)

You cant be afraid, Jorge!

KURT WALDHEIM ON MACHINE: ...and all its inhabitant are but a small part of the...

(Mulder turns it off.)

You cant be afraid...

(He turns back to see the door swinging open. Running through the woods, he shines his flashlight all around.)

Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! Jorge!

(As he walks forward, something catches his eye. He spins to his left and sees Concepcion, dead, leaning back against the tree, arms raised and face scrunched. He looks purely terrified.)



SCENE 17
MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

(Scully folds up her newspaper. She is sitting.)

WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM: ...please proceed immediately to Gate 16.

(She then repeats the message in Spanish. Scully takes out her compact and starts applying her make-up. In the mirror, she looks at the people behind her, trying to see if she has someone tailing her. Seeing no one, she closes it up.)

Attention, please.

(The P.A. system cannot be heard legibly over the people talking behind her. She walks over to another part of the terminal. A couple watches her, then the man signals in her direction when she disappears from view. They pick up their things and start towards her direction. Scully walks back out and looks at them. They look away from her. Scully walks past them and they watch her. She goes to the payphones, puts a few pieces of change in, and dials a number. Cut to Mulders apartment. Agent Morris partner is sitting at Mulders desk, pen and pad in hand. The answering machine picks up Scullys call.)

MULDER ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello. This is Fox Mulder, leave a message please.

(It beeps.)

SCULLY: C.A 519. 7:05. 9:50.

(The agent scrambles to write it down. Scully hangs up and looks at a hot dog stand. The owner of it folds down the glass cover to the front. In the reflection, Scully sees the two sitting down. The woman looks towards Scully. Scully sighs and makes another call.)

MESSAGE: At the tone, Eastern Daylight Time will be 5:47 and forty seconds.

(There is a tone. The two agents are still seated.)

WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM: Attention, passengers. Flight 1535 is now boarding at gate two.

(The agents stand up and look around. The woman looks towards the payphones and sees that Scully is gone. She walks over to the payphones, but Scully is nowhere to be found. She walks back over to the male agent.)

MALE AGENT: Relax, we know where shes going... St. Croix. Caribbean Air flight 519. It leaves at five after seven. Gates in the other terminal.

(They walk away. On the upper level, watching them, leaning over the railing, is Scully. She walks over to the ticket booth for SouthCoast Airlines.)

SCULLY: Id like a ticket on the 6:30 flight to San Juan.



SCENE 18
NATIONAL ASTRONOMY & IONOSPHERE CENTER; ARECIBO, PUERTO RICO

(Jorge is laid out on a table. Mulder stands over him, then brings the tape recorder to his mouth. His breathing is heavy and ragged.)

MULDER: The day is... the time is 10:30. Although not a qualified pathologist, I will record my observations of the body in case at some future time, decomposition should obscure forensic evidence.

(He walks around to the side of the body and keeps walking slowly.)

The subject, perhaps victim... is hispanic male, undetermined age. There are no overt external injuries apparent. There are no indications of any lightning strikes. No singeing of the air or burns of any kind. There are no... there are no puncture wounds due to needles or probes commonly associated with cases of alien abduction.

(He stops on the other side.)

The subject was discovered in sitting position. Riger mortis having set in, a little less than half an hour had elapsed. The skin is strikingly affected by goose flesh. The body shows signs of intense cadaveric spasm. The expression reflects...

(He leans in and looks at Jorges face.)

My God, Scully. Its as if hes been frightened to death.

(He stops the recorder. He then walks away from the body and presses record.)

Again, Scully, nothing but evidence... and again, no evidence at all.

(He walks over to the print-outs.)

The print-outs received in the transmission indicate contact with another lifeform and yet I cannot see them. Even if I could see them, would they really be there? How do I know this isnt some classified military satellite? These transmissions are from the Voyager, for Gods sake. Could extraterrestrials really have intercepted them? Or is this just some elaborate joke played on those who want to believe?

(He throws the print-out down in anger and walks around.)

I was sent here by one of those people. Deep Throat said "Trust no one." And thats hard, Scully... suspecting everyone, everything. It wears you down. You even begin to doubt what you know is the truth.

(He sits down on the desk.)

Before, I could only trust myself. Now, I can only trust you... and theyve taken you away from me. My life up to this point has been about the need to see her again. To see them. But what would I do if they really came?

(He looks over to Jorge. There is a rumbling and a rattling. He stops the tape recorder and puts it down, then walks over to beside Concepcion. The noise is coming from all around him. The recorder moves on the table. Glass starts breaking, having fallen off from where they were. Red and blue lights start flashing and the high-pitched ringing from before begins. The lights are shining through the door window. The printer starts rattling off pages of information. The reel player starts. The voice is very elongated and deep.)

PLAYER: Deep... Throat... said... "Trust... no... one..." Deep... Throat... said... "Trust... no... one..." Deep... Throat... said... "Trust... no... one..." Deep... Throat... said... "Trust... no... one..."

(Mulder rewinds his tape recorder and plays it.)

MULDER ON RECORDER: I was sent here by one of those people. Deep Throat said "Trust no one."

PLAYER: Trust no one.

(The door flings open and wind gushes in.)

MULDER: No!

(He runs to the door and slams it shut, bolting it. He pushes a machine over and it falls, ripping the plug from the wall. Sparks fly everywhere. Mulder backs up and knocks down the table. He looks down at Concepcions body. The ringing and the lights subside. The wind grows louder outside. He walks over to the door window and a bright light suddenly shines in his face. The lock unbolts and the machine flies out from in the front of the door. Mulder runs to his bag and takes out his gun. The doorknob slowly turns and the door opens. Mulder points his gun at the alien, but it does not fire, despite his trying. He takes his clip out, checks it, then puts it back in. He looks to the door and sees a familiar inhuman silhouette. The light engulfs the room. Later, Scully shines the flashlight in Mulders face. His eyes slowly open. Scully sighs in relief.)

SCULLY: I was sure you were dead. Mulder? Its Scully. Dana Scully. Do you know where you are?

(He tries to sit up. She grabs his wrist and helps him to stand up.)

MULDER: They came, Scully... the ones that took her. They were here.

(He puts his hands on her shoulders.)

SCULLY: Here?

(She puts her hand on his forehead.)

Or here?

(Mulder goes to the tape recorder.)

MULDER: On the tapes... the tape. Evidence. Proof.

(He runs to the massive pile of print-out on the floor.)

And the transmissions, its all here.

SCULLY: Proof of what?

MULDER: Contact. And these print-outs... its here. And the man...

(He overturns a table to reveal Concepcions body. Scully is shocked.)

Well have to examine the body. Therell be more proof.

(There is a rumbling. Mulder stands.)

SCULLY: Is that them?

MULDER: No, this isnt it.

(He runs out the door and looks through his binoculars. He sees an army van driving up to the site and runs back inside.)

Its the Blue Berets Crash Retrieval Team. Theyll kill us. Help me with the body.

(He runs to Concepcion.)

SCULLY: We dont have time.

MULDER: Help me!

SCULLY: Mulder, were never going to be able to get the body out of the country!

(The van makes its way up the hill. Mulder grabs the print-outs and starts rifling through them. Scully grabs his arm.)

Mulder, we have to go. Evidence is worthless if youre dead!

(Mulder throws down the paper, looks out the door, and takes the reel. They run out just as the truck reaches the site. They jump into their truck as the van pulls up behind them.)

MAN: Lets go!

(The man pushes down the barrier in the back and men start running out. Mulder jams on the accelerator as the berets start firing with assault rifles. Scully ducks down as the berets make a formation and fire after them. The commander runs up when Mulder and Scully turn the corner out of the line of fire.)

COMMANDER: Hold your fire!

(They stop firing.)

Get that truck to the bottom of the hill.

MAN: Yes, sir.

COMMANDER: Move, come on, soldiers, move!

(The troops run back into the van as Mulder and Scully speed through branches and foliage. The truck goes airborne as it speeds off a small hill in the road, crashing down a few feet later. As the army van races down the road, Mulder and Scullys vehicle suddenly jolts in a diagonal path as it races down a downward slope. It swerves out and onto a dirt road. Mulder jerks the wheel and they go flying over a log. Scully looks behind to see the van approaching.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Mulder makes a very sharp left down another short hill and swerves right onto another gravel path, then speeds away. The army van, unable to follow, stops. The commander gets out of the passengers side, takes off his sunglasses and watches them drive off.)

COMMANDER: Damn it.

(He gets back in. Scully looks at Mulder, who looks focused, then down at the reel at her feet.)



SCENE 19
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is standing, looking out the window and smoking. Skinner walks around his desk towards Mulder.)

SKINNER: You left your offsite set-up. Another brick agent had to cover your ass. The entire surveillance, all the months of work on this case, gone.

(He walks away, then turns around.)

Just like you, gone. This has four-bagger all over it, Mulder. Censure, transfer, suspension, probation.

MULDER: I understand that leaving my assignment warrants disciplinary action and Im willing to accept those measures.

SKINNER: But?

MULDER: But I had enough on that surveillance to arrest those suspects. After three days, I could have nailed them on forty counts of bank fraud but you left me there. Im surprised you even noticed I was gone, let alone wiretap my phone... an illegal procedure without a court order.

(Skinner looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man in shock. The Cigarette-Smoking Man stubs out his cigarette in his ashtray and walks over to Mulder.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Your time is over... and you leave with nothing.

SKINNER: Get out.

(Mulder looks at Skinner, who is staring at the Cigarette-Smoking Man. The Cigarette-Smoking Man continues to stare at Mulder, thinking that Skinner is talking to Mulder.)

I said get the hell out.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at Skinner in shock, realizing that he was talking to him. Skinner continues to glare at him. He takes his hand out of his pocket, takes his cigarettes and lighter. He puts one in his mouth and lights it as the other two watch. He then walks out.)

Report back to your assignment.

(Skinner walks back to his desk.)

MULDER: A minute ago, I was a four-bagger. Do you want me to make the arrests?

SKINNER: I think we need more to go on.

(He sits down.)

Continue the surveillance.

(Mulder walks out. The Cigarette-Smoking Mans cigarette still smokes in the ashtray.)



SCENE 20
LONGSTREET MOTEL; WASHINGTON, D.C.; WIRETAP #5A21147

(Scully and Mulder sit at a table with the tape player. Mulder plays the reel that he got, but nothing comes out.)

MULDER: It should be right here.

(He rewinds it, then presses play. It runs shortly until the tape ends. Still nothing.)

The entire tape is blank.

(He takes it off.)

SCULLY: You know, an electrical surge in the outlet the storm may have degaussed everything, erasing the entire tape.

(He puts the tape down.)

You still have nothing.

MULDER: I may not have the X-Files, Scully, but I still have my work.

(He stands and adjusts the player.)

And Ive still got you.

(She looks at him.)

And I still have myself.

(He sits down, puts his headphones on, and presses play.)

MAN #2: Well, whats the difference between a lap dance and a table dance?

MAN #1: A lap dance, theyre all over you.

MAN #2: A lap dance cost what? All right, all right. Tell me the best spot. Where?

(Scully puts her hand on his and goes to the door.)

MAN #1: Paramount. But you got to spend money.

MAN #2: Im there.

MAN #1: Wednesday.

(Scully looks back at Mulder, who looks up at her.)

MAN #2: She dancing?

MAN #1: No, well go Wednesday. Thats amateur night.

(Scully walks out.)

MAN #2: Amateur night. Nice touch.

MAN #1: Theyre not really amateurs but there are some differences.

(Mulder puts the reel on the player.)

MAN #2: Yeah, you sure?

MAN #1: If you dont mind spending a little money. The girls are all over you.

(The men continue talking, but their voices are overshadowed by Mulders rewinding of the Arecibo reel. After a few seconds, he presses play. Still nothing.)

[THE END]
                                          THE HOST


SCENE 1
ATLANTIC OCEAN; TWO MILES OFF THE COAST OF NEW JERSEY

(A Russian freighter is out at sea. A man is yelling and pounding on some pipes in the bowels of the ship. Another man walks towards him. He steps in water and opens the door to the bathroom. The toilets are flooding. He walks down into he boiler room. Men are yelling in Russian. A Russian engineer picks up the phone. [ = Denotes lines in Russian, subtitles given.)

RUSSIAN ENGINEER: [ Engine room... ]

(Some yelling can be heard over the phone. After a short while, he hangs up the phone and walks over to a young man coming down the stairs.)

[ Dmitri! ]

DMITRI: [ Yeah? ]

RUSSIAN ENGINEER: [ Hey! I've got a job for you. ]

(Dmitri climbs down. He starts to unscrew the bolts from the gate into the tanks. The engineer walks over.)

[ The system is backed-up. The blockage must be removed before the tanks can be purged. ]

DMITRI: [ Why is this always my job? ]

RUSSIAN ENGINEER: [ Because you are young. And because it is terrible, smelly work. ]

(He laughs and walks away. Dmitri opens the gate to the tanks and steps back, holding his breath due to the smell. He looks inside with a flashlight and puts his head in, looking around for the blockage. Something grabs him by the neck and pulls his head in. He pulls his head out long enough to scream, then is pulled down again. His only support is his foot stuck in the step. Just as it is pulled out, the engineer and other men run over, screaming in Russian and trying to hold on. It is no avail, however, as the monster inside proves stronger, dragging Dmitri inside. The men are starting to freak out.)

[ Flush the tanks! Flush the tanks! ]

(Men run off, repeating this. The water starts to filter out, and whatever is inside of it as well.)

SCENE 2
LONGSTREET MOTEL; WASHINGTON, D.C.; FEDERAL WIRETAP #5A21147

(Mulder is still on wiretap duty. A box of Chinese food resides near the reel-to-reel player.)

MAN #1: Dave says he would set it up in the Carsell's village.

MAN #2: Yeah, well, Dave's a stand-up guy. If he's putting it together, you'd be a fool to pass it up.

(Mulder less than cares. He has put his pen through his styrofoam cup and spins it around. A large pile of sunflower seed shells sits on the desk.)

MAN #1: Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I just...

MAN #2: You just what?

MAN #1: When you want to take a dip, you got to test the water. You just don't want to get wet.

MAN #2: No, man. Dippage is sacred.

(Mulder puts down the cup, then puts a seed down on the desk. He flicks it into the cup like a soccer kick. The door to the room opens. Mulder squints at the sudden intrusion of light.)

BRISENTINE: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

BRISENTINE: You're being relieved from your current assignment. Agent Bozoff will take over.

(He motions for the agent next to him to go to the desk, which he does.)

You've got a flight to catch in forty-five minutes.

(Mulder takes off the headphones and stands, still chewing on seeds.)

MULDER: Where am I going?

BRISENTINE: Murder case. Newark, New Jersey.

(He hands Bozoff the bag of sunflower seeds.)

MULDER: Treat yourself.

BRISENTINE: You're flying out of National. Your contact in Newark is Detective Norman.

(He hands Mulder his plane ticket as they head to the door. Mulder struggles to tie his tie while carrying his coat and the ticket.)

MULDER: How did I draw the assignment?

BRISENTINE: Assistant Director Skinner made the request.

MULDER: Skinner requested me?

(They walk out.)



SCENE 3
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY

(Sirens wail as another police car pulls up to a scene. Young children watch from the building across the way. The coroner's office is there as well. Mulder pulls up to the scene and gets out. He flashes his badge to the nearest police officer, who points to Detective Norman down the way. Mulder flashes his badge once he reaches him.)

MULDER: Mulder, F.B.I.

NORMAN: My forensics team's just wrapping up. We left the body where we found it. Kenny!

(A police officer brings over the dead man's boots.)

This is one case I'm going to be happy to turn over to you guys.

(Later, Mulder gags and coughs as he enters the sewer down the manhole. Police officers are waiting, as well as Norman. He steps into the cold water and groans at the smell.)

Watch yourself.

(The group starts to walk along, most of them carrying flashlights, including Norman.)

MULDER: Yeah, wouldn't want to step in anything.

NORMAN: They say it cuts the smell if you don't breathe through your mouth.

MULDER: They lied.

(Mulder takes out his flashlight and the pack moves along slowly.)

Who found the body?

NORMAN: Sanitation worker.

(They reach the body of poor Dmitri. In the dim light, Mulder sees how badly decomposed the body is. It is barely recognizable as anything human, laying face down in the water.)

Looks like it's been here a while.

MULDER: Any I.D.?

NORMAN: No. Not much to go on either. Front side of the body is pretty much eaten away. Would you like us to turn him over for you?

MULDER: No, I'll take your word on that.

(He starts back towards where they came from.)

NORMAN: Hey, Agent Mulder. What would you like us to do with the body?

(Mulder keeps walking.)

MULDER: Wrap it up and send it to the F.B.I., care of Assistant Director Skinner.



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is standing in Skinner's secretary's office, pacing, looking at his watch. He paces back and forth, restlessly, till the door to Skinner's office opens and the secretary walks out.)

SECRETARY: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Thank you.

(She closes the door. Mulder walks up to her.)

MULDER: I need to speak to him.

SECRETARY: I'm sorry, Mister Skinner's unavailable. Would you like to take a seat?

MULDER: Will you tell him that I'm here and I need to speak with him? Now.

(She glares slightly.)

SECRETARY: Certainly.

(She opens the door and looks in. Skinner is standing, looking at a paper. Mulder stands in front of the doorway.)

Excuse me, Mister Skinner. I'm very sorry to interrupt, but Agent Mulder is demanding to see you.

(Skinner walks up to Mulder, still standing in his office.)

SKINNER: Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, there is.

SKINNER: Then make an appointment.

(He turns away.)

MULDER: It's kind of hard to make an appointment when you're up to your ass in raw sewage, being jerked around from one meaningless assignment to another.

(Skinner looks back at him.)

SKINNER: Excuse me?

MULDER: What's my next punishment, scrubbing the bathroom floors with a toothbrush?

SKINNER: You're way out of line, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: So I gathered.

SKINNER: Fine. Come into my office, Agent Mulder, please.

(Mulder walks in, but the anger fades when he realizes he has interrupted a board meeting. Everyone is staring at Mulder.)

Agent Mulder, would you please inform the room as to why you regard your homicide case in New Jersey as meaningless?

MULDER: It seemed to me like a simple drugland body dump, not the type of case the F.B.I. normally wastes it's time and manpower on.

SKINNER: Certainly, Agent Mulder, given your recent history here, you're not one to judge what is or is not a waste of the bureau's time or manpower.

MULDER: Sir, my work on the X-Files...

SKINNER: The X-Files have been closed, Agent Mulder. You will carry out your new assignments and investigate them to the best of your ability. Is that not clear?

MULDER: Yeah.

SKINNER: And I'll be anticipating your field reports on your current homicide case. Thank you.

(Mulder, looking stoic, walks out. Skinner throws the paper down on the desk.)



SCENE 5
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder sits on a park bench, looking out at the Washington Monument. Scully walks up to him.)

SCULLY: Is this seat taken?

MULDER: No. But I should warn you, I'm experiencing violent impulses.

SCULLY: Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances.

(She sits down and sighs.)

I hear you really endeared yourself to Assistant Director Skinner today.

MULDER: You know, sometimes, it just gets really hard to smile through it when they ask you to bend down and grab your ankles. You know?

SCULLY: It's not exactly as if you've ever tried to fit into the program.

MULDER: No. No, I've been thinking a lot about that lately. I've been thinking about leaving.

SCULLY: The bureau?

(Mulder sighs and shakes his head.)

What would you do?

MULDER: Pursue my work in the paranormal somehow.

SCULLY: Y, you could request a transfer to Quantico. Come back to the Behavioral Science Unit.

(He sighs and stands.)

MULDER: They don't want us working together, Scully... and right now, that's the only reason I can think of to stay.

SCULLY: Wh, what about this case you're working on?

MULDER: It's a zero.

SCULLY: Where's the body?

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: They transferred it to our forensics lab. Look, Scully, I know what you're trying to do.

SCULLY: Maybe I can request to do the autopsy.

MULDER: It's an exercise. Skinner is just rubbing my nose in this one. There's nothing to it.

SCULLY: There's a dead body, isn't there?



SCENE 6
FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Scully, wearing gloves and goggles, turns on the examination light, which has a camera attached, and unzips the bodybag. The stench is so unbearable, she groans and covers her nose. She finishes unzipping it. Afterwards, the body is out of the bag and she is speaking out loud, presumably into a nearby tape recorder. She has a notepad in hand.)

SCULLY: Examination and autopsy of John Doe number one-zero-one-three-five-six. Case number D-P-one-one-two-one-four-eight. Special Agent Fox Mulder, field investigator. Body is an adult male, with advanced tissue decomposition, weighing a hundred and sixty-five pounds in extremis, sixty-nine inches in length. Intact skin is mottled and discolored, due to submergence in and exposure to a highly bacterial environment. Cause and time of death unknown.

(She looks at his brownish forearm, which has what looks to be a tattoo in foreign letters.)

Possible identifying mark on right forearm.

(She takes a scalpel out. Later, she looks down at the body.)

Body cavities appear normal. Interior organs intact. Consistent in rate of decomposition.

(She takes a pair of cutters out.)

Removing the rib cage.

(Some cutting sounds are heard, as well as some slashing. Later, a perfect rectangle has been cut in the man's chest. The organs are clearly visible, even though they are covered and surrounded in a grayish liquid.)

Condition of heart and lungs are good. No sign of thrombi, natural degenerate diseases, indicate victim was probably a young adult. The liver shows some nodular hardening, consistent with incipient alcoholism.

(A small flat, gray worm peeks out from inside the liver. Scully is taken aback.)

Oh, God!

(Scully takes the forceps and peels back the outer layer of the liver. She latches onto the small organism and starts to pull it out.)



SCENE 7
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY

(A workman goes down into the sewer, the manhole off. He is wearing black work suspenders. Another workman lowers him a tool case.)

WORKMAN #2: Put it away.

WORKMAN #1: Got it.

(He puts it down and opens it up. The second workman comes down. The first one takes out a rope then, taking the flashlight from around his neck, climbs down into the water. He walks over to a part of the fence on the sewer pipe that is ripped out.)

I'm going to need a big piece of thirty gauge and some bailing wire.

WORKMAN #2: I got to go back up top for the screen.

(He walks back up the ladder. The first workman unties the large piece of wood that had gotten caught, then puts it up on the ledge. He screams as he is dragged under. He remains there for a few seconds, the water bubbling, till he surfaces.)

WORKMAN #1: Hey! Help!

(The second workman climbs down.)

WORKMAN #2: Craig! Craig! Craig!

(He runs over just as the first workman is dragged under again.)

Craig! Hey, Craig!

(He surfaces, gasping, being pulled out towards the hole. The second one throws him a rope.)

Hold on! Craig!

(The first workman doesn't catch the rope, but holds on to the grate.)

Craig!

(The second workman tosses him the rope again. Craig screams and catches it.)

Hold on, man! Hold on! Oh, my God! Hold on! Hold on!

(Slowly, Craig is dragged onto the ledge, gasping for air. The second workman sees a tear in his shirt and the flesh beneath it has been torn up, looking like raw meat.)

Oh my God. I'm going to get help!

(He runs out. The first workman looks to the sewer grate.)



SCENE 8
MIDDLESEX COUNTY HOSPITAL; SAYREVILLE, NEW JERSEY

(Doctor Zenzola is shining her penlight in Craig's eyes, which naturally dilate.)

ZENZOLA: I'm going to give you a tetanus booster just as a precaution.

WORKMAN #1: I'd be happy if you'd just give me something to get this taste out of my mouth.

ZENZOLA: Oh, yeah?

(Mulder walks in. The first workman is sitting on the examination table, wearing a hospital gown.)

Let me take a look. "Aaaah."

(The first workman opens his mouth. She shines her penlight.)

Any trouble swallowing?

WORKMAN #1: Uh-uh.

(She hands him a piece of gum.)

ZENZOLA: It'll go away.

(She turns to Mulder.)

Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

(They walk into the back room.)

ZENZOLA: New York P.D. referred me to you. I was surprised to hear the F.B.I. was involved. Is there something here I should know?

MULDER: I don't know, maybe you can tell me.

(He checks his watch.)

ZENZOLA: The patient is a sanitation worker. He claims he was attacked by something down in the sewer this morning.

(She starts over to a cabinet.)

MULDER: Attacked? By what?

ZENZOLA: We've been unable to determine.

(She reaches into the cabinet and pulls a needle and some liquid.)

Initially, I thought it was just a disability claim... but he appears to be telling the truth.

MULDER: What's his condition?

(She begins filling the needle with the tetanus booster.)

ZENZOLA: He's in satisfactory health. I've given him a heavy course of antibiotics... and we're checking for hepatitis. He does have a strange wound on his back.

MULDER: What kind of wound?

ZENZOLA: Uh, it could be some kind of bacterial infection. Frankly, I can't say I've ever seen anything like it.

(She walks back over to her patient. He follows.)

This is Agent Mulder of the F.B.I.

MULDER: Any idea what attacked you?

WORKMAN #1: Yeah, I've been thinking it might have been a python.

(She delivers the shot, jamming the needle into his arm rather harshly.)

MULDER: A python?

WORKMAN #1: Yeah, or a boa constrictor. Somebody probably flushed a pet snake down the toilet. I found an alligator in the sewer a couple of years ago. It was stronger than hell, I'll tell you that, clamped onto me like a vise.

(Zenzola walks around and pulls back the taped bandages, looking at the wound.)

ZENZOLA: It almost looks like a bite.

(Mulder walks around and looks. The workman sighs. The bite has a hole in the middle, then four slashes like teeth moving in diagonal motions from all four corner directions. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: Oh, excuse me.

(He steps away and answers it.)

Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I need to see you, I've got something here I think you should know about.

MULDER: What is it?

(Cut to Scully, sitting at her desk. The phone is on speaker phone. She's reading over her notes.)

SCULLY: Some kind of parasite near John Doe. I'm having it looked at, but I should know more by the time you get down here.

MULDER: Well, I'm up in Jersey. I should be taking the shuttle down in about an hour.

(He hangs up and walks over to the other two people in the room.)

WORKMAN #1: When can I get out of here? I'd just like to go home.

(Mulder's phone rings again.)

MULDER: Oh, excuse me, sorry.

(He turns around and answers it. Cut to an unknown location, a dark room.)

Scully, this is a bad time for me to talk.

X: Mister Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder, who has no clue who he's talking to.)

MULDER: Yeah.

(Cut to the mysterious man, who looks out the window from his office.)

X: I think you should know... you have a friend at the F.B.I.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Who is this?

(Cut to the mysterious man, who hangs up. Cut back to Mulder, who does the same.)

ZENZOLA: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

ZENZOLA: If you don't have any more questions, I'm going to release this man.

MULDER: Okay, go ahead.

(Zenzola and the workman talk. Mulder looks confused about this last phone call.)



SCENE 9
FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Mulder walks down the dark hallway into Scully's office.)

SCULLY: Close the door.

(He walks back up the stairs in her office and closes the door, then walks over to her. She hands him a glass with the parasite resting in a liquid.)

It's called Turbellaria, or it's commonly known as a fluke or flatworm.

MULDER: This was living inside the body?

SCULLY: Apparently, it had attached itself to the bile duct and was feeding off the liver.

MULDER: Lovely.

SCULLY: Believe it or not, something like forty million people are infected worldwide.

(He puts the jar down on the desk.)

MULDER: This isn't where you tell me some terrible story about sushi, is it?

SCULLY: Well, maybe you'd rather hear what you can catch from a nice, rare steak.

MULDER: So, what, the murder weapon was a top sirloin?

SCULLY: Flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions. It's more likely that the victim contracted it down inside the sewer.

MULDER: Before or after he died?

SCULLY: I don't know. According to my sources, it's unlikely that a single parasite could have killed him. He was a young man. But the weird thing is, there's no other discernible cause of death.

MULDER: How do these parasites attach themselves?

SCULLY: They have what's called a scolex... it's a sucker-like mouth with four hooking spikes.

(Mulder pulls out a picture of the wound on the back of the workman and hands it to her. The wound is nearly across half his entire back.)

MULDER: Anything like this?

SCULLY: Where'd you get that?

MULDER: Something attacked a workman in a New Jersey sewer this morning.

SCULLY: And you're asking me if this is from a fluke?

MULDER: Could it be?

SCULLY: M, Mulder, the scolex is a tiny little organ. This is a huge bite mark.

(He picks up the jar.)

MULDER: How big can these things get?

(She starts to laugh.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I...

(They stare at each other. Mulder really doesn't find anything funny.)

I'm sorry. It felt like old times there for a second.

(They share an uncomfortable silence for a few seconds.)

Flatworms are what are known as obligate endoparasites. They live inside the host, entering the body through the ingestion of larvae or eggs. They are not creatures that go around attacking people.

MULDER: Well, that's good. I didn't want to have to tell Skinner that his murder suspect was a giant, blood-sucking worm.

(She smiles.)

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Well, at the very least, this will be interesting to the Newark Department of Sanitation.

(He picks up the jar, then thinks for a second.)

Look, Scully, I don't know who you shared our conversation with the other night, but I'd prefer if you didn't try to launch a campaign for me.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

MULDER: I don't know who you talked to...

SCULLY: I didn't talk to anybody.

MULDER: Well, somebody called me and told me I had a friend at the F.B.I.

(Scully looks shocked.)

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say, but I, I, I wouldn't betray a confidence.

(They stare at each other, wondering.)



SCENE 10
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY

(The workman turns on the shower and unrobes himself, revealing the huge scar still on his back. He opens the medicine cabinet and takes out the toothpaste. Looking in the mirror, he applies some to his toothbrush, then starts to brush his teeth. He applies more, trying to get the taste out of his mouth. He brushes vigorously and, finding no relief from the taste, squirts some directly into his mouth. Swishing it around, chewing on it, he takes some water into his mouth and spits up a stream of blood and toothpaste, almost gagging on it. He looks at the mirror and wipes off some blood on his lips, shocked. He gets into the shower, relaxing in the water. He suddenly starts to choke, holding his throat. Blood drips out of his mouth as he tries to throw up. A large flukeworm slithers it's way out of his mouth and down the drain.)



SCENE 11
NEWARK COUNTY SEWAGE PROCESSING PLANT

(The foreman is taking Mulder on a grand tour of the facility.)

FOREMAN: City runs on several different systems... some new, some built around the turn of the century. Almost as old as Charlie here.

(He points to an older man walking by, wearing a hard-hat, writing something down on a clipboard.)

Isn't that right, Charlie?

CHARLIE: Oh, yes, sir.

(Charlie keeps walking, as does Mulder and the foreman. They walk over to an encased map.)

MULDER: What part of the sewer was I in?

FOREMAN: That'd be one of the older sections, big eight-foot tunnels.

MULDER: They look more like a catacomb than a sewer line.

FOREMAN: Yup, all the new sections are concrete pipe, not much of it bigger than twenty-four inches.

MULDER: And all the sewage comes through this plant?

FOREMAN: Five-hundred-and-sixty thousand people a day call my office on the porcelain telephone.

(Mulder smiles and pulls out the encased flukeworm.)

MULDER: Have you ever seen one of these?

FOREMAN: Looks like a big, old worm.

MULDER: It's called a fluke. It came from the body they pulled out of the sewer.

FOREMAN: Wouldn't surprise me. No telling what's been breeding down there in the last hundred years.

(Downstairs, the water is loud as it rumbles through as Charlie stands on a plank, smoking a cigarette. He hears a rumbling in the water underneath him and sees something swim beneath him. Charlie runs over to a pole with a built-in telephone. Upstairs, the foreman picks up the phone, which has a bright red light flashing.)

Ray here.

(Some talking can be heard.)

Yeah. Charlie, slow down.

(Mulder looks over. Downstairs, they run over to Charlie, who is standing at a system control.)

CHARLIE: I'm backflushing the system. It's in there.

MULDER: What is it?

CHARLIE: I don't know. It just swam right past me.

(He flips a switch.)

There it is.

(They walk over to a yellow-tube pipe. Charlie shines a flashlight on the thing's face. It's the Flukeman, a giant flukeworm that has human qualities. The scolex is highly evident. Ray and Mulder look at each other, then back at the monster.)



SCENE 12
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is reading a report on flatworms on her computer. She speaks over the scene as she writes her findings down.)

SCULLY: The turbellarian flatworms are free-living carnivorous scavengers, usually less than three centimeters in length, found in fresh and sea water. They are hermaphroditic with complex reproductive systems, capable of internal fertilization. Many species require more than one host to complete a life cycle. Although the shape of the wound on the sanitation worker suggest scolex attachment, the sheer size of the wound precludes involvement of the common flukeworm.

(She hears a rustling and looks to her door to see a tabloid magazine being slid under. Taking off her glasses, she walks over and picks it up. She opens her door and looks outside, but no one is around. Walking back inside, she flips through the tabloid at her desk. After looking through the usual nonsense, she finds a mysterious article with the headline "MONSTER ON BOARD!?" Under it, it reads "Bizarre accident on Russian cargo ship has officials suspicious." There is a picture of the ship. Scully looks up in realization, then turns to her computer. She calls up the pathology report and zooms in on the arm a few times. There is the tattoo. Her phone rings and she answers it slowly.)

Scully.

MULDER: Scully, it's me. You know that fluke you caught?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: It must have been the runt of the litter.

(Scully is rightfully confused.)



SCENE 13
MIDDLESEX COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(Scully is looking through the window on the door into a small room, possibly a washroom, with a sink and various pipes in the corner.)

SCULLY: I don't see it.

(Mulder looks through and points.)

MULDER: There it is. Tucked away in the far corner, behind the pipes.

(Scully sees a large white object move behind the pipes.)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MULDER: I don't know if you can see it from here, but it has no sex organs. It's genderless.

(The Flukeman glares at them from behind the pipes.)

SCULLY: Platyhelminthis are often hermaphroditic. Mulder, this is amazing. It's vestigial features appear to be parasitic, but it has primate physiology.

(Mulder nods.)

Where the hell did it come from?

MULDER: I don't know, but it looks like I'm going to have to tell Skinner that his suspect is a giant, blood-sucking worm after all.

(The Flukeman's head moves into the light.)

The only thing we're missing is the identity of the body in the sewer.

(They move away from the window.)

SCULLY: He was a Russian. An engineer on a cargo freighter. He had a tattoo on his forearm.

(She hands him a print-out of the close-up of his arm.)

I didn't make the connection until I detected that that was the name "Dmitri" spelled in Cyrillic lettering.

MULDER: How did you make the connection at all?

(She hands him the tabloid, folded open to the article.)

SCULLY: Somebody shoved this under my door. I guess you really do have a friend in the F.B.I. And, Mulder... when you see Skinner to hand in your field report, I know that it's your decision, but I hope that you know that I'd consider it more than a professional loss if you decided to leave.

(He smiles slightly, hands back the tabloid and print-out, then looks in at the angry Flukeman.)



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is flipping through Mulder's field report slowly, reading it carefully. Mulder sits across from him, waiting. Skinner scratches his neck a bit as he reads. Skinner finishes reading.)

SKINNER: Everything looks in order.

(Mulder chuckles.)

Is something wrong, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Well, that's just an unexpected response, considering the bizarre nature of the case... and of the suspect.

SKINNER: The strangeness of the criminal and the crime are not lost on me. I had my reaction to them this morning in my conversation with the federal prosecutor's office about how to process the suspect. This meeting... is to evaluate your work.

(Mulder sighs slightly.)

MULDER: There's no way you'll prosecute this.

SKINNER: The justice department has asked that the suspect be transferred to an institution for a full psychiatric evaluation.

(Mulder shakes his head.)

MULDER: This is not a man. It's a monster. You can't put it in an institution.

SKINNER: Then what do you do with it, Agent Mulder, put it in a zoo? It killed two people.

(Mulder leans back.)

MULDER: Two?

SKINNER: The sanitation worker who was attacked was found dead in his home as a result of his injuries.

(He flips through the file. Mulder stands to leave, but turns around and points at Skinner angrily.)

MULDER: You know, you had a pair of agents that could have handled a case like this. Agent Scully and I might have been able to save that man's life, but you shut us down.

SKINNER: I know. This should have been an X-File.

(Mulder searches for something to say. Skinner sighs.)

We all take our orders from someone, Agent Mulder. That'll be all.

(Mulder, looking disgusted, leaves.)



SCENE 15
MIDDLESEX COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(Two workers wheel the Flukeman, strapped down, down a hall and into the Federal Marshall's ambulance truck. They close the door and one of them pats on the door.)

MAN: It's secure.

(The marhsall pulls out. The transmissions from the intercom can be heard blaring. The host struggles against his bonds.)

WOMAN: Charlie twenty-one, Charlie twenty-one, what's your E.T.A.?

(A mumbling response can be heard.)

Unit twenty, no further assist needed. They have the suspect in custody from the, uh...

(The driver looks back and sees that his passenger is gone.)

FEDERAL MARSHALL: This is vehicle forty-nine forty, requesting immediate back-up and assistance.

WOMAN: Roger forty-nine forty, roger forty-nine forty.

(The Marshall pulls over at the side of the road near a small park office. He takes his shotgun, pumps it, and walks out of the car slowly. Moving around to the back, he swings open the door, but there is no sight of his former hostage. He steps into the car and looks down at the straps, covered in residue. He wipes the goo off when he hears some hoarse breathing. The man's screams are heard far off. A shotgun blast goes off and he screams more. Hovering over the ambulance is a sign that reads:

"LAKE BETTY; NATURE'S PLAYGROUND
CAMPSITES AVAILABLE
LIVE BAIT
FISH... ALL YEAR ROUND!"

The words "Live Bait" are a neon sign, glowing. The Flukeman makes his way across the woods, crawling on the ground towards some portable toilets. He crawls into the second one and slithers down the bowl, where he sits, waiting for his next possible victim.)



SCENE 16
LAKE BETTY PARK; 5:27 am

(A truck backs up to the portable toilet. It's a tank cleaner service, and the worker gets out of the driver's seat and heads around back. He puts on rubber gloves and opens the door to the second portable toilet, then takes out a hose and fits it into the toilet. Flipping a lever, he stands back, smoking a cigarette, as the tube begins to suck out the waste. But the motor start to sputter as the engine strains to pull up something, obviously the Flukeman. The man checks the hose, making sure it works, and slowly the blocking object is sucked up the tube into the truck. The cleaning continues as normal.)



SCENE 17
LAKE BETTY PARK; 6:37 am

(Police cars and coroners have enveloped the last murder scene. The workers are also inspecting the ambulance. Mulder pulls up as the tank cleaner service truck rolls by. He walks up to Detective Norman.)

MULDER: What do you got?

NORMAN: Well, we got a dead Marshall and an escaped prisoner. Other than that, we got bubkis. We got a police line in a two-mile radius.

MULDER: Watch all the storm drains, any access to the sewer system. It's going to try to get back underground.

(His cellular phone rings. He answers it.)

Mulder.

(Cut to an unknown location. It's Mulder's mysterious contact.)

X: Mister Mulder, I will make this brief.

(Cut to Mulder. Norman talks to some of the other men.)

Success in your current assignment is imperative.

MULDER: Who am I speaking to?

X: Are you hearing me, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: Yes. Why is it imperative?

(Cut to the newfound informant.)

X: Reinstatement of the X-Files must be undeniable.

(He hangs up. Cut to Mulder, who hangs up. A police officer calls Norman on the walkie-talkie.)

MAN: K-nine, unit six-four, copy?

NORMAN: Six-four, copy.

MAN: Yeah, we're at a campsite approximately a quarter-mile from your position.

(Mulder walks over.)

Dogs tracked a scent to a chemical toilet here. Thought he might be hiding inside, but it's empty.

MULDER: The tanker.

NORMAN: Hold on, six-four.

(He looks at Mulder.)

What?

MULDER: What if he's on the tanker truck?

(He runs to his vehicle. Norman looks pretty dumbfounded.)



SCENE 18
NEWARK COUNTY; SEWAGE PROCESSING PLANT; 8:15 am

(Another tanker truck rolls down the road as Mulder hurriedly pulls up, unbuckles his seatbelt, and runs in the building. Later, he and the foreman are walking down a flight of stairs over the yard where the tanker trucks unload.)

FOREMAN: Company that owns the truck you're looking for doesn't keep detailed service records. They had about five trucks out in that area this morning.

(They stop walking. Under them, another truck starts to dump it's contents.)

Three of them have already deposited their loads.

MULDER: So he could have already been here and gone?

FOREMAN: If he hasn't, he will be.

MULDER: And every tanker dumps it's load here?

FOREMAN: It's a state law.

MULDER: Everything is processed through this plant?

FOREMAN: Yup.

(They start down the rest of the stairs.)

MULDER: Then what happens to it?

FOREMAN: Empties through an outlet pipe about five miles out to sea.

MULDER: Could this thing have escaped through that outlet pipe?

FOREMAN: Doubtful. The system's full of enough filters and screens that nothing much bigger than your little finger's going to get through. If it's here... it's going to be trapped here.

MULDER: Guess all we can do is wait.

(They stop and look out at the giant system of pipes. Later, Mulder is walking the planks, looking down into the water. Other men are doing this as well, including the foreman, inspecting the water. Mulder's cellular phone rings.)

Mulder.

SCULLY: It's me, where are you?

MULDER: I'm at the treatment plant. I was playing a hunch it might have gotten back into the system.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: Forget it, it's stupid.

(Cut to Scully, sitting at a desk.)

SCULLY: Well, you're not going to like what I have to tell you?

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: It hadn't occurred to me, but I think that the fluke in the corpse might have been an incubating larva.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

This... creature, or whatever it is...

(Cut back to Scully.)

Is transmitting it's eggs or larvae through it's bite.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: You mean it's trying to reproduce?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: It's looking for hosts. It attacks because the victims' bodies provide generative nourishment. Mulder...

MULDER: Yeah...

SCULLY: If it finds a new host...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I know, Scully. It could multiply.

FOREMAN: Agent Mulder!

(Mulder pulls the phone from his ear and looks behind to see the foreman yelling to him.)

Linesman spotting something down in a section of pipe!

MULDER: Where?

(Inside, the foreman unrolls a blueprint of the pipe system. He points to a section.)

FOREMAN: Here.

MULDER: That's near where we found the first body.

FOREMAN: Right, except this is an old overflow system that dumps into the harbor during heavy rainfall.

MULDER: That must be where it got into the system.

(The foreman nods.)

It's working it's way back out to sea.

(They look at each other, worried. Mulder and the foreman race to a sewer grate where workers are standing by. Mulder grabs a flashlight from one of them and heads down. The foreman follows. Mulder has to cover his nose from the smell.)

Mmm...

(The foreman also has a flashlight. The waters are bubbling, moving quickly, and they walk on a plank above it, shining their flashlights down. The foreman shines his on a pipe.)

FOREMAN: That's the overflow pipe. It leads to another vault like this one, then it goes three-quarters of a mile to the sea.

MULDER: Let's see if we can get that gate closed.

(The foreman nods and crawls under the ledge. He stays close to the wall, careful not to fall in, then leans down and unchains the lever. He pulls on it.)

FOREMAN: It's rusted in position! See if I can get some leverage here.

(He tries harder. Mulder looks around the water desperately. He feels some water trickling down from above and wipes it off his shoulder. The foreman, however, slips and falls into the water with a short scream as he loses his footing.)

MULDER: Hey!

(The foreman stands up in the pretty shallow water, which comes up to his chest. He has no glasses on.)

FOREMAN: Aw, damn it!

MULDER: You all right?

FOREMAN: Yeah, I lost my... ah!

(He is pulled under. Mulder whips out his gun, searching for signs of the fluke. The foreman surfaces.)

Help! Help!

(Mulder gets down on the plank and reaches out to him.)

MULDER: Give me your hand!

FOREMAN: Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Grab it!

(Mulder manages to grab the foreman's hand, but the Flukeman is still obviously tugging on the foreman, because he screams and starts to slip away. Mulder groans, trying to hold on, but the foreman is dragged under.)

MULDER: We need some help down here!

(He jumps into the water and looks around.)

Hey!

(Some water trickles down onto him. Suddenly, the foreman stands up, back arched, screaming.)

I'll get you out of here!

(He notices some movement in the water. He grabs the foreman and positions him under the ledge, where the foreman grabs on. He is apparently in shock, screaming.)

Hold on! Hold on! You all right? You all right?

(There is a banging. Mulder spins around to see the Fluke trying to get into the pipe. Mulder runs over and jumps on a pipe on the ground, then strains on the lever as the Flukeman gets about halfway into the pipe. Mulder falls as the lever moves, sending the gate crashing down, severing the Fluke in half. The Flukeman screams a high-pitched whine. The foreman has pulled himself up slightly now, gasping, staring at the severed legs floating in the water, blood all around them. Mulder sighs in relief.)



SCENE 19
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is sitting on a bench, looking out at the Lincoln Memorial, in the exact same spot where he and Deep Throat once talked. Scully walks over.)

SCULLY: Is this seat taken?

MULDER: No. But I should warn you, I may reek a bit out of the sewer.

SCULLY: I'll take my chances.

(She sits and sighs.)

You talked to Skinner yesterday.

MULDER: Success in our work is imperative, Scully. Reinstatement of the X-Files must be undeniable.

SCULLY: That came from Skinner?

MULDER: No. We have a friend in the F.B.I.

SCULLY: I thought you might be interested in the lab results on the biology of the fluke larva.

(She takes out a folder, opens it, and starts reading.)

Dissection and analysis indicates reproductive and physiological cross-traiting, resulting in a sort quasi-vertebrate human.

MULDER: Human?

SCULLY: Yes, but still capable of spontaneous regeneration, like any fluke or flatworm.

MULDER: How does that happen?

SCULLY: Radiation. Abnormal cell fusion. The suppression of natural genetic processes. Mulder, nature didn't make this thing. We did.

(Mulder sighs. Scully hands him the folder. He flips through various pictures of horribly scarred and mutated people due to radiation.)

MULDER: I know these. These are from Chernobyl.

SCULLY: That creature came off of a decommissioned Russian freighter that was used in the disposal of salvage material from the meltdown. It was born in a... in a primordial soup of radioactive sewage.

(Mulder stares at the pictures.)

MULDER: You know, they say three species disappear off the planet every day. You wonder how many new ones are being created.

(Scully sighs, wondering the same thing. Mulder stands and walks towards the lake.)



SCENE 20
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY

(A normal night in the populace. Cars drive by a sewer grate, where below leads a tunnel. A broken sewer grate. In the water, another Fluke surfaces, most likely the one from the workman, it's eyes closed. It doesn't appear to be breathing. Then it's eyes open and it hisses in a few breaths.)

[THE END]
                                          BLOOD



SCENE 1
POSTAL CENTER; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(The machines are hard at work, and Ed Funsch is no different. A machine scrolls the envelopes by him, and he types up the zip code as they do. The read-out states the zip code he pressed. The read out reads "33515," then "08619," then "21227."

"Candice Field
4033 W. 20th Ave.
Liverpool, NY
13090"

The read-out says "13090."

"Barry Backus
1561 Jefferson Ave.
Avon, NY
14414"

The read-out says "14414."

(The next envelope is about to come through when the previous one gets jammed in the feed. The machine beeps repeatedly. He goes to take out the paper jam and cuts himself. He watches the blood drip out of the cut. His supervisor walks over.)

SUPERVISOR: Hey, Ed. You okay?

EDWARD FUNSCH: There's blood.

SUPERVISOR: It's only a paper cut. Um, listen, Ed. I need to talk to you.

(In the supervisor's office, the boss pours his employee a cup of water from the cooler. The cooler gurgles.)

There you go. Ed, uh... this is never easy. Ed, everybody down here sure likes you a lot, Funsch. And I know it's tough 'cause you're new to this area. Ed, I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to let you go. I mean, your work is first-rate, and like I said, you're a good guy. But you know the story. Cutbacks and seniority and... you're low man on the pole.

(Ed tries to salvage his dignity somewhat.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Could I work part-time?

(The supervisor sighs, unhappy of what he is doing. He takes out an envelope.)

SUPERVISOR: The guys took up a collection today. It's a hundred bucks.

(He puts the envelope in Funsch's pocket.)

Look, why don't you stay on till the end of the week?

(The supervisor walks out. Funsch sips his water, unhappy as hell. Funsch walks back over to his seat and starts again, typing even faster.

"Graham Coutts
2366 Wall Street
Greenville, RI
02828"

The read-out says "02828."

"Sherry Ross
1875 Bellevue #501
Syracuse, NY
13207"

The read-out says "13207."

"Jill Scott
1040 E. Broadway
Grand Rapids, MI
49548"

The read-out doesn't say "49548." There is a message on it.)

MESSAGE: Kill.

(Funsch stares at it, confused. It changes to "93021." He stares at it longer, unsure of what he saw. He goes back to typing.)

"Robin Hull
326 Simpson Street
Spring Valley, NY
10977"

The read-out says "10977."

"Jan Kobylka
2355 Mathers Ave.
Pittsburgh, PA
15214"

The read-out says "15214.")

Kill.

(Funsch is completely confused now. One second it reads "kill," the next it reads "15214." He looks around at his coworkers.)

Kill 'em.

(Funsch's eyes are wide.)

Kill 'em all.

SCENE 2
CIVIC CENTER; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(10:20 A.M. The elevator is crammed with various businessmen and women. One man has a nagging cough. Starting at eleven, the elevator goes down to seven when there is a ring and the door opens.)

WOMAN #1: Is there room in there for me?

MAN: Oh, I think we can make some.

WOMAN #1: Thank you.

(The elevator dings again and the door closes. A man in the back, Taber, is very agitated by the enclosed space and the cramped area. A woman coughs on a man in front of her.)

WOMAN #2: Excuse me.

(She continues to cough, as does the man. Taber looks over at the time on the read-out. But it changes.)

MESSAGE: No air.

(Taber looks away, then back at it, unsure if he saw it correctly as the elevator starts to move again.)

Can't breathe.

(He squints.)

Kill 'em all.

(The message changes again as Taber grows more agitated.)

Kill 'em.

(Later, police tape surrounds the scene. The photographer walks over to a body outside of the elevator. A deputy lifts the tape for the local Sheriff, Spencer.)

SPENCER: Hey, Ralph, how you doing?

RALPH: All right.

(Mulder, wearing rubber gloves, follows Spencer over to the body.)

SPENCER: Thanks for coming on such short notice. I realize the F.B.I.'s Behavioral Science Unit normally profiles murder suspects that are still at large, and it must be odd being asked to profile our suspects, all of whom are dead.

(Mulder kneels over a body and pulls up the blue cover to look at it.)

I am relieved the Bureau answered our request and sent you.

(Mulder stands.)

Because in all honesty, Agent Mulder... whatever's going on here is way over our heads.

(Mulder walks around the body to Spencer.)

The suspect's body is out on the sidewalk.

(They look at each other. Spencer sighs.)

We're holding the security guard who shot him. The witnesses in the elevator are down at the hospital. You can talk to them whenever you're ready.

(Mulder walks past Spencer, brooding, still not saying a word.)

I've asked all the businesses in the building to close for the day.

(Mulder walks into the elevator, which has blood smeared on the walls.)

We've done our best to preserve the area for you. We've thoroughly photographed the scene. The area has been sketched, but we haven't dusted for prints... yet. We wanted to wait for you before we collected further evidence.

(Mulder looks at the read-out, which is cracked.)

MULDER: Was this damaged during the incident?

(Spencer walks in and looks at it.)

SPENCER: I'll find out.

MULDER: May I see the suspect?

(Spencer nods. The two walk out of the area, under the yellow tape lifted by Ralph.)

SPENCER: Things like this aren't supposed to happen here.

MULDER: A forty-two year old real estate agent murders four strangers with his bare hands? That's not supposed to happen anywhere.

(They stop walking.)

SPENCER: No. Since colonial times, there's only been three murders in this area. In the last six months, seven people have killed twenty-two. Per capita, that's higher than the combined homicide rate of Detroit, D.C. and Los Angeles. This town is not any of those places. In Franklin, you'll never have to pull off the road to make way for a celebrity driving with a gun to his head.

(They start walking to the body.)

MULDER: In each incident, the suspect was killed?

SPENCER: Suicide by cop. Each incident occurred in a public place. The suspect went crazy and refused to desist when ordered. Officers used deadly force in order to save lives.

(They stop walking again.)

MULDER: Were autopsies conducted on the suspects for substance abuse?

SPENCER: Agent Mulder, this town is mainly made up of apple and cherry growers. These folks don't drink much. They certainly don't do drugs. Coroner's tests were negative.

(They walk over to the body. Mulder kneels over and pulls up the blue cover, looking at it. He examines the fingers closely, as they are covered with blood. He notices a green substance on two of the fingertips.)

I played softball with this guy over Labor Day. He was one of those nice guys... couldn't play and didn't bitch about being stuck in right field.

MULDER: What's wrong with right field?

SPENCER: Always the first one to shake hands at the end of the game. Didn't matter whether they won or lost.

MULDER: Got to have an arm to play right field.

SPENCER: Bought a round of beers afterwards, even though he didn't drink.

MULDER: I played right field.

(He encloses the hand in a bag.)

Let's have this analyzed by the bureau's lab.

SPENCER: What the hell could bring anyone to do this?

(Mulder stares at the hand.)



SCENE 3
FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(At Commercial Trust's ATM, the machine asks Funsch to enter his PIN number. He does so. He hears a mother talking behind him to a little girl illegibly. He chooses his transaction, but before he can choose the account, he hears something.)

MOTHER: Baby, you're bleeding.

(He slowly turns around to see the mother tending to her daughter's nosebleed, wiping the blood away.)

Tilt your head back. I told you to leave it alone, okay? Now, don't touch it or it'll bleed again. Tilt your head back.

(Funsch cringes at the bloody tissue. He looks back at the machine.)

MESSAGE: Security guard.

(He slowly looks over at the security guard to his right.)

Take his gun.

(He looks over to the security guard's gun.)

Kill 'em all.

(He shrieks, fearing he is going insane, and starts to punch the keyboard with both fists.)

SECURITY GUARD: Hey! Hey, what the hell's wrong with you?

(Funsch runs off. The guard takes his card and looks at the machine, which asks if he'd like another transaction.)



SCENE 4
VENANGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

(Mulder looks at photographs of the various homicide suspects. He talks over the scene.)

MULDER: Perpetrators of mass murders are divided into two classifications... the spree killer and the serial. The sudden violent outburst in a public locale and the suspect's disregard for anonymity or survival define the Franklin incidents as spree killings.



SCENE 5
FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Scully is reading the report on her computer, having it been transmitted to her.)

The confounding element of the profiles is that, given their backgrounds, the perpetrators would be, statistically, more likely the victims of violent crimes, rather than the originators.

(Cut to Venango County, where pictures of the killers are posted. But these are pictures of leisure and joy.)

The killers were all middle income, responsible people. None with a history of violence.

(The next set of pictures are the same people, only the photos of their bodies.)

Relatives and friends reported only minor displays of dysfunctional behavior. Sleep disorders, headaches, eating difficulties... but witnesses did report the last suspect displayed a claustrophobic reaction.

(Mulder hears a rumbling overhead and looks up. Cut to Scully.)

I'm convinced an outside factor is responsible, but I must concede frustration as to a determination of the cause.

(Cut to Mulder as he sits.)

A residue discovered on the fingers of the most recent perpetrator was analyzed and reported to be an undefined but nontoxic organic chemical found on plants...

(Cut to Scully.)

...perhaps remaining from gardening. There have been reported abductee paranoia in UFO mass abduction cases...

SCULLY: I was wondering when you'd get to that.

MULDER: I find no evidence of this to be the case.

(Scully seems stunned. Cut to Mulder.)

The single, connecting trace evidence to the killings is the destruction of an electronic device at the crime scene.

(Mulder looks at some pictures of the broken devices.)

A pager, a fax machine, a cellular phone, a gas pump digital display.

(He sits down at his laptop.)

In all honesty, Scully, I've never had a more difficult time developing a profile.

(Cut to Scully.)

There is no way to know who will be a killer... or who will be killed.



SCENE 6
FRANKLIN; PENNSYLVANIA

(Mrs. McRoberts apprehensively walks towards the mechanic garage, where the mechanic can be heard whistling. There is a dim light coming, mostly shadowed by the hood. There is a clattering of tools.)

MCROBERTS: Hello?

(She stops far from the car. No answer, just the sound of the ratchet turning.)

Hello?

(The mechanic is still behind the hood.)

MECHANIC: You're late.

MCROBERTS: I'm sorry. I called earlier. A deadline came up at work. If it's ready, I'll just pay you and... get out of here.

(The mechanic walks out from behind the hood.)

MECHANIC: How did you manage to break that anyhow?

MCROBERTS: Oh, it's a long story. Did you fix it?

MECHANIC: It's fixed.

MCROBERTS: What do I owe you?

MECHANIC: I'll tell you. In fixing that, I found some other problems. Serious problems, Mrs. McRoberts. Come back here, I'll show you.

(A shot of fear runs across McRoberts' face as she looks up from her purse. She gasps.)

MCROBERTS: I'm sorry. My husband's waiting for me. I have to go.

MECHANIC: Okay, but you ain't going to go very far unless you get this fixed. Come here.

(He walks behind the hood. She tenses up and follows. The mechanic continues to whistle. The mechanic stands and presses a button on a read-out. The engine starts up, frightening McRoberts.)

This is a diagnostic test of your engine. You're supposed to have an output of a hundred and sixty-eight horses at sixty-two hundred R.P.M.s. You're nowhere near that. Come over here. Next to me. I want you to take a look at this.

(She walks over as he bends down and looks under the hood.)

Well, first of all, you're leaking oil like crazy. Your throw rods are chattering, valves need adjustment.

(McRoberts looks over at the monitor where the read-out is.)

MESSAGE: Liar.

MECHANIC: And over here, you've got a couple of engine mounts that should be replaced.

MESSAGE: He's a liar.

MECHANIC: There's some arching off your coil wire... to tell you the truth, I think we should replace all the ignition wires.

MESSAGE: He'll rape you.

(The mechanic's voice drifts off as McRoberts is absolutely scared out of her wits, staring at the monitor.)

He'll kill you.

(She doesn't even blink.)

Kill him first.

MECHANIC: If you don't believe me, take a look here.

(He puts his hand on her shoulder. She gasps, picks up the ratchet, and slams him over the head with it. She shrieks. He yells in pain and falls, his head hitting the light as he does. She reaches up to hit him again, but he kicks her leg out. He reaches up and grabs a hammer, but she grabs a nozzle for an oil can. As he readies to hit her, she turns to face him, the nozzle in front of him. He gasps, screams, eyes wide, then falls, the nozzle jammed into his stomach. She walks away. The monitor now reads "Analysis Complete, Next." Later, two red dots come together to form one on the mechanic, then a flash. The photographer moves away from the body and Mulder kneels down and inspects it. He stands up and picks up the murder weapon, which is in a bag. He looks over at the computer read-out, which still reads "Analysis Complete, Next." Looking at a clipboard that had been hung to the wall, Spencer and Larry Winter walk over to him. The sheet on the clipboard reads that an oil change was done.)

LARRY WINTER: Agent Mulder? Larry Winter, county supervisor.

(They shake hands. Mulder holds up his gloved hand.)

MULDER: Uh, pardon my rubber.

LARRY WINTER: Can you tell me if... this murder is more of the same?

SPENCER: They don't seem to be connected.

LARRY WINTER: Well, should I be relieved or more scared? I mean, is this the start of copycat killers?

(Mulder flips through more of the clipboard.)

SPENCER: No, Larry, it's not a copy of the other homicides. This wasn't committed in a public area. The suspect fled, covering his tracks.

(Mulder reads the next page, which says that the air filter was repaired, then the next, which reads that the digital dashboard had a problem.)

And the killer appears not to have had a premeditated weapon.

(Mulder scrolls over to see that the digital read-outs on the dashboard were all smashed and replaced.)

MULDER: They are connected.



SCENE 7
McROBERTS' HOUSE

(Mrs. McRoberts opens the door to see Mulder and Spencer.)

MULDER: Mrs. McRoberts?

MCROBERTS: Yes?

MULDER: This is Sheriff Spencer, and I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

(He flashes her his badge.)

May we come in?

MCROBERTS: I'm late for work.

MULDER: You can blame me.

(Mulder and Spencer walk in.)

Been having some car trouble?

MCROBERTS: That's my husband's department.

MULDER: May I speak with him?

MCROBERTS: He just took the car to Pittsburgh for a business meeting.

(She opens the refrigerator and takes out a bag.)

Is it okay if I have my breakfast?

MULDER: It's the day's most important meal.

(She places the bag inside of the microwave and presses a few buttons. She looks at the read-out screen.)

MESSAGE: He knows.

(She gasps. Mulder takes out a paper.)

MULDER: Um... this invoice? It was, uh, signed by you. Did you pick up the car last night?

MESSAGE: Kill 'em both.

(She gasps and walks away from the microwave.)

MCROBERTS: Yes.

(Mulder walks over and looks at it. It reads "7:35 A.M." She places her food down on the counter.)

MULDER: Can you describe to me exactly how the dashboard read-out was damaged?

(She searches for a response that won't implicate her.)

Mrs. McRoberts?

MCROBERTS: I did it. I broke it.

MULDER: Why?

(She pulls open the drawer to reveal a set of butcher knives. Mulder does not notice.)

Mrs. McRoberts? Did you see something in the read-out? Mrs. McRoberts?

(She is almost crying, fingering the handle to one of the knives.)

I can help. Mrs. McRoberts?

(He places his hand on her shoulder. She shrieks and slashes his arm, knocking him down. She straddles his stomach and raises the knife to strike down.)

SPENCER: Stop!

MULDER: No!

(Spencer shoots her.)



SCENE 8
FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Scully pulls back the sheet to reveal the corpse of Mrs. McRoberts. She turns on the light and takes a scalpel. Her voice rings over the scene.)

SCULLY: Several anomalies were discovered in post-mortem analysis that were undetected in previous autopsies. Levels of adrenaline are known to be high in cases of violent death, twice as much as in victims of natural death. This subject's levels were two-hundred times normal.

(Later, she types her report up.)

The adrenal gland displayed extensive adrenal hemorrhage, yet not from disease, but rather from wear. Other physiological evidence present indicated intense phobia. Analysis of the vitreous humor extracted from the eyeball...

(Cut to Mulder, who picks up the file, a bandage wrapped around his wrist.)

...indicated the presence of high concentration of an undetermined chemical compound. This compound, at it's base, is similar to the substance analyzed earlier on a perpetrator's finger. Although further qualitative analysis must be performed, it is my opinion that this chemical, when reacting with adrenaline and other compounds secreted during phobic episodes, creates a substance to lysergic acid diethylamide... L.S.D.



SCENE 9
SHOPPING MALL; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(The shopping mall is busy today, and Funsch, decked out in his best suit, walks up to the customer service counter.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Pardon me. I'd like to apply for a job.

CLERK: Sorry. They're not accepting applications at this time.

(She puts a sign down that says "We'll be back in one hour" and walks off. Funsch, disheartened, wipes some sweat from his forehead and walks down the aisle to the electronics section. He reads a sign that says "Franklin Community Blood Drive.")

WOMAN: Sir? May we ask you to sign up for the blood drive?

(She extends the clipboard and pen, holding it over the word "blood" on a banner taped to the front of the table.)

Sir? Are you all right?

(Funsch, exasperated, walks off quickly.)

Sir?

(Funsch walks over to a set of monitors playing a football game. Suddenly, the monitors go white, then turn to static. They flash to various sights: Charles Manson, an scene from the L.A. riots, the Rodney King beating, an exploding building, another riot scene, and the famous O.J. Simpson-Bronco chase. The scenes cycle repeatedly in front of Funsch, who grows increasingly agitated and confused. The middle monitor goes black.)

MESSAGE: Behind you.

(He slowly looks behind to see the gun section.)

Do it!

(Funsch slowly makes his way towards the counter in the gun rack as the televisions revert to playing "Bobby's World" and a football game.)



SCENE 10
FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder is going for his morning jog when he sees a truck pull up to a house. A man seated on top takes a spade full of flies and throws them onto the lawn and gutter, then taps the side of the truck with it. Mulder watches as the truck drives off, then bends down and picks up one of the flies.)



SCENE 11
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Frohike's face is enlarged by the giant magnifying glass as Byers and Langly look on.)

FROHIKE: Hmmm...

BYERS: In our April edition of "The Lone Gunmen," we ran an article on the C.I.A.'s new CCDTH-twenty-one thirty-eight fiber-optic-lens micro-video camera.

LANGLY: Small enough to be placed on the back of a fly.

MULDER: Imagine being one of those flies on the wall of the Oval Office.

FROHIKE: Been there, done that.

(He smiles to his comrades as he takes the fly over to another desk. They follow.)

BYERS: That is a Eurasian cluster fly. They infest vegetation like, uh, apples or cherries and can inflict a great deal of damage to crops.

LANGLY: This one's probably been irradiated to control propagation.

BYERS: Or agents of competing South American agricultural corporations posing as Franklin city employees, are releasing fertile flies to destroy the crops.

(Frohike studies the fly, which is held by tweezers, then dunks it in a petrie dish full of liquid.)

FROHIKE: Nope. This bug's been nuked.

MULDER: It was a fine effort, though.

(He pats Byers on the back and picks up a folder.)

Have you ever come across this chemical compound?

(Langly points to the diagram of the chemical structure.)

LANGLY: L.S.D.M. Obviously, you haven't read our August edition of "T.L.G."

MULDER: Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day as my subscription to "Celebrity Skin."

(Langly laughs.)

BYERS: Come over here.

(They walk over to a television. Byers shuffles through a number of videotapes. Frohike, meanwhile, is fooling around with his night-vision goggles.)

FROHIKE: So, Mulder, where's your little partner?

MULDER: She wouldn't come. She's afraid of her love for you.

FROHIKE: She's tasty.

MULDER: You know, Frohike, it's men like you that give perversion a bad name.

(Byers takes out a cassette.)

BYERS: Here... toxic pesticides. The chemical you have in that report is called "lysergic dimethrin."

(He puts the videotape in the player. Langly sits.)

It's an unreleased experimental synthetic botanical insecticide. It attempts to act as a natural pheromone.

LANGLY: L.S.D.M. is sprayed on the plant, which invokes a fear response in the pest. You know, "get out of here, there's danger." The insect reacts and leaves the plant.

MULDER: Why won't they release it? Is it possible it affects humans in the same way?

BYERS: Possible?

(Byers and Langly smile.)

Let me show you something.

(Byers presses play. On the screen, a chemical is being sprayed out of a truck onto people's lawns.)

LANGLY: This is actual newsreel footage taken in the 50's. They're spraying D.D.T... a chemical the government did release and determine to be safe.

BYERS: Thirty years later...

(The spray goes over a crowd of women, all smiling, seated in rows.)

...they found out that women exposed to it had higher rates of breast cancer.

(Mulder sits. A man is spraying a number of joyful children in a pool.)

They convinced local officials it was even safe to spray on children. It took a decade of bureaucratic and industry heel-dragging before it was banned.

LANGLY: Different chemicals, same stunts.

BYERS: They just learned how not to be so obvious.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those?

FROHIKE: If I can have Scully's phone number.

(He smirks.)



SCENE 12
FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder is sitting on a hill, looking out over a cropfield. He looks through his goggles and sees nothing. Hearing a helicopter's blades, he looks again, but sees nothing. A dog barks as he walks down the hill and drives closer to the field. Walking slowly, the only sound is the crickets and the persistent dog. The wind picks up and there is a muffled rumbling. Mulder looks up to see a helicopter fly over, coating everything with the spray. Mulder falls to the ground, coughing, rubbing his eyes.)



SCENE 13
FRANKLIN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Scully finishes taking Mulder's blood as Winter talks to Spencer.)

LARRY WINTER: Stealth helicopters? Experimental pesticides responsible for violent behavior?

MULDER: I saw the chopper from two different locations. Look at my skin, feel my hair. The insecticide is still on me.

LARRY WINTER: I checked up on you. You have a penchant for... "Spooky" evidence.

(Mulder looks over to Scully briefly.)

MULDER: Don't start with that tired crap. Don't start diverting blame.

LARRY WINTER: Hang on a second here...

MULDER: Look, if you're the one responsible for the illegal spraying, then the sooner you take responsibility, the sooner people will stop dying. The killers all resided near heavily sprayed areas.

LARRY WINTER: You don't live here, Mulder. I live here. I have my heart in this town. I have three children. I'm not going to dump poison on them.

MULDER: Yeah, well, if it's so safe, why was it done in secret?

LARRY WINTER: What kind of a crusade are you on?

SPENCER: Answer the question. Are we spraying?

(Winter looks away from them, takes a few steps, then looks back.)

LARRY WINTER: This county lives on money generated from its crops. The irradiated flies were not effective. The delays to get approval to spray would have caused millions in crop damage. Look at the hell they raised in California over malathion. Meanwhile, people's lives were being ruined by a... a damn bug.

SPENCER: Ruined? Twenty-three people are dead.

LARRY WINTER: There is no proof whatsoever of the spray caused violent behavior. It was proven to me to be safe.

MULDER: By who? Who proved it to you?

(Winter looks at them angrily, then walks out.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right. I'd love to tell you that I flew three-hundred miles in the middle of the night to perform tests that prove that you're about to become the next Charles Manson... but I find little physiological evidence that L.S.D.M. has toxically affected you... even after massive ingestion.

MULDER: Scully, your own autopsy reported the killer had chemical anomalies.

SCULLY: Yes, but you are proof that it wasn't from exposure to L.S.D.M.

SPENCER: May I see that chart, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Sure.

(He walks over to Scully. Mulder looks up at the television.)

These are normal, right here...

(It says "do it." Mulder watches the screen. The screen says in progressively bigger letters, "Do it. Do it now." There are no messages, because the next shot is of a women doing step aerobics with a shirt that says "Do it.")

...subjected to successive L.S.D.M. sprays...

MULDER: Scully. Are you familiar with subliminal messages?

SCULLY: You mean like... sex and ice cubes in liquor in ice cube ads? That's paranoia.

MULDER: No, it's a fact that some department stores use subliminal messages in their ambient music to deter shoplifting. And the Russians have been using advanced electroensephelographic techniques to control behavior.

SCULLY: And how is this connected with the spraying?

MULDER: Electronic devices were destroyed by every perpetrator.

(Spencer looks at Mulder strangely.)

SCULLY: I'm still waiting.

MULDER: The insecticide L.S.D.M. is known to invoke a fear response in cluster flies. What if the chemical causes the same reaction in humans? All the perpetrators were phobic. Taber was claustrophobic. McRoberts' husband stated she had a paranoia about rape. The insecticide heightened their already existing phobia to an unbearable level. Then the electronic devices relayed messages that told them specifically what to do with their fear in order to alleviate it. The messages were relayed purposely.

SCULLY: By who?

(Mulder sighs. Spencer, who had been pretty caught up in it until now, walks out. Mulder walks over to the door and looks out, then walks back into the middle of the room.)

MULDER: Yeah, he's probably one of those people that thinks Elvis is dead.

SCULLY: Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to the insecticide does induce paranoia.

MULDER: I think this area is being subjected to a controlled experiment.

SCULLY: Controlled by who? By the government? By a corporation? By Reticulans?

MULDER: They've done it before. D.D.T. in the 50's, Agent Orange, germ warfare on unsuspecting neighborhoods.

SCULLY: Yes, but why, Mulder? Why would they intentionally create a populace that destroys itself?

MULDER: Fear. It's the oldest tool of power. If you're distracted by fear of those around you, it keeps you from seeing the actions of those above.

(Spencer walks in.)

SPENCER: I just had a talk with Mister Winter. I have persuaded him to a compromise. He's agreed to stop the spraying immediately and to blood testing extensively the people exposed to the spray area.

MULDER: But?

SPENCER: But... the official explanation of the testing cannot be linked to the side-effects of L.S.D.M.

(Mulder sits.)



SCENE 14
EDWARD FUNSCH'S HOUSE

(Funsch is watching a commercial on the local blood drive. The screen reads "Free Cholesterol Testing.")

WOMAN ON TV: Franklin and Fanengo counties are participating in an important nationwide study on cholesterol. Volunteers will be coming to your door, or you may report at your convenience to Franklin Community General. The procedure is very simple and painless.

(On the television, the doctor pricks the patient's finger with the needle.)

Just a little prick on the fingertip and your participation is complete.

(They show a close-up of the drop of blood on the patient's finger. Funsch cringes.)

And appreciated. So remember, cholesterol screening can save your life.

(Funsch looks back at the gun and the many bullets he purchased.)

So when those volunteers come to your door, answer readily, or you may report at your convenience to Franklin Community General. Thank you.

(The doorbell buzzes loudly, startling Funsch. He runs to his window and looks out to see one of the volunteers for the cholesterol screening. She presses the doorbell twice more. Funsch pulls the blinds shut as the volunteer buzzes again. Funsch looks down at the television.)

MESSAGE: Blood.

(Funsch grows more agitated as the letters grow larger on the screen. He yells and slams the television down onto the floor, face first, shattering the glass front. The nurse continues to press the doorbell rapidly, in almost a pattern. Funsch looks down at the gun, covering his ears from the annoying buzzing. He runs his fingers over the scope, then closes the case. A small calculator drops to the floor. He picks it up and reads the screen.)

Blood.

(He smashes it and stands. Looking out the window nervously, his watch goes off. He looks at it.)

Kill.

(The read-out blinks the message.)



SCENE 15
VENANGO COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

(Spencer is on the phone.)

SPENCER: And your test results on the blood samples were double-checked? Are you sure? Uh-huh.

(He hangs up and walks over to the agents, who are standing by a map of the area.)

Last area just reported in. Okay, these are the sectors that have tested negative.

(He circles an area with his finger.)

This is a list of people who, for one reason or another, haven't checked out. There's about twenty-five.



SCENE 16
EDWARD FUNSCH'S HOUSE; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(The names "Faherty, Mary" and "Francis, Kenneth" have been crossed off. The next name is "Funsch, Edward.")

MULDER: Only seven more to go.

(Scully looks over at the doorbell, which has been ripped out of the wall. She picks up the buzzer.)

SCULLY: This is odd.

(Mulder looks at the frayed wire.)

MULDER: Frustrated Jehovah's witness?

(Scully opens the door.)

SCULLY: Door's unlocked.

(They draw their guns and walk inside. The room is in a complete mess. Scully looks down at the broken television, which is covering the floor. Mulder opens up the gun case. The gun is gone. Later, an officer walks out past Mulder and Spencer, who are standing in the doorway. Scully walks up to them and hands Mulder a folder.)

SCULLY: Here it is.

(Mulder slowly walks into the main room, which is swamped with officials. Mulder starts to read the file.)

MULDER: Edward Funsch, age fifty-two. No diploma, no vehicle or driver's license, navy radio man, wife died ten years ago. No kids. No known family, just been laid-off.

(A picture of Funsch is attached to the file.)

Medical history?

SCULLY: Nothing. I mean, he hasn't seen a doctor in decades.

MULDER: When was the blood tester here?

SPENCER: About ten-thirty this morning.

MULDER: Ten-thirty?

(He picks up a small bag containing the crushed watch. The time reads ten-twenty-five.)

The blood test. I know what he's afraid of... and I know where he's going.



SCENE 17
FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(The destination of the bus is Franklin Community General Hospital. A few people get off, then two more get on. The bus starts off as Funsch desperately runs after it.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Hey, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey!

(The bus stops. Funsch runs up to the door and bangs on it.)

BUS DRIVER: All right, all right, hold on a second.

(Funsch bangs on the door harder. It opens and he boards.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Funsch.

(He deposits some change into the machine and takes the first seat, laying the bag down on the next seats. He looks around, paranoid, then over to the electronic read-out. The letters change and he leans in.)

MESSAGE: They're waiting.

(Funsch leans in and looks at it. The next message appears.)

Get off.

(He clutches the bag tighter and walks up to the driver.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Pardon me.

BUS DRIVER: Wait for the next stop.

EDWARD FUNSCH: Please! I'm on the wrong bus.

BUS DRIVER: Wait for the next stop.

(Funsch is completely gone now, screaming.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Open the door! Open the door! God, open the door, damn it!



SCENE 18
FRANKLIN COMMUNITY HOSPITAL; FRANKLIN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Spencer walks out of the building, motioning for another officer to head the other way.)

MAN ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Uh, C-one, this is X-ray-four. Negative on that North-South line.

SPENCER: Copy that.

(He walks up to Mulder and Scully.)

If he's on it, it's going to be this line.

(They turn to see the bus pulling up.)

MULDER: Here it comes.

SCULLY: Get the uniforms out of sight.

(Spencer nods and starts off. Mulder and Scully duck behind a wall as the bus screeches to a halt, each clutching their guns. Spencer ducks behind a car. Passengers file off, then two get on. Mulder and Scully go up to the bus and Mulder bangs on the door, then flashes the driver his badge. The driver opens the door.)

MULDER: Have you seen this man?

(He hands the driver the picture of Funsch.)

BUS DRIVER: Yeah, I picked him off. Drove four feet, then he went apewire.

MULDER: Where'd you let him out?

BUS DRIVER: Near the college.

SCULLY: We'll have to wait him out.

(The bus drives off.)

MULDER: I don't think he's waiting.

(Mulder looks at a sign advertising the Franklin Blood Drive at Franklin Community College.)



SCENE 19
FRANKLIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE

(The blood drive is booming. People are walking by and signing up. Orange juice is ready on the table. Funsch looks around, then at an electronic sign which scrolls: "Blood drive Sat 11-5." He looks away, then back at it.)

MESSAGE: Up.

(Funsch looks over to a clock tower. Understanding, he heads for it. Mulder and Spencer race towards the college, followed by another car. Funsch slowly makes his way up the winding steps, carrying his weapons in the duffel bag. He stops, looks out the window, then continues. Mulder puts the cellular to his ear.)

MULDER: Scully, anything?

(Cut to Scully, who is still outside the college.)

SCULLY: Nothing.

(Cut back to Mulder, who closes the phone, annoyed. Funsch reaches the top of the stairs, wheezing, then looks around at the various windows. He puts his duffel bag down on the ground, wipes his forehead, then unzips it. Pulling out a box of two-hundred cartridge ammunition full metal jacket bullets, bullets spill onto the floor as he stands, trying to pull it out of the bag. Parts of the rifle fall as well. The police cars arrive at the scene and Mulder and Spencer get out. They start to check around as Funsch studies a bullet off the floor, then loads it. He raises the gun to the window and looks through the scope. Spencer and Mulder cannot see him. Funsch squeezes the trigger slowly. A gunshot rings out and the chest to the ambulance driver explodes after the bullet goes through the windshield. Women scream as people drop to the floor in terror.)

SPENCER: Get down! Get down!

MULDER: Get down!

(The two try to work the crowd out of their frenzy.)

Get down! Get down!

(A container of orange juice explodes on the table as it is hit with another bullet, driving the crowd into an even more excited state. Spencer gets on the bullhorn.)

SPENCER: Please remain calm! Stay away from the building!

(Mulder searches for the shooter and sees the rifle sticking out of the window in the clock tower. He races, ducking, to the police car, where more deputies are positioned. Funsch fires again, then reloads, smiling, licking his lips slightly. The bullet drops to the floor, then he loads another into its chamber. Taking aim, he pulls the trigger again. Mulder makes his way towards the building.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: I've seen that all and I've seen that and I don't want to see that again, baby.

(He sobs, then shrieks as he loads another bullet into the chamber, completely insane. He pulls the trigger. Spencer ducks behind the car and speaks into the walkie-talkie.)

SPENCER: All units, forthwith, Franklin College. Shots fired. Send emergency vehicles.

(He looks up at the tower. Funsch gleefully fires another shot, then reloads quickly. Everything becomes a blur with Funsch, firing another shot and emotions flickering rapidly. He fires again and screams with joy. He runs his hands through his hair repeatedly. Mulder gets in the building and looks up. Hearing another shot, he races up the stairs. Bullets fall to Funsch's feet as he giggles like a madman, reloading and firing again. Mulder hears it and runs faster, clutching his gun tighter. Funsch searches for a bullet. Mulder trips and slices open the side of his wrist on a step, cringing in pain. Funsch fires again then shrieks girlishly, running his hand through his hair. Funsch loads, fires, and loads again. Mulder pops out of the stairwell, gun trained on Funsch.)

MULDER: Put it down!

(Funsch is shocked. Mulder slowly climbs up to the floor.)

Put it down!

EDWARD FUNSCH: Don't kill me.

MULDER: Then put it down, Ed.

EDWARD FUNSCH: I can't. They won't let me.

MULDER: I know they won't, Ed. I know they won't let you.

(Funsch nods sadly.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: Then... you make me put it down, then. You do it.

(He grips the handle tighter. Mulder slowly walks towards him.)

MULDER: If you don't put it down, I'm going to have to shoot you. Or you're going to have to shoot me.

(Funsch smiles slightly.)

There's going to be blood... everywhere.

(Funsch starts to lower his weapon, realizing this. Mulder reaches out for the gun. Funsch sees the bloodstained cuff on Mulder's shirt and screams. He swings the butt of the gun at Mulder, but Mulder ducks. Funsch swings it a second time, but Mulder grabs the rifle and elbows Funsch. The rifle falls down the stairwell. Mulder takes Funsch's wrist and puts his arm behind his back in a hammerlock, then pushes him down onto the ground. Funsch gags slightly as Mulder handcuffs him.)

EDWARD FUNSCH: They'll kill me.

MULDER: It's all right.

(Paramedics wheel a strapped-down Funsch into the ambulance. Spencer walks over to Mulder.)

SPENCER: Agent Scully will examine him at the hospital. You can call her there.

MULDER: I want unrestricted access to him for questioning.

SPENCER: Mulder... you know more about what happened to him than he does.

(He walks away. The ambulance drives off, putting on the siren. Mulder sits down on the banister and starts to dial Scully's number on the cellular phone. He puts the phone to his ear, but hears a strange garbling. He looks down at the phone.)

MESSAGE: All done.

(Mulder stares at the screen.)

Bye-bye.

(Mulder cannot take his eyes off the screen as it changes to "555-3364" and starts to ring. Scully can be heard through the phone as Mulder stares at the phone.)

SCULLY: Scully. Hello? Mulder, is that you? Mulder, where are you? Mulder? Mulder, where are you?

(Mulder doesn't even blink.)

[THE END]

                                         SLEEPLESS



SCENE 1
NEW YORK CITY,NY
11:23 PM

Dr. Saul Grissom sits and watches his Television. Hears rumbling outside his door, opens it and there is fire.

GRISSOM: AH!

Calls 911

OPERATOR: 911 operator, please state emergency.

GRISSOM: Yeah, this is Dr. Saul Grissom. Theres a fire outside my apartment. Im trapped.

OPERATOR: Are you at 700 East 56th street?

GRISSOM: Yes, apt. 606. For gods sake, hurry

OPERATOR: Fire units are being dispatched right now, sir. Please stay on the line.

(He grabs a fire extinguisher.)

GRISSOM: Somebody help! Ah!

Flames consume the room and he starts to choke from smoke inhalation as firemen race up the stairs. A large black man is seen going down the stairs. Much chaos and shouting.

FIREMAN 1: Get a crew up to the roof!

LT. REAGAN: This is Lt. Reagan and we have a possible 23 false alarm in apartment six-zero-six. Lets confirm that location, 606.

WOMAN AT OTHER END OF RADIO: Yes, thats affirmative, 606.

REAGAN: Its cold, lets do it!

The men break in the door and find nothing but Grissoms dead body

FIREMAN: He looks dead.

Mulder opens his paper at his apartment and a tape falls out along with Dr. Grissoms article circled.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
Scene flashes to Mulder and Skinner listening to the 911 tape in the ADs office.

MULDER: The article makes no mention of the fire.

SKINNER: Yes, Agent Mulder, I can read.

MULDER: Grissoms company had a number of government contracts which would place this investigation within the Bureaus jurisdiction.

SKINNER: But thats not why you want the assignment.

MULDER: I think that the circumstances surrounding Grissoms death warrant a closer look. I called NYPD but they wont even talk to me unless I get the Attorney General to sign off on it.

SKINNER: Whered you get the tape. Presumably, someone had led you to believe that there is more here than is being reported.

MULDER: My source, the only one I have ever trusted, is dead.

SKINNER: Ill look into this further and Ill let you know. In the mean time, you have 24 hours of wiretap that needs to be transcribed.

PERSON ON TAP: Are you comin over or what? You said you was comin over two hours ago and Im waitin here like some stupid bimbo who aint got nothin better to do with her time. . .

Mulder rewinds tape some

PERSON: . . .waitin here like some stupid bimbo who aint got nothin better to do with her time than to sit around here waitin for you.

KRYCEK: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

KRYCEK: Its your 302. Assistant Director Skinner just approved it.

MULDER: Theres a mistake here. Theres been another agent assigned to the case.

KRYCEK: That would be me. Krycek, Alex Krycek.

MULDER: Skinner didnt say anything about taking on a new partner.

KRYCEK: It wasnt Skinner. Actually, I opened the file 2 Hours before your request so technically, its my case.

MULDER: And you all ready talked to the police?

KRYCEK: Yeah, just hung up on the officer in charge a few minutes ago. A detective named Whorton. Turns out Grissom called 911 to report a fire.

MULDER: I heard the tape.

KRYCEK: Did you hear that forensics found a spent fire extinguisher on the floor. Grissoms prints were all over it. The walls and floor in his living room were covered with ammonium phosphate.

MULDER: But no trace of a fire.

KRYCEK: Not even a burnt match.

MULDER: That all you know?

KRYCEK: So far. What do you think it means?

MULDER: Listen, I appreciate the show and tell, and I dont want you to take this personally, but I work alone. Ill straighten things out with Skinner.

KRYCEK: Its my case, Agent Mulder. Look, I may be---green, but I had the case first and Im not going to give it away so quickly.

MULDER: All right, Ill tell you what, I got a little work to finish up around here. Why dont you go down to the motor pool and requisition us a car and Ill meet you down there.

KRYCEK: Thats all. I mean you dont have a problem with us working together.

MULDER: Its your party.

KRYCEK: Well, um, Ill get the car.

Krycek walks away with a satisfied smile and Mulder watches him go.



SCENE 3
Scene flashes to Scully in an autopsy class.

SCULLY: Electrocution effects electrolytic conduction, disrupting the heart beat and most of the autonomic systems. Death actually occurs from tissue damage, and necrosis in the heart itself, particularly in the sinus and the atria ventricular nodes. . .

MAN: Agent Scully, sorry to interrupt, but you have a call from a George Hale, says its urgent.

SCULLY: Excuse me.

Scully picks up the phone.

SCULLY: Where are you?



SCENE 4

MULDER: National airport. Catching the shuttle up to Laguardia in a half an hour. How do you feel about joining me in the Big Apple for an autopsy.

SCULLY: Whats going on?

MULDER: I was hoping you could tell me.

SCULLY: I cant do it today. My last class isnt until 4:30.

MULDER: Thats fine. I can have the ME wrap the body to go

SCULLY: Mulder. . .

MULDER: Youll get it by five.

SCULLY: (lets out an exasperated sigh.) Whats the name?



SCENE 5
Scene flashes to Grissoms sleep disorder clinic.

NURSE: Dr. Grissoms alpha-wave analysis defined the standard, he revolutionized the way we think about sleep. His death was a tremendous loss to the scientific community.

MULDER: How many other kinds of sleep disorder did he treat?

NURSE: There are 38 different dissomnias and parasomnias. Dr. Grissom treated them all with an unprecedented success ratio.

MULDER: Maintaining that kind of batting average must have taken its toll.

NURSE: Excellence demands certain sacrifices.

MULDER: Did he ever show any signs of psychological stress?

NURSE: Not really. Except for his own occasional bout of insomnia.

MULDER: But he was never delusional.

NURSE: Of course not.

MULDER: Whats his story?

NURSE: This patients night terrors prevent him from cycling out REM sleep into the more restful slow wave sleep. Its still experimental, but what were trying to do is modify his brain wave patterns externally.

MULDER: How do you do that?

NURSE: Electrical stimulation of the occipital lobe creates simply visual and auditory hallucinations.

MULDER: So its actually possible to alter somebodys dreams?

NURSE: In theory, yes.



SCENE 6
Outside the clinic. Krycek walks out of a car and towards Mulder.

KRYCEK: I paid off your cab. Hey, I dont appreciate being ditched like someones bad date

MULDER: Im sorry if I hurt your feelings.

KRYCEK: Where do you get off copping this attitude. You dont even know the first thing about me.

MULDER: Exactly.

KRYCEK: You know, back at the academy, some of the guys used to make fun of you.

MULDER: Oh stop it, or youll hurt my feelings.

KRYCEK: But there were some of us who followed your work. Believed what you were doing because we knew that there was more out there than they were telling us.

Mulders cell phone rings.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Grissom didnt die from cardiac arrest.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: I think you should come down and take a look for yourself. I havent even started on the chest and abdomen yet and Ill have a lot more to tell you then.

MULDER: I can make it in two hours.

Mulder reaches for the door. Krycek holds up the keys.

KRYCEK: Where are we going.



SCENE 7
Scene flashes to Scullys autopsy bay. She places a large organ on the scale.

MULDER: Spleen or pancreas?

SCULLY: Stomach. I was just about to start on it.

MULDER: This is Alex Krycek. Were, uh, working the case together.

SCULLY: Good to meet you.

KRYCEK: You too.

He holds out his hand, she walks right by it.

SCULLY: Notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse.

Krycek coughs into fist, loudly.

SCULLY: This condition generally occurs several hours after death. Its caused by a coagulation of muscle proteins when the body is exposed to extremely high temperatures.

MULDER: Like fire?

SCULLY: This degree of limb flexion is observed exclusively in burn-related victims.

KRYCEK: But there was no fire.

SCULLY: And no epidermal burns to indicate as much but when I opened up the skull, I found external hemorrhages, which can only be caused by intense heat. Some how, this man suffered all of the secondary, but none of the primary physiological signs of being in a fire.

MULDER: Any theories?

SCULLY: I couldnt even begin to explain what could have caused this. Its almost as if. . .

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Its almost as if his body believed that it was burning.



SCENE 8
Scene flashes to a man watching the home shopping network in a run down apartment. You see a scar on his neck.

COLE: You left the door open, Willie.

HENRY: Preacher?

COLE: Not a good idea leaving your door open in this neighborhood. You never know whos gonna drop by.

HENRY: What are you doin here? How long ya been in town? Want a beer?

COLE: How ya doin, Henry? Huh? How ya been?

HENRY: How am I doin? Im, uh,---tryin to forget. You know. Im trying to get it out of my head.

COLE: No luck?

HENRY: (lets out a laugh.) And Im, uh, still fightin it, you know. I keep seein the faces. Every day I see---aw, whats the difference. Were all goin to Hell, right?

COLE: Where you think we been the last 24 years? After this, whatever you is gonna seem like you get a wine invitation.

HENRY: What do you want here, Preacher? You killed them, didnt you. You killed Grissom, I saw it on TV

COLE: He had to pay, Henry. All of us have to answer for what did over there---cant get away from it.

Many Vietnamese people appear, holding guns

HENRY: No.

COLE: He retains that is anger forever because he delights in mercy. He will turn again. He will have compassion on us. He will subdue our inequities and he will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. Its all right, Henry. Its all over now.

The Vietnamese people raise their guns and fire at Henry, killing him.



SCENE 9
The scene goes to the FBI headquarters. Mulder and Krycek look at photos of a murdered man posted on a bulletin board.

KRYCEK: The victims name was Henry Willig. Unemployed and lived on disability. Police found no indication of force entry of struggle, no abrasions or contusions on the body and cause of death is being listed as a burst aneurysm.

MULDER: So, why did your friend from homicide call us.

KRYCEK: Because the medical examiner called him. The autopsy revealed forty-three small internal hemorrhages and skeletal fragments which doesnt just happen spontaneously. Not without some corresponding external trauma.

MULDER: So what does the ME have to say about it?

KRYCEK: He said if he didnt know otherwise, he would swear they were gunshot wounds.

MULDER: Whats this scar right here?

KRYCEK: According to his medical history, the only surgery he ever had was an appendectomy.

MULDER: Well, unless they got to his appendix through his neck.

KRYCEK: Maybe it happened during Vietnam. Willig did a tour with the Marines in 1970, and Im sure they didnt keep the best of records.

MULDER: Willig was a Marine? So where do all Marines receive basic training on the East coast?

KRYCEK: Parris Island.

MULDER: Where Grissom was stationed from 1968 to 1971.

KRYCEK: Which means that he and Willig were there at the same time, 24 years ago.

MULDER: Here we go. Willig was assigned to Special Forces on Re-con squad J-7. Of thirteen original members, hes one of two survivors.

KRYCEK: Until yesterday.

MULDER: This leaves us with one person who can tell us what happened on Parris Island.



SCENE 10

Scene flashes to a sleep disorder clinic.

DOCTOR: Ive been supervising Mr. Coles treatment since I admitted him twelve years ago. Fraid you wont find him very cooperative, though.

MULDER: We just want to ask him a few questions about his military service.

DOCTOR: He doesnt respond very well to authority figures.

MULDER: Is that why you put him in isolation?

DOCTOR: Oh, weve had to house Mr. Cole in this section of the ward because he kept interfering with our treatment of the other patients.

MULDER: How was he interfering?

DOCTOR: He was disrupting their sleep patterns. Psychiatric patients especially, its critical that the Circadian cycles be strictly maintained. . .

MULDER: Excuse me, but exactly how would Cole disrupt their sleep?

DOCTOR: Here we are. Mr. Cole, there are some gentlemen here to. . .

Cole is not in his cell when the door is opened.

RECEPTIONIST: You discharged him just a few days ago.

DOCTOR: I most certainly did not. Dont you think I would remember if I did.

RECEPTIONIST: Well, I was on shift, Doctor. You signed the order yourself. Thats your signature, isnt it?

MULDER: Lets get Coles face onto the wire.

Mulders cell phone rings.

MULDER: Mulder.

X: Mr. Mulder. I have obtained some information that may shed some light on your current work. You must exercise discretion when we meet. If anyone follows you, I wont be there.



SCENE 11
Scene flashed to an old, abandon warehouse.

MULDER: Who are you?

X: Who I am is irrelevant.

MULDER: Why are you trying to help me?

X: You think I want to be here, Agent Mulder? I dont want to be here.

MULDER: What is this?

X: Data from a top secret military project. Borne of the idea that sleep was the soldiers greatest enemy.

MULDER: Of course. Someone was conducting sleep deprivation experiments on Parris Island.

X: Not deprivation, eradication.

MULDER: Why?

X: Why else? To build a better soldier. Sustained wakefulness dulls fear, heightens aggression. Science had just put a man on the moon. So they looked to science to win a losing war.

MULDER: And Willig and Cole were the lab rats.

X: Lab rats with the highest kill ratio in the marine corps. 4,000 plus confirmed kills for a thirteen man squad.

MULDER: You think Coles behind whats happening now?

X: Im not here to do your thinking, Agent Mulder. All I know is Augustus Cole hasnt slept in 24 years. Theres someone else you should see. A member of the squad who was reportedly killed in action.

MULDER: I thought Cole was the last.

X: His name is on the envelope.

MULDER: So how do I contact you?

X: You cant

MULDER: I may still need more.

X: You still dont get it, do you? Closing the X-Files, separating you and Scully was only the beginning. The truth is still out there, but its never been more dangerous. The man we both knew paid for that information with his life, a sacrifice Im not willing to make.



SCENE 12
Mulder waits in the car and pushes his newly acquired envelope under the car seat.

KRYCEK: Where were ya? Someone matching Coles description just robbed a drugstore in Queens and the place is located under a motel just around the corner.

MULDER: Is he alive?

KRYCEK: He was when the night man just saw him. So where were ya?

They enter the hotel.

KRYCEK: Detective Whorton? Im Agent Krycek, this is Agent Mulder

WHORTON: Ive been waiting for you guys. I tried holding the swat guys back but theyre getting a little antsy. For what its worth, Cole didnt steal dime-one from that drug store, just a bunch of pills.

Three gunshots are fired and a scream is heard. Mulder and Krycek race up the stairs.

KRYCEK: Inside, NOW! Officer down!

MAN: We got two officers down, request emergency vehicles, immediately.

Cole is seen against the wall outside.

KRYCEK: Whats going on here Mulder? These two officers, they shot each other.



SCENE 13
Scene flashes to Scully typing on her computer.

SCULLY: Also in the described in the report, is a highly experimental neurosurgical procedure meant to induce a permanent waking state. The procedure involved cutting out part of the brainstem in the mid-frontal region which would explain Henry Willigs scar. A similar scar should also be evident on Augustus Cole. Post-op treatment also included a regiment of synthetic supplements to replenish the organic deficits caused by prolong lack of sleep. This is consistent with the anti-depressants Cole robbed from the pharmacy. These drugs maintain serotonin levels in the blood. Serotonin being the primary substance produced during sleep. While it is theoretically possible that this procedure greatly diminished the subjects need for sleep, I can neither quantify nor substantiate its success without further clinical evidence.

Telephone rings.

SCULLY: Scully

MULDER: Well, that second officer is still in a coma, so I dont think we can count on him to give us an answer.

SCULLY: Im going over these reports you faxed me. Theyre incredible.

MULDER: Well, the military all ready sent troops to radioactive mushroom clouds, I guess they figured they had to top themselves, right?

SCULLY: Sleep eradication still doesnt explain the shooting of those two officers, or the anomalous autopsy results on Willig and Dr. Grissom.

MULDER: Well, I learned something at Dr. Grissoms clinic. About what happens to a persons cortex when you stimulate it with electricity.

SCULLY: They experience mild visual and auditory hallucinations, any first year med. student could tell you that.

MULDER: Well, what if that stimulus were to come from a remote source? What if Cole had somehow developed the ability to project his unconscious.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that Cole killed these people with telepathic images?

MULDER: Think about it, Scully. In all those years without REM sleep, maybe Cole built a bridge between the waking world and the dream world. A collective unconscious. And what if, by existing consciously in the unconscious world, he developed the ability to externalize his dreams and effectively alter reality.

SCULLY: Even if youre right, youll have a much better chance of finding Cole if you work up a profile and try to surmise his next move.

MULDER: All right, Ill sharpen my pencils and Ill see you later.

Krycek beckons towards Mulder.

MULDER: Ill be right there, Krycek.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: Were gonna check out another member of the squad and see if he can tell us anything about Cole.

SCULLY: Sounds like your new partners working out.

MULDER: Hes all right. He could use a little more seasoning and some wardrobe advice But hes a lot more open to extreme possibilities then. . .

SCULLY: Then I was?

MULDER: . . .then I assumed he would be.

SCULLY: Must be nice not having someone question your every move, poking holes in all your theories.

MULDER: Oh yeah, its---its great. Im surprised I put up with you so long.

SCULLY: Youd better go. Ill read over this report again and see what else I can come up with.

MULDER: Okay.

Hangs up phone.



SCENE 14

Mulder and Krycek walk into a diner.

MULDER: Salvatore Matola?

MATOLA: You gonna shoot me? You gonna kill me?

MULDER: Were with the FBI. We just want to ask you some questions. Whyd you think we were gonna kill you?

MATOLA: I dunno.

MULDER: You know about Willig and Grissom.

MOTOLA: I read about it in the paper. I guess theyre finally killin us all off.

MULDER: Who? Hey Sal, can you spare a few minutes?

MATOLA: I guess so. I got a break comin up. Spare a few minutes. I guess. They said its be like living two lifetimes. At---at first, thats what it was like. Not having to sleep at all made us feel like nothin could touch us, you know? Wed do 24 hour patrols, night ambushes, you know, and that type of thing.

MULDER: And you never got tired?

MATOLA: No. Not so that we had to sleep. And then, nothing that the pills couldnt fix.

MULDER: Serotonin?

MATOLA: Yeah.

MULDER: How long did this go on?

MATOLA: Quite awhile, Id say. Quite awhile until we stopped taking orders from the company commander in Saigon.

KRYCEK: You mean the entire squad went AWOL?

MATOLA: Yeah, somethin like that.

MULDER: Well, then who did you take orders from?

MATOLA: We just made up missions as we went along, until it didnt matter anymore who we were killing. Farmers, women. Outside of Phu Bai, there was this school, they were just kids.

KRYCEK: No one ever tried to stop you?

MATOLA: No, sir.

MULDER: We suspect that Augustus Cole may be behind the murders of Willig and Grissom.

MATOLA: Preacher? Thats what we used to call him on account that he was always reading from his bible, saying this and that about judgment day. Sayin that well have to pay for what we were doin'. Thats what he said back then, thats what hes sayin.

MULDER: But why Grissom. He was never in country, he wasnt even part of the squadron.

MATOLA: Sure he was. He made us what we are. Him and Dr. Gerardi.

MULDER: Whos Gerardi?

MATOLA: The other Doc. The one who did the surgeries on us. Its because of him, I havent slept a night in 24 years.



SCENE 15
Mulder and Krycek are stuck in a traffic jam -- the Long Island Expressway at rush hour.

MULDER: Were going after Gerardi. Cole sees himself as a kind of avenging angel. In his mind, everyone responsible for the atrocities, whether directly or indirectly, must be punished.

KRYCEK: Yeah, but why now. Why after all these years.

MULDER: Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres of the war. Over 300 children slaughtered. But unlike My Lai, no US troops were ever charged. The 24th anniversary of the massacre was two days ago.

Mulders cell phone rings.

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: I think I found the Francis Gerardi youre looking for. Hes a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.

MULDER: Do you have his number in Boston?

SCULLY: Yes, except hes coming to New York for Grissoms funeral, tonight. HeS arriving at bronx station on the 7:30 train.

MULDER: Try to have a photograph waiting for us at the security desk so we know who were looking for, okay?

SCULLY: Got it.



SCENE 16

Mulder and Krycek arrive at the station. They acquire the photograph and run to find him.

MULDER: Stay here, Ill cover you on the side.

Mulder thinks he sees Gerardi..

MULDER: Federal Agent! Drop your weapon.

Mulder fires four shots.

Krycek runs towards him.

KRYCEK: Mulder.

MULDER: Gerardi! Where is he?

KRYCEK: Gerardis not here.

MULDER: I saw him.

KRYCEK: Mulder! You were shouting and waving your gun around, but Gerardi never showed.

MULDER: No, Gerardi was here, and so was Cole. We just missed them.

KRYCEK: Mulder, if they had been here, I would have seen it. Im telling you Mulder, they werent here.



SCENE 17
Mulder and Krycek go to the security office at the station.

MULDER: Okay, theres nothing here. Start with a small window of time, say 1935 to 1945. If you dont find anything in that time frame, then open it up one minute at a time. With all these cameras, we should be able to see something.

KRYCEK: Can we talk for a second.

MULDER: Whats the problem.

KRYCEK: You still havent answered my question. What happened?

MULDER: I told you, I thought I saw Gerardi.

KRYCEK: Come on, you just about killed somebody back there. We both know Im covering for you by keeping it between us.

MULDER: All right, what do you want to know.

KRYCEK: Whats the truth? There are things youre not telling me that I need to know.

MULDER: Its just that my ideas usually arent very popular.

KRYCEK: I told you, I want to believe. But I need a place to start.

MULDER: I think that Cole possesses the psychic ability to manipulate sounds and images to generate illusions that are so convincing they can kill. Hows that for a theory.

KRYCEK: Puts a whole new spin on virtual reality but at least it begins to explain some things.

SECURITY OFFICER: Agent Mulder, see this car in the upper right corner?

MULDER: Yeah.

SECURITY OFFICER: It wasnt there five minutes ago.

MULDER: Where is this.

SECURITY OFFICER: Track 17. Its a restricted part of the yard.



SCENE 18

Scene flashes to Cole and Gerardi.

GERARDI: What are you doing? This is insane. You cant do this to me. You cant hold me responsible. I was following orders, just like you.

COLE: The lord hates the lying tongue.

GERARDI: Its the truth.

Cole hits Gerardi.

COLE: The truth is what you did to us. What you made us do.

GERARDI: No one Made you do anything. You volunteered.

COLE: The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance.

GERARDI: Who is it? Whos there.

COLE: He shall wash his feet in the wicked

GERARDI: Who is it. I cant see without my glasses.

COLE: You dont need to see to know who it is. You know who it is!

Troops are seen walking by and they pick up scalpels.

COLE: You shall pay as the judge has determined. We shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn. Wound for wound, strike for strike. As he has disfigured a man, so shall he be disfigured. And he who kills a man shall be put to death.

Mulder and Krycek drive in.

GERARDI: AHHHH!!!!

They search the place.

MULDER: Hes still alive. Put pressure on the wound on the back of his neck and radio for help. NOW!

KRYCEK: This is Agent Krycek requesting emergency assistance. My location is track 17 in the freight way house.

MULDER: Step away from the edge. Corporal Cole, Im a federal agent, now please, step back.

COLE: Go ahead, shoot me.

MULDER: Thats not why Im here. Im putting down my gun. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes, after that, youre free to do whatever you want.

COLE: Im tired.

MULDER: I know.

COLE: Naw, man, you dont know. You have no idea.

MULDER: One minute is all Im asking.

COLE: One minute is more than I can give. My bloods boilin in my veins. I can feel the air stingin on my skin.

MULDER: What the military did to you was wrong, but your testimony can help.

COLE: They cut out a part of my brain. They made me into somebody else. I can never get back what they took away from me, and Im gonna stop them from taking anything more.

Krycek walks into the room and extends his weapon.

MULDER: Krycek put down the gun and get out of here. Krycek, I said put down the gun and get out of here!

Krycek sees Cole raising a gun. When Mulder looks over, he sees Cole raising his bible.

MULDER: NO!!!!!!

Krycek fires his gun twice, killing Cole.

COLE: Good-night.

KRYCEK: He had a gun. He was gonna shoot you.

MULDER: You did the right thing.

Mulder reaches under his car seat to find that the file is gone. He goes to Scullys office.



SCENE 19

SCULLY: They broke into my office. Went through my files, my computer. . .I came as soon as security called but the report was all ready gone.

MULDER: Someone went through a lot of trouble stealing both our copies to keep this a secret.

SCULLY: Without that report as evidence, Skinners not going to authorize an investigation.

MULDER: He said its never been more dangerous.

SCULLY: Skinner?

MULDER: No, the man who leaked us the report. The one whos been helping us.

SCULLY: You actually met with him.

MULDER: He said that closing down the X-Files was just the beginning. That weve never been in greater danger.

SCULLY: Do you trust him



SCENE 20

Scene flashes to Krycek in front of three members of the
Consortium.

CANCERMAN: Do you know where he got this?

KRYCEK: Not yet. But he got it. Which means hes either found another source, or another source has found him. Sir, if I can recommend something. Youll see that I have outlined several counter measures.

CANCERMAN: What about Scully?

KRYCEK: Reassigning them to other areas seems to have only strengthened their determination. Scullys a problem. A much larger problem than you described.

CANCERMAN: Every problem has a solution.

He puts out his cigarette.

SCENE 1
PULASKI, VIRGINIA; JUNE 3, 1985

(A dog runs into the kitchen and starts to eat his food. The TV blares in the background.)

MAN #1 ON TV: Hold, punster! Find the prisoner!

MAN #2 ON TV: Find the prisoner!

MAN #1 ON TV: There, there, whoa! Who's this?

(The dog starts off to another room.)

MAN #3 ON TV: There, there's been a mistake. Get me a lawyer.

MAN #1 ON TV: Forward, punster. Where is the king?

MAN #4 ON TV: In the great hall, sire.

(The house is not completely done. Sheets cover the walls as if it is under construction. The dog runs into the room with his owner, Duane Barry. Barry is lying on the bed.)

MAN #5 ON TV: Enough! My horses.

MAN #4 ON TV: Aye, sire.

MAN #5 ON TV: "Ode to the Great Hawk."

(Sounds of swords clashing. Then fanfare, but soon the TV goes out. Static fills the screen and the dog grows worried. Outside, strange beings wander about. The dog growls softly. He whimpers and runs out. Duane wakes up with a startle, knowing that they are there.)

DUANE BARRY: It can't be.

(He shakes, unable to move, as light grows on either side of the room, shining through the plastic sheets. Silhouettes of the creatures press up against the sheets.)

No, no! Not again!

(He screams as loud as he can. The light grows bigger as the aliens surround his bed. Outside, his dog barks at the UFO hovering over his house, shining it's light down into the house.)

SCENE 2
DAVIS CORRECTIONAL TREATMENT CENTER; MARION, VIRGINIA; PRESENT DAY

(A guard leads Barry, who has wrist restraints on, past many of the other residents of the center. The guard knocks on the door and opens it, then brings Barry in. Doctor Hakkie turns around and stands up.)

HAKKIE: Hello, Duane. Nice to see you.

DUANE BARRY: Nice to see you too, Doc.

(Hakkie motions to the guard, who leaves and closes the door.)

HAKKIE: How are you feeling today?

DUANE BARRY: Pretty good.

HAKKIE: Why don't we sit down, Duane? I want to go over a few things with you.

DUANE BARRY: Okay.

(They sit down across from each other.)

HAKKIE: Now, uh, it says here that you've been refusing to take your medicine.

DUANE BARRY: I don't like the way it makes me feel.

HAKKIE: Okay, all right, let's talk about that. Because we give you that medicine for a reason, Duane, because of your behavior.

DUANE BARRY: I know, I know.

HAKKIE: Because we don't want you to hurt anybody again.

(Barry nods.)

You're still hearing voices?

DUANE BARRY: I'm not crazy, Doc. Duane Barry's not like these other guys.

HAKKIE: No, everybody here is different.

DUANE BARRY: They're coming again. They're coming again, I can feel it. They're going to take Duane Barry to this place.

HAKKIE: Nobody's coming, Duane.

(Barry rocks back and forth in his chair.)

DUANE BARRY: Nobody can stop them.

HAKKIE: I'm going to give you a shot.

(He stands and goes to his desk.)

I think you just need some rest.

(He prepares a shot. Barry looks at the pen on the desk.)

Now, this will make you sleep... and you'll wake up and you will see that we didn't let anybody hurt you. Okay, Duane?

(He turns around to see Barry walking out the door.)

Duane?

(He starts after him. Duane hurries down the hall and jabs the pen into the guard's back, then into his neck. He picks up the gun and points it at the other residents.)

Duane!

(Duane turns around and aims it at the doctor.)

DUANE BARRY: Get away, get away.

(The doctor walks slowly towards him, hands raised.)

HAKKIE: Put the gun down, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: Give me the keys.

HAKKIE: Duane...

DUANE BARRY: Give me the damn keys!

MAN: Yeah, do it!

(The alarm goes off. Duane, panicking, runs up to the doc.)

HAKKIE: No, no!

(Barry hits him on the head with the butt of the gun.)

DUANE BARRY: Either way, Doc, we're getting out of here together. You guys... let's do it now. Go! Go! Go!



SCENE 3
WASHINGTON, D.C.; AUGUST 7, 1994

(Krycek looks down at the large indoor swimming pool and makes his way down to it. Mulder, wearing only red speedos, is doing laps. He reaches the end of the pool as Krycek walks up.)

KRYCEK: Agent Mulder!

MULDER: Krycek, what's up?

(He gets out of the pool.)

KRYCEK: There's a situation going down. They want you out there right away.

(They start walking.)

MULDER: What kind of situation?

KRYCEK: Hostage negotiation.

MULDER: And they want me?

KRYCEK: Yeah.

MULDER: What for?

(Mulder picks up his towel and dries his face and hair.)

KRYCEK: The guy escaped a mental institution. He's got four people at gunpoint in an office building. Claims he's being controlled by aliens.



SCENE 4
DOWNTOWN RICHMOND, VA.; AUGUST 7, 1994

(Snipers sit on the roof of the building across the street from Travel Time Travel Agency, pointing their guns. Sirens stop blaring. Mulder and Krycek drive up as policemen hold back the crowd.)

POLICEMAN: Stay back!

(As a SWAT truck drives by, they get out of their car. They show the policeman their badges.)

KRYCEK: Krycek, Mulder, F.B.I. What's your handle?

POLICEMAN: Right that way, sir.

(They run into the building. Inside, people are working hard.)

MAN #1: Yes, sir.

MAN #2: Okay, I've got it right here. Lucy?

(He hands the paper to Lucy Kazdin. She looks at the paper and turns to see Krycek and Mulder at the doorway. She walks over to them and shakes Mulder's hand.)

LUCY KAZDIN: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

LUCY KAZDIN: Lucy Kazdin, negotiations commander. Thanks for coming.

MULDER: This is Agent Krycek.

LUCY KAZDIN: Let me show you what we've got.

(They walk over to a blackboard, which she turns around. Agent Rich is also there. Written on the board is four words: honesty, containment, conciliation and resolution. Other things are also written down.)

His name's Duane Barry. He's armed with a nine millimeter Smith & Wesson handgun, one nine-round magazine. It is our belief he's prepared to use the gun and not afraid to die.

MULDER: What does he want?

LUCY KAZDIN: Safe passage for himself and his original hostage, a shrink named Hakkie.

MULDER: Passage to where?

LUCY KAZDIN: He's bent on taking the Doctor with him to an alien abduction site, only he can't quite remember where the site is so he stopped at a travel agency.

MULDER: Is he lucid?

LUCY KAZDIN: Yes, but he's off his medication so he's manic, ranting about scoop mark scars on his body, homing devices, and a lot of other nonsense.

MULDER: Like what?

LUCY KAZDIN: This whole alien abduction business, which I guess you know something about.

MULDER: Yeah, yeah, but I've never been in a hostage negotiation before.

LUCY KAZDIN: Oh, we'll take you through it. Agent Rich is our advisory commander. He and I will be coaching you.

(Rich stands next to her.)

RICH: What Mister Barry needs right now is a friend, someone who appears to understand him and can appeal to his sense of reason.

(Mulder nods. Rich looks at Kazdin.)

MULDER: Do we know anything about his abduction experiences?

LUCY KAZDIN: You really believe in this stuff, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Is that a problem?

LUCY KAZDIN: We're here to save lives. You'll begin negotiations immediately. Every three hours, we'll reevaluate your progress and let our tactical commander advise and update on the use of force.

(He nods and walks past them. The other agents disperse. Mulder walks up to her.)

MULDER: If this man is an abductee, I need to know more about him, his personal history. Each abduction case is different.

LUCY KAZDIN: That material's not been made available to us.

MULDER: And nobody's thought to call the hospital for records?

LUCY KAZDIN: Look, Agent Mulder. The guy's a psycho. Your object is to keep him on the phone. The longer you do, the more chance he's not going to kill anybody. We stop to do a Freudian analysis, next thing we know, we've got four dead hostages. So whatever crap you got to make up about space men or UFOs, just keep him on the phone.

(She walks away.)



SCENE 5
TRAVEL TIME TRAVEL AGENCY

(Bob is sitting on the floor, looking up at Duane. His fellow hostages, Kimberly and Gwen, are seated next to him. Hakkie is tied to a chair.)

BOB: Are we going to have to sit like this all night?

(Duane backhands him and the woman gasp. Duane leans in and whispers loudly.)

DUANE BARRY: I told you to shut up.

GWEN: We all have families, for God's sake.

(Barry stands up.)

HAKKIE: Duane? Don't hurt anyone. Please?

(Barry walks over to him and grabs him by the collar.)

DUANE BARRY: I'm not going to hurt you, Doc. Because this time, you're going with Duane Barry so you can see what it's like... that it's real!

(The phone rings. Cut to the makeshift FBI office. Mulder is sitting down with headphones on. Rich and Kazdin have headphones on as well, and Kazdin is pacing. Duane picks up.)

MULDER: Duane?

DUANE BARRY: Yeah?

MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.

(Mulder looks down at his notepad, which has instructions.)

Look, I want to try to help you.

(Cut back to the travel agency, where Barry paces, holding the phone to his ear.)

DUANE BARRY: Yeah? Well... we're just sitting here, waiting for, uh... travel plans.

(Cut to Mulder, who glances down at his notepad briefly as he talks every few seconds.)

MULDER: I think I know what you're going through, Duane. I just want to make sure you get what you want and that...

(He looks at the blackboard. Kazdin points off each of the names and Mulder reads them off.)

Bob, Kimberly and Gwen and Doctor Hakkie don't get hurt.

(Cut to Duane, who is growing livid.)

DUANE BARRY: You know what I'm going through? You think you know what Duane Barry's going through? You don't know jack!

(Duane is screaming at the top of his lungs. Cut to the FBI office, where Kazdin looks at Mulder to see how he will handle this. Mulder stands.)

MULDER: I know you're scared, Duane, and that you'd like to see this all come out right.

(Cut to Duane, who is pacing now.)

DUANE BARRY: Yeah, right. So they can... put me back in the nuthouse... where I belong!

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: We're only concerned about your safety, Duane. You and the others.

(Cut to Duane. Duane looks through the blinds and sees Mulder through the window across the street.)

DUANE BARRY: Hey... what's your name? Mulder? I know the routine.

(He walks away from the window.)

Honesty... containment... conciliation.

(Cut to Mulder, who looks at Kazdin, shocked.)

Am I missing something?

MULDER: You need someone to trust, Duane.

(Cut back to Duane, who is growing angry again.)

I know a lot of people who have been through similar experiences.

DUANE BARRY: You want to do something for me, Agent Mulder? You keep your dogs on a leash.

(Cut to Mulder, who is walking towards Kazdin, angry.)

You try to gas me out or do anything stupid...

(Cut to Duane. The hostages cower in the corner.)

These people die. They're not taking me again. You got it? They can take somebody else!

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Nobody's going to try anything, Duane.

(Duane hangs up and the dialtone starts. Mulder takes the headset off his ears and looks at Kazdin.)

Who is this guy? He's F.B.I., isn't he?

LUCY KAZDIN: Former F.B.I.

MULDER: And you didn't think to mention that?

LUCY KAZDIN: He's been out of the bureau since 1982. Institutionalized on and off for over a decade. It's beside the point.

(He takes the headset off and puts it down on a desk.)

MULDER: The point being that the bureau wants to minimize it's embarrassment, isn't that it? That we can police our own.

LUCY KAZDIN: They would like it done as neatly and cleanly as possible.

MULDER: Well, you're off to a hell of a start.

RICH: Negotiation is a process, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Well, if you just wanted somebody to come down and read the script, you didn't have to bring me out.

RICH: This method has proven extremely successful in winning the hostage-taker's trust.

MULDER: No, no, that man is afraid. And the only way you're going to win his trust is by trying to understand what he's afraid of.

(Rich tilts his head, a little annoyed.)

Have you ever spoken to an abductee, Agent Kazdin? Heard them talk about having their brains sucked out through their nostril while being wide awake through the experience? Would you like to know what they do to a woman's ovaries?

(She looks up at him quickly.)

LUCY KAZDIN: Not particularly.

MULDER: Well, then understand that you might have to alter your approach a little bit here.

(He walks out, brushing past Krycek. She takes off her headset as the rest of the agents stir and start to move again.)

KRYCEK: Is there anything I can do?

LUCY KAZDIN: Yeah, what's your name again?

KRYCEK: Krycek.

LUCY KAZDIN: Krycek, have you got your notepad?

(He goes to take it out of his inside coat pocket.)

Grande, two percent cappuccino with vanilla. Agent Rich?

(Rich waves it off. She walks away and Krycek shoves the notepad back into his pocket, smiling a little.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is watching the news report.)

REPORTER ON TV: ...of the hostages. As you can see, Carl, the SWAT team has taken positions on all the surrounding buildings...

(The phone rings and she picks up.)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: It's me. I'm in Virginia.

SCULLY: Yeah, I know. I've been watching it on TV. What's going on out there?

MULDER: What's the media saying?

SCULLY: That an escaped mental patient is holding four people hostage in a travel agency.

(Cut to Mulder, who is talking on his cellular phone away from the other agents.)

MULDER: Well, what they're not telling you is that he's former F.B.I. who also claims to be an alien abductee.

SCULLY: Seriously?

MULDER: Yeah, his name's Duane Barry. Look, Scully, I need your help.

(Cut to Scully as she boots up her computer.)

I need you to find out what happened to him. Anything, transcripts from therapy sessions, hypnotic regressions...

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Anything about his abduction experience.

(The lights suddenly go out and the agents murmur. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Cut back to Mulder. Men are screaming in back of him.)

MULDER: The lights just went out here.

(All the lights in the building go out. The snipers are watching.)

MAN #1: Stay back.

MAN #2: Come on, we're losing power!

SNIPER: What the hell is going on?

(The fountain turns off. Duane, agitated, starts waving his gun around. Gwen screams. The only lights are from the police cars outside. The agents start looking through the windows.)

MAN #1: Tactical unit, what are you guys up to?

TACTICAL COMMANDER: Nothing, absolutely nothing sir.

(A bright light builds outside, blinding the agents.)

MAN #1: Ah, what the?

(The light fades and a gunshot goes off. The agents duck and cover.)

Get down, everybody get down! Backup from command. Shots have been fired. Locate and report. I repeat, locate and report.

(More gunshots go off. Duane is shooting wildly. Gwen screams with each gunshot. Ambulances gather outside.)

RICH: We've lost our captured line.

MAN #1: We have either four or five shots fired!

(Mulder walks over to Rich.)

MULDER: What's the number there?

RICH: 555-2804.

(Mulder picks up the phone and dials.)

MAN #1: Repeat, we have either four or five shots fired!

LUCY KAZDIN: Our electrical substation blew. We've got no power up and down the block.

(Duane picks up.)

MULDER: Duane?

(Cut to Duane. The women are chatting nervously in the background.)

DUANE BARRY: I told you.

MULDER: Is everybody all right, Duane?

DUANE BARRY: You didn't believe me, did you?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: No, I, I believe you. I just need to know if...

(Cut to Duane, who's pacing.)

...anybody's been shot.

(Duane looks down at Bob, who is bleeding heavily. Gwen is tending to him.)

GWEN: I need towels. Kimberly? Kimberly? He's going to bleed to death.

(She looks at Kimberly, who won't move.)

DUANE BARRY: I guess we're going to need a doctor.

(Mulder moves the phone away from his ear, frowning. A man turns on a small receiver and puts it in Mulder's ear while a man instructs him.)

TACTICAL COMMANDER: Now, you'll have almost full ambient hearing loss in this ear. Your sense of balance might be affected slightly, particularly if you have to move quickly or get into a physical situation. If you get trapped or held in the building for some reason, we'll be able to warn you if there's a tactical assault. Now remember, he's either got four or five rounds left.

(He adjusts Mulder's blue vest.)

Now, there's a wireless mic hidden in the top of this flak jacket. Speaking in a normal tone of voice, we should be able to hear anything you say up to a hundred yards.

(Mulder buttons his EMT shirt over it.)

Make every attempt to keep these devices concealed. You put a normal telephone handset to that ear, it'll cause feedback and reveal that you're wired.

(Kazdin walks up to him.)

LUCY KAZDIN: You really want to do this?

MULDER: Yeah.

(They start walking, followed by the tactical commander and another man.)

LUCY KAZDIN: Your job will be to deliver medical help to the hostage. Anything else is just a bonus. You're to get in and get out. You are not to risk your own life. Whatever you believe...

MULDER: Don't jump into his delusion. I can't negotiate with him if he thinks I believe him.

LUCY KAZDIN: Right.

(She points at the man standing next to her.)

This is Agent Janus, he's a trained medic. He'll work on the hostage. You're to keep Duane Barry talking. Like I said, if he's talking, he's not going to shoot anybody including you.

(The tactical commander leads Mulder off to the side.)

TACTICAL COMMANDER: Now, I've got three snipers out there. Anything you can do to get him to the front door, all we need is one shot to the medulla oblongata.

(He touches the back of Mulder's neck where the medulla oblongata is located. Mulder nods. Mulder and Janus walk out, Janus carrying his orange case.)

SNIPER: Tac command, this is rooftop zero-two. I have them in sight. They're passing the fountain and approaching the front entrance now.

(Mulder knocks on the door. Kimberly pulls open the shades.)

DUANE BARRY: Just unlock the door and move back.

(Kimberly unlocks the door and sits down. Mulder and Janus walk in.)

MULDER: Duane?

DUANE BARRY: Hands in the air!

(Mulder puts his hands up. Duane, concealed in shadows in the back, has his gun trained on Mulder.)

Put the kit on the floor slowly.

(Janus does so.)

MULDER: We're unarmed.

(Duane steps into the light.)

We just want to help the injured.

GWEN: Over here.

(Mulder looks over at Gwen, who is tending to Bob. Bob is laying on the ground.)

DUANE BARRY: Face the door! That's right.

(They do so. Duane pats them down.)

Not armed, huh? You're F.B.I., aren't you? Got a gun in the kit?

MULDER: No.

DUANE BARRY: Are you wearing a wire?

MULDER: No. We're just here to help.

DUANE BARRY: Okay...

(Duane finishes patting them down and backs away. Mulder and Janus start to turn around. Cut to the makeshift office, where Kazdin, Rich and others are listening in intently.)

MULDER: Nobody's going to try anything, Duane.

LUCY KAZDIN: That's right, good. You want to work with him.

MULDER: We just want to make sure no one else gets hurt.

(In the office, Janus goes over to the wounded.)

DUANE BARRY: Just do your business and get out.

(Duane walks around Hakkie, keeping his gun trained.)

JANUS: How's he doing?

GWEN: He's bad.

(Mulder and Janus look down at Bob.)

JANUS: Hi, my name is Janus. I'm a paramedic. Hold on, we're going to take care of you, okay?

(Mulder turns back to Duane.)

MULDER: They want to work with you, Duane, but you got to work with them. Why not let the others go?

DUANE BARRY: Doc's going with me.

MULDER: Then let the women go.

(Barry squeezes the gun tighter.)

Were they here, Duane? The light... was that them?

DUANE BARRY: Don't try and B.S. Duane Barry.

MULDER: Well, we lost time. I checked my watch. Isn't that what happens? Time stops. Isn't it?

(Duane flashes back to him on the bed screaming very briefly.)

Duane?

(Barry closes his eyes as he flashes back repeatedly to him screaming loudly, a whirring around him. The light flickering. He looks to the right and sees aliens outside, trying to get in. In the present, Duane snaps out of it and breathes heavily. He starts to back away slowly.)

DUANE BARRY: You're making it up.

MULDER: Isn't that what they've been saying to you, Duane? That you're making it up?

DUANE BARRY: They say it's all inside my head. All they want to do is just give me more drugs.

MULDER: I hear you, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: You hear me 'cause I got a gun.

MULDER: No. I believe your story.

(Cut to the makeshift office, where Kazdin is getting agitated.)

LUCY KAZDIN: No, you're feeding into his psychosis.

MULDER: I know you're afraid. I know the pain and the fear you must feel.

LUCY KAZDIN: Just listen to me.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Don't try to identify with him.

MULDER: I've talked to people, Duane. People just like you, and nobody wanted to believe.

(Duane's starts to relax. Janus pats Mulder on the shoulder and whispers into his ear.)

JANUS: This man's going to die unless we get him to a hospital.

(He goes back to Bob.)

MULDER: Why don't you let him go, Duane? There's no reason this man has to die. Come on, Duane. You've got the power. Let him go.

(Duane stares into his eyes.)

DUANE BARRY: Okay.

MULDER: Good. You made the right choice. Now, we're just going to move him carefully to the door.

DUANE BARRY: No! Baldy can go. But you stay. I'm trading the bald man for you.

(Cut to the office, where Kazdin is whispering to Rich.)

LUCY KAZDIN: Damn it!

(Janus walks out with Bob and other agents come over to help him.)

MAN: You're going to be all right, sir... just keep moving.

(Duane ties Mulder to a chair.)

DUANE BARRY: Now, let's see how good a liar you are.

MULDER: I'm telling the truth, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: How could you ever know what Duane Barry's been through? How could anyone know?

MULDER: It happened to my sister.

DUANE BARRY: Don't you think you can lie to save their lives. I want some honesty! I want some respect!

(Hakkie coughs around his new gag. Mulder nods. Duane walks over to Hakkie.)

I'm tired of all the B.S.!

MULDER: How does it happen, Duane? Driving in your car? Alone in bed at night? When do they come to you? You're paralyzed, aren't you? Unable to move. Sometimes, you can't even breathe. You feel an electric shock go through your body...

(Cut to Kazdin, who is pissed.)

...and then they're there.

LUCY KAZDIN: He's going to push him right over the edge. I need a clear picture of what's going on in there.

MAN: Right away.

(He runs off.)

LUCY KAZDIN: You're choosing a dangerous course, Agent Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder. Duane stands over him.)

MULDER: There are beings, aren't there, Duane? Are they tall or small?

DUANE BARRY: No! No!

MULDER: Diminutive...

(Duane closes his eyes and tenses up as he starts to remember. Aliens pound against his walls. Whirring is loud. Duane looks widely at Mulder.)

They take you, Duane, against your will.

GWEN: He's going to kill us...

(Mulder looks at her briefly and keeps talking.)

MULDER: You're powerless. Sometimes, you can't even speak. It's always the same, nobody can help you. Where do they take you, Duane? Is there a ship? Do they take you to a ship, Duane? How do you get there? Are you conscious or being transported?

(In the past, Duane starts to float up off the bed as aliens surround his bed. His breathing is heavily, his eyes barely open. The light engulfs them. Cut to the office, where they are still listening. Duane has calmed down.)

DUANE BARRY: They're, uh... they're talking to Duane Barry. But they don't speak.

(Cut to Duane, who is sitting down on the floor, leaning against a desk cabinet.)

He can hear what they're saying. They can... read his mind.

MULDER: That's right. Abductees call it "mindscan." It's a kind of telepathy.

DUANE BARRY: I'm telling 'em I don't want to go... but they never listen.

(Gwen has her head in her hands, thinking she's going to die. Kimberly, on the other hand, is listening intently, calmly.)

They know what I'm saying. But they just... go right on about their business.

(He stands up slowly and points to Hakkie.)

Tell him what their business is. Tell him.

MULDER: They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests.

(Duane nods slightly, breathing deeply.)

DUANE BARRY: They... drilled my teeth.

(He turns to Hakkie.)

They drilled holes in my damn teeth!

(In the past, aboard the ship, Duane is pinned down to a glass table with many white lines on it. He's wearing a baggy white suit. Aliens are around the table. His mouth is being held open by machines, and there is a red light on his mouth. A machine lowers down towards his mouth as Duane's muffled screaming grows. The aliens watch intently as a small tube comes down from the machine and stops a few inches above Duane's mouth. Suddenly, a red laser blasts into his mouth. Smoke pouring out, Duane tries to scream with all his mouth, but it comes out muffled and dampened. In the present, a man drills a hole in the wall to try to look into the room as other agents, including Rich, look at a map. In the main room, the tactical commander picks up the phone when it rings.)

TACTICAL COMMANDER: Yeah. Who here can talk to an Agent Scully?

(Krycek walks over and takes the phone.)

KRYCEK: Agent Scully, it's Alex Krycek.

(Cut to Scully, who is sitting at her computer with information on the screen.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

(Cut to Krycek.)

KRYCEK: He traded himself for one of the hostages.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: What?

KRYCEK: He's in with Duane Barry.

SCULLY: You've got to get him out of there.

KRYCEK: Well, they're working on it.

SCULLY: No, you've got to get him out of there now or he's going to be killed!

KRYCEK: How can you be sure?

SCULLY: Because Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is.

(She looks at the computer screen. Next to a picture of Duane Barry is a 3-D image of his brain. In the travel agency, Duane is sitting behind Mulder and to the right.)

DUANE BARRY: How old was your sister when they took her?

MULDER: She was eight.

DUANE BARRY: I've seen kids sometimes, young girls.

MULDER: What are they doing to them?

DUANE BARRY: Doing tests. You know... testing them.

(Mulder notices that the agents are drilling the hole above Barry's head. He keeps his attention on Barry, though.)

I tell them not to cry.

MULDER: Are they hurting them?

DUANE BARRY: Oh, yeah. Sometimes... sometimes it hurts real bad, and uh... you just want to die, you know? You know what it's like, sir? It's like living with a gun to your head and never knowing when it's going to go off.

MULDER: You can let the others go, Duane. Let the others go and take me.

(Barry laughs.)

DUANE BARRY: Oh... they heard you talking like that, they're going to have your ass.

(He keeps laughing. Even Mulder smiles a little.)

MULDER: I don't care about that, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: No. I wouldn't do that to you. Besides, Doc and I got an appointment. Ain't that right, Doc?

(Mulder looks back at Hakkie, who is scared stiff. The agent feeds a small camera feed through the hole and a person next to a monitor gives the okay sign. In the monitor, we see the back of Mulder, Hakkie and the women in the corner, but Duane is out of view. The tactical commander gives Kazdin a still picture.)

TACTICAL COMMANDER: We got a picture. Mulder is here, opposite the doctor. The women are on the north wall. We can't see the east wall, Duane Barry must be there.

MAN: Hold on a second.

(Kazdin and the commander look up to see Scully arguing with an agent.)

SCULLY: No, I don't think you understand what I'm telling you. I just flew down here from Washington...

MAN: We, we got a situation in progress...

SCULLY: All right, well then let me speak to someone who's in charge.

(Krycek walks over and puts his hand on her shoulder.)

KRYCEK: You are. Calm down, Scully.

(She pushes his hand off.)

SCULLY: Don't tell me to calm down, I'm not going to calm down until I can talk to someone who will listen to what I'm saying!

(Kazdin walks over.)

LUCY KAZDIN: What's the problem here?

SCULLY: I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have information that is vital to your negotiations.

LUCY KAZDIN: What information?

SCULLY: I think there has been a critical misjudgment here. This man who claims to be under the control of aliens, his, his mental health history describes a rare state of psychosis.

(The phone rings. After, Scully puts a paper down in front of Kazdin, who is sitting at the desk again.)

As you can see from his medical records, in 1982, Duane Barry was shot in the line of duty, the bullet piercing his bilateral frontal lobes.

LUCY KAZDIN: Right.

SCULLY: The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society. It effectively destroyed the moral center of his brain. Now, almost a hundred years ago, there was a famous case. A man named Gage had a blasting rod pierce the same region.

LUCY KAZDIN: And what effect did it have?

SCULLY: He became a pathological liar, suffering from severe delusions. His behavior was characterized as bizarre and violent with a tendency to act out his fantasies.

LUCY KAZDIN: How did you get involved in this case?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder called me. We used to work together.

LUCY KAZDIN: Well, if this is true, he's got your former partner completely fooled.

SCULLY: Is there a way I can reach him with this information?

(In the travel agency, Duane slides up to Mulder in a rolling chair.)

DUANE BARRY: The government knows about it, you know. They're even in on it sometimes. Right there in the room when they come. They work together with a, uh, secret, uh, corporation.

(In the past, two men-in-black stand in the doorway as Barry is being abducted.)

MULDER: Who in the government?

DUANE BARRY: A man, the military. They're all in it together.

(Cut to the listening table in the makeshift FBI office. Scully is now wearing a headset.)

The government knows why they're here, but they wouldn't dare let the truth out. So they cooperate.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: You're going to have to deal with resolving this situation, Duane... sooner or later.

DUANE BARRY: I'm tired.

MULDER: There's no other way out. You've got to tell them what you want to do.

DUANE BARRY: I just want to go back to the place.

MULDER: What place?

DUANE BARRY: Where it first started. Where they first came and got me.

MULDER: Where is that?

(Barry sighs.)

DUANE BARRY: A mountain.

(Cut to Scully, who is listening intently.)

We went, uh, up... and up.

(Cut back to Barry.)

Ascending... ascending to the stars. I'm not going again.

(Barry groans and looks down. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder? It's me. Listen to me. You cannot trust Duane Barry.

(Cut to Mulder. The sound is audible in his ear.)

He is a brain-damaged psychopath who took a bullet in the head. He is not what you think he is.

(Barry is startled, possibly from hearing Scully, and looks up at Mulder.)

DUANE BARRY: What?

MULDER: How do they find you each time?

DUANE BARRY: Implants... my gums, sinus cavities...

(He points to both. Then he lifts his shirt, revealing a scar over his belly button.)

... and my belly button. Tracking devices.

SCULLY: Mulder, he could snap at any time. He has a history of irrational and violent behavior.

(Cut to Scully.)

Now, you have to work towards resolving this. Now, you have his trust. You have to try and negotiate with him.

(Cut to Mulder as he lets the words sink in. He looks over at Kimberly and Gwen. Gwen is frightened while Kimberly is passive.)

MULDER: Why not let the women go, Duane? They'll deal with you if you let the women go.

SCULLY: That's good, that's good, Mulder.

(Cut to Scully.)

Now keep him talking. H.R.T. is moving into position and unless you can get him to free the hostages, they're going to execute a tactical plan.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: The women are of no consequence to you. Let them go. It's the right thing to do, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: Okay, but he stays.

(He nods towards Hakkie. Mulder nods slightly. Duane looks at the women and stands up.)

Go on, get out of here.

(The women are afraid to move.)

Get up, go on. Get out of here, go on.

(Gwen takes Kimberly's hand and they start out. Kimberly stops and looks at Duane after a second.)

KIMBERLY: I'm...

(She clears her throat.)

I just want to say that I believe you.

(Gwen walks back over and leads her out. As they walk out, agents run over to help them.)

SNIPER: The women are clear.

(Men are watching the room on the monitor.)

MAN: I got him, standing, center room... moving...

(SWAT team members begin to surround the building.)

SCULLY: This is the countdown, Mulder, they're coming at you.

(A marksman gets into position and aims at the door.)

MARKSMAN #1: Position number one, ready.

TACTICAL COMMANDER: Coming at you, number one.

(Duane looks at Mulder, more serious.)

DUANE BARRY: We're going to need transportation.

MULDER: What do you want, Duane? A car?

DUANE BARRY: I don't know.

MULDER: Do you know where you want to go?

DUANE BARRY: They're going to tell me.

MULDER: Duane, you can't leave here if you don't know where you want to go.

(The marksman readies his shot. Mulder notices the red tracking beam on the back of Duane's neck.)

Duane!

DUANE BARRY: What?

MULDER: Come here.

(Duane goes to him. The people watching the monitor take note.)

MAN: Hold your fire, you lost your line.

(Kazdin and Scully are especially tense.)

MULDER: There... there's something I want to ask you.

DUANE BARRY: What?

MULDER: You didn't believe me. I had to earn your trust. Now, there's something I got to know. Are you making any of this up?

(Duane grows quite angry at this.)

DUANE BARRY: You are... calling Duane Barry a liar now?

MULDER: No...

DUANE BARRY: You think I make it all up.

MULDER: No, I don't. I'm sorry.

DUANE BARRY: You're sorry?

(Duane looks about ready to explode.)

MULDER: Duane, will you listen to me for a second?

(Duane grabs his collar.)

DUANE BARRY: You're just like all the others, aren't you?

MULDER: Duane...

DUANE BARRY: You say you believe me...

MULDER: Duane, I do believe you.

DUANE BARRY: ...but you don't!

MULDER: I believe you!

DUANE BARRY: You lie just like everybody else!

MULDER: No! I believe you, Duane!

(Because of the screaming, the line starts to break up. Scully and Kazdin sigh as they pick up only static.)

DUANE BARRY: I trusted you! I trusted you like a fool!

MULDER: Can I say... can I say something? Duane, can I say something? I know you're tired, but there's something you've forgotten to do. When you let the women leave, you left the door unlocked. Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock the door. Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock it. They could get in here. Go lock the door.

(Duane, calmer, continues to breathe heavily but slowly makes his way to the door. A small red beam shines upon his chest. Mulder has a look of remorse on his face as Duane looks down at it, then tenses up. A gunshot is fired, shattering the glass. Duane's world turns black.)

MAN #1: Let's go, let's move!

MAN #2: Okay, come on.

MAN #1: He's down, he's down, he's down!

(People start to shout commands to each other. Duane starts to slowly regain consciousness, his vision blurred as the EMTs raise him into the ambulance. The men on the APB talk to each other as Mulder and Scully watch Duane being loaded up. Mulder regrets his decision deeply.)

SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Whatever you're feeling... you did the right thing.

(Mulder nods.)

MULDER: It's just that, uh... I believed him.

SCULLY: Sometimes when you want to believe so badly, you end up... looking too hard.

(The ambulance engine starts and slowly pulls off, sirens blaring.)



SCENE 7
JEFFERSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL; RICHMOND, VA

(Mulder slowly walks down the hallway to Agent Kazdin, who is talking to a police officer. They shake hands.)

LUCY KAZDIN: Agent Mulder, thanks for coming.

(They start down the hallway.)

MULDER: No, I was surprised to get your call.

LUCY KAZDIN: Yeah, well... as it turned out, whatever your impression of the way it was handled, I didn't get to thank you for going out there and putting it on the line.

(Mulder smiles, laughing a little.)

What?

MULDER: I don't know, I guess I thought maybe you called me down here to chew me out.

(She laughs a little.)

How's he doing?

LUCY KAZDIN: Duane? They almost lost him, but he stabilized. They got him listed on critical.

(They come to his door and walk in. Duane is on the hospital bed, hooked up to machines.)

I checked on his records with the bureau. It was exemplary. His accident was something of a mystery. Shot by his own weapon in a drug stakeout, left for dead in the woods. He was never the same. Lost everything... wife, kids, house...

MULDER: The fine thread of sanity.

LUCY KAZDIN: I actually called you down here for another reason, Agent Mulder.

(She paces a little, trying to find away to say what she has to say.)

Uh... in the x-rays, the surgeon found several pieces of metal. In his gums, in his sinus cavity, and one in the abdomen. I had them checked, I felt you'd want to know... and there were tiny drill holes in his left and right rear molars. A dentist who examined them said they could not have been done with any of the current equipment in use... not without chipping or damaging the tooth. Anyway... I thought you ought to know.

(She walks out. Mulder looks down at Duane as the door closes.)



SCENE 8
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is seated across from Scully, who is seated at her desk. She is looking at one of the implants from Duane Barry put in a tiny glass vial.)

SCULLY: This could just be a piece of shrapnel. Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam.

MULDER: It was right where he said it would be, Scully. Along with the ones in his gums and sinus.

(He points to his gums and sinus as he says them.)

SCULLY: And you think that this was implanted?

MULDER: Well, if it was, that would mean Duane Barry is telling the truth.

SCULLY: Or some version of the truth.

(Mulder rubs his eye for a second. They look at each other.)

Look, I'll, I'll take this down to ballistics. We can have this cleared up in a second.

(He gets up and leaves.)



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The ballistics expert looks at the implant under a microscope.)

BALLISTICS EXPERT: Let me just make a slight adjustment.

(He sits down next to Scully as they look at the implant on a computer screen.)

SCULLY: What do you think?

BALLISTICS EXPERT: Could be a shell casing or a small artillery fragment. The edges are dull, but it could have been white-hot when it entered the body.

SCULLY: That would make sense.

(He presses a button and it zooms in on a portion of it. He points out some markings with his pen.)

BALLISTICS EXPERT: But look at this.

SCULLY: What?

BALLISTICS EXPERT: These small markings. See them here?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Looks like some kind of a stamp.

BALLISTICS EXPERT: Like it's been tooled or etched. Pretty fine work, too. This square we're looking at is only ten microns across. Strange.

(Scully looks at the computer screen, a little unsure of her ideas.)



SCENE 10
SUPERMARKET

(Scully is on the express check out line. The clerk runs the pickles and ice cream over the bar code scanner and then totals Scully's purchase up.)

CLERK: Eleven fourteen.

(Scully starts to write a check as the clerk bags the groceries. She hands it to the clerk.)

Thank you.

(She takes the drawer to ring out and starts back to the service desk. A woman is standing at the cigarette machine.)

WOMAN: Excuse me, can I get some help here with these?

CLERK: I'll, uh, be right with you. I just have to cash out my drawer.

(Scully makes sure that the clerk is far enough and takes out the implant. She runs it across the bar code scanner and the machine goes haywire, ringing up thousands of digits. It beeps wildly as it shuffles through the numbers. Scully pockets the implant as the clerk walks back over.)

What happened? Did you touch something?

SCULLY: Uh, I don't know what happened.

(Nervously, she takes her groceries and leaves.)



SCENE 11
JEFFERSON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL; RICHMOND, VA

(Duane continues to be comatose. His heart rate and blood pressure are now steadier but far from healthy. A crackling rumbles through the air and his eyes pop open. He gasps and looks to his left, seeing silhouettes of aliens on the other side of the curtain. Light builds from there as well. Duane, gasping, gets up and takes off his various plugs. He looks out his door's window and sees the police officer talking on the phone.)

POLICE OFFICER: All right...

(He hears a noise and turns around to see Duane Barry about to strike him with a fire extinguisher. He falls as Barry runs off, dropping the fire extinguisher.)



SCENE 12
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Thunder rumbles outside. The phone rings and the machine picks it up.)

MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message please.

(It beeps. Cut to Scully, who is walking around with the phone to her ear, staring at the implant.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it.

(Cut back to Mulder's apartment, where the machine is recording.)

I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up.

(Cut back to Scully's apartment.)

What the hell is this thing, Mulder? It's almost as if... it's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him.

(There is a bump outside and some rustling. Lightning shines through the window. She walks over, carrying the phone and raises the blinds. Duane Barry peers through at her. She gasps. Cut to Mulder's apartment, where the machine picks up sounds of Scully screaming and glass breaking.)

DUANE BARRY: Come on, lady...

SCULLY: Mulder!

DUANE BARRY: Come on!

SCULLY: I need your help! Mulder!

(More sounds of glass breaking and shuffling.)

Mulder!

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                          ASCENSION



SCENE 1
WASHINGTON, D.C.; 11:23 P.M.

(Mulder walks into his house as rain pours outside. Lightning cracks. He presses a button on the answering machine and the tape rewinds. A beep sounds.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it. I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up. What the hell is this thing, Mulder? It's almost as if... it's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him.

(Sounds of Scully gasping and glass breaking.)

Mulder! I need your help!

DUANE BARRY ON MACHINE: Shut up!

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Mulder!

(Mulder pulls up to Scully's house and gets out. There are people everywhere, and the house is surrounded with yellow tape. He shows his badge to a policeman, who lets him through. He goes up the front stairs and looks at the broken window. He sees blood on the wall on the inside and his own reflection in the glass. In his mind, he sees Scully pull open the blinds and Duane Barry peering through. She gasps and Barry punches her through the glass. She falls, dropping the phone. He knocks down the blinds and climbs through the window. Mulder snaps out of it and walks inside. People are taking pictures, collecting blood samples and dusting for fingerprints. He
walks over to the glass round table in the middle of the room. He looks down at a portion that is cracked and stained with blood. In his mind again, he sees Scully crawling towards the table.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Duane Barry grabs her foot.)

DUANE BARRY: Come on, lady...

SCULLY: I need your help!

(She reaches up to the table for her gun, smashing the glass with her wrist. A man takes a picture of the crushed phone on the ground. Mulder sees Scully about a foot away from the phone.)

Mulder!

(Suddenly, Duane Barry's foot crashes down onto the phone, breaking it. Mulder walks out of the room. He accidentally gets some blood on his fingers from the wall.)

POLICEMAN: I'm sorry, ma'am, but you can't disturb a crime scene.

MARGARET SCULLY: But this is my daughter's apartment. Let me go, I have to get through.
I have to get in!

(Mulder walks up to her.)

MULDER: Mrs. Scully?

(He goes to put his hand on her shoulder, but he notices her staring at the blood on it. He looks at the blood on them for the first time.)

She's not in there.

MARGARET SCULLY: Where is she?

(Mulder does not respond.)

Where is she?

SCENE 2
11:46 P.M.

(Outside the house, reporters and cameramen file onto the front lawn as the policemen and various other people shuffle around. One can hear many people talking illegibly. Mulder and Margaret Scully are standing in a doorway.)

MARGARET SCULLY: I knew it would happen this way. I had this dream about Dana being taken away.

(Mulder leads her into the room. Flashbulbs are going off in the back.)

I, uh... I was going to call her but I was afraid I was going to scare her.

(She sits down. Mulder sits down across from her.)

She would have laughed at me anyway. She doesn't believe in that kind of thing, you know.



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 8:03 A.M.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man sits off to the side, smoking. Skinner slowly walks around a table as he speaks. Sitting at the table are Mulder, Krycek, and numerous other officials.)

SKINNER: According to the reports I reviewed, Agent Scully research states that Duane Barry's propensity for violent, deviant behavior is due to brain damage from a bullet wound in the head. Is this the operational opinion?

(Skinner looks to Mulder for an answer, but none is given.)

KRYCEK: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Is there another?

KRYCEK: He's convinced he's going to be abducted by aliens. That by taking someone to the abduction site, he won't be abducted himself.

SKINNER: That he's following orders from alien voices in his head.

KRYCEK: Yes.

SKINNER: Well, that's an interesting spin on the Nuremburg defense. Which explanation do you subscribe to, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: There's a question of how he could've gotten to her in the first place.

MAN: And you think these alien voices told her?

MULDER: Agent Scully was carrying a small piece of metal that was removed from Duane Barry's abdomen, an implant he described as a tracking device.

MAN: Agent Scully thought that you had made a major miscalculation in Duane Barry's psychosis. Is that true?

MULDER: Yes, but that still doesn't explain how he could have found her.

(Krycek glances over to the Cigarette-Smoking Man.)

SKINNER: Where would he be taking her?

MULDER: I don't know. He talked about a mountain but he wasn't specific about the location.

SKINNER: Well, however he got to her and whatever his motives, he took Agent Scully's car and weapon. I think we all understand the seriousness of this matter and should proceed ahead quickly with all possible resources. I need you to turn over your files to H.R.T...

MULDER: I'd like to brief them myself...

SKINNER: Go home, Agent Mulder, you've been up all night. Get some sleep.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Sir, I know Duane Barry. I've been in his head, I know how he thinks...

SKINNER: You're too close to this case. If we can use you, we will.

MULDER: Sir...

SKINNER: That's an order, Agent Mulder.

(He looks at Krycek.)

Make sure he gets home safely.

(Krycek stands up.)

KRYCEK: Come on.

(They walk out.)



SCENE 4
ROUTE 229; RIXEYVILLE, VIRGINIA; 11:23 A.M.

(Duane Barry is driving down the road. The radio is playing "Red Right Hand" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Duane Barry makes a very sharp left down a bridge and speeds off. Soon, a police car pulls out of a side road and follows him, sirens blaring. The cop flashes his lights. Duane pulls over and rolls down his window. The patrolman adjusts a camera. He walks over to the car and, holding onto his gun in it's holster, looks over at Barry. Inside the trunk, Scully is bound and gagged.)

PATROLMAN: Sir? Can you turn off your radio?

DUANE BARRY: I would, officer, but I got to keep going.

APB WIRE CONDUCTOR: An F.B.I. APB has been issued for a suspect in the abduction of an F.B.I. agent...

PATROLMAN: Sir, I asked if you mind turning that off.

(Barry turns it off.)

DUANE BARRY: Okay. But could you just give me the ticket now so I can go? I got to be someplace.

PATROLMAN: Where?

DUANE BARRY: I'm not sure but... they'll tell me when I get there.

(The patrolman looks at Barry's hands and sees that there his knuckles are bloody and his hospital ID band has blood on it too. He takes out his gun and points it at Duane.)

PATROLMAN: Sir... put your hands on the steering wheel where I can see them.

DUANE BARRY: You don't understand. They're waiting for me, I, I can't be late.

PATROLMAN: Put your hands up and exit the vehicle.

DUANE BARRY: No, I got to keep moving. Please? For your own sake? Don't stop Duane Barry.

PATROLMAN: Sir, put your hands up.

(Scully starts moaning, hearing the cop, and bangs on the trunk hood. The patrolman turns around and looks at it. Duane pulls out his gun and shoots the cop. He screams and falls, startling Scully. Duane opens up the hood and looks at her.)



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS; VIDEO PRODUCTION UNIT; 3:11 P.M.

(Mulder points to a monitor which has a surveillance shot on it of Barry looking into the trunk with the officer down to the side.)

MULDER: Right there.

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: Okay.

(Mulder walks over to the technician at the computer.)

MULDER: Back it up a few frames.

(He does so.)

Can you magnify this area?

(He points into the trunk. The technician magnifies it many times until there is a clear head shot of Scully with the gag in her mouth.)

VIDEO TECHNICIAN: My God...

MULDER: She's still alive. Print this up.

(The printer feeds out the picture of Scully.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; 4:08 P.M.

(Mulder sits at his desk, listening to a tape recording of the hostage situation. He's looking at the picture.)

DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING: I just want to go back to the place.

MULDER ON RECORDING: What place?

DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING: Where it first started. Where they first came and got me.

MULDER ON RECORDING: Where is that?

DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING: A mountain. We went, uh, up... and up.
Ascending... ascending to the stars.

(He rewinds it.)

Ascending... ascending to the stars.

(Krycek walks over carrying two coffees.)

KRYCEK: Coffee?

(Mulder takes out his earphones.)

MULDER: Yeah.

(Krycek puts the coffee down on the table.)

Thanks.

KRYCEK: Yeah. How'd you sleep?

MULDER: I didn't.

(He rewinds the tape again.)

DUANE BARRY ON RECORDING: You're not taking Duane Barry again.

(He rewinds the tape more.)

A mountain. We went, uh, up... and up. Ascending... ascending to the stars.

(He rewinds.)

Ascending to the stars.

KRYCEK: What is it?

(Mulder stops the tape.)

MULDER: Where was that patrolman killed again?

KRYCEK: Rixeyville, Virginia. Route 229.

MULDER: Doesn't Route 229 lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway?

KRYCEK: I don't know.

(Mulder gets up and walks over to one of many shelves full of telephone books.)

What?

(Mulder pulls one out and flips through it. He finally lands on the page he wants that has an ad that reads:

"Ascend to the Stars
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN
555-7684 Spectacular views and a full service grill")

MULDER: Ascend to the stars. Skyland Mountain.

(He rips the page out.)

KRYCEK: You know where he's going?

MULDER: Get your car and meet me downstairs.

KRYCEK: Where are we going?

MULDER: Just get your car.

KRYCEK: What about Skinner?

MULDER: I'll deal with Skinner.

(He takes his overcoat and walks off. In the parking lot, Krycek's talking on the phone, standing next to his car.)

KRYCEK: He thinks Scully's been taken up to Skyland Mountain. I'll hold him off until they locate her.

(He looks behind his shoulder and sees Mulder approaching.)

Wait, here he comes. I'll be in touch.

(He hangs up and pushes the antenna down.)

MULDER: Come on, let's go.

(Krycek gets in the driver's side and slams the door. Mulder runs to the other side, gets in and they speed off. As they turn out of the parking lot, they pass a parked car whose driver is the Cigarette-Smoking Man. He lowers the cellular phone from his ear, flips it closed and pushes down the antenna. He takes on more puff of his cigarette before throwing it out.)



SCENE 7
ROUTE 211; WARRENTON, VIRGINIA; 5:43 P.M.

(Krycek and Mulder speed down the road. Mulder's eyes close. He struggles to keep them open, but he falls asleep. Krycek looks at him, then hears a honking. A mack truck is speeding towards them.)

KRYCEK: Hey!

(He pushes Mulder, who wakes up. Mulder looks at the truck and swerves out of the way. Krycek sighs in relief.)

You're dozing off. Maybe I should drive.

MULDER: I'm fine.

KRYCEK: Well, you haven't slept yet. I have.

MULDER: No, I said I'm fine.

(Krycek stares at him for a few seconds then sighs.)

KRYCEK: You know, Chernobyl, Exxon Valdez, Three Mile Island... they were all linked to sleep deprivation.

(Mulder looks at him for a second, then turns his attention back to the road.)

The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that over 190,000 fatal car crashes every year are linked to sleepiness.

MULDER: Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics?

KRYCEK: I'm just trying to keep you awake.

(They pass a gas station.)

MULDER: Look, I know you think we should have told Skinner but if he sends in the whole cavalry, Duane Barry might go over the edge.

KRYCEK: You're right.

MULDER: If we find him first, we'll notify the Bureau. All right?

KRYCEK: Yeah. You really think he tracked her down with that implant?

MULDER: Well, that's the easiest explanation. It's also the most implausible.

KRYCEK: Is there another possibility?

MULDER: Somebody could have given him her address. I don't know who.

(Krycek looks ahead at the road and points to a sign that reads "Ascend to the Stars, Skyland Mountain.")



SCENE 8
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN; SKYLAND, VIRGINIA

(Krycek and Mulder are walking with the tram operator. The operator is looking at a mug shot of Barry.)

KRYCEK: You seen this guy?

TRAM OPERATOR: Yeah, he was here.

KRYCEK: He's wanted for kidnapping a federal agent. Did you let him go up in the tram?

(He takes the picture and puts it in his coat pocket.)

TRAM OPERATOR: No way, it's shut down for the summer. I told him to take the back road up.

KRYCEK: How long ago?

TRAM OPERATOR: About forty-five minutes.

MULDER: Did he have a woman with him?

TRAM OPERATOR: No.

KRYCEK: How long does it take to drive to the top?

TRAM OPERATOR: Little over an hour.

(They stop at a sign for the tram.)

MULDER: You gotta get me up there.

TRAM OPERATOR: No, no way. We just got done refitting the cable. It hasn't been tested with passengers yet. You'll have to drive.

MULDER: I don't have the time.

TRAM OPERATOR: You don't have a choice.

MULDER: No, you don't have a choice.

(He pulls back his overcoat to reveal his gun. He unhooks the holster. The tram operator looks at him warily. Inside the control booth, the operator turns a key and the machinery starts. He then flips a switch.)

TRAM OPERATOR: Okay, I can't stop you from going up there but if there's a problem with the cable, I'm shutting this down. I'm not going to be responsible for your death.

(They all walk to the tram. Mulder gets in and bolts the door. Krycek leans up against it.)

KRYCEK: What are you doing?

MULDER: Stay here and whatever happens, don't let him stop the tram.

(He walks over to the panel.)

TRAM OPERATOR: Okay, you hit your "run" and "up" button on the panel. Speed indicator controls your ascent. Now when you want to slow down...

(Mulder starts the tram up its path.)

Don't crank it faster than fifteen!

(The operator goes back to the booth as Krycek watches the tram go up. In the tram, Mulder moves the speed indicator from "slow speed" to "fast speed." The speedometer shoots up from fifteen to twenty. The tram operator, standing by the machinery, hears the cables grinding. Meanwhile, Duane Barry races up the roads. Mulder cranks it even more, and the machine shoots up to 25.7, then to 26.)

What the hell's he doing? I told him not to go that fast.

(He picks up the intercom transmitter.)

Base to car one, pick up.

(The noises from the machinery grow louder.)

Do you hear that sound? At this speed, the cable can't hold.

(The tram shoots up the cable. Inside Barry's trunk, Scully moans through her gag as Barry turns the corners. The tram is now at thirty. The tram operator cannot be heard over the machinery.)

...a sec. Do you hear me? Slow...

(Mulder's tram races past another one going the opposite way.

Base to car one, pick up.

(Mulder picks up the transmitter and adjusts the frequency.)

MULDER: Go ahead.

TRAM OPERATOR: Slow it down.

MULDER: You're breaking up.

TRAM OPERATOR: Slow down or the cables'll jump when you hit that tower!

(Mulder looks and sees a tower approaching. He slows it down to twenty-five and the car shakily passes the tower. Barry passes a sign that says "Ascend to the Stars, Skyland Summit." Mulder speeds it back up to thirty.)

Slow it down for the next tower.

(Mulder turns the speed down to fifteen as he passes the next tower.)

KRYCEK: How close is he?

TRAM OPERATOR: Should be up top in a minute.

(Krycek pulls back his coat and unhooks his holster. On the monitor, we can see the tram approaching.)

There he is.

(Krycek grimaces and pistol-whips the operator across the face, knocking him out. He sighs and fixes his hair. He flicks the switch and turns the key back. The tram rocks back and forth, having stopped. Mulder picks up the transmitter.)

MULDER: What are you doing? Turn it back on. Krycek, what's happening down there?

(Krycek takes out his cell phone, raises the antenna and starts dialing.)

Krycek, do you read me? Tell the operator to restart the tram. Hello?

(The phone rings. We can still hear Mulder intelligibly.)

KRYCEK: I've got him stalled up there. I'll hold until you advise.

(Barry drives past cabins, Scully breathing heavily in the trunk.)

MULDER: Is there an emergency system on-board? Can you read me down there?
Can anyone read me?

(He puts down the transmitter and goes to a small compartment. He takes off the lid and throws away a tag that says "Screamer Suit." He pulls out a harness, and throws it down. He pulls down a ladder and climbs on top of the tram. Krycek looks at the monitor in awe as the sky grows dark. Mulder starts to climb up. Krycek turns the key then flips the switch. The tram restarts, throwing Mulder nearly off the tram. He grabs on to the side of the roof and pulls himself up, narrowly avoiding the next tower. The tram reaches the end and comes to a halt. Krycek sighs. Mulder runs over up the hill and comes to Barry's car. The driver's side door is open. He looks in with the flashlight and sees the car is empty. The radio is playing and a woman is talking intelligibly. He notices blood on the steering wheel. He pops the trunk and opens it up. It is empty, except for a bloody rope and a necklace with a cross on it. He takes the cross and hears a noise. He looks up and sees a giant light beaming down from something. The object then speeds off. Duane's laughing can be heard. Mulder races over to him and points his gun.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(Duane stands and holds his hands up in the air in triumph. Mulder runs towards him, keeping his gun on him.)

DUANE BARRY: Yes!

MULDER: Freeze!

DUANE BARRY: Yes, yes, yes!

MULDER: I said freeze! Where is she?

DUANE BARRY: I'm free, you son of a bitches! You can't touch Duane Barry anymore!

MULDER: Don't move.

(Duane laughs insanely as Mulder grabs his wrists and pulls them behind his back.)

Don't move!

DUANE BARRY: I'm not going anywhere!

MULDER: Where is she? Where'd you leave her?

DUANE BARRY: They took her.

MULDER: Who?

DUANE BARRY: Them! I told you they would take somebody else. They did!

(Mulder starts to lead him back towards the car when a helicopter shoots up from behind the hill, shining a bright spotlight on them. Duane thinks that the aliens have returned.)

No, no! No! No, no, no!

(Mulder struggles to hold him back.)

No! No! No! No! Nooo! Noooo!



SCENE 9
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN SUMMIT; 8:46 P.M.

(Firemen run by outside of the house.)

APB WIRE CONTROLLER: Choppers found them on the mountain. Send out five teams to search for that federal agent.

(Inside, a medic tapes up the bullet wound in Duane's chest. Barry is sitting in a chair, his hands bound behind him. Another man holds a paper cup to his lips.)

MEDIC #2: Water.

(Barry drinks it. The two medics plus the guard start to the door.)

MEDIC #1: We'll wait outside.

(They leave. Mulder is sitting in a chair as well, looking ragged. They sit in silence for a few seconds, Mulder staring at Barry. Mulder gets up and puts his hands on his hips.)

MULDER: Now what happened after you took her out of the trunk?

DUANE BARRY: We walked a-little ways up to the top of the mountain. Right where you found me.

MULDER: Then where'd you take her?

DUANE BARRY: I didn't. They did. That was the deal. Her instead of me.

(Mulder closes his eyes for a second, then walks directly in front of Barry.)

MULDER: (quietly) Did you kill her?

DUANE BARRY: No.

(Mulder stares at him.)

I swear.

(Mulder points to the burn marks on Barry's face.)

MULDER: How'd you get this?

DUANE BARRY: From the ship.

MULDER: What ship?

DUANE BARRY: You saw it.

MULDER: I saw a helicopter.

DUANE BARRY: They were here. I'm not lying to you!

(He looks through the window into the other adjoining room and sees various men in suits watching. They start to file out.)

There they are. Ask them. They know what happened!

(He gets up but Mulder pushes him back into the chair.)

MULDER: Sit down, Duane.

DUANE BARRY: No! You've got to stop them! Hurry, hurry!

(Mulder looks back into the adjoining room and sees no one.)

They were just out there! They were right outside!

(He gets up and starts to the window. Mulder grabs him by his wrists and spins him around, slamming his face down into the desk.)

MULDER: Duane, settle down!

DUANE BARRY: They'll tell you where she is!

(Mulder looks at his hospital ID band and sees Scully's blood and a few of her hairs on it.)

The military's in on it, just ask them!

(He rips off the band and looks at it, then spins Barry around and gets right into his face, holding the band up.)

MULDER: Did you hurt her?

DUANE BARRY: No.

MULDER: Did you hurt her!?

DUANE BARRY: No!

MULDER: What is this?

(Duane shakes his head "no." Mulder grabs him by the throat and starts choking him. Barry gags as Mulder squeezes the life out of him. After a few seconds, Mulder lets go and slams Barry, coughing and gagging, down into the chair. Mulder paces, holding his face in his hands. He then looks at Duane, takes his coat, and starts out.)

DUANE BARRY: I'm sorry.

(Mulder looks back.)

They had to take her. I hope they're not hurting her... too much with the tests. I'm sorry.

(Mulder walks out. He starts down the hallway, passing Krycek.)

KRYCEK: Hey?

MULDER: Yeah.

KRYCEK: What, what's the matter, what, what'd he say to you?

MULDER: No, he's giving me nothing. Were you out here alone?

KRYCEK: Yeah, why?

MULDER: Nobody goes in or out of that room.

(He starts walking.)

MAN: Hey, Mulder?

(Mulder waves the man off. He walks to the window and looks through it. In one of the lights, he sees Scully on an operating table, crosses of light shining over her arms. A drill starts spinning down from the ceiling towards her. Scully's eyes open suddenly. Another instrument comes down from the ceiling. Then, he sees some kind of tube attached to Scully's belly button. Her stomach starts inflating, being filled with air. It grows very large as two figures, presumably aliens, watch in the background. Mulder hears a click and turns around, startled. He sees the door ajar. He walks through.)

APB WIRE CONTROLLER: Rescue two, we're on the Warsaw building, southwest.

(He walks over and looks through the window to Duane's room. He sees Barry talking to Krycek. Mulder taps on the window and Krycek looks back at him. Mulder waves him out. Krycek says a few more things to Barry and leaves the room, walking over to Mulder.)

MULDER: What are you doing in there?

KRYCEK: I heard him...

MULDER: Come here.

(They walk away from the window.)

KRYCEK: I heard him gagging in there, he couldn't breathe.

MULDER: No one...

KRYCEK: I...

MULDER: No one!

KRYCEK: He said you choked him!

MULDER: No one is to interrogate the suspect.

KRYCEK: Except you.

MULDER: Except me. Did you ask him about Scully?

KRYCEK: Yeah.

MULDER: What'd he say?

KRYCEK: He started whistling "Stairway to Heaven."

(They hear a car pull up. Mulder looks back at the room, then they walk down the hallway, passing a security guard.)

Keep an eye on him.

GUARD: Okay.

(The guard walks back to the room as Mulder and Krycek continue to the door. Skinner and three men are standing there.)

SKINNER: You got Duane Barry?

MULDER: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, you disobeyed my direct order.

GUARD: Call the paramedics!

(Mulder, Krycek, Skinner and the others run in to see two guards kneeling over Barry, who is on the ground choking. Mulder kneels down next to them.)

MULDER: What happened?

GUARD: He was gagging...

MULDER: Duane? Duane?

(Duane gags and wheezes.)

Duane!

(Duane looks at him slightly, his body tensed. Suddenly, he wheezes a final breath as his body untenses. His eyes close shut. Two paramedics run in, one carrying a kit.)

PARAMEDIC #1: Coming through!

(They kneel down. The first one listens for breathing as the second one unpacks his kit. Mulder stands up and backs away next to Krycek.)

PARAMEDIC #2: Respiration?

PARAMEDIC #1: Hmm, nothing. CPR...

(The first paramedic takes a plastic piece and fits it into Barry's mouth, then puts a pump respirator over that.)

PARAMEDIC #2: Ready?

(The respirator wheezes as the three agents watch on.)

One, two, three, four, five...

(The respirator wheezes again four times. Skinner stares at Mulder.)

One, two, three...



SCENE 10
FBI ACADEMY MORGUE; QUANTICO, VIRGINIA; 6:07 AM

(Barry's body is under a sheet on the table. His toe-tag reads:

"Medical Examiner
Name: Barry, Duane
Case No. 197735 Date: 6/17/94
Where taken from: Skyland, VA."

Mulder is standing over it. A female doctor walks in.)

PATHOLOGIST: Excuse me.

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy of this man's autopsy report.

PATHOLOGIST: I'm sorry, it's still incomplete.

MULDER: Are you the pathologist?

PATHOLOGIST: Yes.

MULDER: Can I ask what your preliminary findings are?

(She sighs and looks at the clipboard she's carrying.)

PATHOLOGIST: Umm... "Second-degree burns to the face, contusions about the neck, bruised larynx..." If I had to list cause of death at this point, I'd have to say asphyxiation. Were you expecting something else?

(She walks around the body. Mulder coughs.)

MULDER: You haven't run a toxicological yet?

PATHOLOGIST: They should be finished shortly.

MULDER: I'd be interested to see what you find. When will they be on file?

PATHOLOGIST: Later this morning.

MULDER: I'd like a copy as soon as possible, please.

PATHOLOGIST: Oh, I'm sorry, you'll have to go through regular military channels.

MULDER: What do you mean, "military?" You're not F.B.I.?

PATHOLOGIST: Quantico's under military jurisdiction. There wasn't an F.B.I. pathologist available this morning.

(She wheels the body out as somebody holds the door for her.)



SCENE 11
DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON, D.C.; 6:16 AM

(Krycek walks through an underground parking lot warily, looking around as he walks. He opens the driver's side door of his car and gets in. He looks to his right and sees the Cigarette-Smoking Man. He clears his throat.)

KRYCEK: Skinner's expecting my report on the Duane Barry incident. What do I tell him?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: The truth.

(He stubs out his cigarette.)

KRYCEK: What do you mean?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Confirm Mulder's version of events. You've earned his trust, the object now is to preserve it.

KRYCEK: For how much longer?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Until your assignment is complete.

KRYCEK: If Mulder is such a threat, why not eliminate him?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: That's not policy.

KRYCEK: It's not? After what you had me do?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Kill Mulder and you risk turning one man's religion into a crusade.

KRYCEK: What about Scully?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: We've taken care of that.

KRYCEK: How?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: We tell you only what you need to know.

KRYCEK: I think I have a right to know.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You have no rights, only orders to be carried out. If you have a problem with that, we'll make other arrangements.

(He gets out of the car, leaving Krycek alone.)



SCENE 12
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 10:36 A.M.

(Skinner is looking at a picture of Duane Barry.)

SKINNER: Victim appears to have expired from prolonged hypoxemia, secondary to asphyxiation.

(He passes it around the table to a man.)

Several possible etiologies and most likely strangulation due to the presence of contusions and a bruised larynx. Do you want to speak to this, Agent Mulder?

(The man passes it to a woman, who puts it down in front of Mulder.)

MULDER: I didn't kill him, if that's what you're suggesting.

SKINNER: But you attacked him?

MULDER: I was interrogating him about Agent Scully. He wasn't cooperating so I pushed him.

MAN: And you lost control.

MULDER: Momentarily. But then I left the room. He was very much alive, I spoke to him. Agent Krycek spoke to him.

(We now see the Cigarette-Smoking Man watching on.)

SKINNER: Agent Krycek says he entered the room because the suspect was gagging.

MULDER: Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too?

SKINNER: No. He corroborates your story. But the fact is, we've got a dead suspect, Agent Mulder and no other plausible cause of death. O.P.C. wants the both of you to take a lie detector test. You're to report there immediately.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: There is another plausible cause of death.

SKINNER: Which is?

MULDER: Poisoning by injection or ingestion.

(The other people at the table look back at Skinner, who flips through his file.)

SKINNER: Poisoning?

MULDER: You won't find that on the navy pathologist's report.

SKINNER: What are you saying, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: That the autopsy is incomplete. That the military covered up the toxicological findings.

SKINNER: And why would they do that?

MULDER: Because they know where Scully is.

MAN: Why are you so paranoid, Mulder?

MULDER: Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because I find it hard to trust anybody.

(He walks out. Skinner looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who takes a drag. Outside, Mulder walks up to Krycek, who is walking down the hall reading a file, and puts his hand on his shoulder.)

MULDER: Alex? Alex, can I borrow your car keys?

KRYCEK: Why, where are you going?

MULDER: There's someone I've got to see.

KRYCEK: Yeah, but we're scheduled at O.P.C...

MULDER: I know, just give me the car keys please.

(Krycek sighs, reaches into his pocket, and hands Mulder the keys.)

Thanks.

(He turns and walks away. Krycek watches him go, a dour expression on his face.)



SCENE 13
OFFICE OF SENATOR RICHARD MATHESON; 11:45 A.M.

(Outside the building, people hustle and cars fly by. Inside, Mulder walks up some stairs and starts towards his office, but X appears at the top of the next flight of stairs.)

X: You've wasted a trip, Mister Mulder. There's nothing the Senator can do for you now.

MULDER: What?

(Mulder walks up the stairs to him.)

X: Not without committing political suicide.

MULDER: Why? Do they have something on him?

X: They have something on everyone, Mister Mulder. The question is when they'll use it.

MULDER: I need his help.

X: No one can help you now. Your channels of appeal and recourse are closed.

MULDER: Your predecessor could have helped me.

(They stare at each other. Mulder looks away for a second, then walks around him, shaking his head.)

Oh... you know, don't you? You know what's happened to her.

(X turns to face him as Mulder walks.)

X: This reaches beyond any of us, Mister Mulder. Even my predecessor.

MULDER: I want an answer!

X: Why kill Duane Barry if there was nothing to hide?

MULDER: You mean the government?

X: There are no answers for you, Mister Mulder. They only have one policy...

(He steps into the light, and we can see his face clearly for the first time.)

Deny everything.

(X walks past him and up the stairs. Mulder thinks for a second, then walks back down the stairs and out. Passing businessmen, he goes to the car and gets in. He thinks for a second, then opens up the ashtray. He sees the cigarette butts. He picks up one and looks at it. He puts it back and slams the drawer shut.)



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 8:11 A.M.

(Skinner sits at his desk, looking at Mulder's report. Mulder stands, waiting, a thick stubble on his face.)

SKINNER: This is a serious allegation, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: So long as it's true.

SKINNER: "Agent Krycek was hired or suborned by an outside agency to impede a federal investigation and may be responsible for the death of a suspect in a capitol murder case."?

MULDER: It goes on.

(He sits.)

SKINNER: "And the possible murder of the tram operator at Skyland Mountain." There's a lot of blood on this document, Agent Mulder. Are you standing behind this, going on the record?

MULDER: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Then you damn well better have the facts to back it up.

(Mulder nods. Skinner presses a button his intercom, which beeps.)

I need to see Agent Krycek immediately.

(He stands and goes to the window.)

I can't protect you, Agent Mulder. Past a point, this will become a larger bureau matter.

(He turns around and looks at him.)

All right, what do you got?

(Mulder pulls a small bag containing the cigarette butt he found out of his pocket. He tosses it next to an ashtray full of them.)

MULDER: I found this in Agent Krycek's car. He doesn't smoke. Agent Krycek was the last person with Duane Barry before he died. He was also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappeared. When I got to the top of Skyline Mountain, I saw an unmarked helicopter working the area. I believe that Agent Krycek gave away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Agent Scully to whoever he's working with.

SKINNER: And who is that?

MULDER: I don't know, the military? Some covert organization within the government? Whoever it is that man who smokes those cigarettes works for.

SKINNER: Why?

MULDER: Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever it is they're trying to deny. Because she had hard and damning evidence, that metallic implant in her possession. Or because her termination would prevent further involvement with me and my work.

SKINNER: Do you think Agent Scully's dead?

MULDER: I don't know. How far do you think they'd go?

(Skinner looks away.)

What do you know about Agent Krycek?

SKINNER: I didn't give him the assignment, I only...

(The phone rings. Skinner looks at it and picks it up. He listens for a second or two.)

Yes. Thank you.

(He hangs up.)

Agent Krycek didn't show up for work this morning. His home number has been disconnected.

(He sits down.)

MULDER: That's it? He's gone, he just disappears into the woodwork?

SKINNER: So it would appear.

(Mulder stands and marches towards the door angrily before turning back.)

MULDER: Who are these people who can just murder with impunity and we can't do anything about it?

SKINNER: Let it go, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Like hell.

SKINNER: There's nothing you can do.

MULDER: What can you do about it?

SKINNER: There's only one thing I can do, Agent Mulder. As of right now, I'm reopening the X-Files.

(He stands.)

That's what they fear the most.

(Agent Mulder walks out. Later, he sits down on a park bench. Margaret Scully walks up to him.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Agent Mulder?

(Mulder stands.)

Thank you for calling me.

MULDER: I'm sorry I don't have better news.

MARGARET SCULLY: Do you know something? Is Dana okay?

MULDER: We don't know anything more about her.

MARGARET SCULLY: I know you're doing all you can.

(Mulder motions for her to sit. She does so, and Mulder sits down next to her.)

I had that dream again last night. About Dana being taken away? I can't tell you how it scares me.

MULDER: It's probably scarier when you stop having the dream. Don't you think?

(They look at each other. She looks about to cry. They both look down at the floor in silence for a few seconds. Mulder is about to say something, but stops himself. He pulls Dana's cross necklace out of his pocket.)

I found this.

(He puts it in her hand.)

It's something I... I never considered about her. If she was... if she was such a skeptic, why did she wear that?

MARGARET SCULLY: I gave it to her on her fifteenth birthday.

(Mulder nods. She places the cross back in his hand.)

MULDER: Don't you want to keep it?

(She closes his hand.)

MARGARET SCULLY: When you find her, you give it to her.

(He nods slightly.)



SCENE 15
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN, VIRGINIA

(Mulder walks alone up to the top of the hill. He looks out at the trees, then up at the stars. He stares at them, looking crestfallen.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

SCENE 1
HOLLYWOOD HILLS
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
12:41 AM

(Night. Exterior of nice house in Southern California. Helicopter view of forest fires in the distance. An older man, GARRETT LORE, stands drinking a glass of red wine. He spills a drop on his white shirt.)

LORE: Damn. (enters the house) Theres ash in the wine from the fires in Malibu Canyon. You can almost see from here.

(Naked WOMAN stands silhouetted in the darkened doorway. She strikes a match and lights a candle, then blows out the match.)

LORE: (feeling guilty) I want you to know I I dont do this. I mean, Im not one of those guys that sends his family on vacation just so he can  but when I met you at the corporate party, I

WOMAN: Shh. (finger on his lips) Itll be worth it. Ill do things with you no ones ever done.

(She turns on the hot tub.)

(Later, the two of them are passionately kissing in the tub. A man stands hidden behind them with a syringe.)

LORE: (as she bites too hard and breaks the skin) Ouch!

(The woman lifts her blood covered mouth from the mans neck. The man attacks LORE. Another man comes out of the shadows and also attacks. LORE cries out. The glass of wine is knocked over and shatters.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
X-FILES OFFICE

(X-Files office. MULDER enters, carrying a folder, and begins pulling dusty plastic off the desk and cabinets. He changes the Playboy-like calendar from May to November. He opens a file cabinet. He opens the folder and removes a new X-File marked "Dana Scully 7 3317." He puts the file in the cabinet then reaches in folder and removes SCULLYs glasses and badge. He takes the gold cross necklace from inside the badge, puts the badge and glasses in a baggie and puts it beside the file and closes the drawer. He fingers the cross gently. Phone rings. Mulder turns, eager.)



SCENE 3
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

(Shot of plane dropping red powder fire retardant over Southern California. Exterior of LOREs house in California. Crime Scene. DETECTIVE NETTLES is in charge.)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: Lets start in the bedroom and work our way downstairs.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Dont let the media in on the writings in blood on the wall.

DETECTIVE MUNSON: Okay.

(MULDER arrives alone and ducks under the tape.)

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Excuse me, sir? If I can ask your indulgence? This is a restricted crime scene.

MULDER: (showing badge) Agent Mulder. Im with the Bureau.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Nobody called the Bureau.

MULDER: They should have.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Look, LAPDs seen, I dont know, what? Maybe a couple of weird crime scenes down the years. I think we can handle things.

MULDER: (walking toward house) Theres no time for agency rivalries. I dont care about credit for the arrest or what goes on whose record. In the past year these killers have murdered six people in two states. They only kill at night. By the end of the week, two more people will be dead and they will be gone.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Just how do you know all this?

MULDER: Theres a file on the previous murders. Ive studied it. Ive studied them. Ive been waiting three months for them to reappear.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: And just how can you be sure that these are the same killers?

MULDER: The wire reported a body was found drained of blood, bite marks on the exterior jugular and median cubital veins. Every mirror in the house was smashed.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Yeah, well, its what the wire didnt report that distinguishes this scene.

MULDER: Theres writings on the wall written in the victims blood.

(They look at bloody words written on the wall.)

MULDER: "He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day." They have the same feeble grasp of the Bible as all those big-haired preachers do. The victim  was he a father?

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Yeah. Three boys. The familys been notified.

MULDER: In Memphis, they murdered James Ellis, 58, father of Ellis and Sons Clothiers. The second victim was a Korean woman -- Linda Sun. The third victim was a Jesuit Theologian. Excuse me. (MULDER has taken off his jacket and put on latex gloves and is kneeling down beside the overflow trap of the hot tub) In Portland, three months ago the first victim was a priest. The second victim was the only son of a family of six children. The last victim was the owner of a new age book shop --- The Holy Spirit. (feels around in trap) I believe thats how they perceive themselves, as a kind of Unholy Trinity. (pulls a used needle out of the trap) They use these to extract blood and store it for a quick fix later. Their need is insatiable, but murdering for blood risks exposure and capture. If my profile of the previous cases holds true, theyve been living in the city and working near blood products for the past month.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: (impressed) Look, Agent Mulder, look Im really sorry I was such a hard ass back there. In this town, its really tough to trust anyone. Truth is, Id be happy to have you work on our investigation. (begins to introduce another detective) Now this is Detective Gwen ----

MULDER: Im working alone. (turns and begins walking away)

DETECTIVE NETTLES: (surprised) An FBI Agent without a partner? Look, Mulder, our departments under a crisis alert right now because of the fires in the canyon. The fact is, I dont think I can free up any resources for you.

MULDER: I only need one thing.



SCENE 4

(Police office. MULDER is crossing off numbers of blood banks in the phone book as he calls them.)

VOICE: (on phone) Hollywood Blood Bank.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, hi. This is Marty Mulder from your payroll service. I have a question regarding the W -4 form of a recent employee.

VOICE: (on phone) You mean Frank?

MULDER: (on phone) When was he hired?

VOICE: (on phone) Couple of weeks ago. He's the night watchman.



SCENE 5

(Blood bank. Night. MULDER quietly searches the building. Pulls his gun and surprises MAXWELL, an employee, making him drop the vials of blood he is carrying.)

MULDER: Federal Agent!

MAXWELL: Easy, man, easy! Sorry, man. I didnt know you were there. Damn freak night watchman always breaking the light bulbs.

(MAXWELL opens door for MULDER.)

MAXWELL: Ill wait upstairs.

(MULDER goes downstairs. Hears heavy breathing and suckling sounds. He uses a metal spoon to check reflection around the corner. Sees nothing. MULDER turns the corner and confronts JOHN, THE SON whose mouth is covered with the blood he has been drinking.)

MULDER: Federal Agent! Freeze!

(JOHN, THE SON throw the jar of blood at MULDER. MULDER ducks then tackles and handcuffs JOHN, THE SON.)



SCENE 6

(Police interrogation room. JOHN, THE SON, is screaming and writhing on the floor as DETECTIVE NETTLES and DETECTIVE MUNSON watch impassively.)

JOHN, THE SON: Turn off the lights! Turn them off! Youre killing me! Turn them off! Turn them off! Please!

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Tell us your real name.

JOHN, THE SON: I cant take it! Turn off the lights!

(MULDER enters with a lamp with a red gel over it.)

JOHN, THE SON: Youre killing me! Turn them off! Please! Turn off the lights! Please! Turn them off! Turn them off!

(MULDER flicks off the overhead light. JOHN, THE SON stops screaming and looks at MULDER.)

MULDER: That better?

JOHN, THE SON: (sucks blood from his own hand for a moment in the red light) Ill only talk to him.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: (as they exit) Lucky you.

JOHN, THE SON: You know what we are.

MULDER: What are you?

JOHN, THE SON: (as if reciting scripture) He is the Father, I am the Son, and she is the Unholy Spirit.

MULDER: And the three of you killed Garret Lore.

JOHN, THE SON: No.

MULDER: Your fingerprints were found at the crime scene.

JOHN, THE SON: No. When a snake eats a fly, its not murder. It just is.

MULDER: Frogs eat flies. Are you dead?

JOHN, THE SON: I never will be.

MULDER: Do you believe that?

JOHN, THE SON: Dont you want to live forever?

MULDER: (considers) Well, not if drawstring pants come back into style.

JOHN, THE SON: Look, what nobody realizes is that there is no afterlife. I know this. Listen, listen, I know this because when we prolong our lives by taking theirs all I see is such horror in their eyes and thats because at that moment theyre face-to-face with death and then suddenly they realize theres nothing else. Theres no heaven. Theres no soul. Theres just rot and theres just decay. And I will never, ever, ever, ever have to face that.

MULDER: Its a stiff price, though. Look at yourself  drinking blood, living in darkness, unable to see your reflection in a mirror. Or is that just a myth?

(MULDER palms a mirror and sees JOHN, THE SONs reflection in it.)

JOHN, THE SON: (positive) I cant be seen in a mirror. Look anything worth anything has a price and when Im standing next to your deathbed looking as young as I look right now and I see that fear in your eyes at the moment of death then, then tell me the price is too stiff.

MULDER: Its more likely Ill be looking in your eyes at the moment before they lead you into the gas chamber. Thats a moment you wont have to face if you tell me where the others are.

JOHN, THE SON: Why would I? Theyre the only ones that can kill me.

MULDER: Well, if you are what you say you are, I know what can kill you.



SCENE 7

(Later, dawn, MULDER, holding a roll of aluminum foil, and JOHN, THE SON are in a jail cell with a long window. The sunlight almost fills the room. JOHN, THE SON is cringed against the last remaining dark wall.)

MULDER: Itd be easy to cover those windows. Just tell me where the other two are. In another couple of hours, therell be no escaping the sun. Son.

(JOHN, THE SON spits at MULDER. MULDER knocks on the door and a guard lets him out.)

MULDER: If he wants to talk, cover the windows and call me. (hands him the foil)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: What if he turns into a bat and flies out through the bars?

MULDER: That man is clearly delusional but I get the sense that not even he believes his claims. For now, weve got to play along with his beliefs. Im hoping the sunlight will give him an excuse to talk.

DETECTIVE MUNSON: Why dont you go back to your hotel and get some sleep.

MULDER: I didnt check into a hotel room. I dont sleep anymore. (smiles bitterly and leaves)



SCENE 8

(Two hours later in the cell. The sun reaches JOHN, THE SONs feet. He begins screaming as smoke rises from his feet, and tries to press as far against the wall as he can.)

GUARD: (outside the cell) Number four, right away!

(More screaming.)

GUARD: (outside the cell) Number four, right away!

(Screams continue. Guards watch as JOHN, THE SONs burnt body falls to the floor.)



SCENE 9

(Later, in the cell, the coroner, DR. BROWNING, and MULDER look at JOHN, THE SONs burned body.)

DR. BROWNING: An edema ball at the nostrils. Rupture of the skull due to internal steam pressure these are indications of long term exposure to extreme temperatures, not a sunburn for 15 seconds.

MULDER: The guards found no flammable materials? I had believed that this mans illness was psychological.

DR. BROWNING: There is a condition known as Gunthers Disease  congenital erythropoietic porphyria creating cutaneous photosensitivity.

MULDER: Im familiar with porphyria. Its an affliction which causes lesions and blisters when skin is exposed to sunlight, not fourth degree burns. Sufferers may have a hema deficiency which can be supplemented by a small ingestion of blood, not the kind of bloodthirst this man had. Its probably ignorance of porphyria as a disease that led to the creation of vampire myths in Asia in the Middle Ages. I had dismissed the possibility of the actual existence of such a creature as myth.

DR. BROWNING: (staring at MULDER throughout his speech) You are really upsetting me. On several levels.

MULDER: When will you get the blood tests back?

DR. BROWNING: Next week.

MULDER: (pointing to JOHN, THE SONs hand) Whats this purple stain here?

DR. BROWNING: Could be an ink stamp like they give at a party or a club.

MULDER: Can you read it?

DR. BROWNING: It is possible that the heat burned the ink permanently into the lower levels of the skin. (gets a lamp from GUARDS DESK AND HOLDS IT OVER THE HAND:) An old coroners trick.

MULDER: I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear.

(DR. BROWNING smiles then peels skin away revealing "Club Tepes" on the hand.)



SCENE 10
CLUB TEPES

(Club Tepes. Smoky, loud dance club. Vampire movies on the TV screens. MULDER, very out of place in his suit, enters. He passes by KRISTEN, beautiful, extremely thin, very spooky looking. She is sitting alone using at a compact with no mirror. He walks around her, curious.)

KRISTEN: Are you about to ask what a normal person like me is doing in a place like this?

MULDER: (sitting) How do you define normal?

KRISTEN: (to waitress) Risha .. Red wine. (to MULDERs ear) I dont. How do you?

MULDER: I dont. All I know is, uh .. normal is not what I feel.

KRISTEN: Youve lost someone. Not a lover, a friend. (wine arrives) Ill get these. (hands over money, MULDER sees syringes in her purse)

(They raise glasses.)

MULDER: He who drinks my blood

KRISTEN:shall have eternal life. (they drink) Youre not interested in this place  in what we do.

MULDER: How do you know?

KRISTEN: Youre afraid of me. I take the life of others inside me, into my blood.

MULDER: I need to know.

(KRISTEN takes his hand, very sexual, and leads him to a dark corner of the bar where they sit. She pulls one of several syringes out of her purse.)

KRISTEN: All day long I deal with equity notes, bonds, nothing thats real. This gives my life life. (she pricks her finger and offers the bloody tip to MULDER) My names Kristen. Its a normal name.

MULDER: (pulling her hand away from his mouth) AIDS. Arent you afraid?

KRISTEN: I wish I could die.

(KRISTEN gets up and walks to a man, DAVID YUNG on the dance floor. She kisses him, then offers him the drop of blood on her finger that MULDER refused. YUNG takes her finger into his mouth and sucks on it. MULDER watches confused, almost jealously. KRISTEN leads YUNG out of the club. MULDER follows discreetly. A man, THE FATHER watches them leave.)



SCENE 11
8426 MELROSE AVE.

(Later, MULDER drives up to a house. Over the door is an eagle with a sun.)

MULDER: (to himself) Father. The Sun.

(He looks in the window and sees KRISTEN kissing YUNG. A trickle of blood runs down YUNGs throat. A car turns the corner nearby illuminating MULDER. KRISTEN sees him. MULDER tries to open the door, then backs away and runs around the house to another door where YUNG opens the door and knocks MULDER back down the stairs. MULDER lies on the pavement.)

YUNG: I dont know who you are, Freak, but were two consenting adults. Now, get the hell out of here.

(YUNG goes back inside.)

YUNG: Kristen? Kristen? (doesnt see her) Kristen? Come out. Its my turn.

(Eats a strawberry out of the refrigerator. Sees the shape of a woman in the door.)

YUNG: Dont worry. I took care of that guy. I told you Id protect you.

(YUNG is knocked to the floor by a man. YUNG begins screaming as the woman and another man converge on him.)



SCENE 12

(Later, same house, now a crime scene. YUNGs body still on floor.)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: The murderers cut off the power supply at some point and the phone. Fits their MO.

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Agent Mulder, this is our forensic dentist you requested  Dr. Jacobs.

DR. JACOBS: (shakes hands) How do you do.

MULDER: (quietly) I dont want to bias your report, but I need a preliminary examination for anything unnatural.

DR. JACOBS: Uh huh. (to an officer) Shine the light down here. (begins looking at the body)

(MULDER searching the house finds KRISTINs compact under the stove and a can of raspberry sauce dripping in the refrigerator. With fingerprints.)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: Agent Mulder. All this time Ive been putting raspberry sauce on ice cream.

MULDER: Check these prints immediately. One will be the victims. The other should be the woman were looking for.

(MULDER goes back to DR. JACOBS.)

DR. JACOBS: Well, the bites are not done by an animal. These are human. And, realize this is a cursory exam, but Id say they were made by three different people.



SCENE 13

(Police station. MULDER is looking at the file on KRISTEN.

KRISTEN KILAR
1233 MALIBU CANYON
MALIBU, CA 91607
SEX:F HAIR :BL EYES:
HT: 58" WT: 100 DOB:
RESTR: None

There are two previous addresses.

164 Valley View Dr. Portland, Oregon 97223

4057 Sweetgum Lane Memphis, Tennessee 88161

MULDER looks at the files of the murders that were committed in each of those cities.)

MULDER: The Unholy Spirit.



SCENE 14

(KRISTENs house. MULDER and team of police arrive.)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: Weve got the front. You guys go around back. You, check the garage. Okay. Do it. Open her up.

(They pick the lock and enter the house.)

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Miss Kilar? Los Angeles Police Department. We have a warrant to search the premises.

(No response.)

(MULDER goes into the kitchen, latex gloves on. DETECTIVE MUNSON joins him and shows him what he has found.)

DETECTIVE MUNSON: I found these. Veterinary needles. Size matches the puncture wounds of the previous victims. This is from a snake bit kit. Its placed over the wound to extract poison. Only this one

MULDER: Has blood in it.

(DETECTIVE MUNSON is called away to another part of the house.)

(MULDER opens the oven and finds a loaf of bread. He breaks it open and finds that it is filled with blood. He quickly shuts the oven again when DETECTIVE NETTLES enters the kitchen.)

DETECTIVE NETTLES: Well, she wasnt at work, and shes not here.

MULDER: (with conviction) Shes gone, and shes not coming back.



SCENE 15
2:15 AM

(That night. KRISTEN comes in the house. She takes down her hair, then notices MULDER sitting in the foyer. His tie is gone, shirt partially unbuttoned. He looks exhausted.)

MULDER: Special Agent Fox Mulder. (shows badge) Federal Bureau of Investigation. Theyre after you.

KRISTEN: How do you know?

MULDER: The bread. Legends in Eastern European countries. Its said that one can protect oneself eating bread filled with blood. You were protecting yourself.

KRISTEN: (walking toward him) And now youre protecting me?

MULDER: I think its best if I took you into protective custody. Theyll kill once more. Theyll try to kill you.

KRISTEN: (circling him) Why are you here alone? Because you think youre not afraid? Because you need to know. You need to know they are who you believe they are.

MULDER: What I believe you to be.

(KRISTEN crosses to the window and listens to the helicopters overhead.)

KRISTEN: One change in the wind and the fires will move this way. Have you ever tasted blood? (MULDER hesitates) No. You havent. Blood tastes dangerous. Its sweet and thick.

MULDER: (moving toward her) You were in Memphis and Portland when the other murders occurred. How are you connected?

KRISTEN: When I was a little girl, my father my father beat me. "Abused" is too frail a word. He showed his love for me by beating me. I was dead. One night, he hit me so hard he knocked out two teeth, then locked me in my room. The blood poured from my mouth onto the floor and down my throat. It was the only way I knew I was alive. I met John in Chicago. You know him as "The Son." He also beat me. (laughs softly) I guess that's the way it works sometimes. He hit me once and cut open my lip. I was angry. As revenge, I jumped on him and I bit through his lip. He tasted my blood. And I tasted his. After that, we were into blood sports. But... I never... I lost him. One night he came home with two others and it turned... unnatural. I left him and I moved to Memphis.

MULDER: But they followed you. They want you.

KRISTEN: Im tired of running. And youre here to protect me.

(She reaches into his shirt and fingers SCULLYs cross which MULDER is wearing.)

KRISTEN: (amused) You trying to ward me off?

MULDER: Thats from someone I lost.

KRISTEN: Well, I hope you find her.

MULDER: The one you lost, John, hes dead. But theyve picked up another. Theyre three again. Kristen, youll be safer if you come back to the police station with me.

KRISTEN: Without him, they wont come for me. I wont go.

MULDER: Then I wont go.

KRISTEN: (smiles) You need to get cleaned up.

(MULDER, sighs, and looks sheepishly embarrassed.)

(Later, MULDER, shirtless, is in the bathroom shaving by feel, since there is no mirror. KRISTEN knocks.)

MULDER: Yeah?

(KRISTEN enters in a robe and looks at him.)

MULDER: No mirrors.

KRISTEN: I dont like the way I look.

MULDER: That makes this hard.

KRISTEN: (sitting on the sink in front of him) Ill do it.

(MULDER steps between her legs and lets her take the razor and begin shaving his face. On the second swipe, MULDER grunts as she nicks his jaw on the left side. She stops shaving him and reaches out and wipes the blood onto her finger. She brings the drop to her lips, but MULDER grasps her wrist and pulls her hand away from her face.)

MULDER: Its not who you are. It doesnt make you happy.

(They stare at each other for a moment, then KRISTEN pulls his head to hers. He meets her in a kiss that quickly builds in hunger and intensity. Locked in the kiss, MULDER pushes her down and back out of frame. Wow. They are not watching TV tonight. Outside the window, JOHN, THE SON watches them with evil intent. Sound of helicopters overhead.)



SCENE 16
5:47 AM

(Later, just before dawn, KRISTEN is walking through the dark house. Suddenly, JOHN grabs her and puts his hand over her mouth. She struggles.)

JOHN, THE SON: I've been watching. I had to wait for you to finish. I had to wait to tell you. It's true. I was as surprised as anybody. (releases her) You can live forever. Everybody else just dies but we... We come back. The spirit showed me. And now she'll show you. We live in a different world, Kristen, and nobody on the outside can end my life. You can't kill me but I can kill you. I know, Kristen, what I did to you was... if I were to die I would certainly go to hell for what I did, but I love you and I can atone for eternity. Kill him... and we'll be together. You've got to drink the blood of his spirit.

KRISTEN: But hes not

JOHN, THE SON: No, no. He is. A spirit is one who believes. He knows we're possible. You don't have much time before the sun comes up. (holds up knife) Cut him open... and we'll finish.

(KRISTEN takes the knife and goes into the bedroom. MULDER is sleeping, fully clothed. She leans over him. He wakes.)

KRISTEN: You have to go.

MULDER: (sitting up suddenly) Are they here?

KRISTEN: The fire. You have to go.

MULDER: (putting on his shoes) My cars down the hill.

KRISTEN: Mines in the garage. The keys are in it.

MULDER: You have to get your things.

KRISTEN: Ill be right there.

(MULDER ducks as she stabs with the knife, but she hits the figure beside the bed, THE FATHER. MULDER watches as she stabs him repeatedly. THE FATHER staggers forward and falls on the bed.)

KRISTEN: Hes not dead! Johns alive. I saw him.

MULDER: Come on.

(MULDER leads her out into the hall. JOHN, THE SON attacks MULDER, and they fight. MULDER whacks JOHN, THE SONs legs, then uses a lamp cord to tie him up. Then MULDER pulls KRISTEN into the garage and puts her in the passenger seat of her car, then gets in the drivers seat and starts the car. The WOMAN from the beginning, the UNHOLY SPIRIT, drops down onto the car and pulls MULDER out the sunroof after she shatters the glass. KRISTEN starts the car and runs into THE UNHOLY SPIRIT forcing her to release MULDER. THE UNHOLY SPIRIT begins speaking Rumanian, and KRISTEN rams the car again, pinning the SPIRIT against the wall. As she slides limply down the wall, we see a trail of blood where she was impaled on a wooden peg in the wall.)

MULDER: (running to KRISTEN) Are you all right?

KRISTEN: I wont leave without him.

MULDER: Ill go.

(MULDER runs back into the house and begins to untie JOHN, THE SON. He hears a car motor from the garage and runs back to investigate. He sees the empty garage, and runs down the long driveway, finding KRISTENs empty BMW.)

(Inside the house, KRISTEN pours gasoline all around JOHN and the two other unconscious ones in the hall.)

JOHN, THE SON: Well rise up! You cant kill us! Youre not one of us!

KRISTEN: But I will be. (smiles, wipes blood off a wound on her head, then licks the blood off) Im tasting the blood of a believer.

JOHN, THE SON: (getting nervous) But you havent taken a life.

(KRISTEN opens a box of matches and lights one.)

KRISTEN: Ill take mine.

JOHN, THE SON: Dont do that! Dont do that! Dont! Dont! Dont! No! No! No!

(Smiling sadly, KRISTEN drops the match.)

(MULDER, walking back to the house sees the huge explosion as fire quickly consumes the house.)



SCENE 17

(Later, FIREMAN approaches MULDER who is sitting on the grass nearby the burned house.)

FIREMAN: Agent Mulder. (kneels down) Im sorry. We found four bodies  all dead.

MULDER: The remains?

FIREMAN: The fire was extremely hot. Its just ashes and bones.

(The FIREMAN walks away. MULDER reaches into his collar and pulls out SCULLYs cross necklace and looks at it. He holds it tightly as he looks off into the distance.)

[THE END]
                                                 ONE BREATH



SCENE 1

(Were flying right above the clouds as Margaret speaks.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Once, when she was a girl... a very little girl... Dana was in the woods.

(The sun shines as leaves fall.)

It was autumn.

(Little Dana is running through the woods.)

She had always been a tomboy, unlike her sister Melissa.

(Dana is holding a B.B. gun as her brothers point out how to use it and things about it.)

For her birthday, Danas brothers had given her a B.B. gun and were showing her how to use it.

(William Scully puts a tin can down on a log.)

Their father had told them only to shoot cans...

(William Jr. picks up a garter snake from a pile of leaves.)

But in a patch of grass, Bill Jr. found a garter snake.

(He tosses the snake off and aims his B.B. gun at it, along with his brother. Dana joins in and all three shoot at the garter snake.)

And they began shooting. Wanting to fit in with her brothers, Dana also shot at the snake.

(The bullets pierce the ground near the snake as it tries to get away.)

It squirmed wildly, desperatly fighting for life but as the boys continued to shoot the snake began to bleed. When she realized what she had done...

(Dana lowers her gun and walks over to the dead snake. She kneels down, picks it up and begins to cry.)

Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt. Through her tears, she was saying that... something was missing from the snake. She had taken something that was not hers to take. And although deathly afraid of snakes, Dana held the animal as if sheer human will could keep it alive. The snake, its blood on her hands, died. There was nothing she could do to bring it back.

(We see Mrs. Scully and Mulder are sitting at a table.)

MULDER: Its too soon, Mrs. Scully. We cant give up.

MARGARET SCULLY: That day in the woods, I felt for my daughter. But at this moment, I know how my daughter felt.

(The door opens and Mrs. Scully stands up. A man walks in carrying something. She walks over and he lifts the cover off. Mulder walks over, looks at it, and turns away. It is a tombstone, and it reads:

" = DANA KATHERINE
======= SCULLY
= 1964--------1994
= LOVING DAUGHTER & FRIEND
"The Spirit is the Truth." JOHN 5:07")

SCENE 2
MULDERS APARTMENT

(An X-File, presumably Scullys, sits on his desk. We hear moaning emanating from the TV, a man and a woman. Mulder is lying on the couch. He looks at the TV, then rewinds it and plays it again. The phone rings. He looks up at it.)



SCENE 3
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder storms through the halls, then starts jogging. Phones ring and doctors talk as Mulder runs past them. A nurse grabs his hand, trying to stop him.)

NURSE: Sir... sir, you cant go in there!

(He breaks free and runs through a door marked "Authorized Personal Only." He runs to Scullys side. She is hooked up to various machines, her face covered with them. She is in a coma and attached to a respirator.)

MULDER: Who...?

(He looks at Mrs. Scully, who is staring at her daughter. Mulder looks away, knowing her pain. He looks over to the various people sitting around.)

Who brought her here?

(He stands and starts around the bed.)

How did she get here?

NURSE: Sir, will you please...

MULDER: (shouting) How did she get here?

NURSE: Ms. Scully was in this condition when I arrived for the evening shift. If youll step outside, perhaps Dr. Daly...

MULDER: Is that Daly?

(He points at a man, then walks over to him.)

Are you Dr. Daly?

(The man nods.)

Whats going on? How the hell did she get here?

DOCTOR DALY: Would you settle down...

MULDER: Was it, was it paramedics, FBI, military? Answer me right now!

(People start murmuring and screaming. Mrs. Scully does not look up, her eyes fixated on her daughter.)

DOCTOR DALY: I...

MULDER: What, youre telling me she just appeared?

DOCTOR DALY: Sir...

MULDER: Who did this to her!?

DOCTOR DALY: Sir...

(Mulder goes to the nurses desk and starts throwing papers.)

MULDER: I want to see her admission forms. Who did this to her? I want to see what tests have been done!

(Daly struggles with him for the papers. Security guards grab Mulder and start dragging him away.)

Listen, if youre hiding anything, I swear, I will do anything, whatever it takes, I will find out what they did to her!



SCENE 4
DALYS OFFICE

(Daly is looking at some charts. Mrs. Scully is sitting in a chair, Mulder is sitting on the arm.)

DOCTOR DALY: Presently, we have Dana listed under critical condition, comatose. There is complete unawareness of self or environment. There is no evidence of language comprehension, no evidence of voluntary responses to external stimuli. My apologies but... no one here can determine how Dana arrived at the hospital, administered and how she was attended to in such critical condition. Um... because of the absence of Danas recent medical history, I am at a loss for prognosis. I cant determine with certainty how long shes been in this state.

MARGARET SCULLY: You havent told us why shes like this.

DOCTOR DALY: We just dont know, Mrs. Scully. There are no indications of acute injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic, I cant find any signs of degenerative or metabolic disorders. We have conducted every test possible.

MULDER: Id like her examined for trace evidence.

DOCTOR DALY: She has been bathed and cleaned since her admittance. Also, there is a situation which I dont know if youre aware of. The F.B.I. has notified us of the terms of Danas living will.

MARGARET SCULLY: What is it, what did she say?

DOCTOR DALY: Well, Dana is a doctor. Her criteria for terminating life support is quite specific. She states that, um... if her glasgow outcome scale lists her...

MULDER: (to Mrs. Scully) She doesnt want to live in this condition.

DOCTOR DALY: (to Mulder) You signed the will as her witness.



SCENE 5
DANAS HOSPITAL BED

(Danas sister, Melissa stands over her, holding a crystal above her. Mulder comes over and Melissa looks at him.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Ive been told not to call you Fox.

MULDER: By who?

MELISSA SCULLY: Dana, just now.

MULDER: Dana talked to you just now? If she talked, the EEG would have moved.

(Melissa laughs.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Her soul is here.

(Mrs. Scully walks over.)

Hi, Mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: Im glad you could come, Melissa.

MULDER: Youre Scullys sister.

MELISSA SCULLY: Danas choosing whether... whether to remain or move on.

(She puts her hands over Scullys body. Margaret walks away.)

You can feel her. Here.

(She places his hand above Scullys body. In Scullys mind, she is sitting in a rowboat on a lake The rowboat is tied to a dock with a piece of rope. On the dock, she sees Mulder and Melissa, with a nurse in the background.)

MULDER: Shes not here.

MELISSA SCULLY: No, your anger and your... your fears blocking...

(Back to the room.)

...any positive emotions she needs to feel.

MULDER: I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air.

(He walks away.)



SCENE 6
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder takes some masking tape and puts an "X" on his window. He shines the lamp through it and turns off the rest of the lights. He sits down. Over the course of the night, he waits patiently, sometimes playing with a basketball, before going to sleep. In the morning, he wakes up, looks at the "X" and goes to the door. He picks up the newspaper, goes back in, unwraps it, and flips through it. He sees no help from X. He throws it away, rips the "X" off the window and slams his fist down.)



SCENE 7
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Frohike walks in, decked out in a suit and bowtie, carrying flowers. He walks to the nurses desk.)

NURSE: May I help you?

FROHIKE: Uh, Dana Scully, please.

(Mulder looks over to the voice, moving the phone away from his ear.)

MULDER: Frohike?

(A nurse pulls open the curtains and takes Frohikes flowers. They look at Scully, Frohike saddened. He takes a look at her charts.)

FROHIKE: Hey, Mulder. This is weird.



SCENE 8
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Byers is sitting down, looking at the charts. Mulder sits at another desk. Frohike is standing, and Langly walks over and sits on the desk behind Mulder.)

BYERS: Good work sneaking out these charts.

FROHIKE: Snuck em in my pants.

MULDER: Theres plenty of room down there.

(Frohike looks at him and sits down on the desk next to Byers.)

LANGLY: You look down, Mulder. Tell you what, youre welcome to come over Saturday night. Were all hopping on the internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of "Earth 2."

MULDER: Im doing my laundry.

BYERS: The chart shows abnormal protein chains in the blood. The amino acid sequence is in a combination Ive never seen before.

(He slides his chair over to the computer. They all walk over to him.)

Ive downloaded Scullys medical data to the newest Lone Gunman.

FROHIKE: He goes by the name "The Thinker."

BYERS: This guys a hacking genius.

(On the screen is a picture of Nixon with such phrases as "I am not a crook!" and "Let me make this perfectly clear..." The screen flips to one that has a 3-D image of Scullys DNA, as well as two other charts with DNA coding. The computer beeps twice and sentences begin filing in. Byers and Langly read it and look worried.

MULDER: What?

BYERS: The Thinker reports the protein chains are a result of branched DNA.

MULDER: Branched DNA?

LANGLY: The cutting edge of genetic engineering.

BYERS: A biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.

LANGLY: This is way beyond cutting edge. This technology fifty years down the line.

MULDER: Whats it used for?

FROHIKE: Could be a tracking system.

BYERS: Developmental stages of a biological marker.

MULDER: You mean a high-tech identity card?

LANGLY: Or something as insidious as grafting a human into something... inhuman.

(The computer beeps again.)

BYERS: Good theories, gentlemen, but all for naught.

(He points at a protein data map.)

This branched DNA is inactive. Its waste product. Whoever was experimenting on Scully is finished. Now its nothing more than a biological poison.

MULDER: Will she live?

(Byers looks at Mulder, then at Langly, who looks back solemnly.)

BYERS: Um... her immune system has been decimated and, uh... I doubt even a healthy human body has the ability to fight this. Mulder, theres nothing you can do.



SCENE 9
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, there is now a nurse standing at the shore.)

NURSE OWENS: Dana? Dana, honey? I know you can hear me. This is Nurse Owens. Im here to take care of you, sweetheart, to watch over you. Help you find the way home.

(In reality, Owens is leaning over on the bed, whispering to her.)

I know youre far away from home tonight and that where you are is peaceful.
It would be nice to stay but Dana, you must leave here only when its time.

(She puts her hand on Scullys forehead. Mulder walks in.)

Ill be here when you need me, dear.

(She kisses Scullys forehead and leaves. The nurse walks in carrying a machine.)

NURSE: Excuse me, sir. Im going to have to take some blood.

(She does so. As she does, Mulder looks back into another room and sees a man in an overcoat standing over an old lady. The man looks back. The nurse puts the vial down on the counter when a long beeping sounds. She looks up to see that the old lady has flatlined. The Overcoat Man is nowhere to be found.)

Code blue crash cart!

(She runs in, along with a few other doctors.)

MALE NURSE: Red wave coming in!

NURSE: Lets go!

DOCTOR: Alright, lets get an airway in!

NURSE: (says something intellegibly) B.P. 80 over 60 and dropping.

(Mulder looks down at Scully. The nurse closes the curtains.)

DOCTOR: Alright, lets shock her. Give me the paddles. 200 joules. Clear!

NURSE: Clear!

(The defribillators go off. Mulder notices that the vial with the blood is gone.)

DOCTOR: What do we got?

NURSE: (says something intellegibly)

DOCTOR: Lets go again, 260, clear!

NURSE: Clear!

DOCTOR: Come on!

(Mulder whips back the curtain and sees the door closing. The doctors and nurses continue talking as he runs out after The Overcoat Man. He runs out to see the man walking down the hall. He begins running after him.)

MULDER: Hey!

(The man begins running as well. The man jumps into an elevator and presses the button many times. Mulder comes too late as the elevator closes. He tries to pry open the doors, pushes the button, then starts running down the stairs. He runs down to the lobby and, seeing no one outside, goes back in and runs down to the parking lot. He sees the Overcoat Man turning a corner. Taking out his gun, he moves silently along the wall until X grabs him, slamming him against the wall and putting a gun to his head.)

X: Didnt expect you here till after visiting hours.

MULDER: There was a man, he took Scullys blood.

X: Forget him.

MULDER: Get that gun out of my face...

X: This high-capacity compact Sig Saver .40 caliber weapon is pointed at your head to stress my insistence that your search for who put your partner on that respirator desist immediately!

MULDER: You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what you say? You go to hell!

X: You got him killed! You got her killed. Thats not going to happen to me. Youre my tool, you understand? I come to you when I need you. Right now, youre heading in a direction that can lead them right here.

MULDER: What the hell are you talking about?

X: Youre not supposed to know. Thats the point.

MULDER: I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing.

X: She was a good soldier, Mulder, but theres nothing you can do to bring her back.

MULDER: Shes not dead.

(X laughs slightly.)

X: Listen to you. Listen. Youre a damn schoolboy, Mulder. You have no idea. No idea!

MULDER: Okay, then tell me. Tell me!

(They stare at each other angrily. X loosens his grip.)

X: I used to be you. I was where you are now. But youre not me, Mulder. I dont think you have the heart. Walk away. Grieve for Scully and then never look back. You will be able to live with yourself, Mulder... on the day you die.

(A door closes and X looks to the sound. Mulder breaks his grip and runs in that direction. X, trying to remain in the shadows, cannot follow him. Mulder sees the man and skulks behind the cars towards him.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(The Overcoat Man fires at him. Mulder moves behind a column. The man runs and opens a door, then goes in. Mulder follows. He looks down both ways of the hallway, then goes right. He hears some rattling and follows the noise. Moving into the laundry room, he manages to sneak up behind the man.)

Federal agent, dont turn around. You know Im armed. Put your gun very slowly on the ground.

(The man does so. Mulder holds his gun at him the whole time.)

Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers. Turn right towards the machine and put your head on it.

(He does so. Mulder walks behind him, reaches into his pocket and pulls out the vial. He walks back to where he was.)

Face me.

(The man does, his fingers still interlocked behind his head.)

Who wants this? Who wants it?

(No answer.)

All right, lets go. This way.

(He points and they start walking. After a few feet, the Overcoat Man grabs a cart and slams it back into Mulder. He then takes a metal pipe and smashes it into Mulder four times, knocking him down and forcing him to drop his gun and the vial. Mulder is nearly unconscious as the man bends over to pick up the vial. As he does, X sneaks up behind him, grabs his hand and twists it around his back, breaking his arm. He then snaps it back, breaking his wrist. X grabs onto him from behind and kicks the gun away. He walks past Mulder just as Mulder begins to regain consciousness. X looks at him.)

X: Stay there.

(He pushes the man forward. Mulder struggles to try to get to his feet.)

MULDER: Wait!

(X whips out a gun and shoots the Overcoat Man, apparently in the arm. He looks at Mulder again as the man groans.)

X: You want to see what it takes to find the truth, Agent Mulder? You want to know what I know?

(Mulder watches as X walks over and shoots the man again, this time in the head. He walks back to Mulder.)

Ill attend to this.

(He walks back towards the man. Later, Daly sits in his office with Melissa, Margaret, and Mulder. They are all sitting except for Fox.)

DOCTOR DALY: Discontinuing the respirator does not necessarily mean pulling the plug or ending her life. Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years after cessation of mechanical ventilation. I do believe, however, that this is not the case with your daughter, Mrs. Scully. My guess is that shes been in this state since her disappearance and she will not improve.

MELISSA SCULLY: Is she below the criteria established in her will?

MULDER: Its possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics.

DOCTOR DALY: Agent Mulder, I dont know where you developed this bizarre diagnosis, but I do believe youre in no position to continue your...

MULDER: Youve never provided an answer as to why shes here or whats wrong with her. We need to study her.

MELISSA SCULLY: Shes not a piece of evidence.

MULDER: Shes here because of unnatural circumstances.

MELISSA SCULLY: Shes dying. Thats perfectly natural. We hide people in these rooms because we dont want to look at death. We have machines prolong a life that should, that should end. Thats a much more unnatural circumstance than any cause of her death.

MULDER: Thats very politically correct.

MELISSA SCULLY: Thats very human. I love her. This is right.

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana has made our decision. Fox... you and Dana had a friendship built on respect. Now, in the last year...

(She stands, almost crying. Melissa is almost crying too.)

I have lost my husband. And God knows I dont want to lose my baby girl. But like you, I have always respected her.

(She walks to the door and turns back.)

Fox... this is a moment for the family. But you can join us if you want.

(Mulder lightly shakes his head no. Margaret, Melissa and Daly walk out. In Scullys mind, she sees Nurse Owens standing on the dock. The rope is pulled taut and suddenly snaps. Scully starts to float away.)



SCENE 10
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNERS OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man throws a document down on Skinners desk and picks up a pack of "Morleys" cigarettes. Skinner is sitting at his desk.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Read it. Its all there. If youre having trouble sitting on Mulder, Assistant Director Skinner, Im sure you know wed have no trouble.

(He puts a cigarette in his mouth and takes out his lighter.)

SKINNER: Uh-uh.

(He nods towards a sign on Skinners desk that reads "Thank You For Not Smoking." Cancer Man proceeds to light it anyway. He takes a few drags as he walks across the room. He stubs it out in an ashtray and walks out through the double-doors. Through the single door at the side of his office, there is a knocking.)

Yeah, come in.

(Mulder walks in and notices the cigarette, still smoking.)

Sit down.

(He does so.)

I called you right up here because of rumors about an incident at the hospital last night.

MULDER: Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria jello?

SKINNER: The rumor has it that you were involved in the laundry room?

MULDER: No, sir.

SKINNER: A man was executed, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I was with Scully.

SKINNER: Traces of her blood were found at the scene.

MULDER: May I see the police report?

SKINNER: There is no police report of this incident, Agent Mulder, and there is no body. You know that.

MULDER: Since I am unfamiliar with any such incident, sir, no, how would I know that?

SKINNER: Knock it off!

(He stands.)

MULDER: Hows it feel? Constant denial of everything, questions answered with a question.

SKINNER: I want to know what happened, damn it.

MULDER: Him. Thats what happened.

(He stands and picks up the ashtray, putting it down on Skinners desk.)

Cancer Man! Hes responsible for what happened to Scully!

SKINNER: How do you know that?

MULDER: Its a rumor. Who is he?

SKINNER: Its not your...

MULDER: Oh, you can have it all, you can have my badge, you can have the X-Files, just tell me where he is.

SKINNER: And then what? He sleeps with the fishes? Were not the mafia, Agent Mulder. I know its easy to forget but we work for the Department of Justice.

MULDER: Thats what I want.

SKINNER: Agent Scully was a fine officer. More than that, I liked her. I respected her. We all know the field we play on and we all know what can happen in the course of a game. If you were unprepared for all the potentials, then you shouldnt step on the field.

(Mulder turns away and walks a few steps before looking back.)

MULDER: What if I... I knew the potential consequences but I... I never told her?

SKINNER: Then youre as much to blame for her condition as... "The Cancer Man."

(Mulder walks out.)



SCENE 11
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, she is laying on a table in a white dress. All the walls are white except for one, which is a black void. Through the void walks her father, dressed in his admirals uniform. He walks over to her.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Hello, Starbuck. Its Ahab. People would say to me, "Life is short." "Kids, they grow up fast," and "Before you know it, its over." I never listened. For me, life went at a proper pace. There were many rewards... until the moment that I knew, I... understood that... that I would never see you again... my little girl. Then my life felt as if it had been the length of one breath, one heartbeat. I never knew how much I loved my daughter until I could never tell her. At that moment, I would have traded every medal, every commendation, every promotion for... one more second with you. Well be together again, Starbuck. But not now. Soon.

(He slowly turns and walks back into the void. In reality, Nurse Owens is standing over her again. She leans in and whispers to her.)

NURSE OWENS: Dana? I know death is at arms reach tonight, but Dana? Your time is not over.

(At the cafeteria, Mulder is eating lunch with Melissa.)

MELISSA SCULLY: You know, Fox sorry, Mulder... you could spend the rest of your life finding every person whos responsible and its still not going to bring her back. Whoever did this to her has an equal horror coming to them.

MULDER: Including myself?

(Melissa looks at him strangely. A woman comes up to Mulder.)

WOMAN: Pardon me, sir, do you have change for the cigarette machine?

(He checks his pockets for money.)

MULDER: No. Sorry, I dont.

(She smiles and walks over to the machine.)

MELISSA SCULLY: What do you mean, yourself?

WOMAN: Theres a pack already here... Morleys. Not my brand.

(She walks away. Mulder stands up and pulls the pack out of the slot. He unwraps the top and opens it. He takes out a folded piece of paper that reads "900 W. Georgia St.")



SCENE 12
THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MANS APARTMENT

(Cancer Man sits in his chair, watching an old war movie. There are various screams coming out of it. On the table, his ashtray is filled to the brim with old cigarettes. His gun sits on the other side of the table as he puts his newly-finished cigarette into one of the beer bottles.)

MAN ON TV: Want a cigarette, Rev? How bout a smoke?

(He picks up a pack of Morleys and hears a creak. He starts to get up when Mulder grabs him by the back off his shirt and throws him back into his chair.)

MULDER: Sit down!

(Mulder swings around and points a gun directly at his head.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Howd you find me?

MULDER: Shut up! Tonight, I ask the questions! Youre going to answer me, you son of a bitch!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Dont try and threaten me, Mulder. Ive watched presidents die.

(He puts a cigarette in his mouth. Mulder backhands it out. Cancer Man looks shocked.)

MULDER: Why her? Why her and not me?

(Cancer Man does not respond. He is slumped back in his chair, obviously somewhat scared.)

Answer me!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I like you. I like her too. Thats why she was returned to you.

(Mulder grips his gun with both hands and leans in a little.)

MULDER: You should be the one to die.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is completely cool and confident now. Mulder, on the other hand, is falling apart.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Why? Look at me. No wife, no family, some power. Im in the game because I believe what Im doing is right.

MULDER: (almost whispering) Right? Who are you to decide whats right?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Who are you? If people were to know the things I know, it would all fall apart. I told Skinner you shot the man in the hospital but I didnt really believe it. And here you are with a gun to my head. I have more respect for you, Mulder. Youre becoming a player. You can kill me now, but youll never know the truth...

(Mulder squeezes the trigger but slowly releases it.)

...and thats why Ill win. Dont worry. Thisll be our secret. We wouldnt want others to start rumors.

(He lights a cigarette and takes a drag. Mulder watches, half-disgusted with Cancer Man and half-disgusted with himself.)



SCENE 13
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON D.C.

(Mulder sits at his computer and is typing something. He clicks a button on the mouse and the printer fires up. He takes the paper out and signs it. It reads:

"To Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner
Please accept my resignation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation effective immediately.

Sincerely,

______________ (Mulders signature.)

Fox Mulder."

He leans back in his chair. Later, Mulder takes his microscope and puts it in a box. Skinner walks in and sighs.)

SKINNER: When I started out, this is where they kept the copier.

MULDER: At least back then, it wasnt just wasted space.

(Skinner walks towards him and tears up Mulders resignation form.)

SKINNER: Its unacceptable.

(Mulder continues packing books into the box.)

Look, I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully, but I will not accept resignation and defeat as self-punishment.

MULDER: All the forensics, the field investigations, the eyewitness accounts... to still know nothing. To lose myself... and Scully. I hate what Ive become.

(Skinner sighs and takes his glasses off. He walks a little bit as Mulder continues putting folders and such in the box.)

SKINNER: When I was eighteen, I, uh... I went to Vietnam. I wasnt drafted, Mulder, I... I enlisted in the Marine Corps the day of my eighteenth birthday. I did it on a blind faith. I did it because I believed it was the right thing to do. I dont know, maybe I still do. Three weeks into my tour, a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy walked into camp covered with grenades and I, uh... I blew his head off from a distance of ten yards.

(Mulder looks at him, shocked. He listens intently now.)

I lost my faith. Not in my country or in myself, but in everything. There was just no point to anything anymore. One night on patrol, we were, uh... caught... and everyone... everyone fell. I mean, everyone. I looked down... at my body... from outside of it. I didnt recognize it at first. I watched the V.C. strip my uniform, take my weapon and I remained... in this thick jungle... peaceful... unafraid... watching my... my dead friends. Watching myself. In the morning, the corpsmen arrived and put me in a bodybag until... I guess they found a pulse. I woke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later.

(He walks towards him.)

Im afraid to look any further beyond that experience. You? You are not. Your resignation is unacceptable.

(He starts out.)

MULDER: You.

(Skinner turns back. Mulder sighs.)

You gave me Cancer Mans location. You put your life in danger.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, every life, everyday is in danger. Thats just life.

(He walks out, closing the door behind him. Later, Mulder carries the box down towards his car. As he reaches the door to the parking lot, a man jumps out in front of him. Mulder drops the box and goes for his gun until he sees it is X. X hands him a plane ticket.)

X: Your plane ticket.

MULDER: But we barely know each other.

X: I cant tell you why she was taken. Its too close to me. Im giving you the men who took her.

MULDER: How?

X: They believe youll be out of town. They believe you information about Scully being kept in your desk in your apartment. AT 8:17 tonight, theyll search your apartment. They will be armed. You will be waiting.

MULDER: Waiting.

X: To defend yourself with terminal intensity. Its the only way, Mulder. The law will not punish these people.

(Mulder sighs and takes the plane ticket.)

After tonight, we cannot make contact for several weeks.

(He dashes off.)



SCENE 14
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder sits alone in the dark, his gun on the table. He spots a shadow covering the light under the door. He looks at his watch. ONLY 7:30. He picks up the gun. As there is a knocking. Outside, Melissa knocks again.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Mulder.

(Mulder opens the door and looks around the hallway.)

Sorry. I came by. You werent answering and your machine wasnt on. Can I come in?

(Mulder looks at her.)

For a second?

(He leads her in and latches the door.)

Why is it so dark in here?

MULDER: Because the lights arent on.

MELISSA SCULLY: Okay. I just came from the hospital. Dr. Daly says... shes weakening. It could be anytime. So I figured youd want to come down and see her.

MULDER: No, I cant.

MELISSA SCULLY: Well, Id think that you would.

MULDER: Yeah, I would. I cant, not right now.

(She walks up to him.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Listen. I dont have to be psychic to see that youre in a very dark place... much darker than where my sister is. Willingly walking deeper into darkness cannot help her at all. Only the light...

MULDER: Enough with the harmonic convergence crap, okay? Youre not saying anything to me.

MELISSA SCULLY: Why dont you just drop your cynicism and your paranoia and your defeat. You know, just because its positive and good doesnt make it silly or trite! Why is it so much easier for you to run around trying to get even than just expressing to her how you feel? I expect more from you. Dana expects more.

(She angrily unlatches the door.)

Even if it doesnt bring her back, at least shell know. And so will you.

(She leaves. Mulder latches the door, sits down and puts the gun back on the table.)



SCENE 15
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder slowly walks up and pulls up a chair. The respirator is gone. Mulder stares at her for a while before putting his hand on hers.)

MULDER: I feel, Scully... that you believe... youre not ready to go. And youve always had the strength of your beliefs. I dont know if my being here... will help bring you back. But Im here.

(He sits back in his chair and stares at her solemnly. The clock reads 8:17.)



SCENE 16
MULDERS APARTMENT

(It is morning. Mulder walks into his apartment to find it completely wrecked. Everything is in shambles. He goes to the doorway from his living room to his office and looks in. He leans up against the door fixture and begins to cry. He slumps down on the floor, crying, looking at his hands.)



SCENE 17
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, she is lying on a bed in a small clearing in a forest. A chair is in the corner. The area slowly fades away into the hospital room. Doctors and nurses walk around.)

NURSE AT DESK: Ill look at the chart.

(The nurse who took her blood starts by, but looks at her and stops.)

NURSE: Call Dr. Daly, now.

(She walks over to her head. Scullys eyes are opened. She blinks.)



SCENE 18
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder sits on his sofa as the phone rings. The machine picks it up.)

MULDER ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message...

(He picks up the reciever.)

MULDER: Im here.

(He listens. Slowly, a smile comes onto his face.)



SCENE 19
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is in a room now, with flowers off to the side. Margaret sits in a chair, Melissa is sitting on her bed. Mulder walks in. Melissa gets up and makes room.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Hello, Fox.

(Scully laughs.)

SCULLY: Not Fox, Mulder.

(Mulder is smiling widely as she looks at him.)

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Mulder, I dont remember anything... after Duane Barry...

MULDER: Doesnt... doesnt matter.

(She sighs. He holds up a blue plastic bag.)

Brought you a present.

(He takes out a video and shows it to her.)

"Superstars of the Super Bowl."

SCULLY: I knew there was a reason to live.

MULDER: I know you want to get some rest, I... just came by to see... how you were doing and say hi.

(He holds her hand then starts out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(He turns back.)

I had the strength of your beliefs.

(He nods and takes her cross out of his pocket. She reaches up and takes it.)

MULDER: I was holding this for you.

(She looks at it, then at her mother, who smiles.)

SCULLY: (quietly) Thanks.

(Mulder smiles and looks at Melissa, who smiles at him. He walks out. Later, she touches the cross as it sits around her neck. The nurse comes in.)

SCULLY: Hmm. Could I see Nurse Owens? Ive got something Id like her to have.

NURSE: Nurse who?

(She hands Scully her medicine and a cup of water. Scully downs it.)

SCULLY: Owens. Short with straight light brown hair? She watched over me in intensive care and Id like to thank her.

NURSE: Dana, Ive worked here for ten years and theres no Nurse Owens at this hospital.

(She walks out. Scully stares at the door, wondering.)

[THE END]

                                         FIREWALKER



SCENE 1

(Were flying right above the clouds as Margaret speaks.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Once, when she was a girl... a very little girl... Dana was in the woods.

(The sun shines as leaves fall.)

It was autumn.

(Little Dana is running through the woods.)

She had always been a tomboy, unlike her sister Melissa.

(Dana is holding a B.B. gun as her brothers point out how to use it and things about it.)

For her birthday, Danas brothers had given her a B.B. gun and were showing her how to use it.

(William Scully puts a tin can down on a log.)

Their father had told them only to shoot cans...

(William Jr. picks up a garter snake from a pile of leaves.)

But in a patch of grass, Bill Jr. found a garter snake.

(He tosses the snake off and aims his B.B. gun at it, along with his brother. Dana joins in and all three shoot at the garter snake.)

And they began shooting. Wanting to fit in with her brothers, Dana also shot at the snake.

(The bullets pierce the ground near the snake as it tries to get away.)

It squirmed wildly, desperatly fighting for life but as the boys continued to shoot the snake began to bleed. When she realized what she had done...

(Dana lowers her gun and walks over to the dead snake. She kneels down, picks it up and begins to cry.)

Dana began to cry with irrevocable guilt. Through her tears, she was saying that... something was missing from the snake. She had taken something that was not hers to take. And although deathly afraid of snakes, Dana held the animal as if sheer human will could keep it alive. The snake, its blood on her hands, died. There was nothing she could do to bring it back.

(We see Mrs. Scully and Mulder are sitting at a table.)

MULDER: Its too soon, Mrs. Scully. We cant give up.

MARGARET SCULLY: That day in the woods, I felt for my daughter. But at this moment, I know how my daughter felt.

(The door opens and Mrs. Scully stands up. A man walks in carrying something. She walks over and he lifts the cover off. Mulder walks over, looks at it, and turns away. It is a tombstone, and it reads:

" = DANA KATHERINE
======= SCULLY
= 1964--------1994
= LOVING DAUGHTER & FRIEND
"The Spirit is the Truth." JOHN 5:07")

SCENE 2
MULDERS APARTMENT

(An X-File, presumably Scullys, sits on his desk. We hear moaning emanating from the TV, a man and a woman. Mulder is lying on the couch. He looks at the TV, then rewinds it and plays it again. The phone rings. He looks up at it.)



SCENE 3
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder storms through the halls, then starts jogging. Phones ring and doctors talk as Mulder runs past them. A nurse grabs his hand, trying to stop him.)

NURSE: Sir... sir, you cant go in there!

(He breaks free and runs through a door marked "Authorized Personal Only." He runs to Scullys side. She is hooked up to various machines, her face covered with them. She is in a coma and attached to a respirator.)

MULDER: Who...?

(He looks at Mrs. Scully, who is staring at her daughter. Mulder looks away, knowing her pain. He looks over to the various people sitting around.)

Who brought her here?

(He stands and starts around the bed.)

How did she get here?

NURSE: Sir, will you please...

MULDER: (shouting) How did she get here?

NURSE: Ms. Scully was in this condition when I arrived for the evening shift. If youll step outside, perhaps Dr. Daly...

MULDER: Is that Daly?

(He points at a man, then walks over to him.)

Are you Dr. Daly?

(The man nods.)

Whats going on? How the hell did she get here?

DOCTOR DALY: Would you settle down...

MULDER: Was it, was it paramedics, FBI, military? Answer me right now!

(People start murmuring and screaming. Mrs. Scully does not look up, her eyes fixated on her daughter.)

DOCTOR DALY: I...

MULDER: What, youre telling me she just appeared?

DOCTOR DALY: Sir...

MULDER: Who did this to her!?

DOCTOR DALY: Sir...

(Mulder goes to the nurses desk and starts throwing papers.)

MULDER: I want to see her admission forms. Who did this to her? I want to see what tests have been done!

(Daly struggles with him for the papers. Security guards grab Mulder and start dragging him away.)

Listen, if youre hiding anything, I swear, I will do anything, whatever it takes, I will find out what they did to her!



SCENE 4
DALYS OFFICE

(Daly is looking at some charts. Mrs. Scully is sitting in a chair, Mulder is sitting on the arm.)

DOCTOR DALY: Presently, we have Dana listed under critical condition, comatose. There is complete unawareness of self or environment. There is no evidence of language comprehension, no evidence of voluntary responses to external stimuli. My apologies but... no one here can determine how Dana arrived at the hospital, administered and how she was attended to in such critical condition. Um... because of the absence of Danas recent medical history, I am at a loss for prognosis. I cant determine with certainty how long shes been in this state.

MARGARET SCULLY: You havent told us why shes like this.

DOCTOR DALY: We just dont know, Mrs. Scully. There are no indications of acute injuries, traumatic or non-traumatic, I cant find any signs of degenerative or metabolic disorders. We have conducted every test possible.

MULDER: Id like her examined for trace evidence.

DOCTOR DALY: She has been bathed and cleaned since her admittance. Also, there is a situation which I dont know if youre aware of. The F.B.I. has notified us of the terms of Danas living will.

MARGARET SCULLY: What is it, what did she say?

DOCTOR DALY: Well, Dana is a doctor. Her criteria for terminating life support is quite specific. She states that, um... if her glasgow outcome scale lists her...

MULDER: (to Mrs. Scully) She doesnt want to live in this condition.

DOCTOR DALY: (to Mulder) You signed the will as her witness.



SCENE 5
DANAS HOSPITAL BED

(Danas sister, Melissa stands over her, holding a crystal above her. Mulder comes over and Melissa looks at him.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Ive been told not to call you Fox.

MULDER: By who?

MELISSA SCULLY: Dana, just now.

MULDER: Dana talked to you just now? If she talked, the EEG would have moved.

(Melissa laughs.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Her soul is here.

(Mrs. Scully walks over.)

Hi, Mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: Im glad you could come, Melissa.

MULDER: Youre Scullys sister.

MELISSA SCULLY: Danas choosing whether... whether to remain or move on.

(She puts her hands over Scullys body. Margaret walks away.)

You can feel her. Here.

(She places his hand above Scullys body. In Scullys mind, she is sitting in a rowboat on a lake The rowboat is tied to a dock with a piece of rope. On the dock, she sees Mulder and Melissa, with a nurse in the background.)

MULDER: Shes not here.

MELISSA SCULLY: No, your anger and your... your fears blocking...

(Back to the room.)

...any positive emotions she needs to feel.

MULDER: I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air.

(He walks away.)



SCENE 6
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder takes some masking tape and puts an "X" on his window. He shines the lamp through it and turns off the rest of the lights. He sits down. Over the course of the night, he waits patiently, sometimes playing with a basketball, before going to sleep. In the morning, he wakes up, looks at the "X" and goes to the door. He picks up the newspaper, goes back in, unwraps it, and flips through it. He sees no help from X. He throws it away, rips the "X" off the window and slams his fist down.)



SCENE 7
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Frohike walks in, decked out in a suit and bowtie, carrying flowers. He walks to the nurses desk.)

NURSE: May I help you?

FROHIKE: Uh, Dana Scully, please.

(Mulder looks over to the voice, moving the phone away from his ear.)

MULDER: Frohike?

(A nurse pulls open the curtains and takes Frohikes flowers. They look at Scully, Frohike saddened. He takes a look at her charts.)

FROHIKE: Hey, Mulder. This is weird.



SCENE 8
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Byers is sitting down, looking at the charts. Mulder sits at another desk. Frohike is standing, and Langly walks over and sits on the desk behind Mulder.)

BYERS: Good work sneaking out these charts.

FROHIKE: Snuck em in my pants.

MULDER: Theres plenty of room down there.

(Frohike looks at him and sits down on the desk next to Byers.)

LANGLY: You look down, Mulder. Tell you what, youre welcome to come over Saturday night. Were all hopping on the internet to nitpick the scientific inaccuracies of "Earth 2."

MULDER: Im doing my laundry.

BYERS: The chart shows abnormal protein chains in the blood. The amino acid sequence is in a combination Ive never seen before.

(He slides his chair over to the computer. They all walk over to him.)

Ive downloaded Scullys medical data to the newest Lone Gunman.

FROHIKE: He goes by the name "The Thinker."

BYERS: This guys a hacking genius.

(On the screen is a picture of Nixon with such phrases as "I am not a crook!" and "Let me make this perfectly clear..." The screen flips to one that has a 3-D image of Scullys DNA, as well as two other charts with DNA coding. The computer beeps twice and sentences begin filing in. Byers and Langly read it and look worried.

MULDER: What?

BYERS: The Thinker reports the protein chains are a result of branched DNA.

MULDER: Branched DNA?

LANGLY: The cutting edge of genetic engineering.

BYERS: A biological equivalent of a silicon microchip.

LANGLY: This is way beyond cutting edge. This technology fifty years down the line.

MULDER: Whats it used for?

FROHIKE: Could be a tracking system.

BYERS: Developmental stages of a biological marker.

MULDER: You mean a high-tech identity card?

LANGLY: Or something as insidious as grafting a human into something... inhuman.

(The computer beeps again.)

BYERS: Good theories, gentlemen, but all for naught.

(He points at a protein data map.)

This branched DNA is inactive. Its waste product. Whoever was experimenting on Scully is finished. Now its nothing more than a biological poison.

MULDER: Will she live?

(Byers looks at Mulder, then at Langly, who looks back solemnly.)

BYERS: Um... her immune system has been decimated and, uh... I doubt even a healthy human body has the ability to fight this. Mulder, theres nothing you can do.



SCENE 9
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, there is now a nurse standing at the shore.)

NURSE OWENS: Dana? Dana, honey? I know you can hear me. This is Nurse Owens. Im here to take care of you, sweetheart, to watch over you. Help you find the way home.

(In reality, Owens is leaning over on the bed, whispering to her.)

I know youre far away from home tonight and that where you are is peaceful.
It would be nice to stay but Dana, you must leave here only when its time.

(She puts her hand on Scullys forehead. Mulder walks in.)

Ill be here when you need me, dear.

(She kisses Scullys forehead and leaves. The nurse walks in carrying a machine.)

NURSE: Excuse me, sir. Im going to have to take some blood.

(She does so. As she does, Mulder looks back into another room and sees a man in an overcoat standing over an old lady. The man looks back. The nurse puts the vial down on the counter when a long beeping sounds. She looks up to see that the old lady has flatlined. The Overcoat Man is nowhere to be found.)

Code blue crash cart!

(She runs in, along with a few other doctors.)

MALE NURSE: Red wave coming in!

NURSE: Lets go!

DOCTOR: Alright, lets get an airway in!

NURSE: (says something intellegibly) B.P. 80 over 60 and dropping.

(Mulder looks down at Scully. The nurse closes the curtains.)

DOCTOR: Alright, lets shock her. Give me the paddles. 200 joules. Clear!

NURSE: Clear!

(The defribillators go off. Mulder notices that the vial with the blood is gone.)

DOCTOR: What do we got?

NURSE: (says something intellegibly)

DOCTOR: Lets go again, 260, clear!

NURSE: Clear!

DOCTOR: Come on!

(Mulder whips back the curtain and sees the door closing. The doctors and nurses continue talking as he runs out after The Overcoat Man. He runs out to see the man walking down the hall. He begins running after him.)

MULDER: Hey!

(The man begins running as well. The man jumps into an elevator and presses the button many times. Mulder comes too late as the elevator closes. He tries to pry open the doors, pushes the button, then starts running down the stairs. He runs down to the lobby and, seeing no one outside, goes back in and runs down to the parking lot. He sees the Overcoat Man turning a corner. Taking out his gun, he moves silently along the wall until X grabs him, slamming him against the wall and putting a gun to his head.)

X: Didnt expect you here till after visiting hours.

MULDER: There was a man, he took Scullys blood.

X: Forget him.

MULDER: Get that gun out of my face...

X: This high-capacity compact Sig Saver .40 caliber weapon is pointed at your head to stress my insistence that your search for who put your partner on that respirator desist immediately!

MULDER: You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what you say? You go to hell!

X: You got him killed! You got her killed. Thats not going to happen to me. Youre my tool, you understand? I come to you when I need you. Right now, youre heading in a direction that can lead them right here.

MULDER: What the hell are you talking about?

X: Youre not supposed to know. Thats the point.

MULDER: I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing.

X: She was a good soldier, Mulder, but theres nothing you can do to bring her back.

MULDER: Shes not dead.

(X laughs slightly.)

X: Listen to you. Listen. Youre a damn schoolboy, Mulder. You have no idea. No idea!

MULDER: Okay, then tell me. Tell me!

(They stare at each other angrily. X loosens his grip.)

X: I used to be you. I was where you are now. But youre not me, Mulder. I dont think you have the heart. Walk away. Grieve for Scully and then never look back. You will be able to live with yourself, Mulder... on the day you die.

(A door closes and X looks to the sound. Mulder breaks his grip and runs in that direction. X, trying to remain in the shadows, cannot follow him. Mulder sees the man and skulks behind the cars towards him.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(The Overcoat Man fires at him. Mulder moves behind a column. The man runs and opens a door, then goes in. Mulder follows. He looks down both ways of the hallway, then goes right. He hears some rattling and follows the noise. Moving into the laundry room, he manages to sneak up behind the man.)

Federal agent, dont turn around. You know Im armed. Put your gun very slowly on the ground.

(The man does so. Mulder holds his gun at him the whole time.)

Put your hands behind your head and interlock your fingers. Turn right towards the machine and put your head on it.

(He does so. Mulder walks behind him, reaches into his pocket and pulls out the vial. He walks back to where he was.)

Face me.

(The man does, his fingers still interlocked behind his head.)

Who wants this? Who wants it?

(No answer.)

All right, lets go. This way.

(He points and they start walking. After a few feet, the Overcoat Man grabs a cart and slams it back into Mulder. He then takes a metal pipe and smashes it into Mulder four times, knocking him down and forcing him to drop his gun and the vial. Mulder is nearly unconscious as the man bends over to pick up the vial. As he does, X sneaks up behind him, grabs his hand and twists it around his back, breaking his arm. He then snaps it back, breaking his wrist. X grabs onto him from behind and kicks the gun away. He walks past Mulder just as Mulder begins to regain consciousness. X looks at him.)

X: Stay there.

(He pushes the man forward. Mulder struggles to try to get to his feet.)

MULDER: Wait!

(X whips out a gun and shoots the Overcoat Man, apparently in the arm. He looks at Mulder again as the man groans.)

X: You want to see what it takes to find the truth, Agent Mulder? You want to know what I know?

(Mulder watches as X walks over and shoots the man again, this time in the head. He walks back to Mulder.)

Ill attend to this.

(He walks back towards the man. Later, Daly sits in his office with Melissa, Margaret, and Mulder. They are all sitting except for Fox.)

DOCTOR DALY: Discontinuing the respirator does not necessarily mean pulling the plug or ending her life. Karen Ann Quinlan lived for nine years after cessation of mechanical ventilation. I do believe, however, that this is not the case with your daughter, Mrs. Scully. My guess is that shes been in this state since her disappearance and she will not improve.

MELISSA SCULLY: Is she below the criteria established in her will?

MULDER: Its possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics.

DOCTOR DALY: Agent Mulder, I dont know where you developed this bizarre diagnosis, but I do believe youre in no position to continue your...

MULDER: Youve never provided an answer as to why shes here or whats wrong with her. We need to study her.

MELISSA SCULLY: Shes not a piece of evidence.

MULDER: Shes here because of unnatural circumstances.

MELISSA SCULLY: Shes dying. Thats perfectly natural. We hide people in these rooms because we dont want to look at death. We have machines prolong a life that should, that should end. Thats a much more unnatural circumstance than any cause of her death.

MULDER: Thats very politically correct.

MELISSA SCULLY: Thats very human. I love her. This is right.

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana has made our decision. Fox... you and Dana had a friendship built on respect. Now, in the last year...

(She stands, almost crying. Melissa is almost crying too.)

I have lost my husband. And God knows I dont want to lose my baby girl. But like you, I have always respected her.

(She walks to the door and turns back.)

Fox... this is a moment for the family. But you can join us if you want.

(Mulder lightly shakes his head no. Margaret, Melissa and Daly walk out. In Scullys mind, she sees Nurse Owens standing on the dock. The rope is pulled taut and suddenly snaps. Scully starts to float away.)



SCENE 10
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNERS OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man throws a document down on Skinners desk and picks up a pack of "Morleys" cigarettes. Skinner is sitting at his desk.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Read it. Its all there. If youre having trouble sitting on Mulder, Assistant Director Skinner, Im sure you know wed have no trouble.

(He puts a cigarette in his mouth and takes out his lighter.)

SKINNER: Uh-uh.

(He nods towards a sign on Skinners desk that reads "Thank You For Not Smoking." Cancer Man proceeds to light it anyway. He takes a few drags as he walks across the room. He stubs it out in an ashtray and walks out through the double-doors. Through the single door at the side of his office, there is a knocking.)

Yeah, come in.

(Mulder walks in and notices the cigarette, still smoking.)

Sit down.

(He does so.)

I called you right up here because of rumors about an incident at the hospital last night.

MULDER: Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria jello?

SKINNER: The rumor has it that you were involved in the laundry room?

MULDER: No, sir.

SKINNER: A man was executed, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I was with Scully.

SKINNER: Traces of her blood were found at the scene.

MULDER: May I see the police report?

SKINNER: There is no police report of this incident, Agent Mulder, and there is no body. You know that.

MULDER: Since I am unfamiliar with any such incident, sir, no, how would I know that?

SKINNER: Knock it off!

(He stands.)

MULDER: Hows it feel? Constant denial of everything, questions answered with a question.

SKINNER: I want to know what happened, damn it.

MULDER: Him. Thats what happened.

(He stands and picks up the ashtray, putting it down on Skinners desk.)

Cancer Man! Hes responsible for what happened to Scully!

SKINNER: How do you know that?

MULDER: Its a rumor. Who is he?

SKINNER: Its not your...

MULDER: Oh, you can have it all, you can have my badge, you can have the X-Files, just tell me where he is.

SKINNER: And then what? He sleeps with the fishes? Were not the mafia, Agent Mulder. I know its easy to forget but we work for the Department of Justice.

MULDER: Thats what I want.

SKINNER: Agent Scully was a fine officer. More than that, I liked her. I respected her. We all know the field we play on and we all know what can happen in the course of a game. If you were unprepared for all the potentials, then you shouldnt step on the field.

(Mulder turns away and walks a few steps before looking back.)

MULDER: What if I... I knew the potential consequences but I... I never told her?

SKINNER: Then youre as much to blame for her condition as... "The Cancer Man."

(Mulder walks out.)



SCENE 11
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, she is laying on a table in a white dress. All the walls are white except for one, which is a black void. Through the void walks her father, dressed in his admirals uniform. He walks over to her.)

WILLIAM SCULLY: Hello, Starbuck. Its Ahab. People would say to me, "Life is short." "Kids, they grow up fast," and "Before you know it, its over." I never listened. For me, life went at a proper pace. There were many rewards... until the moment that I knew, I... understood that... that I would never see you again... my little girl. Then my life felt as if it had been the length of one breath, one heartbeat. I never knew how much I loved my daughter until I could never tell her. At that moment, I would have traded every medal, every commendation, every promotion for... one more second with you. Well be together again, Starbuck. But not now. Soon.

(He slowly turns and walks back into the void. In reality, Nurse Owens is standing over her again. She leans in and whispers to her.)

NURSE OWENS: Dana? I know death is at arms reach tonight, but Dana? Your time is not over.

(At the cafeteria, Mulder is eating lunch with Melissa.)

MELISSA SCULLY: You know, Fox sorry, Mulder... you could spend the rest of your life finding every person whos responsible and its still not going to bring her back. Whoever did this to her has an equal horror coming to them.

MULDER: Including myself?

(Melissa looks at him strangely. A woman comes up to Mulder.)

WOMAN: Pardon me, sir, do you have change for the cigarette machine?

(He checks his pockets for money.)

MULDER: No. Sorry, I dont.

(She smiles and walks over to the machine.)

MELISSA SCULLY: What do you mean, yourself?

WOMAN: Theres a pack already here... Morleys. Not my brand.

(She walks away. Mulder stands up and pulls the pack out of the slot. He unwraps the top and opens it. He takes out a folded piece of paper that reads "900 W. Georgia St.")



SCENE 12
THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MANS APARTMENT

(Cancer Man sits in his chair, watching an old war movie. There are various screams coming out of it. On the table, his ashtray is filled to the brim with old cigarettes. His gun sits on the other side of the table as he puts his newly-finished cigarette into one of the beer bottles.)

MAN ON TV: Want a cigarette, Rev? How bout a smoke?

(He picks up a pack of Morleys and hears a creak. He starts to get up when Mulder grabs him by the back off his shirt and throws him back into his chair.)

MULDER: Sit down!

(Mulder swings around and points a gun directly at his head.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Howd you find me?

MULDER: Shut up! Tonight, I ask the questions! Youre going to answer me, you son of a bitch!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Dont try and threaten me, Mulder. Ive watched presidents die.

(He puts a cigarette in his mouth. Mulder backhands it out. Cancer Man looks shocked.)

MULDER: Why her? Why her and not me?

(Cancer Man does not respond. He is slumped back in his chair, obviously somewhat scared.)

Answer me!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I like you. I like her too. Thats why she was returned to you.

(Mulder grips his gun with both hands and leans in a little.)

MULDER: You should be the one to die.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is completely cool and confident now. Mulder, on the other hand, is falling apart.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Why? Look at me. No wife, no family, some power. Im in the game because I believe what Im doing is right.

MULDER: (almost whispering) Right? Who are you to decide whats right?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Who are you? If people were to know the things I know, it would all fall apart. I told Skinner you shot the man in the hospital but I didnt really believe it. And here you are with a gun to my head. I have more respect for you, Mulder. Youre becoming a player. You can kill me now, but youll never know the truth...

(Mulder squeezes the trigger but slowly releases it.)

...and thats why Ill win. Dont worry. Thisll be our secret. We wouldnt want others to start rumors.

(He lights a cigarette and takes a drag. Mulder watches, half-disgusted with Cancer Man and half-disgusted with himself.)



SCENE 13
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON D.C.

(Mulder sits at his computer and is typing something. He clicks a button on the mouse and the printer fires up. He takes the paper out and signs it. It reads:

"To Assistant Director Walter S. Skinner
Please accept my resignation from the Federal Bureau of Investigation effective immediately.

Sincerely,

______________ (Mulders signature.)

Fox Mulder."

He leans back in his chair. Later, Mulder takes his microscope and puts it in a box. Skinner walks in and sighs.)

SKINNER: When I started out, this is where they kept the copier.

MULDER: At least back then, it wasnt just wasted space.

(Skinner walks towards him and tears up Mulders resignation form.)

SKINNER: Its unacceptable.

(Mulder continues packing books into the box.)

Look, I know you feel responsible for Agent Scully, but I will not accept resignation and defeat as self-punishment.

MULDER: All the forensics, the field investigations, the eyewitness accounts... to still know nothing. To lose myself... and Scully. I hate what Ive become.

(Skinner sighs and takes his glasses off. He walks a little bit as Mulder continues putting folders and such in the box.)

SKINNER: When I was eighteen, I, uh... I went to Vietnam. I wasnt drafted, Mulder, I... I enlisted in the Marine Corps the day of my eighteenth birthday. I did it on a blind faith. I did it because I believed it was the right thing to do. I dont know, maybe I still do. Three weeks into my tour, a ten-year-old North Vietnamese boy walked into camp covered with grenades and I, uh... I blew his head off from a distance of ten yards.

(Mulder looks at him, shocked. He listens intently now.)

I lost my faith. Not in my country or in myself, but in everything. There was just no point to anything anymore. One night on patrol, we were, uh... caught... and everyone... everyone fell. I mean, everyone. I looked down... at my body... from outside of it. I didnt recognize it at first. I watched the V.C. strip my uniform, take my weapon and I remained... in this thick jungle... peaceful... unafraid... watching my... my dead friends. Watching myself. In the morning, the corpsmen arrived and put me in a bodybag until... I guess they found a pulse. I woke in a Saigon hospital two weeks later.

(He walks towards him.)

Im afraid to look any further beyond that experience. You? You are not. Your resignation is unacceptable.

(He starts out.)

MULDER: You.

(Skinner turns back. Mulder sighs.)

You gave me Cancer Mans location. You put your life in danger.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, every life, everyday is in danger. Thats just life.

(He walks out, closing the door behind him. Later, Mulder carries the box down towards his car. As he reaches the door to the parking lot, a man jumps out in front of him. Mulder drops the box and goes for his gun until he sees it is X. X hands him a plane ticket.)

X: Your plane ticket.

MULDER: But we barely know each other.

X: I cant tell you why she was taken. Its too close to me. Im giving you the men who took her.

MULDER: How?

X: They believe youll be out of town. They believe you information about Scully being kept in your desk in your apartment. AT 8:17 tonight, theyll search your apartment. They will be armed. You will be waiting.

MULDER: Waiting.

X: To defend yourself with terminal intensity. Its the only way, Mulder. The law will not punish these people.

(Mulder sighs and takes the plane ticket.)

After tonight, we cannot make contact for several weeks.

(He dashes off.)



SCENE 14
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder sits alone in the dark, his gun on the table. He spots a shadow covering the light under the door. He looks at his watch. ONLY 7:30. He picks up the gun. As there is a knocking. Outside, Melissa knocks again.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Mulder.

(Mulder opens the door and looks around the hallway.)

Sorry. I came by. You werent answering and your machine wasnt on. Can I come in?

(Mulder looks at her.)

For a second?

(He leads her in and latches the door.)

Why is it so dark in here?

MULDER: Because the lights arent on.

MELISSA SCULLY: Okay. I just came from the hospital. Dr. Daly says... shes weakening. It could be anytime. So I figured youd want to come down and see her.

MULDER: No, I cant.

MELISSA SCULLY: Well, Id think that you would.

MULDER: Yeah, I would. I cant, not right now.

(She walks up to him.)

MELISSA SCULLY: Listen. I dont have to be psychic to see that youre in a very dark place... much darker than where my sister is. Willingly walking deeper into darkness cannot help her at all. Only the light...

MULDER: Enough with the harmonic convergence crap, okay? Youre not saying anything to me.

MELISSA SCULLY: Why dont you just drop your cynicism and your paranoia and your defeat. You know, just because its positive and good doesnt make it silly or trite! Why is it so much easier for you to run around trying to get even than just expressing to her how you feel? I expect more from you. Dana expects more.

(She angrily unlatches the door.)

Even if it doesnt bring her back, at least shell know. And so will you.

(She leaves. Mulder latches the door, sits down and puts the gun back on the table.)



SCENE 15
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder slowly walks up and pulls up a chair. The respirator is gone. Mulder stares at her for a while before putting his hand on hers.)

MULDER: I feel, Scully... that you believe... youre not ready to go. And youve always had the strength of your beliefs. I dont know if my being here... will help bring you back. But Im here.

(He sits back in his chair and stares at her solemnly. The clock reads 8:17.)



SCENE 16
MULDERS APARTMENT

(It is morning. Mulder walks into his apartment to find it completely wrecked. Everything is in shambles. He goes to the doorway from his living room to his office and looks in. He leans up against the door fixture and begins to cry. He slumps down on the floor, crying, looking at his hands.)



SCENE 17
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In Scullys mind, she is lying on a bed in a small clearing in a forest. A chair is in the corner. The area slowly fades away into the hospital room. Doctors and nurses walk around.)

NURSE AT DESK: Ill look at the chart.

(The nurse who took her blood starts by, but looks at her and stops.)

NURSE: Call Dr. Daly, now.

(She walks over to her head. Scullys eyes are opened. She blinks.)



SCENE 18
MULDERS APARTMENT

(Mulder sits on his sofa as the phone rings. The machine picks it up.)

MULDER ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message...

(He picks up the reciever.)

MULDER: Im here.

(He listens. Slowly, a smile comes onto his face.)



SCENE 19
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is in a room now, with flowers off to the side. Margaret sits in a chair, Melissa is sitting on her bed. Mulder walks in. Melissa gets up and makes room.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Hello, Fox.

(Scully laughs.)

SCULLY: Not Fox, Mulder.

(Mulder is smiling widely as she looks at him.)

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Mulder, I dont remember anything... after Duane Barry...

MULDER: Doesnt... doesnt matter.

(She sighs. He holds up a blue plastic bag.)

Brought you a present.

(He takes out a video and shows it to her.)

"Superstars of the Super Bowl."

SCULLY: I knew there was a reason to live.

MULDER: I know you want to get some rest, I... just came by to see... how you were doing and say hi.

(He holds her hand then starts out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(He turns back.)

I had the strength of your beliefs.

(He nods and takes her cross out of his pocket. She reaches up and takes it.)

MULDER: I was holding this for you.

(She looks at it, then at her mother, who smiles.)

SCULLY: (quietly) Thanks.

(Mulder smiles and looks at Melissa, who smiles at him. He walks out. Later, she touches the cross as it sits around her neck. The nurse comes in.)

SCULLY: Hmm. Could I see Nurse Owens? Ive got something Id like her to have.

NURSE: Nurse who?

(She hands Scully her medicine and a cup of water. Scully downs it.)

SCULLY: Owens. Short with straight light brown hair? She watched over me in intensive care and Id like to thank her.

NURSE: Dana, Ive worked here for ten years and theres no Nurse Owens at this hospital.

(She walks out. Scully stares at the door, wondering.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
J.A.S.D. BEEF
DELTA GLEN, WI

(Cattle file into their pen as workers cross-cut and package meat in the plant. Two horns go off. A man starts walking out.)

MAN: 7:30. See you tomorrow, Beth.

BETH KANE: Okay. See you tomorrow.



SCENE 2
BETH KANE'S HOUSE

(Beth's son Gary lays on the couch, watching a TV show. On the TV, police stand on a porch as two black men are led out, both with their faces scrambled out. Her younger son, Stevie, sits on the floor in front of the TV. Beth walks in.)

MAN ON TV: Got information on a crackhouse... this is some pretty direct information... came from an informant who made the buy.

BETH KANE: I'm home!

(She looks at her younger son. On the TV, the police shout to each other as they surround a house.)

STEVIE KANE: Hi, Mom.

(She rubs his head.)

GARY KANE: Hey.

BETH KANE: "Hey?" All I get is "hey?"

GARY KANE: Hey, Mom.

(She smiles and walks into the bathroom.)

BETH KANE: I'm going to take a quick shower. You guys interested in getting a pizza delivered?

(Gary grunts. Beth laughs.)

If that was a "yes," you can call the order in and no pepperoni for me.

(She closes the door, sighs and starts to take her shirt off. From behind the mirror, a man wearing glasses watches through a peephole, breathing heavily. In the main room, the phone rings and Gary picks it up.)

GARY KANE: Hello? Oh, yeah. Sure.

(He hangs up and grabs his brother's nose with two fingers.)

STEVIE KANE: Ow!

GARY KANE: Tell Mom I'll be back in five minutes, okay, buttcrumb?

(Stevie nods and rubs his nose. Later. The time is 11:55. Beth is on the phone. Stevie lays his head on her lap.)

BETH KANE: He said he was only going to be gone five minutes and that was over four hours ago. Yes? No, I don't know who called him. The last person to see him? His younger brother.

SCENE 3
DELTA GLEN, WI

(Morning. Gary runs through the forest in his underwear, whimpering and cowering behind trees. Two sheriffs are driving down the road when one sees Gary runs out into the street.)

SHERIFF #1: Whoa whoa whoa!

(They stop and get out, walking towards him.)

SHERIFF #2: Gary? Gary Kane?

(Gary can do nothing but whimper.)

Go get him a blanket.

(The other sheriff goes to get him one. The first grabs hold of Gary gently by the shoulders.)

It's going to be okay, son. Hey, we're here to help you!

(Gary breaks free and starts to walk away, his feet shuffling. As he turns around, the sheriff sees three words written on his back. "He is One.")

Oh my God.



SCENE 4
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder shows Scully a slide of Gary's back with the words clearly written on it.)

MULDER: Gary Kane, 16 years old, High School Junior. "C" student, first-string varsity football, member of the local 4-H club. Not one of Wisconsin's more remarkable kids but still the apple of his mother's eye.

SCULLY: What does that mean?

MULDER: Nobody knows.

SCULLY: What does the police report say?

(Scully walks over to Mulder and sits on the desk next to him as he shows her the file.)

MULDER: The victim received a phone call and left his home. He was discovered in the woods in his underwear twelve hours later. He's been unable to give a coherent statement.

SCULLY: Any evidence of sexual assault?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Does it seem like it might have been a schoolboy prank?

MULDER: The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalized since their ordeals.
They were reportedly hysterical with fear.

(He stands up.)

SCULLY: Victims? You mean there've been others?

(Mulder nods and switches the slide to another person with the same writing.)

MULDER: One in eastern Wisconsin, one three towns away.

(He flips to another slide, then another.)

Both with the same black words written in black magic marker.

SCULLY: What's your interest in this?

MULDER: The local sheriff in Delta Glen, Wisconsin thinks he knows what's been happening to these kids.

SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: He thinks they've been possessed.



SCENE 5
DELTA GLEN, WISCONSIN

(Mulder, Scully and Sheriff Mazeroski drive down a road in the sheriff's car. Mulder is in the back seat.)

MAZEROSKI: There's something I think you ought to see first. They call themselves the Church of the Red Museum. They're followers of a guy named Odin that moved out here from California three years ago and bought a ranch.

SCULLY: What's the significance of the name "Red Museum?"

MAZEROSKI: Well, Odin and the rest of them are a bunch of vegetarians. They drove the ranch right into the ground, turned 500 head of beef cattle into pets. Calls it a monument to barbarism.

MULDER: Probably went over big with the local ranchers.

(Mazeroski laughs.)

MAZEROSKI: Well, you gotta admit, it takes some big ones to set down in the middle of cow country and start a church like his.



SCENE 6
CHURCH OF THE RED MUSEUM
DELTA GLEN, WISCONSIN

(They pull up to the church as three worshippers walk by and towards a barn. They are dressed in white except for a red turban. Mulder, Scully and Mazeroski get out of the car and watch them. Mulder takes out an umbrella and holds it over his and Scully's head.)

MAZEROSKI: Kinda stick out like a sore thumb, don't they?

SCULLY: You know sheriff, from what little we've seen, what, what little you've told us, they seem rather unlikely to be involved in the kind of activities that you described.

MAZEROSKI: Well, I, I won't say another word. You can just see for yourself.

(They walk into the barn and stand in the back. In front of them is a whole congregation of fifty or so people, with a giant viewscreen in the front of the room. A man gets up onto the platform in front, puts his hand together and bows lightly.)

CONGREGATION: Ommm...

MAZEROSKI: That's Odin.

(Odin sits down at a computer and starts typing rapidly. A woman in back of him reads off the screen into a microphone as the words come up on the screen in back of her.)

WOMAN: Today is a blessing from our lord and master, who awaits his flock in this time, the dawning of the Age of Aquarius. Eighteen earth years from the beginning of the new kingdom. The guides speak through me today as messengers of word that we may be free from death and the passage into spirit. As the acceleration continues, we, the enlightened, must bring our teachings of the skills for survival to mankind. Repeat in prayer...

MULDER: They're walk-ins.

SCULLY: What are walk-ins?

WOMAN: We, the second souls of the first bodies...

CONGREGATION: We, the second souls of the first bodies...

WOMAN: Bearers of the word and keepers of the sacraments of a new enlightenment...

MULDER: They're believers in soul transference, enlightened spirits who have taken possession of other peoples bodies.

CONGREGATION: Bearers of the word and keepers of the sacraments of a new enlightenment...

WOMAN: Blessed mission and toil.

CONGREGATION: Blessed mission and toil.

WOMAN: Our struggle is transcendent, and your guidance, our guides...

CONGREGATION: Our struggle is transcendent, and your guidance, our guides...

(Odin finishes typing and looks to the back of the room at the three visitors.)

WOMAN: ...will carry us toward the dawning of a new age.

CONGREGATION: ...will carry us toward the dawning of a new age.

(Odin starts typing again.)

WOMAN: Today, we bear witness to three who do not believe.

(The congregation, one by one, slowly turn and look back at the agents.)

We encourage them to open their hearts and minds to our teachings that they who slaughter the flesh slaughter their own souls and must be taught the way.

(Mulder looks at Mazeroski.)



SCENE 7
BETH KANE'S HOUSE

(Gary and Beth are sitting down. Mazeroski is as well, but Mulder and Scully are standing.)

GARY KANE: I only remember parts of it.

MULDER: Which parts are those?

GARY KANE: I was in the woods and... I felt... a spirit enter me.

(Mulder walks over and sits down next to him.)

MULDER: When you say spirit, Gary, I'm not sure what you mean.

GARY KANE: It... it might have been an animal spirit. I can't explain it. Something... just came over me.

MULDER: And you don't remember who called you?

(Gary shakes his head no. Scully, standing in the doorway, looks back down the hallway.)

Anything at all about what happened immediately after you left home that night?

(Scully walks down the hallway, looking at various pictures.)

Have you ever had any dealings with anyone from the Church of the Red Museum?

GARY KANE: I've seen them around.

MULDER: Do you have any reason to believe that they may be involved with what happened to you?

(The pictures are of Beth, Gary, Stevie and the whole family.)

MAZEROSKI: Now tell him what you told me, Gary.

(Gary talks in the background. Stevie walks up to Scully.)

SCULLY: Hi.

STEVIE KANE: Hi.

SCULLY: Who are you?

STEVIE KANE: Stevie.

SCULLY: Oh, you're in all the pictures. You must be Gary's younger brother.

(Stevie nods.)

I'm Dana. Stevie... do you remember who your brother might have gone out to see the other night?

(Stevie shakes his head "no.")

Did he say anything?

(Through the peephole in the bathroom mirror, the man watches Scully. Scully hears footsteps in that direction and looks towards the mirror, but does not see anything. The man is gone from behind it. Mulder walks up to Scully.)

MULDER: Scully, we'll meet you outside.

(He and Mazeroski leave. Scully turns back to Stevie.)

SCULLY: Well, thank you for your time.

(Mulder and Mazeroski start down the front steps.)

MULDER: Has this boy ever been in any trouble?

MAZEROSKI: Gary?

MULDER: Yeah.

MAZEROSKI: No, I've known him since he was a kid. Same age as my son. Now, he's done some beer drinking, but he's just your basic sixteen-year-old. Least he was.

MULDER: You see a noticeable difference in him?

MAZEROSKI: Yeah, yeah. Gary Kane lived for football. He's a damn good athlete too. Now he won't even suit up.

MULDER: The Red Museum... how are they treated by the local citizens?

(Scully walks over.)

MAZEROSKI: Nobody much cares for them.

MULDER: Well, are they ever singled out? Shop owners refusing to sell to them, stuff like that?

MAZEROSKI: Well, there's a reasonable amount of tension but most folks are happy to just try to avoid them.

MULDER: Uh, can you recommend a good motel in the area?

MAZEROSKI: Sure. That means you're going to stay on for a bit. You think there might be something to this?

MULDER: Well, I, I want to run a background check on the church and this guy

MAZEROSKI: You've come to the right place for that.



SCENE 8
CLAY'S BBQ

(Scully sits with plates upon plates of food in front of her. She has a bib with the store logo on it, and it is covered with sauce. She finishes off a rib and puts down the bone, leaving some more sauce on her cheek by her lip. Mulder is sitting across from her with a bib on as well.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder... ribs like these, I'd say the Church of the Red Museum has its work cut out for it.

(He wipes off the sauce on her face.)

Thanks.

So, you started to tell me about walk-ins but I'm not sure if I grasped the finer points.

MULDER: Well, it, it's kind of a new age religion based on an old idea. That if you, uh, lose hope or despair and want to leave this mortal coil, you become open and vulnerable.

SCULLY: To inhabitation by a new spirit.

MULDER: A new enlightened spirit. According to the literature, Abe Lincoln was a walk-in. And Mikhail Gorbachev and Charles Colson, Nixon's advisor.

SCULLY: But not Nixon?

MULDER: No. Not even they want to claim Nixon.

SCULLY: So are you still subscribing to the sheriff's claims of a possession?

MULDER: I don't know. In the absence of any other plausible explanation... it's a novel theory.

SCULLY: Well, I'll tell you something, I kind of feel weird saying this...

(Mulder looks out the window and sees a congregant of the Red Museum walking by to hollering and screaming.)

...but I got the creeps in that apartment today.

MULDER: Really?

TEENAGER: Hey, you tofu-eating towelhead!

(A car honks at the boy.)

SCULLY: Yeah, what, what's going on?

(The truck makes a U-turn and the boy in the passenger seat yells at the churchgoer.)

TEENAGER: Hey, veggieburger, who let you out!

(Mulder gets up.)

MULDER: I think the sperm posse just rode into town.

(The teenagers get out of the car and go to the boy, who stops and looks at him.)

RICK MAZEROSKI: Hey, diaperhead! We're talking to you. How's your pet cow?

TEENAGER: Did you get any milk out of him?

RICK MAZEROSKI: We're talking to you, Aladdin.

(He pushes him into the other teenager that is heckling, who pushes him back into Rick.)

What's the matter, diaperhead?

(He pushes him back to the other kid, who pushes him again.)

Huh? Huh?

RED MUSEUM TEENAGER: Nothing.

MULDER: Hey, leave him alone!

(They all turn to see Mulder coming towards them.)

Leave him alone.

(He looks at the Red Museum member.)

Go home. Go ahead, go home.

(The teenager silently turns and walks away.)

TEENAGER: Catch you later, Red.

MULDER: You got a problem?

KATIE: Yeah, but who asked you?

MULDER: I see four against one. I got a problem.

(Scully starts towards the group.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

RICK MAZEROSKI: Yeah, well, why don't you run along with the little wife? You're going to miss the tour bus.

(As Scully puts on her coat, Katie sees that Scully has a gun.)

FEMALE TEENAGER: She's got a gun.

RICK MAZEROSKI: Well, what's she going to do, shoot us? Go call my dad, Katie, I think he'd like to hear about this.

MULDER: Who's your dad?

RICK MAZEROSKI: He's the sheriff.

(Mulder looks at Scully.)

MULDER: Yeah, I think he would like to hear about this.

TEENAGER: Come on, let's just get out of here, Rick.

(Rick glares at Mulder, then walks past him, shoving into him as he does. The rest follow.)

SCULLY: Kind of hard to tell the villains without a scorecard.



SCENE 9
KATIE'S HOUSE

(Rick gets out of the driver's side and Katie walks around to him. The radio blares as he grabs her and french kisses her for quite a while. She smiles and he gets in his car. They wave to each other as he drives away. Katie starts towards her house and hears some whimpering. She looks over to the garbage cans and sees her dog.)

KATIE: Pupperdog? Is that you? Pupperdog?

(She starts petting the dog.)

What are you doing here, huh, girl?

(A man reaches out and grabs her, holding a cloth over her mouth. He drags her away, kicking and screaming. In the morning, Katie is sobbing. She is down to her bra and underwear. Every little noise makes her whimper even more. She leans up against a tree and looks up. She looks back at the ravens in an old tree. In her mind, the tree changes into a giant raven and starts pecking at her. She cries in horror and falls to the ground. Then she sees thousands of cockroaches crawling over her arms. She tries to brush them off, but to no avail.)

Get off me. Get off me! Help me! Please, somebody, help me! Help me! Please!

(On her back, the words "She is One" are written.)



SCENE 10
MOTOR LODGE REGISTRATION

(Mulder is on the phone writing something down, sitting on the bed.)

MULDER: Yeah, Eddie, this is all good stuff. Yeah, see what else you can find on him from the N.C.I.C. and call me back. At, at this number or on my cellular.

(Scully walks in. He hangs up.)

SCULLY: I just examined the girl.

MULDER: What'd you find?

(Scully sits down.)

SCULLY: Not much until the toxicology report came back. They found trace amounts of an unspecified alkaloid substance in her blood, possibly an opiate derivative, as well as a dangerously large quantity of something called scopolamine.

MULDER: Is that the stuff they use for motion sickness?

SCULLY: Well, only in very small doses. Anything past .2 micrograms and you've got a very powerful anesthetic with hallucinogenic qualities. It's been in the news lately because Colombian gangs have been using it in kidnappings to subdue their victims.

MULDER: Is it a controlled substance?

SCULLY: Yes, you'd probably have to be a doctor or a pharmacist to get hold of these quantities.

(He hands her his notepad and walks over to the table, picking up his gun and other things.)

"Richard Odin. Also known as Doug Herman. Left A.M.A. in 1986 over questionable ethics inquiry. Did not renew license."

(Mulder puts on his coat.)

MULDER: I'll drive.

(They walk out.)



SCENE 11
RICHARD ODIN'S HOUSE

(Mulder and Scully pull up. Mulder knocks on the door. The woman reading the words opens it. They show her his badge.)

MULDER: I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We'd like to speak to Richard Odin. Is he in?

WOMAN: Just a moment.

(Odin walks up the door.)

MULDER: Richard Odin?

ODIN: Yes.

MULDER: We'd like to ask you some questions. May we come inside?

(He tries to steps in, but Odin holds up his hand.)

ODIN: I'm sorry. I can't allow you in this house.

SCULLY: We can get a warrant if that's what it takes.

ODIN: You can get a warrant if you'd like, but you will not enter this building.

MULDER: Well, how's that?

ODIN: Because you're meat-eaters. The building that houses our kitchens cannot be desecrated by your presence. I believe I'm well within my religious rights to prevent it.

SCULLY: Yes, sir, but you can't hide behind your rights if a crime has been committed.

ODIN: Have I been accused of a crime?

(A loud moaning starts behind them. The agents turn around to see the congregation of the Red Museum, all surrounding their car, looking at them and chanting.)

CONGREGATION: Ommm...

MULDER: We can always determine that elsewhere. Can you step outside, please, sir?

(Odin looks at him.)

Can you step outside, Mr. Odin? We're placing you under arrest.



SCENE 12
GRAHAM COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION

(Odin is sitting in a seat at a table. Scully sits across from him, Mulder and Mazeroski are standing.)

SCULLY: Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine, Mister Odin?

ODIN: Are you familiar with bovine growth hormones and inhumane treatment of beef and dairy cow...

MULDER: Just answer the question, Mister Odin.

ODIN: Yes, I know it. But I've never prescribed it or administered it.

SCULLY: Have you ever ordered others to do so?

ODIN: No.

MULDER: Do your religious beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge, either physically or psychically, on those who might not share them?

ODIN: The barbarians will one day be cleansed from the earth...

(Mazeroski starts towards him.)

MAZEROSKI: Answer the question! You did it, didn't you? You did something to those kids!

(Mulder grabs him by the arm and leads him out.)

MULDER: Sheriff...I've already had to go through this once with your kid. Can you just take a walk?

DEPUTY OUTSIDE: Hey, sheriff, can you come here for a second?

(Mulder closes the door.)

MULDER: You know, for a holy man, you've got quite a knack for pissing people off.

(Mazeroski comes in.)

MAZEROSKI: We got problems down the street.

(Outside, a congregation of people stand in the middle of the road outside Clay's BBQ. People are yelling at them.)

WOMAN: Keep your mind open to the wisdom of the guide.

MAN #1: We don't care about the wisdom of the guides!

WOMAN: All we ask is that you listen and...

MAN #2: Woo!

(The woman's talking is drowned out by the townspeople's heckling. Mulder, Scully and Mazeroski are walking towards the scene. Rick and his buddy drive up and get out.)

TEENAGER: All right, man, let's do it!

WOMAN: ...before it is too late. End the slaughter. The rights of the just must be protected.

MAN #1: Please!

WOMAN: Just as the barbarism against nature must cease. Violence against nature begets violence against man.

RICK MAZEROSKI: How about a little cow blood?

(Rick splashes the woman with a bucket of cow's blood. The congregants moan and gasp as the townspeople clap and cheer. Rick's father grabs him by the shoulder.)

MAZEROSKI: What do you think you're doing? Get out of here, get going. Get!

(He pushes Rick away from the scene. The townspeople continue to moan and groan. Scully looks at an old man in a red truck, who motions for her to get in. Scully looks back at Mulder, then walks to the car.)

OLD MAN: You the F.B.I. agents?

SCULLY: Yes.

OLD MAN: There's something I'd like to show you.

(Scully looks back at Mulder, who is watching her. They speed down the road in silence.)



SCENE 13
CATTLE FARM

(They reach their destination and get out. They walk over to the fence as cows moo.)

OLD MAN: This pastureland belonged to my granddad. He bought it in 1890. Yeah, he died right over there, next to that cattle pen. Eighty-two years old. Just fell off the tractor one morning. My dad worked this piece for the next forty years. I put in twenty-five myself before I decided to call it quits. Sold it for eighty times what my granddad paid.

(He chuckles.)

SCULLY: Why did you sell it?

OLD MAN: Ah... business changed. People changed too.

MULDER: In what way?

OLD MAN: Competition. Used to get by with fifty milk cows. Now, you got to have five hundred. Used to turn them out to pasture, now you keep them in pens and grain feed them.

SCULLY: You said you wanted to show us something.

OLD MAN: You're looking at it.

(He points to two men tending to the cows.)

See those men over there? Well, they're injecting the cattle with something called B.S.T. Bovine somatotrophin.

SCULLY: A genetically-engineered growth hormone.

OLD MAN: Yeah, shoot them up and the cow will produce ten percent more milk. Feed it to beef cattle, more meat on the hoof. Changed the business. Changed a whole lot of things.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

OLD MAN: Well, that, uh, fracas in town this afternoon. Ten, even five years ago, never would have happened. People around here have changed... gotten mean... spiteful... dog-eat-dog. We had seven rapes here last year by high school boys. Well, that, um... this, this business of the kids being found in the woods... well, I think that you're going to find it all comes from the same root source.

MULDER: The growth hormone.

OLD MAN: Yes, sir.

SCULLY: But these hormones have been proven safe. They've been cleared by the F.D.A.

OLD MAN: Says who? The government? God...

(He walks back to his truck.)

MAN: Yeah, that's good.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other, then follow. One of the men hands the other a needle, then turns back. His name is Gerd Thomas, and he is the man that has been looking through the peepholes.



SCENE 14
PLANE

(At night, an airplane flies over the farm. Sitting next to the pilot is a doctor carrying a Halliburton briefcase.)

PILOT: I don't know, doc. I'm losing oil pressure like crazy. I don't know what's going on!

LARSON: How far are we from the airport?

PILOT: We're not going to make it. I'll have to find someplace to put it down.

(The pilot looks out the window as the engine sputters. The plane is quickly approaching the trees.)

LARSON: Look out!

(The plane nose-dives into the clearing just before the trees. The ensuing explosion is tremendous.)



SCENE 15
CRASH SITE

(In the morning, firemen, deputies and sheriffs survey the wreckage, some talking to one another. Two men wrap up the bodies as Mulder, Scully and Mazeroski walk over.)

MAZEROSKI: We're still trying to I.D. the pilot.

SCULLY: What about the second body?

MAZEROSKI: That's Doctor Jerrold Larson.

MULDER: Did you know him?

MAZEROSKI: Yeah. He delivered my kid. Something else over here I want you to see.

(He leads them over to the briefcase, which is cracked open. Mulder lifts it open with his pen and sees that it is half-filled with money and half-filled with vials, some broken.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

MULDER: Looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies.

MAZEROSKI: That's why I brought you out here.

(Scully takes a pouch out from the briefcase and unzips it, holding a rubber glove. She takes out a vial out and smells it. Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Any clue what this is about?

MAZEROSKI: I have no idea. Jerry Larson was a pillar in this community. He was the last of the country doctors.

MULDER: Well, wherever he was coming from, I'd say that was one hell of a house call.

MAZEROSKI: You don't think this has anything to do with what happened to those kids?

(Scully holds up the vial.)

SCULLY: I think we'll know more once we find out what this is.



SCENE 16
MOTOR LODGE REGISTRATION

(Scully is on the phone.)

SCULLY: You're sure? Both kids? No, it's okay, I'm... I'm sure you're correct. Thank you very much.

(She hangs up as Mulder walks in.)

MULDER: Scully? You're not going to believe this.

(He closes the door. Scully stands.)

SCULLY: You found a connection between the out-of-town kids and the kids abducted here. Every one of them was delivered and treated through childhood by Doctor Larson.

MULDER: Yeah, the print-outs we found in the briefcase were mostly shipping orders along with a list of credit card numbers, each number corresponding to a card in the victim's family.

SCULLY: Why would he carry a list of credit card numbers?

MULDER: I don't know. Maybe to track them the way credit card companies track stolen cards?

SCULLY: But why? And what was he treating them for?

(Mulder sits.)

MULDER: What was he treating them with?

SCULLY: I don't know. We won't get the test results back on the vial until tomorrow. Are you thinking it might be bovine growth hormone?

MULDER: I know that was the first thing through both of our minds, Scully, but it just doesn't track. Not with that briefcase full of cash.

SCULLY: I know. And it still doesn't answer the question of who's marking those kids... or why.



SCENE 17
CATTLE FARM

(Some congregants of the Red Museum walk through the pasture and the man who was handed the needle before opens up the gate.)

MAN: Go on. Away we go.

(He pats the cow on the back, who moos and walks out. The man takes off his gloves and puts his needles away. The peephole man, Gerd Thomas, puts something in the back of his truck.)

GERD THOMAS: So, I'll see you in the morning?

MAN: Yeah. 8:30 sharp.

(He closes up his box and watches Thomas drive off. Thomas stops and watches a man drive by him in a blue car. He looks back and keeps going. The man in the blue car gets out. It is the Crew-Cut Man.)

Howdy.

(The Crew-Cut Man shoots him and goes back to his car.)



SCENE 18
BETH KANE'S HOUSE

(Beth is taking out the garbage when Mulder and Scully pulls up.)

SCULLY: Hi. Sorry to come unannounced.

BETH KANE: Gary's not home right now.

SCULLY: Actually, we wanted to talk with you, if that's okay.

(Inside, they are sitting down except for Mulder.)

BETH KANE: I don't know what to say. You think Doctor Larson was doing some kind of tests on Gary?

SCULLY: Well, thinking back, was there anything that seemed strange to you? Was Gary sick often?

BETH KANE: No. Actually, Gary's never been sick a day in his life.

MULDER: Gary was never sick.

BETH KANE: No.

SCULLY: Why was he going to Doctor Larson?

BETH KANE: Doctor Larson gave him vitamin shots. He gave them to a lot of kids. He said it was like treating their teeth with fluoride... as a preventative measure.

MULDER: Did you ever take Gary to another doctor?

BETH KANE: No. Jay had wanted to.

SCULLY: Jay's your husband?

BETH KANE: Yes. He was concerned that Gary wasn't growing. Jay was six-five. He wanted Gary to play college ball.

(Mulder looks into the bathroom.)

But then there was Jay's accident.

SCULLY: What accident?

(Mulder notices the pinhole in the mirror.)

BETH KANE: It was seven years ago. He worked at the packing plant. He had an accident with one of the machines.

(They look away.)

MULDER: Excuse me? What is this?

(They walk into the bathroom. Mulder holds up his hand and the light from the pinhole shines on it.)

BETH KANE: What?

MULDER: This light here.

BETH KANE: I don't know.

(Mulder turns on the lights and looks at the peephole.)

MULDER: There's something back there.

(Mulder punches through the window with a towel wrapped around his hand. He looks in and see a video camera with thousands of videotapes.)

SCULLY: What is it, Mulder?

MULDER: Looks like somebody's private little movie studio.

SCULLY: What?

(They all look in.)

BETH KANE: Oh my God.



SCENE 19
DELTA GLEN

(Rick and his friend are getting drunk, sitting in their car in a clearing. Somebody is sneaking through the woods.)

TEENAGER: I got to drain the lizard.

(He looks at Rick, waiting for a response.)

RICK MAZEROSKI: What do you want, applause, man?

(They laugh and the teenager gets out of the car. After, the teen finishes, zips his fly and starts back to the car. Rick takes a sip of his beer when the man, Gerd Thomas holds a cloth over his mouth. When the teenager reaches the car, it is empty. Rick's side of the door is open.)

TEENAGER: Rick? Rick?

(Morning. The sheriff deputies are standing over Rick's body and Rick's friend is off to the side. Sheriff Mazeroski pulls up and gets out. One of the deputies walks over to him.)

DEPUTY: Sheriff? We're going to find who did this to him...

(Mazeroski walks by him.)

MAZEROSKI: Get away from him. Get back.

(Rick is face-down on the ground, the words "He is One" written on his lower back like the others.)

Oh my God... Ricky! Son...

(He turns him over and sees his eyes are open and cold. He lifts up his head.)

No. No, no!

(A short while away, the Crew-Cut Man walks out of the woods and over to his car. He throws his gun in the trunk, slams it shut, and goes to his door. Scully and Mulder are driving down a road. Scully is looking at a folder with a picture of Thomas.)

SCULLY: His name is Gerd Thomas. He's owned the building for twenty-one years. He used to run a day-care center out of it. They're holding him for us.

(The Crew-Cut Man pulls up to the road. They pass him as he makes a right turn. Scully looks at his face as he drives by.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: I know that face.

MULDER: What?



SCENE 20
GRAHAM COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION

(An officer sits Thomas down in a chair and walks out. Mulder closes the door. Scully sits down.)

MULDER: That's quite a video library you've compiled for yourself. I especially like the ones with the little boys.

(Thomas speaks in a breathy, low, quiet voice.)

GERD THOMAS: I know. I'm... a sick man.

(Mulder sits down across the table.)

MULDER: No. No, men who know they're sick try to get help. You just kept right at it for years.

GERD THOMAS: I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

MULDER: Did you kidnap those kids?

GERD THOMAS: Yes.

MULDER: Are you prepared to confess to those crimes?

GERD THOMAS: Yes.

MULDER: And to the murders of Rick Mazeroski and...

GERD THOMAS: No. I never murdered anybody.

(Mulder opens up a folder and takes some pictures out. He stands and walks around Thomas.)

MULDER: Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski?

(He puts two pictures down in front of Thomas: a close-up of the words "He is One" and a picture of Rick's dead body.)

Did you write this on his back?

GERD THOMAS: Oh my God...

MULDER: Answer the question.

GERD THOMAS: No, I... I never killed them. I never killed anybody, I... I really loved those kids.

MULDER: Is this how you express your love for them?

(He puts down a picture of Rick's face, looking cold, eyes open. He then pushes Thomas' face towards it.)

Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski? Did you write that on his back?

GERD THOMAS: Yes!

MULDER: Why?

GERD THOMAS: Because of what he had become.

MULDER: What'd he become?

GERD THOMAS: Because those kids have become monsters.

MULDER: You're not making any sense. Now, you... make sense to me.

(Thomas nods.)

GERD THOMAS: Because of Doctor Larson, because of the tests.

(Scully's mind drifts off. In her mind, she sees the Crew-Cut Man driving in his blue car. Then she remembers seeing him drive by in the white van. She remembers him shooting Deep Throat. The gunshot echoes in her mind.)

SCULLY: Excuse me.

(She stands up and walks out. Mulder looks at her, then back at Thomas. He walks around across the table and sits down.)

MULDER: Okay, what tests?

GERD THOMAS: Doctor Larson was using those kids as guinea pigs and he was using us too.

MULDER: What do you mean, "using you?"

GERD THOMAS: To inoculate the cattle.

MULDER: With growth hormone?

GERD THOMAS: I don't know exactly what it was but he was paying us a lot of money to do it.

MULDER: So you're saying that Doctor Larson was paying you a lot of money to inject the cattle with something and you didn't know what it was.

GERD THOMAS: Not until later. Not until after all those rapes.

(He takes a few jagged breaths.)

Doctor Larson told my boss that he felt responsible for everything that those kids had done... and that he was giving them the same inoculations.

MULDER: Was Doctor Larson involved in the kidnapping?

(Thomas shakes his head.)

GERD THOMAS: No, no... he didn't want his secret to come out. He didn't care about those kids like me.

(Scully walks back in carrying a folder.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Mm-hmm?

(He stands up and goes over to her.)

SCULLY: I, uh... I think he's telling the truth. I don't think he killed anyone.

MULDER: Well, how can you be sure?

SCULLY: I just got the toxicology report back on the broken vial. The residual substance couldn't be analyzed because it contained synthetic corticosteroids with unidentified amino acids. That's "Purity Control," Mulder.

(They walk out. Mulder motions to the deputy, who goes back into the room.)

MULDER: Do you know what you're saying, Scully?

SCULLY: The man who died in that plane crash was inoculating those kids with antibodies derived from what may have been an extraterrestrial source.

MULDER: He's been injecting those kids with alien DNA.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, that was never proven conclusively.

MULDER: But it's the same substance we found in the Erlenmeyer flask, isn't it? The same material my Deep Throat contact died for.

SCULLY: Yes.

MULDER: It all makes sense. The money in the briefcase, they've been conducting an experiment here. Somebody's been paying to have those kids injected with alien DNA to see how they'd react. It's been going on for years.

SCULLY: Does that man know anything about it?

MULDER: No. He's just some poor soul who blew their cover. I don't think he knows any more than he's telling us.

SCULLY: Well, I think his boss must have because they just found him shot to death in a cow pasture.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: I think I know who shot him, Mulder. That man that I recognized on the road today... that's the same man that executed Deep Throat.

(Mulder stares at her for a second in disbelief.)

MULDER: Well, whoever's behind this, he's here covering their tracks. He's going to go after the kids. You get the sheriff and meet me at Gary Kane's apartment.

(He starts away, then looks at her.)

And, Scully... I want this guy alive.

(He walks away as she stares at him.)



SCENE 21
BETH KANE'S HOUSE

(Mulder pulls up, runs out of his car and knocks on the door. Beth opens it.)

MULDER: Where's Gary?

BETH KANE: He's in his bedroom.

MULDER: Go pack some clothes, things you need. You're all coming with me.

(A police car pulls up.)

BETH KANE: What?

MULDER: I'll explain later.

(He runs down the stairs as Mazeroski gets out of his car.)

Those credit card numbers, every kid's family that was listed. Get them packed up. Call out every man you've got.

MAZEROSKI: Where are we taking them?



SCENE 22
RICHARD ODIN'S HOUSE

(Odin opens the door to see Mulder standing there.)

ODIN: Yes?

MULDER: I need your help.

(Odin looks at him, a little shocked.)

ODIN: For?

MULDER: It may offend your religious sensibilities but it could help save some kids' lives.



SCENE 23
CHURCH OF THE RED MUSEUM
DELTA GLEN, WISCONSIN

(The townspeople file into the main building, murmuring. On the other side of the room, congregated around the seats, are the followers. The Kanes walk in. Mazeroski makes his way through the crowd and looks at the little kids of the Red Museum. Scully walks over to him.)

SCULLY: Sheriff... where's Mulder?

MAZEROSKI: He told me to make sure that the kids were safe. He thought there was some other place this guy might be.



SCENE 24
J.A.S.D. BEEF
DELTA GLEN, WI

(Mulder pulls up and gets out. He walks in and moves to a doorway, gun in hand. He reaches out onto the walls next to him with both hands and flicks on the light switch. Walking slowly, he stops and sees a trail of some kind of liquid on the ground. He kneels down and smells it, then follows the path, stepping around the large hanging pieces of meat. He walks over to the gasoline can on the ground. He follows the trail down a corridor where enormous pieces of meat stream down on each side of him, all wrapped up. There is some clanging to his right and he draws his gun again. Walking into the hallway, he sees another gasoline can. Going back to the room, the Crew-Cut Man, carrying another gasoline can, steps out from between two of the pieces of meat and walks the other way, not seeing Mulder. Mulder aims his gun.)

MULDER: Stop right there!

(The Crew-Cut Man does not even bother to look back, he just runs, dropping the gas can. Mulder moves swiftly after him and slowly walks down through the next meat passageway. He looks under some of them, kneeling and moving. Suddenly, the Crew-Cut Man swings out on a meathook and kicks Mulder square in the face with both feet, knocking the gun out of his hand. He smiles and runs off. Mulder gets to his feet and runs after him as the Crew-Cut Man locks him in.)

Hey!

(The Crew-Cut Man takes out his lighter and lights it. Scully and three officers walk in through the door behind him. Scully aims her gun.)

SCULLY: Don't move!

(He turns around.)

Put it down. Now.

(The Crew-Cut Man smiles.)

Just put the lighter down.

(Mazeroski holds his shotgun on him with one hand. His hand is shaking. Mulder bangs on the door. Scully turns to look and the Crew-Cut Man moves his lighter towards the gas can. Mulder bangs a little more but stops when he hears two gunshots and a man yelling in pain. Mulder bangs on the door more as three more gunshots go off.)

MULDER: Hey!

(Mazeroski walks towards the Crew-Cut Man's dead body, firing two more shots until he is out of bullets. He pushes the trigger repeatedly and the gun clicks. Mazeroski starts to cry. A deputy unlocks the door and Mulder walks out. Two officers follow him. Mulder looks at the Crew-Cut Man, then at Mazeroski.)

Get him out of here. Get everyone out of here!

(They start to file out. A deputy grabs Mazeroski's arm.)

DEPUTY: Come on.

(He walks out with Mazeroski, who looks at the Crew-Cut Man the whole time. Scully, typing her report, speaks over the scene.)

SCULLY: File number XWC060361. The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse has yet to be determined. His name, any record or artifact of his past, present or immigration status have yet to be found. His fingerprints are not on file in either the F.B.I. or National System of Records. At this time, it remains doubtful that anyone will come forward to I.D. or claim the body.

(Mulder and Scully walk away.)



SCENE 25
CHURCH OF THE RED MUSEUM
DELTA GLEN, WISCONSIN

(The children of the town stand together as Scully continues to speak.)

SCULLY: Under further analysis, the inoculant found in the broken vials was isolated and determined to be an unstable antibody of no known biological origin. After three weeks of study, the components of the serum, probably synthetic, have broken down structurally and, in this retrograde state, cannot be analyzed further. This coincides with the development of a severe and undiagnosed flu-like ailment affecting the children who were believed to be inoculated and some of the local families.

(The people of the Red Museum look back at the townspeople.)

To date, none of the congregants or members of the Church of the Red Museum have contracted this illness. I suspect whoever was doing may have been using them as a control group.

(Cut to a shot of the open briefcase.)

The shipping manifests for what is believed to be milk and beef tainted by the unspecified inoculant do not provide enough information to track their destinations.

(Cut to a shot of Clay's BBQ, which has a sign in the window that says "Closed Until Further Notice.")

A local advisory and quarantine have been established. Further inquiry into the tainted beef has been promised by the pertinent government health agencies.

(The old man sits in his car, looking at the closed shop.)

The F.B.I. investigation into this case is currently at a standstill. The case remains open and unsolved.

(He drives off.)

SCENE 1
EXCELSIUS DEI CONVALESCENT HOME
WORCESTER, MASS

(Night at an old nursing home. Person enters the building. Two male orderlies, UPSHAW and TIERNAN, are watching a boxing match featuring Mike Tyson on TV.)

TV ANNOUNCER: Danelle was an outstanding high school basketball player...

TIERNAN: (air-boxing) Come on, man. Come on. Come on, now. Put em down put em down! Ow! (playfully punches UPSHAW)

UPSHAW: (doesnt want to box) Hey, man, watch it.

TIERNAN: Come on, Upshaw. Come on, you and me, buddy! Lets go!

UPSHAW: Youre a moron, Tiernan.

TIERNAN: (still boxing) Come on. Lets go!

(NURSE CHARTERS, 30s, no nonsense type, has entered the room and looks at the two men with disgust.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Youre both morons, as far as Im concerned. Now whos watching the floor?

UPSHAW: Whats his name, the Skink.

TIERNAN: Guess who died this afternoon? Mrs. Richardson.

UPSHAW: (chuckles) Face plant, in a bowl of pudding.

NURSE CHARTERS: I dont suppose either of you changed her room.

UPSHAW: Oh, no. We left that for you.

(She gives them a humorless smile, and picks up some sheets.)

TIERNAN: (back into game) Ow!

TV ANNOUNCER: Mike Tyson, a disciple of Costanaro

(NURSE CHARTERS leaves the orderlies and enters HAL and STANs room. The two elderly residents of the home are also watching the fight.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Okay. Partys over, gents. (She turns off the TV.)

STAN: (whining) Whyd you do that?

NURSE CHARTERS: Cause rules are rules, Stan. And Im the Queen Bitch around here.

HAL: Gung said we could watch the rest of the fight.

NURSE CHARTERS: Well, do I look like Gung to you?

HAL: No. You got a better figure. (his hand is on her butt)

NURSE CHARTERS: You want to keep that hand, Hal, you better let go.

HAL: How about a little sponge bath?

NURSE CHARTERS: How about I take care of these wandering hands of yours? Come here.

(She straps HAL down to the bed with velcro arm bands.)

HAL: You like strapping me down, dont you?

NURSE CHARTERS: (sarcastically) Oh, yeah. I really get off on it.

(HAL chuckles as she leaves the room. STAN looks over at his friend sadly.)

(In the hall, NURSE CHARTERS passes GUNG, a quiet looking Asian orderly.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Hey, Gung. No TV after 9:00. Do you understand?

GUNG: Dr. Grago said theyre getting better so

NURSE CHARTERS: Oh, getting better. Right. Thats because they dont pinch his butt every time he walks into the room.

(GUNG watches her go, then continues down the hall.)

(NURSE CHARTERS removes the "Mrs. Richardson" nameplate from a door and goes into the empty room. She begins straightening up the room, making the bed. Suddenly, the door slams, and the bed is slammed up against the door, blocking it. NURSE CHARTERS goes to the bed and tries to pull it out of the way, but an unseen force flips her onto the bed. The velcro arm straps open. She is then flipped onto her back and the straps close around her wrists. (Camera close on her face as she screams in fear and in pain.)

NURSE CHARTERS: No! Somebody help me! Somebody, please! Please! Please! Please!

(Hall shot outside the room. No one is there. NURSE CHARTERS' screams continue.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Help me! Please, help me! (screams)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Early morning. MULDER enters dark X-Files office and stares at SCULLY who is sitting at his desk watching a video tape. He was obviously not expecting her to be there before him.)

SCULLY: (glancing over her shoulder) Good morning.

MULDER: Whatever tape you found in that VCR, it isnt mine.

SCULLY: Good. Because I put it back in that drawer with all those other videos that arent yours.

(MULDER crosses behind her and sees that the video is of NURSE CHARTERS. Her face is bruised.)

MULDER: Well, this definitely isnt mine.

SCULLY: No. This is Michelle Charters. Shes a registered nurse at a convalescent home in Worchester, Massachusetts.

MULDER: What happened to her?

SCULLY: According to Miss Charters, she was raped. The abrasions and contusions here would be consistent with her claims as would be the medical report which cites the kind of injury and tearing associated with sexual trauma.

MULDER: Where did you get this? Violent Crimes?

SCULLY: No. The woman made the video herself. It seems that no one will believe her story.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity. A spirit being.

MULDER: I have several X-Files that document similar cases. (Goes to file cabinet and opens it)

SCULLY: I know. Ive been here since 6:00 this morning going through them.

MULDER: Well, then you none of them have ever been substantiated.

SCULLY: Not surprisingly.

MULDER: Given the emotional and psychological violence of rape, the face or identity of the attacker is often blurred or erased from memory. That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap for me.

SCULLY: Yes. But this case is different.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: The victim has filed a lawsuit against the government. She seems to be certain who the spirit being is.



SCENE 3

(NURSE CHARTERS living room. MULDER and SCULLY interviewing NURSE CHARTERS who is still bruised.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Mr. Arden. Hal Arden.

SCULLY: And you know him?

NURSE CHARTERS: Hes been a patient where I work for about five years.

MULDER: Miss Charters, the facts of your case seem to contravene those of other cases we have on file.

NURSE CHARTERS: (bitter) Right. You mean the other Woman-Raped-by-Invisible-Man cases?

MULDER: How do you know it was him who attacked you?

NURSE CHARTERS: He made advances toward me. And he said things  rude things. Look, when you bathe somebody every day for five years you get to know more about them than you really need to. And an old man smells a certain way and he feels a certain way.

SCULLY: I know this is hard for you.

NURSE CHARTERS: This is the easy part. You see, hard is not being able to get disability leave or workmans comp and having to go back to work with this guy.

SCULLY: To continue our investigation were going to need some kind of evidence  physical or

NURSE CHARTERS: Yeah, I know. Ive heard it. Unless you have hair or semen or fibers you guys cant build a case.

MULDER: Thats right.

NURSE CHARTERS: Look, I didnt make this up, okay? I was attacked. And Im not some kind of shrinking violet who would repress the memory of a rapists face. If I could positively ID him or give you something to incriminate the man, I would.



SCENE 4

(Nursing home. Bathroom. MULDER and SCULLY watch as HAL gets out of the tub. GUNG wraps a towel around him.)

HAL: Youve got to be kidding me. (chuckles) And what do I think about her claims? I should be in the Guinness Record Book. Im 74 years old. Ive got plumbing older than this building. Hmmm?

(HAL holds open towel exposing himself. SCULLY stares for a second, then turns away slightly. MULDER looks, and nods with a little grin.)

HAL: And it dont work much better, either.

MULDER: Thank you for sharing. Are you aware youre being named in a lawsuit against the federal government?

HAL: I am?

SCULLY: Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

HAL: (doesnt hear her) What?

SCULLY: (louder) Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?

HAL: Threaten? It was harmless, for crying out loud. Ever since this *sex harassment* fad, men cant say whats on their minds.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a look and smiles which she misses.)

SCULLY: She says you made advances.

HAL: (again, not hearing) Hmm?

SCULLY: (louder) Advances?

HAL: If I told you you were a very pretty woman and I would like to show you some affection, would you be offended? Huh?

(SCULLY doesnt quite know how to answer. She and MULDER look at each other. HAL suddenly looks up at MULDER apologetically.)

HAL: Oh, I didnt mean to step on your toes there.

MULDER: (looking quickly at HAL, surprised, then quickly) Its all right. There seems to be some confusion here.

HAL: Yeah. I though Nurse Whats-Her-Name said she was rogered by a ghost. I may have one foot in the grave, but I certainly cant fly down hallways spreading amour.

MULDER: (loudly) Apparently not.

HAL: (chuckling as GUNG leads him out of the bathroom) If thats what its like if thats what its like in heaven, Lord, take me now. (GUNG and HAL exit.)

SCULLY: What do you think, Mulder?

MULDER: (grinning at her) About the guys plumbing?

SCULLY: About his story.

MULDER: I think this will turn out to be a huge waste of time just like all the other X-Files on entity rape. Unsubstantiated phenomena.

SCULLY: But in a substantiated crime.

(As they leave, STAN and UPSHAW enter for STANs bath.)

UPSHAW: Hey, pay attention. Or you can take another bath with your clothes on. At five and a half bucks an hour I dont give a rat's ass either way.



SCENE 5

(Outside the home. MULDER and SCULLY walking with MS. DAWSON, tall, blonde, confident, impersonal director of the Excelsius Dei Home.)

MS. DAWSON: Ten years ago, Excelsius was a leading facility in care and treatment of the elderly. Then government funding was cut till were all but shut down. Only a few wings are operational now.

SCULLY: Is there still a medical staff?

MS. DAWSON: Not on site. Dr. Grego visits three times a week. Excelsius residents are very well looked after, though. We hold ourselves to a high standard of health maintenance and treatment.

SCULLY: What kind of treatment?

MS. DAWSON: Weve always specialized in the care of the late-life degenerative diseases  Alzheimers, Parkinsons.

MULDER: We met with a patient today.

MS. DAWSON: We prefer "resident," actually.

MULDER: We met a *resident* who was described to us as having Alzheimers but he actually seemed quite spry and alert.

MS. DAWSON: Youre speaking of Hal Arden, the man accused of assaulting Michelle Charters.

SCULLY: Was he receiving special treatment?

MS. DAWSON: Youd have to speak to Dr. Grago. Hal has been here almost eight years now. Were all quite fond of him. We were extremely dismayed over this whole business with the lawsuit.

SCULLY: Are you saying you dont believe Nurse Charters allegations of rape?

MS. DAWSON: Theres something Id like to show you.

(In STAN and HALs room. STAN at the window watches the agents and the director walking inside.)

STAN: What did you tell them?

HAL: I didnt tell them anything.

STAN: Why are they still here?

HAL: I dont know, Stan.

STAN: Now you got to be more careful.

HAL: I am careful.

STAN: Youre going to ruin it for all of us. They find out, it all goes for nothing.

HAL: I didnt tell them anything.

STAN: Im not going to die in this Godforsaken hole, you hear me?

HAL: Oh, bug off, Stan.

(STAN opens a drawer and takes a brown capsule.)

HAL: Whered you get that?

STAN: I know where he keeps them.

HAL: Give me one, Stan. Huh? I want another one, too.

STAN: You cant handle another one.

HAL: Oh yeah? Maybe Ill just rat you out, then. Huh? How would you like that?

(Later. MULDER and SCULLY in DAWSONs office. MS. DAWSON pulls out a file and gives it to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: This is Michelle Charters?

MS. DAWSON: There are three separate insurance claims for accidents received on the job. In April, she went to the State Board and requested leave with full pay due to job-related emotional stress. The request was summarily rejected. Theres more

SCULLY: Id like to review it myself, if thats okay?

MS. DAWSON: Certainly.

MULDER: Ms. Dawson, did you get a chance to see Michelle after the incident? To see the extent of her injuries?

MS. DAWSON: I wasnt here the night it happened but I did see her the following day.

MULDER: Then you know how badly she was hurt.

MS. DAWSON: Yes.

MULDER: In your opinion, do you think she staged the attack?

(Knock at the door.)

TIERNAN: Excuse me, Ms. Dawson? We need help. Mr. Ardens choking to death!

(MULDER, SCULLY, and MS. DAWSON follow TIERNAN.)

(In STAN and HALs room. HAL lies gasping on the bed. It looks like his throat is being constricted. STAN stands beside him)

STAN: See? See what happened? I told you you couldnt handle any more.

(MULDER, SCULLY and the others rush into the room)

SCULLY: Call 911. Hal. Can you speak? (no response) I think this mans in ventricular fibrillation. I need 75 milligrams of Lidocaine and one amp of Amphinephrine. Stat.

TIERNAN: Yeah.

SCULLY: And get me a defibrillator!

TIERNAN: (running out of the room) Okay.

SCULLY: Hes turning cyanotic. Come on, Hal. You gotta help me.

MULDER: Come on, Hal.

MS. DAWSON: One, two, three, four, five.

UPSHAW: The ambulance is on the way!

SCULLY: Im losing him. Whats taking them so long?

MS. DAWSON: Hes not responding! Still no pulse. Wheres that crash cart!



SCENE 6

(BODY is wheeled out of the nursing home to an ambulance. DOCTOR GREGO, late 40s, watches with MULDER and SCULLY.)

DOCTOR GREGO: Hal Ardens been my patient since he came here eight years ago. This really is a setback.

SCULLY: A setback?

DOCTOR GREGO: Hal was part of a group of Alzheimers patients Ive been treating for 11 months.

SCULLY: But Alzheimers isnt treatable.

DOCTOR GREGO: Its an experimental drug called Depranil  an enzyme inhibitor that increases the amount of acetylcholine in the brain.

SCULLY: Ive read about it, but Ive also read that the clinical benefits are marginal at best.

DOCTOR GREGO: Yes, but these patients seem to be proving otherwise. Theyve demonstrated cognitive abilities well beyond anything thats been reported.

MULDER: So he was actually getting better?

DOCTOR GREGO: Before he started receiving the drug he could hardly complete a sentence.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

DOCTOR GREGO: (slightly embarrassed) Look, theres not much to get excited about in my work. Most of these people are on the downhill slide. If I can make them comfortable, maybe prolong a life, thats about all they expect. But to reverse an illness.

SCULLY: Would it be possible for us to take a look at other patients in your test group?

DOCTOR GREGO: Sure, if you want to.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(Ambulance drives away. MULDER watches NURSE CHARTERS watch it go.)

(STAN watches from the window, then turns to take another dose of the brown pills. GUNG enters the room and catches him.)

GUNG: Where did you get that?

STAN: It was Hals. Since hes not here anymore, why cant I have it?

GUNG: Because you have enough. What I give you is enough. Its our secret.

(STAN takes the pills. GUNG disapproves.)

STAN: Oh, come on, Gung. Its making me better.

GUNG: (adamant) Too much is very bad Very bad. No more for you.



SCENE 7

(Day room at the nursing home. MULDER and SCULLY and DOCTOR GREGO watch the residents, all very active. DOROTHY, eighty-something, moves around the room in her wheelchair directing imaginary people into position for LEO, at a table with paper and pen, to draw a picture. No one pays attention to DOROTHY, but she doesnt seem to notice.)

DOROTHY: I want you to stand behind Ben, Eddie, because Bens taller, and I want (continues)

DOCTOR GREGO: (quietly pointing to LEO) That man there --- thats Leo Kreutzer. During the Depression he was a WPA artist. Quite a good one too, Im told.

DOROTHY:Hello, Mabel, dont you look lovely. .

MULDER: (quietly) Is he receiving the same treatments as Hal Arden?

DOCTOR GREGO: Yes. When he came to us he couldnt draw a circle. Now, you can see for yourself.

(LEO rapidly draws as DOROTHY keeps positioning imaginary people.)

DOROTHY:Because youre taller I want you to stand behind Ben.

DOCTOR GREGO: Youll have to excuse me, Im already well behind on rounds.

SCULLY: Can I get a copy of Hal Ardens autopsy results?

DOCTOR GREGO: Of course.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(MULDER has crossed over to LEO.)

MULDER: May I sit down, Leo? (no response)

SCULLY: Leo, were with the FBI. We have some questions that wed like to ask you.

DOROTHY: (to MULDER and SCULLY) Leos a brilliant artist, you know. Dont be so modest, Leo. President Kennedy has one of his paintings in the White House.

(LEO sighs.)

SCULLY: Dr. Grago tells us that you havent been able to work in years. That the medicine has improved

LEO: (interrupting gruffly) It aint the medication.

SCULLY: What is it then?

UPSHAW: Okay, Rembrandt. 6:00. Dinner time.

TIERNAN: (grabbing DOROTHYs wheelchair) Come on, Dorothy. Legs up and straight ahead. Dont want you getting a flat tire.

DOROTHY: Wait, Leos not finished with us.

TIERNAN: Leo can finish with you later.

DOROTHY: He still has to draw the rest.

TIERNAN: (wheeling her out) Hell do it later, honey.

UPSHAW: (taking pen from LEO) Come on, Leo. Dont make me embarrass you in front of your friends.

(The orderlies take the residents out of the room.)

MULDER: (disgusted) Come on, Scully. Lets get out of here.

(SCULLY looks at the Picassoesque picture that LEO was drawing.)



SCENE 8
HOTEL HARTLEY
WORCESTER, MASS
6:53 PM

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY enter hotel lobby.)

SCULLY:.to find not just the treatment but a cure for Alzheimers. Do you realize how important that would be?

MULDER: (bitter) If it would keep anybody out of a place like that it would be important enough. I wouldnt say those people were exactly cured.

SCULLY: Any progress at all

MULDER: Well, I hope someones making some progress cause were going home with a big goose egg. (to hotel clerk) Checking out of room 206 and 210, please.

CLERK: (taking their keys) Certainly, sir. (to other clerk) Angelo?

SCULLY: What if theres a connection?

MULDER: Between the rape case and the Alzheimers? (very close to her, quietly) When theyre not drawing childlike pictures theyre brutal sex offenders?

SCULLY: Dr. Gragos therapy produces acetylcholine. Too much cholinergic activity causes a phychotic state similar to schizophrenia.

MULDER: You think that Michelle Charters was raped by an 74-year-old schizophrenic?

SCULLY: Its possible.

MULDER: An *invisible* 74-year-old schizophrenic?

SCULLY: Well, maybe its not in the medication. Maybe its the place itself.

MULDER: Are you saying that the buildings haunted? (smiles and laughs, quietly) If you are, youve been working with me for too long, Scully.

SCULLY: Im talking about an environmental reason behind whats happening there. Even the disinfectant couldnt mask that smell. Who knows whats breeding behind the walls or in the sub-structure. Some fungal contaminants have been known to cause delusions, dementia, violent behaviour

MULDER: Why wouldnt it have affected the other residents?

SCULLY: Maybe it has.

MULDER: I-I think youre looking too hard, Scully, for something thats not there. I think Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates.

SCULLY: Her lip required 13 stitches. The blow to her head resulted in a subdural hematoma. Thats quite a concoction. Look, I just want to talk to a few more patients there. We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night.

(MULDER looks at her and considers.)



SCENE 9

(Nursing home. DOROTHYs room. TIERNAN is feeding her. She doesnt want to eat.)

TIERNAN: This is gourmet fare. Be a good girl and open wide.

DOROTHY: No. Please dont. Please, dont.

TIERNAN: Open wide. Open up, honey.

DOROTHY: Please dont. I dont want

(He pushes the food in her mouth, she spits it back out.)

TIERNAN: Thats fine, Dorothy. Starve to death. See if I care. (he leaves the room)

(LEOs room. GUNG is with LEO. LEO stares at his food tray.)

GUNG: Why arent you eating your food, Leo? Whats the matter?

LEO: Its Dorothy. She needs more. We both do.

GUNG: What you have is enough.

LEO: Its not working for us. Not like it works for the others. We need more.

GUNG: No. No. Now eat your food, please. Ill come back and pick up your tray.

(GUNG leaves. DOROTHY wheels into LEOs room. They look at each other.)

LEO: Its okay, Dorothy. Dont worry. I think Stan had some more hidden away somewhere. It will be all right.

(STANs room. His DAUGHTER is with him. She looks tired, as if she has been arguing with him for a while.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Why are you being so stubborn?

STAN: Im not. I happen to like it here.

STANS DAUGHTER: A year ago you were begging to live with us.

STAN: Well, things change.

STANS DAUGHTER: Look Dad, I am sorry about what happened to Mr. Arlen.

STAN: His name was Arden.

TIERNAN: Im finished packing your things, Mr. Phillips. Im going to make sure you didnt forget anything. (to STANs DAUGHTER) Dont you worry, Mrs. Kelly. Just pull your car around out front. Ill make sure he gets down okay.

STANS DAUGHTER: Thank you.

TIERNAN: Hes going to be fine. (closes door)

(MULDER and SCULLY come down the hall to STANs room.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Can I help you?

SCULLY: Yes. Wed like to have a word with Mr. Phillips.

STANS DAUGHTER: Im his daughter. What is this about?

SCULLY: Were with the FBI. We have a few questions concerning his medical treatment. (shows badge)

STANS DAUGHTER: Hes in there packing right now. Im about to take him home. Is there anything I can help you with?

(Later, night, MULDER and SCULLY accompany STANs DAUGHTER down the outside stairs.)

STANS DAUGHTER: My little girls wont even visit their grandfather. Theyre afraid to even come here.

SCULLY: Its hard for anyone to be here, including the residents.

STANS DAUGHTER: Thats why Jack and I decided that no matter what time hes got left we want him to spend it with us.

SCULLY: How many years has he been here?

STANS DAUGHTER: Almost three. But we didnt have any choice. Jack and I both work. The doctor said he needed 24 hour nursing assistance.

MULDER: He doesnt seem to need much assistance now. Has his improvement been that pronounced?

STANS DAUGHTER: I thought I was bringing him here to die. They told me hed only get worse. The physical deterioration, the dementia. And now its like hes a different person.

MULDER: Do you have any idea why?

STANS DAUGHTER: I suppose it has something to do with Dr. Gragos treatment. Dad wont talk to me about it. Hes just too angry. He was angry when I first brought him here in the first place. Now hes angry that I want to take him home. I dont know that hes ever going to forgive me.

(STANs room. The orderly, TIERNAN, is packing STANs bag, his back to the door.)

TIERNAN: You know, Id like to say Im going to miss you, Stan, but the truth is, you are a royal pain in the butt.

(TIERNAN sees movement as STAN darts out of the room.)

TIERNAN: Hey, where you going? Dont make me chase you, old man.

(TIERNAN runs upstairs to top floor after STAN. We dont see STAN at all, just flurries of movement.)

TIERNAN: (out of breath) Hey! What are you? A track star all of a sudden? (he enters dark room and goes to open window and sees movement on the roof at the next window) Okay, stop messing around, Stan. You crawl back in that window right now. You crawl back in there. (He climbs on to the sill.) Dont think Im coming over there to get you. Id just as soon let you fall and break your neck. Did you hear me Stan? You hear me?

(Suddenly, there is movement behind him and he is pushed out of the window. He manages to grab the sill with his fingers.)

TIERNAN: Help! Help me! Somebody help me! Im gonna fall!

(MULDER runs back inside and up to the top floor.)

TIERNAN: Help!

(As TIERNAN dangles, one by one his fingers are lifted. MULDER reaches the window and holds out his hand to TIERNAN.)

MULDER: Give me your hand. Come on.

TIERNAN: (trying, but cant lift his hand to MULDERs, as if he is being pushed away) I cant.

MULDER: Grab it.

(TIERNAN screams as he loses his grip on the sill and falls four stories to the ground below. Unable to help, MULDER watches in shock.)

(SCULLY checks for a pulse on TIERNAN, and looks up to MULDER.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Oh, my God.



SCENE 10

(Next morning. MULDER is with STAN in STANs room. GUNG changes the sheets. DOCTOR GREGO enters, out of breath.)

DOCTOR GREGO: They paged me this morning. I got a message an orderly fell out a fourth floor window?

MULDER: Apparently. Either that or he was pushed.

DOCTOR GREGO: Was Stan involved?

MULDER: Thats what were trying to determine. Stan was with him just prior to the accident.

DOCTOR GREGO: Youre not suggesting he could have done it.

MULDER: There have been two deaths here in the past 24 hours. Stans been present before both of them.

DOCTOR GREGO: No, no. Thats impossible. Stan Phillips has a degenerative hip disease. Theres no way, he couldnt get up to the fourth floor on his own.

MULDER: What about an elevator?

DOCTOR GREGO: The elevators in this place havent worked for years.

MULDER: Maybe he was helped.

DOCTOR GREGO: Helped? By whom?

MULDER: I dont know. The postmortem on Hal Arden  did you get it yet?

DOCTOR GREGO: No, not yet, but they promise theyll fax it today.

MULDER: Can we check and see if its come in yet?

DOCTOR GREGO: Sure. Just what do you expect to find?

MULDER: (looks at STAN) Im not sure, exactly.

(They exit. STAN watches them leave, then looks at GUNG.)

(In another room, SCULLY sits with STANs DAUGHTER.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Why are they questioning him?

SCULLY: Its routine procedure.

STANS DAUGHTER: Are they going to want to keep him here?

SCULLY: Youll have to ask Dr. Grago.

STANS DAUGHTER: I God. If my mother was alive

(They hear NURSE CHARTERS arguing with MS. DAWSON.)

NURSE CHARTERS: How can I handle the whole floor by myself?

MS. DAWSON: I dont know, Michelle. I have other things to deal with.

NURSE CHARTERS: Yes, well, so do I. I would just like some help, please.

MS. DAWSON: Youre the only one on?

NURSE CHARTERS: Yes. Upshaw never showed up for work last night. Nobodys listening to me around here. I said there was something going on and I told you it had to do with Mr. Arden and Mr. Phillips. Forget it. (leaves)

MS. DAWSON: (to SCULLY) Can you please explain to me whats going on around here?

(DOROTHY is sitting in the hall nearby talking to her empty room.)

DOROTHY: Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Go away! Leave me alone. Go back! Dont come any closer!

MS. DAWSON: Go back in your room, Dorothy. If you need something, Ill send an orderly to see you.

DOROTHY: No, theyre in there.

MS. DAWSON: Who?

DOROTHY: All of them.

SCULLY: (looking in the empty room) Theres nobody in your room, Dorothy.

DOROTHY: Here they come. Youll see. All right, now you be nice. I dont want any more of your dirty tricks.

SCULLY: Is she going to be all right?

(MS. DAWSON tries to push DOROTHYs wheelchair into the room, but DOROTHY braces her hands on either side of the open door.)

DOROTHY: No! No, no, no, I dont want to go back in there! No! No! I dont want to go back in there! Oh, no, no, no

MS. DAWSON: (giving up) Its senile dementia. This is just an episode.

(DOROTHYS POV ON SCULLY: SCULLY is surrounded by shadowy figures reaching out to touch her. SCULLY stands staring at DOROTHY.)

DOROTHY: You leave her be. Dont you touch her. Now shoo! Go away, go away! Dont you get any ideas, mister.

SCULLY: (uncomfortable, passing DOROTHY, heading down the hall) Excuse me.

DOROTHY: Now dont you follow her.

(From DOROTHYs POV, we see the shadowy figures following SCULLY, hovering around her as she walks down the hall.)

(MULDER with DOCTOR GREGO who is looking at a file.)

DOCTOR GREGO: This is it.

MULDER: Is the toxicology there?

DOCTOR GREGO: Yes. Theres something here that shouldnt be here.

MULDER: Whats that?

DOCTOR GREGO: Ibotenic acid. How did that get in his blood?

MULDER: Whats ibotenic acid?

DOCTOR GREGO: If Im not mistaken, its a kind of poison.

(SCULLY enters, quickly.)

SCULLY: Mulder

MULDER: Scully, Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood. Somebody poisoned him.

SCULLY: (looking at the chart) Well, not necessarily. This is only a trace amount but small amounts are known to cause hallucinations which is what one of your patients is having right now down the hall.

DOCTOR GREGO: Where did they get it?

(NURSE CHARTERS knocks and enters in a hurry.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Excuse me. Youve got to come quickly.

(They follow NURSE CHARTERS into the day room.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

(One wall is completely covered with beautiful, intricate, but very disturbing, scary paintings. Oblivious to the others in the room, LEO continues painting frantically.)

MULDER: Its fantastic.

DOCTOR GREGO: Whats going on here?

SCULLY: Leo?

(LEO looks at her, then back to the painting.)

SCULLY: Its incredible

MULDER: Youve got an Asian orderly working here. Whats his name?

DOCTOR GREGO: Uh, Gung, I think.

MULDER: Do you know where he is?

DOCTOR GREGO: Somewhere down in the basement.

(MULDER goes into the basement alone, looks around. He finds a padlocked door. He uses a metal bar [chair leg?] to bash open the lock. He enters the dark, damp, room, shines flashlight, and finds lots of mushrooms growing in dirt. Digging through the dirt, he sees the hand, then uncovers the body of UPSHAW, the missing orderly, dead.)

MULDER: Upshaw.



SCENE 11

(MS. DAWSONs office. MULDER, SCULLY, DAWSON, and DOCTOR GREGO are questioning GUNG.)

GUNG: I didnt kill him.

MULDER: But its your mushroom crop, isnt it?

GUNG: Yes.

MULDER: Who else would have buried him there?

SCULLY: Why were you growing them?

GUNG: For medicinal purposes.

SCULLY: Were you feeding them to the residents here?

GUNG: Yes, but only in small amounts.

MULDER: Why?

GUNG: Because it makes them feel better.

MULDER: Makes them feel better, or it kills them?

GUNG: No.

DOCTOR GREGO: Exactly what kind of mushrooms are they?

GUNG: Its from my prefecture in my country. Theyve been used for centuries.

SCULLY: For what purpose?

GUNG: In my country, our customs are different.

MS. DAWSON: Youre not in your country now. Youre hired here to care for these people under our guidelines.

GUNG: Where I come from, many generations live under one roof. As children, our grandparents live with us. We feel a duty to take care of them. (MULDER and SCULLY share a look.) It isnt like that in this country. We respect our old people as we respect our ancestors. We dont send them away to die like Stan and Hal.

DOCTOR GREGO: These people are given excellent medical care.

GUNG: But theyre not treated with respect. Hals family never came to visit him once and the orderlies treat the residents worse than dogs.

MS. DAWSON: No one is mistreated here.

GUNG: Youre not here to see.

MULDER: All right, Gung, who killed the orderly? Who buried him in that room?

GUNG: Something has gone very wrong. The mushrooms we take to speak with the dead, to see our ancestors in the spirit world. But the spirit in this place is very angry and the souls that died here continue to suffer. And now they  have been awakened.

SCULLY: Are you saying that a spirit killed this man, Upshaw?

GUNG: Yes. Theyve taken revenge for their mistreatment.

MULDER: How are the mushrooms taken?

GUNG: Dried, mixed with many herbs, made into powder.

MULDER: Well, I think the first thing we should do is make sure nobody else takes them. (to DOCTOR GREGO) You, check on the other patients. Gung, come with me. Lets go.

(MULDER, SCULLY, and GUNG go down to the basement room. GUNG pauses for a moment at the door, and looks around suspiciously. Then they enter and GUNG goes to a cabinet and removes a jar with just a couple of pills at the bottom.)

GUNG: Someones taken them all.

(MULDER pulls SCULLY to the side to speak privately.)

MULDER: I think youre right, Scully.

SCULLY: About?

MULDER: Whats been happening is the result of the medication, but not the medication the Doctors been giving them.

SCULLY: Mulder, mushrooms arent medication. They taste good on hamburgers, but they dont raise the dead.

MULDER: Shamans have used them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world.

SCULLY: I think youve been reading too much Carlos Castenada.

MULDER: Ask any anthropologist then.

SCULLY: I know --- a shaman gets intoxicated, he has dreams or hallucinations, and he interprets them. I dont think its any more magical than that.

MULDER: I dont know how else to explain whats happening here.

SCULLY: Well, I think, if anything, these mushrooms are a poison to the system and I think thats what killed Hal Arden.

MULDER: And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies? Somethings been unleashed here, Scully. I dont know how to explain it, but it has something to do with those pills.



SCENE 12

(STAN in his room drops a handful of pills and frantically pushes them into his mouth. His DAUGHTER enters.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Daddy? Daddy, what are you taking? What are you putting in your mouth?

DOROTHY: (in hall, waving her arms) Go away! You go away! Go away! You leave me leave us alone! Go on! You  run. (to STANs DAUGHTER) Run while you can. Go on, run. Run. Go away. (sees the shadowy figures approaching) Go away! Go on. You leave us alone. Go on.

LEO: (voice) Dorothy! I need your help!

DOROTHY: Leo. you leave me alone. You leave him alone! Leo! Leo! Leo  go on. Go on. You leave him you leave .

(DOROTHY wheels herself to LEOs door. LEO is collapsed on floor. She sees figures over him. STANs DAUGHTER joins her at LEOs door.)

DORORTHY: Oh oh, no. Stop. Stop that.

(Both of them see LEOs body pulled into the shadows and the door slam. They hear NURSE CHARTERS scream.)

(Downstairs, MULDER and SCULLY hear NURSE CHARTERS scream. MULDER runs upstairs and into the bathroom and sees NURSE CHARTERS trying to stand up.)

NURSE CHARTERS: Help me, please.

(NURSE CHARTERS screams as she is flung against the wall. MULDER turns to see SCULLY just getting to the bathroom door. Door to the bathroom slams shut, and every water faucet and valve in the bathroom begins shooting out water. Fighting against the water, MULDER hears SCULLY outside the door.)

SCULLY: (trying to open the door which has just slammed in her face) Mulder! Whats going on!? Mulder!? Mulder!

MULDER: (yelling through the locked door) Scully! Turn off the water main! Turn off the water main!

(SCULLY sees water coming out the bottom of the door.)

SCULLY: Theyre trapped in the bathroom and its filling with water.

MS. DAWSON: What?

SCULLY: Wheres the main water shutoff?

MS. DAWSON: I dont know.

SCULLY: Gung will know. (begins running off to find GUNG) Keep trying the door.

(Bathroom is now almost knee deep. MULDER begins pulling a dizzy NURSE CHARTERS to her feet.)

MULDER: Youve got to get up. Come on. You got to get up.

(In the basement, SCULLY and GUNG try to turn off the water main.)

GUNG: Its stuck.

SCULLY: See if you can find something to force it with.

GUNG: Okay.

(Bathroom is now about five feet deep. MULDER swims down and tries to uncover the drain. It doesnt work. He surfaces again next to NURSE CHARTERS who is holding on to a pipe.)

MULDER: I cant open the drains.

(STANs room. STAN is lying on bed having a seizure. STANs DAUGHTER catches SCULLY in the hall.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Please! Please, my father needs help. My father took something. Im afraid hes dying.

SCULLY: You stay with him. Ill get help. (runs down hall to the bathroom door) Dr. Grago! Dr. Grago.

DOCTOR GREGO: Its sealed tight.

SCULLY: Do you have any atropine in your kit here?

DOCTOR GREGO: Uh, I might. Yes, I think so.

SCULLY: Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions. I think he might have poisoned himself.

(DOCTOR GREGO runs down the hall.)

(In the bathroom, water level is only a few inches from the ceiling. MULDER and NURSE CHARTERS hold onto a pipe just barely keeping their noses above water.)

MULDER: Just hold on. Its all right.

(In STANs room, DOCTOR GREGO gives STAN an injection. His body tenses as shadowy figures fade.)

(In hall, SCULLY stares at the bathroom door which now has water flowing over the top. Suddenly, the door gives way, and the wall of water knocks SCULLY and MS. DAWSON down, then MULDER and NURSE CHARTERS come pouring out and a few feet down the hall. )

(STAN, in his room, catches his breath and begins to relax, the seizure fading.)

DOROTHY: (in hallway) Theyre gone. Theyre all gone. Theyre gone. Theyre all gone.

(MULDER, coughing, stands up, holding NURSE CHARTERS in the hip deep water in the hall.)

SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah. Fine.



SCENE 13

(SCULLY voiceover. Nursing home, night, then some time later.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) In response to the series of unexplained incidents at the Excelsius Dei convalescent home, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has assumed all administrative authority at the facility. They detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid in more than half the residents tested. Though these levels have dissipated rapidly.

(Day room. In front of the incredible mural, LEO draws a crude picture of a sailboat.)

SCULLY: (voiceover, cont.) Dr. John Grago has been replaced as head physician at the facility and his trial use of the drug Depranil has been suspended. For his admitted part in manufacturing and distributing an illicit substance, Gung Bittouin was remanded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and is awaiting repatriation to Malaysia. There are reportedly no efforts being made to study the mushrooms.

(DOROTHY is wheeled in and a magazine placed in front of her. No response.)

SCULLY: (voiceover, cont.) The federal government has settled Michelle Charters lawsuit out of court though no clear blame has been placed. Witnesses to the events have been unreliable due to dramatic relapses and a general reversal in their progress with Alzheimers disease.

(STANs DAUGHTER sits with STAN in the day room. He is completely nonresponsive.)

STANS DAUGHTER: Im going to go now, Daddy. Ill see you again soon. Maybe next week.

(STAN stares into space.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
AUBREY, MISSOURI

(A busy police station office. DETECTIVE JOE DARNELL and LIEUTENANT BRIAN TILLMAN enter, conversing.)

DARNELL: There was blood everywhere. Whoever killed her is a real psycho.

TILLMAN: Murder weapon?

DARNELL: Seven stores in town carry strop razors.

TILLMAN: Have somebody check them out.

DARNELL: Well, what about the press?

TILLMAN: (picking up a phone) Just the basics. No mention of this "sister" thing to anybody.

DARNELL: Okay. (Walks away)

(Various background voices in the office talk urgently about the current investigation. Camera focuses on DETECTIVE B.J. MORROW, seated at a desk. She is looking intently at TILLMAN. He gets off the phone, looks at her briefly, then walks into his office. BJ continues to stare, appearing uneasy.)

(In TILLMAN's office. We get a long look at a photograph of TILLMAN and a woman, presumably his wife. Camera pulls back to reveal TILLMAN seated at his desk drinking coffee in front of a laptop computer. BJ knocks on the door, opens it, and stands in the doorway.)

BJ: Brian, I need a minute.

TILLMAN: (somewhat irritated) I'm working on a homicide investigation. (waves her in) Come on.

BJ: (enters) You didn't show last night.

TILLMAN: This what you want to talk about?

BJ: I made dinner.

TILLMAN: (sighs in exasperation) It's not -- (gets cut off by an phone intercom buzz, and snaps at the phone) What?

INTERCOM: Sorry ... coroner's on one.

(BJ sits as TILLMAN picks up the phone.)

TILLMAN: Yeah, whattaya got, Reuben? (listens to the phone, ignoring BJ for the moment)

(BJ picks up a piece of paper and writes a note.)

TILLMAN: (still on phone) Uh-huh.

(BJ hands him the note. It reads "I'M PREGNANT." TILLMAN looks at it, then BJ. She looks at him with a somewhat embarrassed and guilty look on her face.)

TILLMAN: (on phone) Uh, hang on a second, will you, Reuben?

(TILLMAN puts the phone on hold, pauses a moment, and then rips a piece of paper from a notepad to write a note. BJ looks at him almost hopefully. He hands her the note.)

TILLMAN: This address, ten o'clock tonight.

BJ: (surprised) Where's this? (suspicion dawns on her face) A motel?

TILLMAN: It's a place we can talk.

(BJ looks disapprovingly at TILLMAN, but gets up and walks out of the office. TILLMAN crumples the "I'M PREGNANT" note and throws it out. He picks up the phone to resume his conversation, but puts it down and then holds his head in his hands in despair.)

(Later that night, at the Motel Black, BJ ascends the steps to room #6. She fumbles with her keys. As she tries to put the key in the lock, she misses and her vision blurs. She grimaces in pain, starts to hyperventilate, and looks around her in fright. Voices whisper unintelligibly. She sinks to the ground. Nearby, an engine roars into life and headlights flick on, illuminating her face in a white glare. She raises her hand to her eyes to shield them from the light, moaning softly. In grainy black-and-white footage we see the grille of an old (1940's?) truck. BJ is having a vision. In her vision, we are at the wheel of the truck, driving at night into an empty field. Reflected in the rearview mirror we see the face of a young man. The truck stops and the driver takes a large something from the truck bed, grunting with the effort. He walks with it slung over his shoulder through the field, then drops it onto the ground. It is a body. We see the driver digging a shallow grave with a shovel, backlit by the truck headlights. The scene flashes back and forth from the vision of the man digging to BJ digging in the dirt with her bare hands. She is moaning as she digs frantically. She uncovers a long bone (a femur?) and then a human skull. Her digging slows and then stops as she picks up something else from the dirt. She raises it into the light. It's a metal badge that reads: "Justice Department U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation." BJ raises her head, her mouth open in shock, and looks around her. She stands slowly, still turning around as if looking for help, but she is completely alone in the field.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The X-Files office. MULDER is examining several sets of dental X-rays pinned up on a lightboard. SCULLY enters from the adjoining room and stands next to him.)

SCULLY: Any cavities?

MULDER: I brush after every meal. Would you say they match?

(SCULLY examines the X-rays.)

SCULLY: Well, there's a filling on the occlusal surface of the upper left bicuspid here and here (pointing at the X-rays) and he's congenitally missing a lower left bicuspid here and here ... Yeah, I'd say they're definitely a match. Who do they belong to?

MULDER: Special Agent Sam Chaney.

SCULLY: That name sounds familiar.

MULDER: Chaney's a legend. (Picks up a file and hands it to SCULLY, who opens it and starts flipping through pages. We get a good look at a photo of Chaney.) Forty years before the Bureau started profiling violent criminals, Chaney and his partner Tim Ledbetter would work on their own time investigating what were then called "stranger killings" -- what are now called serial murders. They disappeared while investigating three murders in Aubrey, Missouri in 1942. Chaney's body wasn't found until two days ago by local detective, B.J. Morrow ... a woman.

SCULLY: What's your interest in this case?

MULDER: During their time, Chaney's and Ledbetter's ideas weren't very well received by their peers. Using psychology to solve a crime was something like, um ...

SCULLY: Believing in the paranormal?

MULDER: Exactly. (pauses) There's another mystery.

SCULLY: Which is?

MULDER: Well, I'd like to know why this policewoman would suddenly drive her car into a field the size of Rhode Island and for no rhyme or reason dig up the bones of a man who's been missing for fifty years. I mean, unless there was a neon sign saying "Dig Here" --

SCULLY: I guess that's why we're going to Aubrey.

MULDER: (slyly) Yes, and also I've always been intrigued by women named B.J. (smiles at SCULLY)



SCENE 3
CRIME SCENE
AUBREY, MISSOURI

(Shot of a shovel digging in the dirt. Pull back to reveal the crime scene: an area of the field that is staked off. MULDER and SCULLY are talking to BJ; TILLMAN stands off to the side, overseeing the excavation.)

SCULLY: Detective Morrow, exactly how did you discover the remains?

BJ: (as if she's rehearsed this explanation) I witnessed a dog digging in the ground; I proceeded to investigate and found the gravesite.

MULDER: Well, the initial police report states that you couldn't explain your actions at the time.

BJ: (slightly flustered, but recovers) It was late ... I was a bit shocked by my discovery ... I'm afraid I didn't clearly articulate exactly what happened for my initial report.

MULDER: What were you doing in the woods at that hour?

BJ: My vehicle was experiencing engine failure.

MULDER: And you left your car ... (looks around)

BJ: (pointing way across the field) Over there, sir.

(We see TILLMAN chewing on a piece of straw. He is looking away from the group but is paying close attention to what is being said.)

MULDER: Would you say that's uh ... four or five hundred yards?

BJ: (looks back and forth at the distance) Yes, sir.

MULDER: So from that distance, you could see a dog digging in this field at night?

(TILLMAN turns around abruptly and walks over to the three.)

TILLMAN: She was taking a shortcut through the woods to reach a phone. The path led her through the field.

MULDER: Well, the report says she phoned in from the Motel Black just up the road there. That's not a very short cut.

TILLMAN: It seems like you're more interested in how the missing agent was found than in how he got here in the first place. You don't, uh, suspect her, do you?

MULDER: No, no, not at all. I would just like to ask Detective Morrow a few more questions.

BJ: All right.

MULDER: Have you ever, um, have you ever had any clairvoyant experiences? Premonitions, visions, precognitive dreams, things like that?

(BJ is taken aback.)

TILLMAN: (scoffing) What the hell kind of question is that?

BJ: (incredulously) Dreams?

MULDER: Yeah.

TILLMAN: (condescendingly) Look, Agent Mulder, I don't mean to be rude, but we have a lot to do. If you have any further questions specifically pertaining to your investigation of this crime, please feel free to call. Come on, B.J.

(TILLMAN walks off. BJ follows absently. SCULLY and MULDER share a look.)



SCENE 4
CORONER'S OFFICE
EXAMINING ROOM C

(An examination room. Close-up of a bone fragment through a magnifying glass. Pull back to reveal SCULLY examining bones laid out on a table.)

SCULLY: These bones are in good condition. But I think the field may have been tilled shortly after Chaney was buried; there are small cuts on the top three ribs. I don't think they were made by an animal.

MULDER: (Sitting on a tabletop perusing a small black leather journal) Listen to this, Scully. "One must wonder how these monsters are created." Chaney wrote this. "Did their home life mold them into creatures that must maim and kill, or are they demons from birth?"

SCULLY: Well, that's poetic but it doesn't help us much. What did he say about the 1942 homicides?

MULDER: (looking at a file) Well, the press called the murderer "The Slash Killer." His three victims were all young women aged twenty-five to thirty. (Flips through a series of gruesome black and white photographs.) He disabled them with a blow to the head.

(SCULLY picks up Chaney's skull, turns it to reveal a jagged hole in the back of the skull.)

MULDER: He would carve the word "SISTER" on their chests and paint it on the wall with their blood.

<SCULLY picks up another bone, a rib, and looks at it thoughtfully.)

MULDER: The victims bled to death. The murderer was never found.

SCULLY: Mulder, these cuts on the ribs -- they could have been made by a razor.

MULDER: Can you make out a word?

SCULLY: No, but we might be able to if we can find somebody in Aubrey who has a digital scanner.

(Somewhat later. SCULLY is seated at a computer eating a cookie. The screen reads, "FBI IMAGE ANALYSIS. Please Wait.")

SCULLY: I've scanned the images from the crime photo and the ribcage and loaded them to Quantico. It's gonna be a few more seconds before the hookup.

MULDER: I checked with the precinct mechanic. BJ's car was just tuned. She lied about experiencing engine failure. (Sits down next to SCULLY and helps himself to a cookie.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't think BJ was in the woods that night because of engine failure.

MULDER: (with mouthful of cookie) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Well, the Motel Black would have been the perfect meeting place -- away from town, away from his wife ...

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: It's obvious BJ and Tillman are having an affair.

MULDER: How do you know?

SCULLY: A woman senses these things.

MULDER: (scoffs) Aw ... pshaw.

(Computer beeps. Both turn to the screen, which displays two ribcages side-by-side.)

SCULLY: The image on the right is Chaney's ribcage. The one on the left was extrapolated from the crime photo of the Slash Killer's last victim. Now I need to enlarge the victim's ribcage in order to allow for gender difference. (Taps busily on keyboard.) And now, we can compare them. (Computer beeps and reads, "ATTEMPT MATCH IMAGE COMPARE NO MATCH".)

MULDER: Could he have carved out another word on his ribcage?

(SCULLY types some more. The images of the ribcages zoom closer and the screen reads "ATTEMPT FUZZY MATCH".)

SCULLY: I'm searching for any matching pattern of cuts.

(BJ appears at the door.)

BJ: Agent Mulder? Have you made any progress in the investigation?

MULDER: Uh, we may have. It seems Agent Chaney might have been a victim of the killer he was trying to catch. We're trying to determine if the cuts on his ribcage spell out a word right now.

(BJ walks into the room, staring at the bones as if in a trance. She has a B&W vision of Chaney being dealt a blow to the head and then of a razor upraised and descending on Chaney's neck. She staggers.)

MULDER: You all right?

BJ: (recovering) I'm sorry. Something I ... I'm not fee--- ... (swallows convulsively) Excuse me. (Turns and leaves the room abruptly.)

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 5

(In the women's restroom, BJ is rinsing her mouth at a sink. She's obviously just vomited. SCULLY enters and gets a paper towel, offers it to BJ.)

SCULLY: Feeling better?

BJ: I'm fine now. (Ignores SCULLY's outstretched paper towel, reaches across SCULLY to get her own paper towel and begins to dry her face.)

SCULLY: Things must be difficult for you now. I've had ... feelings for people I've worked with. Interoffice relationships can be complicated ... especially when he's married.

(BJ ignores SCULLY, throws out the paper towel.)

SCULLY: (with penetrating insight and feminine intuition) You're pregnant, aren't you?

(BJ is shocked, turns to face SCULLY, then turns away. She says nothing. SCULLY, sensing that her advances are not welcome, turns and begins to leave.)

BJ: Does it show?

SCULLY: No, not yet.

BJ: (somewhat relieved, begins to open up) Now I know why my mother only had one child. She told me about the nausea, but not about the nightmares.

SCULLY: (returning to BJ) Nightmares?

BJ: (nervously arranging her hair) It's always the same. I'm in a house, it feels familiar. There's a woman that's been hurt. There's a mirror... I see a man's reflection. I recognize his face, but I don't know it. What I remember most is the blood. There's a lot of blood.

SCULLY: Have you talked to anyone about these nightmares?

BJ: I'm sure it's something about the pregnancy. If anyone else knew I was pregnant ... Brian would kill me if I told anyone.

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

BJ: I don't know.

(SCULLY leaves the restroom and returns to the examining room. She sits down at the computer next to MULDER.)



SCENE 6

SCULLY: (with only a slight touch of "I told you so") Well, BJ's pregnant, and Tillman's the father.

(MULDER looks suitably surprised and impressed. However, both return to strictly business as BJ walks into the room.)

MULDER: Um, I've approximated the pattern of the cuts to match up with letters. There's a 93% chance that this is the letter R (pointing at the computer screen). If we lower the probability to 79%, we get the letters I, E, and R.

(As SCULLY and MULDER are engrossed by the computer screen, BJ turns around to the bones on the table and moves toward them, staring at them intently.)

SCULLY: Well, it could be a word, or it could just be random slashes.

MULDER: If we exhumed one of the Slash Killer's victims, we could do a CT scan to determine if the cuts were made by the same type of instrument.

SCULLY: Well, that means getting a court order. It could take a couple of days. Maybe we could find a relative who could speed up the process.

(BJ, standing over the bones, moves her hand over the ribs as if writing a word. Her mouth moves as if she's saying the same word.)

BJ: (hoarsely) Brother.

MULDER: Excuse me?

BJ: I know what it says. On the ribcage. It spells "Brother." (She joins the agents at the computer.)

(TILLMAN enters the room unnoticed. MULDER types on the keyboard, the computer does some lightning fast computations, and displays "MATCH STRING SET. BROTHER AT 68%")

MULDER: You're right.

TILLMAN: BJ?

(All turn to face TILLMAN.)

BJ: (almost guilty) Brian.

TILLMAN: What's going on here, BJ?

BJ: (defensive) Nothing.

TILLMAN: Really? Then where'd you get these? (Picks up the file of 1942 photos MULDER was looking at earlier. Angrily.) These are crime scene photos. They were sealed. No one had access to 'em.

MULDER: I think you're mistaken. Those were shot in 1942.

TILLMAN: (shaking the file at MULDER) These are evidence of a homicide that occurred three days ago.

SCULLY: No, those were from a case that Agent Ledbetter and Agent Chaney were investigating in 1942 before they disappeared.

(TILLMAN stares at the file in his hands.)

CASE NO. D-147816 REF 44-9A
AUBREY POLICE DEPARTMENT
CRIMINAL PACKAGE REFERENCE RECORD

BRADSHAW, ANTONIA
EBERHARDT, KATHY
VAN CLEEF, LAURA
HOM, RAPE 1942
CASE NO D 147816

(TILLMAN flips through the photos, then looks up at the three.)

TILLMAN: Three days ago, a young woman was murdered and the word "SISTER" was carved into her chest and painted on the wall. Only myself, the coroner, and one of my men knew about this.

(There is a brief but significant silence. Suddenly DARNELL rushes into the room.)

DARNELL: Excuse me, sir, we just got a call. There's been another one.

(TILLMAN, MULDER, SCULLY, and BJ enter the pool area of what is probably the local YMCA. The pool is empty. Various policemen and detectives are at the scene, inside the drained pool, taking pictures and gathering evidence. Prominent is the word "SISTER" painted on the wall of the pool.)

POLICEMAN: (to TILLMAN descends a ladder into the pool) Watch your step, sir.

ANOTHER OFFICER: (to TILLMAN as he approaches the victim) Victim's name is Verna Johnson.

(The four advance toward the victim, who is lying on the floor of the pool in the deep end. The sheet is drawn back, revealing the face of a young woman streaked with blood. "SISTER" is carved on her chest.)

BJ: Oh my god. (Everyone stares at her.)

SCULLY: BJ?

BJ: (shaky) It's her. It's the woman in my dream.



SCENE 7
LINCOLN PARK
AUBREY, MISSOURI

(A little blond girl is running through autumn leaves with a dog. She stumbles and falls.)

GIRL: Ow!

(At the sound, BJ stands up and looks over, wanting to help. However, the girl's mother goes over to the girl quickly and comforts her. BJ slowly looks away and sits back down at a picnic table with MULDER and SCULLY)

MOTHER: (very faint in the distance) Honey dear, you're fine.

BJ: The mothering instinct. I've been feeling it a lot lately. I used to hate it when my mother hovered over me. I swore I'd never be like her.

(The mother has helped the girl up onto her feet and they are walking away.)

MULDER: I think we all feel that way at one time or another.

BJ: My father was a cop. A good cop. That's all I ever wanted to be. He'd say what we're doing here is nonsense. That you can't solve a crime from a dream.

MULDER: Well, I've often felt that dreams are answers to questions we haven't yet figured out how to ask. (pause) You said you were in a familiar house?

BJ: (nodding) There's a woman that's been hurt ... I look in a mirror and I see a man's reflection.

MULDER: What does he look like?

BJ: He's got a ... rash on his face. And his eyes are ... intense.

MULDER: Do you remember anything else?

BJ: There's this ... strange picture on the wall behind him. It's a building like the Washington Monument, but different. And there's a ... a big circular thing beside it.

MULDER: You think you could draw it?

BJ: Sure.

(MULDER hands her a pen and SCULLY gives her a pad of paper. BJ draws a tall isosceles triangle on the left and then a circle on the right, which slightly overlaps the base of the triangle. She shows the drawing to the agents.)

BJ: It looks something like this.

SCULLY: What do you think it is?

(BJ shrugs.)

MULDER: Could be the Trylon and the Perisphere. Have you ever been to New York City?

BJ: No, never.

MULDER: You can get pictures of these on postcards all over Times Square. These were the symbols of the 1939 World's Fair.

SCULLY: Do you know why they might have been in your dream?

BJ: No idea at all.

(MULDER looks again at BJ's drawing.)



SCENE 8

(Somewhere in the Aubrey police station. Screen shot of a folder cover that reads:)

CIMARRON COUNTY
CATALOGUE NO. 4756
1942

(The folder is opened. BJ is looking through it, scanning old mug shots. TILLMAN approaches.)

TILLMAN: You're here kinda late. (sits down with a grunt) What are you lookin' for?

BJ: Just want to check on something. (continues flipping busily through the pages)

TILLMAN: (looks closer at what she's doing) I don't get it. That book's from the 1940s.

(BJ ignores him.)

TILLMAN: (looks around nervously) Can we talk? (pause) You know, I'm willin' to go with ya ... for the appointment.

BJ: I'm not so sure it's what I wanna do.

TILLMAN: I thought we agreed that it was the best thing for both of us.

(BJ keeps looking at photos until TILLMAN slams his hand down over the page. They stare at each other.)

BJ: I changed my mind.

TILLMAN: What do you mean you changed your mind? You can't just change your mind. This isn't your decision, it's our decision! BJ!

(BJ has continued looking at mug shots. She focuses on one, a man with a scarred-looking face, and breathes in sharply.)

BJ: It's him! Brian ... I have to go. (stands up and walks away, leaving TILLMAN confused.)



SCENE 9
HIGHWAY 377
MISSOURI/NEBRASKA BORDER

(We are driving down a rural highway.)

SCULLY: (v/o) This is the man BJ claims to have seen in her dream.

(Mug shot of the man BJ recognized.)

SCULLY: (v/o) Harry Cokely. He lives in Gainesville, Nebraska since his release from Macalester Penitentiary on December fifth, 1993.

(MULDER is driving; SCULLY is reading from a file.)

SCULLY: He was convicted in 1945 for rape and attempted murder. Cokely carved "SISTER" on the chest of his victim, Linda Thibedeaux, before she was able to escape and get help from a neighbor.

(Shot of a portait of an attractive young blond woman, 1940's style hair and dress.)

MULDER: And the police never made the connection to the 1942 homicides?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Well, I don't want to jump to any rash conclusions, but I'd say he's definitely our prime suspect.

SCULLY: But Mulder, the man we're talking about is 77 years old.

MULDER: George Foreman won the heavyweight crown at 45. Some people are late bloomers.

(SCULLY goes back to looking through the file.)

MULDER: Anyway, this still doesn't explain BJ's connection to all this.

SCULLY: What if it's cryptamnesia?

MULDER: You mean consciously forgotten information?

SCULLY: Yeah. BJ told us that her father was a policeman in the area. What if she heard him discussing the 1942 case when she was young? She might have even seen pictures of Cokely .

MULDER: Yeah, but that still doesn't explain why she would go into a field and unearth the grave of an FBI agent.

SCULLY: What if the recent murders triggered what was previously buried in her mind ... some connection she'd unconsciously made that no one else had been able to make.

MULDER: You mean a hunch?

SCULLY: Yeah, something like that.

MULDER: Well, that's a pretty extreme hunch.

SCULLY: I seem to recall you having some pretty extreme hunches.

MULDER: (grinning) I never have.

(SCULLY smiles too.)



SCENE 10

(Somewhat later, the agents are driving down a dirt road flanked by stark, winter-bare trees. They approach a decrepit two-story farmhouse and park the car. They knock on the door. Slow footsteps approach the door and open it.)

MULDER: Harry Cokely?

COKELY: Yeah?

(COKELY looks at the agents suspiciously. He is an old, acerbic-looking man with intense eyes and a blistered-looking face. An oxygen tube runs to his nose.)

MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder, this is Special Agent Scully. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. May we come in?

(Grudgingly, COKELY turns and motions them in. As he walks away, we see that he is carting an oxygen tank. SCULLY shuts the door behind them. They enter the living room, which is where COKELY seems to do most of his living, such as it is. There is an unmade bed, an armchair, and the TV is on. The air is wreathed in shadow and in smoke as COKELY sits in the armchair and lights a cigarette, in spite of the fact that there is already one smoking in the ashtray. MULDER and SCULLY remain standing.)

SCULLY: Mr. Cokely, our records show that in 1942, you lived in Terrence, Nebraska, an hour's drive away from Aubrey, Missouri. During that time, three women were murdered in Aubrey. (COKELY is coughing hoarsely.) Their assailant had mutilated their bodies with a razor in the same manner that you slashed Mrs. Linda Thibedeaux's body in 1945.

COKELY: I don't remember much about that.

SCULLY: Well, I'm sure Mrs. Thibedeaux will never forget it.

(COKELY narrows his eyes at SCULLY, the looks away.)

COKELY: (slowly and deliberately, with a pronounced midwestern drawl) Doctors said I was sick back then. They gave me some pills. I served my time, and now I'm better.

SCULLY: What kind of pills?

COKELY: Red and white ones, little sister.

(SCULLY looks at him with thinly-veiled disgust. MULDER shows him a photo of Agent Chaney.)

MULDER: Do you recognize this man? His name's Chaney.

COKELY: No.

MULDER: He was an FBI agent who was also murdered in Aubrey in 1942. Can you tell me where you were about 8:35 PM two nights ago, Mr. Cokely?

COKELY: Sittin' right where I am now.

MULDER: Do you have a witness to testify to that?

COKELY: (turning mean) Are you blind? (gestures at the tank) I can't leave the house without this damn thing! I sit right here in front of that TV twenty-four hours a day. And on the night you're talkin' about, I was sittin' here watching a show about a lost dog. Then after that, it was a show about --

SCULLY: (interrupting him) That won't be necessary.

COKELY: Good. Now, are you about finished with me, little sister? (Takes a drag on the cigarette.)

SCULLY: For now. (if looks could kill ... )

(COKELY continues to smoke and cough and MULDER and SCULLY leave the house.)



SCENE 11

(BJ's bedroom at night. A strong wind is blowing the curtains around an open window. BJ is in bed, sleeping. Various wind and banging sounds as the shutters hit the house. Headlights pass by the window and they segue directly into BJ's B&W dream. Again we see the grille of the old truck. In real life, lightning illuminates BJ's face; in her dream the flash shines on an upheld straight razor that slashes down. Thunder crashes and BJ wakes up screaming. She grabs her gun and points it around the room, but there's no one there. The shutter bangs and BJ relaxes, putting a hand to her forehead. She feels something there and looks at her hand in the darkness. She turns on the bedside lamp and discovers that she's covered in blood ... her face, her hands, her chest. There is blood on the lampshade, too. Moaning, she stumbles into the bathroom and turns on the light. She looks at herself in the mirror, grabs a towel from the rack and wets it in the sink. As she cleans herself, bloody water washes down the drain. She dabs the blood from the chest and discovers to her horror that "SISTER" is carved there. Not knowing what to do, she stumbles back in to the bedroom and closes the bathroom door. In the full-length mirror there she sees the reflection of YOUNG COKELY. She screams and whirls around but he's not there. She screams again and falls to the floor, sobbing. She has another B&W vision. In this vision, a crowbar pries up a floorboard. A man, grunting, drags a body in a gunny sack and dumps it under the floor. Cut immediately to BJ, also ripping up floorboards with a crowbar. She's in someone else's house, in the cellar.)

WOMAN: (coming down the stairs with TILLMAN, SCULLY, and MULDER) She seemed to be in trouble but when I opened the door, she just barged in and ... and came running down the stairs. So I called the police.

BJ: (moaning frantically and throwing floorboards aside) He's here ... he's here!

TILLMAN: BJ, what happened? (holding BJ and noticing her blood-soaked shirt) Oh my god.

BJ: (still sobbing, whispers) He's here ...

TILLMAN: Oh my god. I'm taking her to the hospital. (Escorts her up the stairs.)

(MULDER kneels down and looks at what BJ has unearthed from the floor. He pulls up an old, dirt-covered gunny sack full of bones. He and SCULLY share a look.)



SCENE 12
MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
AUBREY, MISSOURI

(Hospital exterior, night. Then BJ's room in the hospital. A nurse leaves the room as SCULLY and MULDER enter. SCULLY hands a paper bag of clothes to BJ, who is sitting up in bed.)

SCULLY: Thought you might need these.

BJ: (pulling an article of clothing from the bag and smiling) Thanks.

SCULLY: You hurt yourself.

(BJ looks down at her left hand, which is blistered. It looks like it was burnt in acid.)

MULDER: Can you tell us what happened, BJ?

BJ: (with certainty) Cokely. He was in the room.

SCULLY: Cokely attacked you?

BJ: Yes. (looking down at her chest) He must have done this while I was asleep.

MULDER: You're sure it was him.

BJ: I know it was him. I saw his reflection in the mirror. He looked just like his picture.

MULDER: Like his mug shot?

BJ: (nodding) Yes.

MULDER: But that's the picture of a young man.

BJ: But it was Cokely. I swear it was him.

SCULLY: Well, I'll have Tillman pick him up. (Looks at MULDER with a "let's humor her" look.)



SCENE 13

(An interrogation room in the Aubrey police station. COKELY and TILLMAN are seated at a table; MULDER and SCULLY are standing.)

TILLMAN: Where were you last night?

COKELY: (obviously disgusted with this business) Honolulu.

TILLMAN: You were in Aubrey, weren't ya?

(COKELY has a coughing fit.)

TILLMAN: How'd ya get into Detective Morrow's house?

COKELY: It's all I can do to get to the bathroom, you damn fool!

TILLMAN: The victim has identified you, Mr. Cokely.

COKELY: I already paid for my crime.

TILLMAN: We'll, I'm gonna see that you pay more.

COKELY: I never touched that woman!

(MULDER notices that COKELY's left hand is blistered, similar to BJ's.)

COKELY: And I'm not answering any more questions without a lawyer. (pause) Get me a lawyer.



SCENE 14

(In MULDER's motel room. He's eating sunflower seeds over a picture of YOUNG COKELY. Someone knocks at the door.)

SCULLY: (outside) Mulder?

MULDER: It's open.

(SCULLY enters, carrying some papers.)

SCULLY: I have the preliminary results from the genetic testing from the blood found under Verna Johnson's nails. They checked it against Cokely's. The PGM subtype matches, the DQF and the D-1S are the same.

MULDER: Cokely's blood?

SCULLY: The results strongly suggest that. Imagine the strength of this man's psychosis still driving him to murder after fifty years.

MULDER: But for some reason he let BJ live.

SCULLY: Well, she's not the first. Mrs. Thibedeaux also survived his attack back in 1945.

MULDER: I think it's time we paid a visit to Mrs. Thibedeaux.

(They gather up their things and leave the room.)



SCENE 15
THIBEDEAUX RESIDENCE
EDMOND, NEBRASKA

(Exterior of a neat suburban ranch house. The agents pull up in an SUV. Cut to the same picture of MRS. THIBEDEAUX as a young woman that we saw earlier in COKELY's file.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (v/o) That was taken three weeks before it happened.

(Camera pan from picture to MRS. THIBEDEAUX's face. She looks grandmotherly, but there is a prominent scar near her right eye. It looks like she was slashed there.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: I haven't had a picture taken since.

(MRS. THIBEDEAUX, MULDER, and SCULLY are standing in the foyer. A staircase leads up to a landing.)

MULDER: (indicating other pictures that line the wall of the stairs) Is this your husband?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: That's, uh, Martin. He was a good man. He passed last June. If it hadn't been for him I never would have survived.

SCULLY: I know this goes back a long way, Mrs. Thibedeaux, but can you tell us what happened the night Harry Cokely attacked you?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (slowly, remembering) It happened up there, on the landing. I remember how the light from the window ... bounced off the razor. It, it had an ivory handle. He, he kept saying, "Someone's gotta take the blame, little sister, and it isn't gonna be me." They tried to explain at the trial how his father used to beat him and how he was the only son in a family of five daughters, and how he was brutally punished for everything wrong that happened.

(MULDER is looking at more pictures on the wall. He focuses on one photo of MRS. THIBEDEAUX and her husband posing in front of the Trylon and the Perisphere -- the shapes from BJ's dream.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: But if you ask me, that man was born evil.

MULDER: No children?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (shaking her head) No. None.

MULDER: Mrs. Thibedeaux, our records show that you recuperated from your injuries within two months. But nine months later you checked back into the hospital.

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: Well, I ... I had complications.

MULDER: (stepping closer to her) What happened to the child? (pause) Cokely's child.

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (defensive) I gave the baby to an adoption agency. Baby! He'd be almost fifty now ... (Goes to her portrait on the wall and pulls a scrap of paper from behind it. Gives the paper to MULDER.) This is the address of the adoption agency. If you do find him ... no, never mind.



SCENE 16

(MULDER's motel room. Papers and sunflower seeds are scattered about.)

SCULLY: The bones BJ found under the house belong to Chaney's partner, Agent Ledbetter. Cokely rented the house in 1942. The detectives at the crime scene found an old straight razor under the house, they're trying to lift some prints. And Cokely's been released, but I think we have enough to nail him.

MULDER: (shaking his head) Something just doesn't track, Scully. The night she was attacked, BJ said she saw a younger man.

SCULLY: Yeah, but you know the state of mind she was in that night. She, she could have been mistaken.

MULDER: No, maybe she did see a younger man -- young Cokely. Cokely's grandson.

SCULLY: Are you saying Cokely's grandson attacked BJ?

MULDER: It would make sense, Scully. Genetic traits often skip a generation. And that would explain the test results of the blood found under Verna Johnson's fingernails. PGM subtypes are similar among relatives. Did Danny call back with the adoption records yet? Did you get 'em?

SCULLY: (dialing a phone number) I don't think Mendel had serial killers in mind when he developed his theory on genetics.

MULDER: When I was a, a kid, I would have nightmares. I would wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I was the only person left in the world. Then I would hear this. (Crunches loudly on a sunflower seed.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: My dad would be in the study eating these.

SCULLY: (on the phone) Yeah, Danny Valladeo, it's Agent Scully. (to MULDER) What does that have to do with Cokely?

MULDER: Well, on a basic cellular level, we're the sum total of all our ancestors' biological matter. But what if more than biological traits get passed down from generation to generation? What if I like sunflower seeds because I'm genetically predisposed to liking them?

SCULLY: But children aren't born liking sunflower seeds. Environments shape them; behavior patterns are taught.

MULDER: There are countless stories of twins separated at birth who end up in the same occupation, marrying the same kind of people, each naming their child Waldo.

SCULLY: Waldo?

MULDER: Jung wrote about it when he talked about the collective unconscious. It's genetic memory, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, Danny. (pause as she listens, then shock spreads across her face) Yeah, thanks, I'll tell him. (hangs up the phone) Danny tracked down Mrs. Thibedeaux's son. He was a policeman named Raymond Morrow.

MULDER: That's BJ's father.

SCULLY: BJ is Cokely's granddaughter.

MULDER: She's responsible for the murders.

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Get your coat. Let's go.

(MULDER grabs his coat and walks out. SCULLY follows.)

SCULLY: Wait, Mulder. Do you honestly think that BJ is capable of murder?

MULDER: No, but Cokely is, and that's who BJ has become.

SCULLY: That's outrageous!

MULDER: Scully, this is what I think. I think that Cokely's memories, his compulsions have been passed on genetically to his granddaughter BJ. That's what's driving her to kill.

SCULLY: So you're saying that BJ's nightmares are real? That, that she's out there killing these women and carving "SISTER" on them?

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: Well then how do you explain the cuts on her own chest?

MULDER: I can't explain everything. Maybe she carved them on herself, or maybe it's some kind of weird stigmata. Whatever it is, BJ is not herself.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

MULDER: We have to warn Mrs. Thibedeaux. If BJ has, in the sense that I'm talking about, become Cokely, then she might be trying to finish what Cokely started.



SCENE 17

(MRS. THIBEDEAUX's house. In the kitchen, MRS. THIBEDEAUX, wearing an apron, closes the oven which she has just finished cleaning. She picks up a bucket and a bottle of ammonia and carries them into the adjoining utility room. Back in the kitchen, a gloved hand picks up the clothes iron, which was sitting on the ironing board. In the utility room, MRS. THIBEDEAUX is folding the apron. She hears a sound and turns around to see BJ rushing to attack her with the iron. MRS. THIBEDEAUX throws the ammonia in BJ's face. BJ claws at her face. Now her face is blistered like COKELY's. MRS. THIBEDEAUX has escaped into another room, where she opens a drawer and pulls out a revolver. BJ approaches her, but stops a few feet away as MRS. THIBEDEAUX aims the gun at BJ.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: Stop it!

BJ: (in a hoarse, deeper voice) Somebody's gotta take the blame, little sister ...

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (shaking the gun) No, no, no. You're not him! You can't be!

(BJ continues advancing slowly toward MRS. THIBEDEAUX, who backs away slowly.)

BJ: ... and it's not gonna be me.

(As MRS. THIBEDEAUX backs up toward the stairs, BJ raises a straight razor in her right hand.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: I'm not afraid to use this!

(They keep backing up the stairs, eyes locked. MRS. THIBEDEAUX is on the landing where she was attacked 50 years ago.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: You have his eyes! You're ... him!

(As BJ passes the pictures on the wall, she sees the picture of MRS. THIBEDEAUX and her husband at the World's Fair. She stares at it.)

BJ: No ...

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: You're my grandchild. (Lowers the hand holding the gun.)

(It takes a few seconds for this to sink in. Then BJ snarls and continues up the stairs, brandishing the razor.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (hysterically) Do you know what you're doing?!

BJ: Shut up!

(BJ reaches MRS. THIBEDEAUX and rips open her shirt, revealing the scar of "SISTER". BJ then opens her own shirt and looks at the "SISTER" carved there. MRS. THIBEDEAUX has dropped the gun.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: He's done this to both of us.

(BJ looks for a moment as if she might give in and return to normal, but the COKELY urge gains control and she raises the razor again.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: No! You don't know what you're doing! He's the one to blame!

(MRS. THIBEDEAUX falls to the floor, turning her head away from BJ. The razor glints in the light. As it begins to fall, we hear MRS. THIBEDEAUX scream.)

(The agents' SUV screeches to a halt in front of MRS. THIBEDEAUX's house. MULDER opens the door and walks in, looking around.)

MULDER: Mrs. Thibedeaux? Mrs. Thibedeaux!

(SCULLY comes in and sees her.)

SCULLY: Mulder. (She rushes up the stairs to the landing, where MRS. THIBEDEAUX is slumped against the wall, holding a hand over her chest. She appears unhurt.) Mrs. Thibedeaux. What happened?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: She had a razor. She tried to kill me. But something stopped her.

MULDER: Where did she go?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: I don't know.

(MULDER goes down the stairs and picks up the phone, dials 911. SCULLY helps MRS. THIBEDEAUX to her feet.)

SCULLY: Can you stand?

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: Yes, I think so.

SCULLY: Let me help you up the steps.

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: Thank you.

MULDER: (on the phone) This is Agent Mulder, I need an ambulance to 238 North 54th Street. I also need an APB on BJ Morrow. Yes, that's Detective Morrow. She should be considered armed and dangerous.

SCULLY: BJ's going after Tillman. The first murder occurred after BJ found out she was pregnant. She's looking for someone to blame. I think that's Tillman.

MULDER: (dialing another number) I don't think so, Scully. I think if she's gonna go after anyone, it'll be Cokely.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: She's probably figured out by now that Cokely's her grandfather. If she's looking for someone to blame, it'll be him. Cokely's not answering his phone. I'm going over there. (He hangs up and walks out of the house, leaving SCULLY to take care of MRS. THIBEDEAUX.)



SCENE 18
POLICE HEADQUARTERS
AUBREY, MISSOURI

(Inside, MRS. THIBEDEAUX is evidently giving a statement.)

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: She had a razor.

(TILLMAN rushes into the room.)

TILLMAN: Agent Scully, I gotta talk to you.

SCULLY: I'm giving a statement.

TILLMAN: You've accused BJ of murder?!

SCULLY: Can we talk about this outside?

TILLMAN: No! Here! Now!

SCULLY: Have you seen Detective Morrow?

TILLMAN: No, I have not. But I don't care what you've accused her of, Detective Morrow could not hurt anybody!

SCULLY: (gesturing to MRS. THIBEDEAUX) Detective Morrow broke into this woman's house and attacked her with a razor.

TILLMAN: Oh, come on! I do not believe that!

MRS. THIBEDEAUX: (grimly) It's true. It happened.



SCENE 19

(COKELY's living room. An old B&W movie is playing on the TV. I'm not a fan of classic movies, but I'm sure the actors are famous. They look familiar.)

MAN ON TV: Look, Hildie, I only acted like any husband who didn't want to see his home broken up.

WOMAN ON TV: What home?

MAN ON TV: What home? Don't you remember the home I promised you?

(COKELY walks into the room and glances at the TV.)

WOMAN ON TV: Sure I do, that was the one we were going to have right after the honeymoon. (laughs sarcastically) Yeah, honeymoon.

(COKELY sits down in his armchair.)

MAN ON TV: Well, was it my fault now that that coal mine was gonna have another cave-in? I intended to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildie, honest I did.

(TV sound fades. Cokely adjusts himself in his chair, grunting. He starts to put his oxygen tube around his head, but discovers that the tube has been cut. He hears a creak and the sound of a closing door. He looks up and around suspiciously and places the useless tube on the end table next to him. He picks up the remote control and switches off the TV. Leaning forward in the chair, he continues to scan his surroundings. In the other room, he spots the shadow of a figure. He gets to his feet, flicking open a straight razor in his right hand.)

COKELY: Who's there?

(Holding the straight razor by his side, he walks slowly into the other room. Outside, MULDER pulls up in his SUV and gets out.)

MULDER: (running toward the house) Cokely?

(Inside, COKELY is searching the house.)

COKELY: Who's there?

(COKELY turns the corner into a room and sees BJ in the shadows. BJ points the razor directly at him and starts advancing toward him.)

COKELY: No ...

BJ: (in a deep hoarse voice, waving the razor) How does it feel to be on the other side of the razor, brother? (She slashes at him, but misses. He cringes backward.)

COKELY: Shut up!

(BJ slashes him again, this time slicing him in the chest. Outside, MULDER is running around a corner of the house, drawing his weapon. In the background, we see the old 1940's truck from BJ's dream. It is in mint condition.)

COKELY: (eyes wide with fright, cowering) No! No! Please ... no!

BJ: (holding the bloody razor over him) You know the rules. This doesn't stop 'til you're dead. (She slashes again as COKELY screams.)

(MULDER has entered the house and is walking around with his weapon drawn and in a ready position.)

MULDER: Cokely! Cokely? (hears moaning, finds COKELY slumped on the floor, wheezing and bleeding. Behind him, he hears BJ charging at him with a roar. She knocks him right in the head with the oxygen tank. Ouch! MULDER falls on the floor, groaning. Quickly BJ stands over MULDER, straddling him and holding the razor over his head. MULDER tries feebly to slide away.)

MULDER: No, don't. BJ.

(In BJ's mind, MULDER has changed into CHANEY. She leans down over him.)

CHANEY with MULDER'S VOICE: Don't. Don't! No!

(BJ slashes down with the razor, but stops just short of slashing MULDER's throat.)

BJ: (in a deep hoarse voice) This time you'll stay dead.

(MULDER winces at the blade against his neck.)

SCULLY: Freeze! (Audibly she cocks her weapon; she's got BJ covered.)

TILLMAN: (also aiming his gun at BJ) BJ, what are you doing?!

(BJ looks up at them, then down at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Let him go. Let him go, BJ.

BJ: (in the deep voice) I'm not BJ.

MULDER: Yes, you are.

(BJ slides the blade against MULDER's throat, drawing blood. SCULLY tenses her finger on the trigger. In the corner, COKELY wheezes, draws his last breath, and expires. SCULLY goes to him and checks his carotid pulse with left hand, still covering BJ with her gun in her right hand.)

SCULLY: He's dead.

(BJ seems to deflate at the news. She withdraws the blade from MULDER's neck and sits down next to him weakly, moaning quietly. TILLMAN walks over and helps her up.)

TILLMAN: Come on.

(SCULLY goes to MULDER and raises him up from the floor. TILLMAN has seated BJ in a chair and is touching her face and her arms reassuringly.)

TILLMAN: It's all right, BJ. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be okay. (He looks at SCULLY in desperation.)

(SCULLY cradles MULDER's head protectively.)

(SCULLY is typing her report on the computer.)

SCULLY: (v/o) We are continuing with genetic testing on Detective Morrow. Evidence suggests the presence of a mutator gene that has activated previously dormant genes, but the results so far are inconclusive.



SCENE 20
SHAMROCK WOMEN'S PRISON
PSYCHIATRIC WARD, HIGH SECURITY

(We are advancing along a long, grim prison corridor. SCULLY's voice-over continues.)

SCULLY: (v/o) Detective Morrow has not demonstrated any further physiological changes. Extensive blood work and psychological testing has been conducted in order to determine whether the pregnancy could have been a catalyst for the transformation. We have yet to determine the effects on the fetus.

(In BJ's room. She is leaning against the corner on her cot wearing prison orange. She is very pregnant.)

SCULLY: (v/o) Amniocentesis results show no genetic abnormalities. Chromosome testing has determined the child's sex to be male. BJ is on her second week of suicide watch after an unsuccessful attempt to abort her son. Lieutenant Tillman has petitioned to adopt the child, and the case will soon be presented to the courts.

(BJ's hand slowly rubs her pregnant belly.)

[THE END]
                                          IRRESISTABLE



SCENE 1
JANELLI-HELLER FUNERAL HOME
A teenage girl stands at a pulpit, delivering a difficult eulogy.

YOUNG WOMAN: ...I think we all feel an empty place not just in our hearts but in our lives. Everybody loved Jennifer, not just because she was a special person...but because she was the kind of friend who was always there for you. We'll all miss you, Jennifer. We'll miss your smile...we'll miss your laugh and your sense of humor. We'll miss the time we could have spent together. We'll keep those memories close to our hearts until we meet again in God's kingdom.

Mourners filing past the coffin.

Move to Donnie Pfaster, an employee of the funeral home, standing near a door to the side of the pulpit. His eyes betray a fire of fascination. This look evaporates when Jackson Toews, his supervisor, enters near Donnie.

TOEWS (quietly): The family has requested a graveside service now. I've rescheduled the burial to tomorrow afternoon. We'll keep the body overnight.

The mourners have left by now. Donnie's approaching the coffin, looking at the girl.

DONNIE (sincerely): Such a beautiful girl.

Donnie strokes the girl's hair lovingly, then closes the lid.

CUT TO:
The funeral hall, at night. Jackson Toews enters a dark room, looking for something. He hears noise, turns, staring into the darkness.

TOEWS: Hello?

The room is still. A sound of a coffin being closed.

TOEWS (he's really spooked now): who's there?

A shadowy form is drifting through the coffins.

TOEWS: I said, who's there?

The form is a silhouette of a gargoyle-like, demonic creature. Toews turns in terror, finds the light switch, flips it on. He's turning to see:

TOEWS (surprised): Donnie? What the hell are you doing here this late?

DONNIE: Working.

TOEWS (noticing a pair of scissor in Donnie's hand): Working? at this hour? (noticing a trail of blonde hair clippings scattered on the concrete): What the hell were you doing? (opening the coffin, to find the dead girl's hair has been cut off): Get out of here, you freak! Get out of here, and don't come back!

Donnie turns and walks away, a demonic smile on his face.

SCENE 2
GRAVEYARD
Mulder, Scully and special agent Moe Bocks are walking towards a gravesite.

BOCKS: ...I got the call from Minneapolis PD, saying they wanted the FBI to come out and have a look. Anything slightly freakazoid, that's the drill: call Moe Bocks. As if I'm tight with all the nut cases in town. So I shoot on down here to see what's-the-what and I'll be damned if I'm not knocked on my butt by what they show me. Twenty two years, I've never seen anything like it. I get one look at the corpse and I'm on the phone to my pal Andi Schnider down at the Mutual UFO Network. You know Andi?

MULDER: No.

BOCKS: Well, he knows you.

MULDER: Why'd you call Mufon?

BOCKS: I wanted to see if there'd been much UFO activity in the area.

MULDER: You think this grave was unearthed by aliens, Agent Bocks?

BOCKS: It has all the telltale markings, don't you think? I mean, according to the literature.

MULDER: The literature?

BOCKS: Y'know. The way the hair and nails have been cut away. Sort of like they do in cattle mutilations.

Scully is clearly disturbed by the sight of the body.

MULDER: I hate to disappoint you, Agent Bocks, but this doesn't look like the work of aliens to me.

BOCKS (disappointed): No? How can you be sure?

MULDER: I've seen this kind of thing before. When I was with the Violent Crime Section. Whoever dug this up probably used a backhoe. If you took casts of the ground in the area, you'd probably lift some clean new tracks off the garage around here somewhere.

BOCKS: You think?

MULDER: He may work here, but it's not likely. Though he's probably worked at a cemetery or a mortuary at one time or another. Probably been busted before, but you're not going to find any record of it. Not real good for business when these stories get around.

BOCKS (to be sure): You're saying some human's been doing this?

MULDER: If you want to call him that.

BOCKS (embarrassed): Well, don't I feel like a dumb butt.

Scully ventures one last look into the grave, the image giving her a cold shudder. Mulder & Scully move back to their car, Bocks stays behind.

MULDER: You okay, Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah... I've read about cases of desecrating the dead, but this is the first time I've seen one.

MULDER: Nothing can prepare you for it. It's almost impossible to imagine.

SCULLY: Why do they do it?

MULDER: Some people collect salt and pepper shakers. The fetishist collects dead things. Hair, fingernails... no one quite knows why. though I've never quite understood salt and pepper shakers myself.

SCULLY (looks curiously at Mulder): Sometimes you surprise me, Mulder.

MULDER: Why?
(opens car door for Scully, then goes around the car to get in)

SCULLY: How that didn't shock you back there.

MULDER: I've prepared myself for it before we left Washington.

SCULLY (gives him a look, they are in the car now): You knew it wasn't UFO related from the start?

MULDER: I had suspected as much.

SCULLY: Mulder, we flew three hours to get here. Our plane doesn't leave until tomorrow night. If you suspected, why -

MULDER (pulls two tickets from his pocket): Vikings versus Redskins, in the Metrodome. Forty yard line, Scully. You and me.



SCENE 3
FICICELLO FAMILY FROZEN FOODS.
Marilyn sits behind a desk, interviewing Donnie Pfaster.

MARILYN: Have you lived in the Twin Cities area long, Mr. Pfaster?

DONNIE: I grew up here. I was away for a few years.

MARILYN: What kind of work were you in before?

DONNIE: Cosmotology. Hair and makeup.

MARILYN: Oh, that's interesting.

DONNIE: If you don't mind my saying, that's a lovely color lipstick you're wearing. Is that Indian Summer?

MARILYN (flattered): Yes. Yes, it is. You're applying for a job as a deliveryman -

DONNIE: To put myself through school. I've gone back to school.
Marilyn (smiles, writing this down): What are you studying?

DONNIE: Comperative religions.

MARILYN: Oh. Are you religious yourself?

DONNIE: Yes. Very.

MARILYN (smiles, leaning forward): I'm probably not supposed to say this, but Mr. Ficicello feels very strongly about religious backgrounds. He prides himself on the honesty of his employees.

DONNIE: Can you put that on the application?

MARILYN: I'll attach a little note. (winks)

DONNIE: Thank you.



SCENE 4
Agent Bocks is sitting in his office, watching the Vikings vs. Redskins game. Scully & Mulder enter. Bocks turns the TV sound down.

BOCKS: I was glad I could catch you before you left.
Mulder (stares longingly at the mute screen)

BOCKS (hands to Scully a file folder): We found more bodies dug up.

SCULLY: Did you get your forensics report on this one?

BOCKS (nodding): Somebody was down there in the grave alright. Cut the hair with a pair of pinking shears. Gotta wonder about this guy.

MULDER: How many bodies does this make?

BOCKS: Three in the last two days.

MULDER: What else can you tell me about the analysis of the corpses?

BOCKS: The hair was cut from the heads of two of the bodies. From the third one, the fingernails were pulled out with what looks like a pair of needlenose pliers.
Scully (looking at photos in the file, and sees herself as one of the victims! A wave of nausea comes over her. She lays the file on the desk and leaves the room. Mulder noting this)

MULDER: Alright, I want you to draft an eyes-only memo to everyone in this office, and to all law enforcement agencies in the metropolitan area.

BOCKS: Saying what?

MULDER: That the Twin Cities have an escalating fetishist on their hands.

BOCKS: A what?

MULDER: An escalating fetishist. Security should be tightened around the city cemeteries. Mortuaries, funeral homes and hospitals should be notified. There should be warning of a possible stalker in the area.

BOCKS (hesitating): This isn't New-York, Agent Mulder. People still leave their doors unlocked here. This is going to scare them.

MULDER: You can leave out the more gruesome aspects in your press release.

BOCKS: Why do you want to alarm folks anyway? I mean, if this guy only preys on dead people...

MULDER: His compulsion is growing. He may resort to homicide to procure his corpses. Once he gets a taste of a warm body, he's probably going to want more.

BOCKS (shaking his head): Maybe I've been isolated up here in the great white north too long.

MULDER: How's that?

BOCKS: People wondered why it took them so long to catch that kid in Milwaukee. Thought someone would have noticed he was killing those young boys. Truth is, no one ever believed it could happen.

MULDER: If you catch this guy before he kills, maybe they can go right on believing that.

BOCKS: I'm afraid we don't have the manpower or expertise to move on this with any speed. Going to be hard to round anybody up on a Saturday. Could be Monday or Tuesday before we get our ducks in a row.

Outside of the office, Scully sits alone, with a disturbed look on her face. She's startled when Mulder leans out the door, but she's not looking at him.

MULDER: I'm going to cancel our flight. We've got some work to do here.
Scully (stares forward, still not looking at him)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: I'll be right with you.
(Mulder ducks back, while Scully remains there, shaken).



SCENE 5
AGENT BOCKS' OFFICE.
On a computer screen, there's information regarding all sorts of murderers and maniacs, accompanied by photos of them.

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: A complete model or psychological profile of the death fetishist does not exist. Extrapolating from material on file at the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, the compulsion is the result of a complex misplacement of values and a deviation from cultural norms and societal mores - often accompanied by extreme alienation from normal social interaction and traditional avenues for interaction with others. He is more likely to be white, male and of average to above average intelligence. Cases of fetishists with IQs over 150 have been documented. The progression of the pathology can be traced from the fantasy stage to the eventual acting out of fetishistic impulses, including opportunistic homicide. Agent Mulder believes strongly that the suspect in this case is escalating toward this action. It is my opinion from reading these case files that death fetishism may play a stronger role than suspected in cases of serial murder. That once he begins to murder, it is the killing that draws attention away from a deeper motive. A motive which most people, including law enforcement professionals, dare not imagine. It is somehow easier to believe, as Agent Bocks does, in aliens and UFOs, than in the kind of cold blooded inhuman monster who could prey on the living to scavenge from the dead.



SCENE 6
Donnie Pfaster. Cruising in his car, down a street lined with working girls. He stops near 2 hookers, one of them (Satin) bends down, leaning on the car.

SATIN: Hi.

DONNIE: Hi.

SATIN: Are you looking for a date?

DONNIE: Yes.

SATIN: Do you want to pull around the corner over there.

DONNIE: I'm interested in a couple of hours.

SATIN (smiling): Where do you have in mind?



SCENE 7
DONNIE'S APARTMENT.
Donnie and Satin enter. Normal apartment.

SATIN (hugging herself): Don't you have any heat in here? It's freezing.

DONNIE: The forced air unit is broken. I'd like to run you a bath. (heads towards the bathroom)

Donnie's bathroom. Little bottles with shampoos and soaps neatly placed on the side of the tub. The water is running, Donnie's adding bubble bath into the water. Satin enters.

DONNIE: Is your hair treated?

SATIN: What?

DONNIE: Do you need a shampoo for chemically treated heir?

SATIN: You want me to shampoo my hair?

DONNIE: I'm happy to pay extra, if that's something out of the ordinary.
Satin (looks at him, then reaches down to take off her high-heeled shoes. Her fingernails are long and painted bright red): Nobody's ever asked me.

Phone rings from another part of the house.

Donnie (starts to walk out of the bathroom): Excuse me.

Donnie's bedroom, he's answering the phone.

DONNIE: Hello.

MARILYN: Is this Mr. Pfaster?

DONNIE: Yes.

MARILYN: Hi, this is Marilyn at Ficicello Frozen Foods. Sorry to bother you so late, but I'm calling to say you've been hired, Mr. Pfaster. We'd like you to start right away.

SATIN (coming down the hallway): Hey, what's going on here? The water's ice cold. (entering the bedroom, with only a towel wrapped around her. Her expression changes to one of terror): Oh God...

Donnie's bedroom is full of funeral sprays, most of them are wilting. He looks calmly at Satin.

MARILYN (on the phone): Mr. Pfaster...?

DONNIE: Yes. That's wonderful news. Thank you so much.
(hangs up the phone, looking at Satin, as she backs away into the hallway)

SATIN: Don't you come near me! Get away from me!

Donnie's getting up, moving towards her.



SCENE 8
An alley. Night. Police cars are all around, there's a body covered with blue satin sheets.

BOCKS: We're still waiting for someone to ID the body.
(approaching with Mulder & Scully)
Judging from this area, I'd say she was probably a working girl.

The prostitute, that was standing with Satin when Donnie picked her up, is approaching, seeing the body, becoming hysterical.

PROSTITUTE: Oh my God! Oh my God! Who did this to her? Who did this?
(she's being pulled away)

MULDER: Was it him?

BOCKS: It looks like it. Knife wound the length of her torso. All her hair was cut off. He took her fingernails. But this time, he took some fingers, too. Do you want to see the body?
Mulder (starts moving towards the body, Scully doesn't follow. He looks back at her)

SCULLY: I need a minute.



SCENE 9
NICE NEIGHBOURHOOD
DAYTIME.
Donnie Pfaster, with his delivery man uniform walks out of a delivery vehicle, with a frozen food container. He walks up to one of the houses, and knocks the door. A woman answers.

DONNIE: Hi. I'm your new delivery man.

ELLEN: Oh, hi. Come in.

They both enter the kitchen. Donnie starts placing the food in the freezer, while Ellen is spooning out cookie batter onto metal cookie sheets.

ELLEN: Did they give you Skip's old route?

DONNIE: Yes, ma'am. I think so. I just started with the company.

ELLEN: Skip had been delivering to us for so long, we almost took it for granted he'd always be around. Since before the kids were born.

Lisa, Ellen's daughter enters the kitchen.

ELLEN: Lisa, this is...

DONNIE: Donnie. Donnie Pfaster.

LISA: Oh, hi. (to her Mom): I'm going to Steve's, Mom.

ELLEN: Okay. You have a good time.

LISA (to Donnie): Bye.

DONNIE: Bye. (stares at her leaving)

ELLEN (to Donnie, after Lisa leaves): We have three daughters.

DONNIE: Oh. (smiles politely, as he closes the freezer door): Pardon me, but can I use your washroom to wash my hands?

ELLEN: Oh, sure. There's a washroom down off the service porch.

BATHROOM
Donnie, thoroughly washing his hands. He dries them, and looks down at a waste-basket. He reaches down, picks it up, and puts his hand inside. He retrieves a hairball, looks at it lovingly, and brings it to his face to feel its texture. He, then, puts it in his pocket, and puts the waste-basket back down. He turns around to exit, and when he opens the door, he finds himself face to face with Ellen.

ELLEN: I just wanted to tell you, if we're ever not home, we always leave the back door open here.

DONNIE: Oh, Okay. I'll remember that.



SCENE 10
COUNTY MORGUE.
A group of men (doctors and medical examiners). they stand around the body of the satin sheet covered dead hooker on the autopsy table. Scully walks in, to perform the autopsy, all men silently make room for her.

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: Death is a recorded event. For reasons natural or unnatural, when a body ceases to function, the cause of the effect can be clearly reconstructed. A body has a story to tell.

She pulls the satin sheet back, and turns on the microphone above the autopsy table.

SCULLY: The time is eleven fourteen AM, Monday, November 14th. The deceased is a female in her twenties... (her voice fades)

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: If the victim was strangled, an examination of the veins in the eyes will reveal this. If the victim was shot, entry wounds and gunpowder residue can be used to reconstruct the events leading to death and help to establish a possible motive. Body temperature, preferably the temperature of the spleen, is an accurate indicator of the time of death. As are rigor, livor and levels of sodium in the blood. If the body was moved, sand, small rocks, vegetable debris, even pollen can be removed and analysed to determine the location of the original crime scene and place the position of the body at the time of death. Extracutenous stains and residues can indicate the use of poison or toxins. Hair and fibres, slivers of glass, plastic, even insect casings can serve to recreate the circumstances under which death occurred.

Scully is now seated at Agent Bocks' computer, the heard words are written on the screen by her.

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: It may be an irony only understood by those of us who conduct these examinations, who use these pieces to rebuild a narrative, that death, like life itself, is a drama with a beginning, middle and end.
It is my opinion, having conducted this examination, that the victim died a wrongful death for the express purpose of extracting her hair and fingernails.

We keep hearing Scully's voice over, but now we see Mulder reading a document from Scully's computer.

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: The time of death cannot be accurately determined due to what I believe must have been immersion in a cold environment, most likely water. Death came as a result of blood loss and trauma from a deep knife wound which severed the plimonary artery. Of the evidence examined, no one piece or combination gives a clear picture of the killer, other than the motive implied by the bizarre nature if the crime. For the record, it is also my opinion that, outside of child homicide, which may be more tragic and heinous, this is one of the most angry and dehumanizing murders imaginable.

Mulder looks up from the page, he's now in a lineup observation room.
He stands with Agent Bocks, and the 2nd prostitute.

BOCKS (to prostitute): Look at each man carefully.
Prostitute (shakes her head): He was ordinary. He didn't look like no freak.

BOCKS: Do you remember what kind of car he was driving? What color it was?

PROSTITUTE: I think it was white.

BOCKS: Okay, you can go. Just leave a number and address where you can be reached.

PROSTITUTE: Are you gonna catch this guy?
Bocks (unconvincing): We'll catch him.

MULDER: Might be a nice week to take that paid vacation the boss owes you.

PROSTITUTE: Yeah. Right. (leaves the room)
Bocks (to Mulder): If this guy looks regular-like, and if he doesn't have a record, he's gonna be near impossible to find.

MULDER: Until he kills again. Or until we can determine what's driving him.

BOCKS: I read your profile. Sounds like a guy who can't make it with women. Which would explain the hooker.

MULDER: The hooker was just convenient. This guy's not after sex. He's after trophies. His victim was a young attractive woman. The corpses he dug up were those of young women. Yet there's no evidence of any sexual activity. What fuels his need? What us important about the hair and fingernails to him? It's as if it's not enough that they're dead. He has to defile them. There's a deeper psychosis at work here. And anger toward women, possibly his mother.

BOCKS: I'd say she'd be pretty fried at him, too.

MULDER: The next thing to do is call all the psychiatric facilities. See if they have any record of patients with similar pathologies. This kind of killer isn't made over night. He's been fuelling this fetish for years.



SCENE 11
A CLASSROOM
NIGHT

TEACHER: ...the necessity of the story, the myth or the legend in a culture is almost universal. We think of myths as things that entertain or instruct, but their deeper purpose is often to explain, or make fanciful, wishes, desires or behavior that society would otherwise deem unacceptable. Myths often disguise thoughts that are simply too terrible to think about, but because they are conveyed in a wrapping of untruth - the story - these thoughts become harmless fiction.

Donnie is seated in the back of the classroom. He stares at a pretty short-haired blonde coed in the front row. she touches her neck, her fingernails are filed, long and colored. The teacher continues.

TEACHER: Take for example stories that we recite for children, such as Snow white or Alice in Wonderland. The subtextural themes where the Queen orders "off with her head", or the prince wakens Sleeping Beauty with a kiss, are what Freud would describe as death/wish imagining.



SCENE 12
PARKING LOT
The pretty coed is walking to her car, and opens the door. Donnie appears on the other side of the car and surprises her.

DONNIE: Excuse me. I'm in your mythology class.

COED: Oh.

DONNIE: My name's Donnie. I sit a couple rows over. Maybe you've seen me.

COED: I-I don't know. I -

DONNIE: I know. You sit up front. I just... (moving to her side of the car) I was going to my car, and I saw you, and... did he ask us to read chapters ten and eleven, or eleven and twelve?

COED: Oh, I think it was... (reaches into her bag, to check in her notebook) It was chapters ten and eleven.

DONNIE: Oh, thanks.
Coed (puts the notebook back in her bag, in the meantime, Donnie's got closer to her, and has her penned in the tight V made by the open door) I have to go now. (tries to pull the car door from Donnie's grasp, and fails)

DONNIE: Don't go.

COED (angrily): Let go of the door!
(Donnie takes a step closer, and she knees him in the groin, followed by a punch, which sends him to the floor)
(screaming) HELP!!! SOMEBODY!!!



SCENE 13
COUNTY MORGUE.
The body is lying on the autopsy table, covered with a satin sheet. Agent Scully walks in, wearing her autopsy uniform, and moves to the body. She removes the sheet from the body, and with a horror expression on her face, she sees...
Herself! lying on the autopsy table.
From the dead Scully's point of view, we see the demonic figure from the beginning, where the examining Scully stood before. Phone begins ringing.

MOTEL ROOM
Scully's bolting upright in bed, waking from a nightmare.
She answers the ringing phone.

SCULLY: Hello.

MULDER: Scully, it's me. They've arrested somebody they think may be our guy.
Scully (still under shock): I'll get dressed.



SCENE 14
JAIL BLOCK
NIGHT
Scully, Mulder and Bocks walk down the jail corridor, heading towards a cell.

BOCKS: He's got a history of assault. A 911 call came in from a security officer who saw it happen.
She hurt him really bad.

They arrive the cell, look inside. The man inside is not Donnie. He has a knife wound across his cheek and nose.

MULDER: Who cut him?

BOCKS: A working girl. They're all carrying knives since what happened.

They enter the cell. Behind them, in another cell, Donnie is standing, his face pokes out of the bars. He's staring at Scully with the same look we've seen before. After a while, the agents leave the other man's cell, and move a few steps from the bars.

MULDER: He's not our guy.

BOCKS: I thought we had him.

They start leaving, as Donnie keeps staring at Scully.
She turns around, feeling his look. She looks at him, then turns away, shaken. They all reach the door.

SCULLY: Mulder, can I have a minute with you?

MULDER: Yeah.
Scully (looks at Bocks, she wants to talk to Mulder alone)

BOCKS (gets the message): I'll be out front. (exits)

SCULLY: I think I might better drive this investigation if I focused on the evidence.

MULDER: What are you suggesting?

SCULLY: That I take the body back to Washington. I'd like to run it through the fingerprint lab there. You know those guys, they can pull a print -

MULDER: If you're having trouble with this case, Scully, I want you to tell me.

SCULLY: I'm not having trouble, Mulder.

MULDER: I'd understand, Scully. This isn't exactly easy to stomach.

SCULLY: I'm fine with it. Really. I just think we're a long way from catching this guy. If we could get a print, we'd have something to go on. Right now we're at a standstill.

MULDER (knowing she's hiding something): I think it's a good idea. (puts his hand on her shoulder): I just don't want you to think you have to hide anything from me, Scully. I've seen agents with twenty years in the field fall apart on cases like this.
Scully (quietly): I'm fine, Mulder. I can handle it.
(gently, she pulls away from his touch, and they both leave)

DONNIE (to the guy in the cell next to him, whom the agents were talking to): Hey, what's your name?

SUSPECT: You talking to me?

DONNIE: Yeah. Were those FBI agents?

SUSPECT: Yeah.

DONNIE: What were they asking you?

SUSPECT: They thought I was some freak who's been digging up corpses. Man, I'm in enough trouble already.

DONNIE: What were their names?

SUSPECT: Who?

DONNIE: The younger agents.

SUSPECT: Um. I don't remember his name, but she was Scully, like that baseball announcer.

A jailor approaches, and opens Donnie's cell.

JAILOR: Let's go. Mr. Pfaster.

DONNIE: Go where?

JAILOR: Lady's dropped the charges against you. They're letting you out soon as you talk to psychiatric social worker.



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS LAB.

Examiner (studying a piece of satin through magnification eyeglasses): At first glance, there's not much to work with. Satin doesn't hold a print real well. There could be a latent somewhere in these blood stains, but I suspect the killer used gloves.

SCULLY: The body was shipped on my flight. I should be here within the hour.

EXAMINER: We'll take a look. How long are you in town, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I've got a flight back to Minneapolis booked for tonight. But I might cancel.

EXAMINER: I've put all other work aside.
Scully (nods and exits)



SCENE 16
FBI HEADQUARTERS.
Scully is walking down a hallway. She reaches a door marked:
"Employee Assistance Program, K. Kosseff L.C.S.W.". Scully looks around to see no one's looking, then enters. Scully's seated across Karen Kosseff, struggling with her emotions.

SCULLY: You think you find a way to deal with these things. In med school, you develop a clinical detachment to death. In your FBI training, you are confronted with cases, the most terrible and violent cases. You think you can look into the face of pure evil. And then you find yourself paralysed by it.

KOSSEFF: Are you aware you've been talking about yourself in the second person?

SCULLY: No. Was I?

KOSSEFF: Do you know why?

SCULLY: Probably as another way of trying to detach myself from it.

KOSSEFF: You're a strong person. You've probably always felt you can handle any problem yourself. But you feel vulnerable now. Do you know why that is?

SCULLY: No.

KOSSEFF: Is it your partner? Is there a problem with trust -
Scully (firmly): No. I trust him as much as anyone. I'd trust him with my life.

KOSSEFF: Can you talk to him about the way you're feeling?

SCULLY: No. (pauses) I know it sounds crazy, but I don't want him to know how much this is bothering me. I don't want him to think he has to protect me.

KOSSEFF: I know you lost your father last year. And I read in your file that you were very ill recently. That your life was threatened. Exposures like these can leave you extremely vulnerable.

SCULLY (tears well up in her eyes, but she's not crying): I know these things. I'm conscious of them. I know the world is full of predators, just as it has always been. And I know it's my job to protect people from them. And I've counted on that fact to give me faith in my ability to do what I do...
I want that faith back... I need it back.



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
FINGERPRINTS ANALYSIS LAB

Scully enters.

EXAMINER: There you are. I've been looking for you.

SCULLY: I had a meeting.

EXAMINER: I've got good news.

SCULLY: What did you find?

EXAMINER: Well, as I suspected, there was nothing on the sheets. But we got something nice off the body. At first it didn't look like it. Nothing on the torso, the face, the arms, the hands. The guy cut her fingers off though, right? But not all of them. On her right hand, he left a thumb. (hands Scully a print of the fingerprint) I pulled this off the nail polish. There must have been a struggle before he killed her. Before he put the gloves on.

SCULLY (excited): I've got to call Agent Mulder. (goes to the phone)

EXAMINER: Oh. Somebody called for you.

SCULLY: Who?

EXAMINER: He said he was an Agent working out of Minneapolis. I told him you were out, but had a flight booked back tonight.
Scully (with a look of concern, as she dials): Was it Agent Mulder?

EXAMINER: I didn't recognize the print.

SCULLY: Did you tell him about the print?

EXAMINER: I haven't found it yet.

MULDER (on the phone): Mulder.

SCULLY: Hi, it's me. We got a print.

MULDER (to Bocks): Scully got a print.

BOCKS: Fantastic!
Scully (on the phone): I'm going to modem it out to you right away to see if you can run a match.

MULDER: Are you staying on there, Scully?

SCULLY: No. I'm coming back tonight.

MULDER: Look, Scully. I know this is a pretty horrific case -

SCULLY: I'm okay with it, Mulder. You can use my help.

MULDER: Always!
Scully (smiles faintly, then): Mulder? You or Agent Bocks didn't call here looking for me earlier, did you?

MULDER (to Bocks): Did you call for Agent Scully?
Bocks (shakes his head)

MULDER: No.
Scully (curious) Okay, I'll see you when I get there. (hangs up)



SCENE 18
DONNIE PFASTER'S APARTMENT.
The door is broken down by uniformed officers. The bedroom, just as before, flowers all over. No sheets on the bed. From out of the zippered end of one pillow, protrudes a stuffing of long human hair. Mulder and Bocks enter the apartment, Mulder walks into
the kitchen as Bocks is talking on his walkie-talkie.

BOCKS: The suspect does not appear to be at home. Let's put out an APB on Donald Addie Pfaster, age twenty eight -

One of the officers opens the freezer, showing something to Mulder.

Mulder (showing it to Bocks): Take a look.

BOCKS: Holy mother of God.

It's a box of frozen food, that contains brussel sprouts, and also some fingers, and a long fingernail, painted bright red.



SCENE 19
AIRPORT
NIGHT
Scully exits. She goes to a car rental company.
She exits the rental company, and approaches her rented car.
From another car nearby, a man is watching her. It's Donnie Pfaster.
Scully's in her car, driving. Behind her, a pair of bright headlights looms up behind her. The lights grow brighter and nearer, and Scully is taken totally by surprise, as her car is rammed from behind. She gets hold of the wheel, trying to correct the forced swerve, but her car is being rammed again.



SCENE 20
AGENT BOCKS' OFFICE
NIGHT

Mulder (worriedly checking his watch): She should have been here.

BOCKS: She was on the flight. And it arrived three hours ago.
An FBI Agent (entering): We found Agent Scully's car.



SCENE 21
A ROAD

(Scully's dented car lies on the side of the road.. Agents Bocks and Mulder pull up. Mulder jumps out and runs towards Scullys abandonned rental car. There's a white scratch on the car. He looks inside. The airbag is out, and is torn.)

MULDER: She was forced off the road, it looks like a white car... get one of your men to get a sample of this paint and get it on a plane to Washington... if you hurry we can get a make and model of the car by morning... we're gonna find her.

(Mulder walks off as Boggs watches him.)



SCENE 22
Donnie is in a dark house. He's going down a corridor, entering a bathroom. The bathtub is filling, we can guess the temperature of the water. There are little bottles of shampoos etc. on the side of the tub.
Donnie is again, walking in a corridor, entering a bedroom. He opens the closet door. Inside we see Scully, huddled in the corner. Her hands and feet are tied, her mouth gagged. Her face is bruised, her eyes are closed. She opens her eyes, and sees...
The demonic figure from her dream. Donnie's closing the door.



SCENE 23
BOCKS' OFFICE.

Bocks (on cellular phone): Nothing registered to Donald Pfaster? Right... right. Got it. (hangs up)
(to Mulder): The paint is called Ivory Bone. It's a two-step enamel used by three makers of late model mid-sized car. They estimate there may be about sixty thousand cars that fit this description in the metropolitan area.

MULDER (on his own cellular phone): Nothing? No one saw her leave the rental agency...? There was no attendant in the area...? (presses the 'end' button in frustration) (to Bocks): People videotape police beatings on dark streets. They see Elvis in three cities across America every day. But no one saw a pretty woman being run off the road in her rental car.

BOCKS: He could have taken her anywhere. How're we going to find her?

MULDER: We've got to go back to the beginning. As nasty as it seems, we've got to get into this guy's head. How he thinks. Where would he go?

BOCKS (shrugging): Anywhere but his mother's right?

MULDER: What do you mean?

BOCKS: Being that he's so pissed off at her. From what your profile says.

MULDER (interested): Where does his mother live?

BOCKS: I don't know.

MULDER: Let's find out.



SCENE 24
Donnie in that dark house, moving towards the closet and opens it.
Scully is in there, very frightened.



SCENE 25
BOCKS' OFFICE
Mulder and Bocks look at a computer screen.

BOCKS: The mother lives in Boca Raton, Florida. Correction. She used to live there. She died a year ago.

MULDER (disappointed): did she have a car registered to her?

BOCKS (checking): A late model white sedan.

MULDER (realizing): He inherited the car. Boca Raton could have been a winter house. Was there a residence here in Minneapolis?



SCENE 26
BEDROOM
Inside the closet.
Donnie's near Scully, he's inspecting her findernails.
He uses a sharp knife to cut the rope that binds her feet.

Scully (her mouth still gagged): Get the hell away from me!!
(to her terror, she sees Donnie's face, transforming, and becoming different men's faces. Those are the men she saw before, in the computer files she checked. The figures then changes to that demonic creature again, then back to Donnie)

DONNIE: Don't be afraid.

Donnie takes Scully, hands still tied, mouth still gagged.
He leads her to the bathroom, where the tub is filled with water and bubbles. Donnie walks around her in the bathroom, to check the shampoos.

DONNIE: Would you say your hair is normal or dry?
(he turns around, as Scully backs out towards the door)
Now where are you going?

Donnie moves towards Scully, grabs her, but she pushes him hard straight into the freezing water in the bathtub. Scully then rushes out of the bathroom. Donnie pulls himself, wet, from the tub, and starts chasing her. He walks out of the bathroom, and looks around. Scully has disappeared. He's moving around the house, looking for her. Scully reaches the front door. It's locked. She runs for a place to hide.

DONNIE: There's no way out, girly girl. (enters a bedroom, and retrieves a gun from the dresser) I know this house, girly girl. There's nowhere to hide.

He then hears a noise from one of the rooms, and rushes in that direction. He moves towards a closed door and opens it. Scully jumps forward, her gag removed, with a spray bottle in her tied hands. She sprays him in the eyes, and runs off, while he's stumbling backwards. Scully runs towards the staircase, Donnie after her. He catches her at the top of the stairs, and they both tumble down the staircase. As they hit the floor, Donnie's gun slips out of his grasp. Scully starts
crawling for the gun, Donnie sees her, and leaps on top of her. As she's pointing the gun at him, she, again, sees the demon from her dream, which shocks her, and allows Donnie to snap the gun from her hands. At that moment, the door bursts open, Mulder, Bocks and a few officers rush in.

MULDER (gun brandished): FEDERAL AGENTS! HANDS IN THE AIR!

Donnie slowly puts his hands in the air, and the other men take him forcefully.
Mulder kneels down to Scully. She's dazed, as she's trying to get up.

MULDER (loudly): Let's get the paramedics out here!

SCULLY: I'm okay.

MULDER: Just stay there, Scully.

SCULLY (she insists on getting up, Mulder helps her): I'm fine. Just help me get my wrists undone.

(As Mulder starts untying her): How did you find me?

MULDER: His Mother used to own the house, willed it to the sisters. I played a hunch. A patrolman spotted the car out front.

Her wrists untied, Scully rubs them. She doesn't want to meet Mulder's eyes. She's looking over at Donnie, who's being bound on the floor.

MULDER: Why don't you sit down until someone can take a look at you.

SCULLY (quietly): Mulder, I'm fine.

Mulder looks at her, and tips up her chin. She, then, meets his gaze, and that's all it takes. Her eyes well up, and she begins crying. Mulder's holding her now, though she keeps her arms crossed in front of herself. She, then, allows herself to hold him, to fully let her emotions out.
Scully continues to cry in Mulder's arms, while he holds her tight and strong.

Photos of Donnie as a child, and his family, are fading one into the other, as we hear Mulder.



SCENE 27

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: The conquest of fear lies in the moment of its acceptance. And understanding what scares us most is that which is most familiar, most common place. That boy next door, Donnie Pfaster, the unremarkable younger brother of four older sisters, extraordinary only in his ordinariness, could grow up to be the devil in a buttoned-down shirt. It's been said that the fear of the unknown is an irrational response to the excesses of the imagination. But our fear of the everyday, of the lurking stranger, and the sound of foot-falls on the stairs. The fear of violent death and the primitive impulse to survive, are as frightening as any x-file, as real as the acceptance that it could happen to you.

(close-up of PTC room wall)

AUSBURY: All in favour?

DEBORAH: Aye.

CALCAGNI: Aye.

AUSBURY: All right.

AUSBURY: Starting Monday, the track around the athletic field will be closed to joggers at 8:30 pm instead of ten.
(He looks up as if at other people, we hear murmurs of assent)
Any other items before we call it a night?

CALCAGNI: Yeah, um, I got wind that for the spring drama productions, Howard Roberts intends to put on Jesus Christ Superstar (Wry amusement).

AUSBURY: You know how he is... Howard's just trying to do things the kids like.

CALCAGNI: My point exactly.

DEBORAH: Um... I don't think that play is appropriate for this high school.

VITARIS: If he wants to be young, I have no problems with "Grease", or "Annie", or...

CALCAGNI: Doesn't "Grease" have the "F" word?

AUSBURY: Look, I'll talk to Howard. OK, let's adjourn till next week. Deborah, why don't you lead us in a prayer?

[He produces a red candle and sets it on the desk as he and Vitaris speak]

VITARIS: Jim -- the game is on.

CALCAGNI: It'll only take a minute. (SIGHS) We've been... letting it slip.

[Ausbury strikes a match to light the candle. We hear faint thunder in the background]

AUSBURY: Paul, why don't you get the door.

Vitaris gets up, camera tracks him to the door then is "shut out" by him. Faint light is visible around door edges.

ALL: In the name of the Lords of Darkness, rulers of the Earth, kings of the Underworld, I command the forces of darkness to bestow their infernal power upon me.

DEBORAH: Sein ist die Hand die verletzt

OTHERS: Sein ist die Hand die verletzt.

CAPTION: HIS IS THE HAND THAT WOUNDS!

DEBORAH: Sein ist der Ort genannt Hölle. (OR: Hoelle)

OTHERS: Sein ist der Ort genannt Hölle. (OR: Hoelle)

CAPTION: HIS IS THE PLACE CALLED HELL.

DEBORAH: May the black powers of our forefathers make us strong.

ALL: Hail. Hail the Lords of Darkness.

SCENE 2
MILFORD HAVEN, NH
EXTERIOR. NIGHT. WOODS

It is raining heavily. We see four kids walking through the woods, two boys followed by two girls. They are backlit by very strong moonlight coming through the trees. The boys (Jerry Stevens and Dave Duran) are pretty standard grunge types, the girls (Kate and Andrea) standard "nice girl" looks. The girls carry umbrellas. Jerry Stevens is carrying a bulky package in a brown paper bag. During the following exchange they walk up to and past camera.

KATE: How much further?

The boys answer simultaneously

JERRY: Up there a ways.

DAVE: Not far.

JERRY: I heard the altar is a hollowed stump, just up here. OK, when they get freaked, you get Kate, I take Andrea. (Grinning) Those mittens are giving me a Gingrich.

DAVE: OK. I need a personal object from everyone. All right. (They gather round the stump, the girls still hanging on to their umbrellas. Dave produces a black candle from his pocket, stands it up on the stump and lights it)

Now Andrea, you gotta stand over here and face Jerry ... Like this.... (She looks uncertain) Closer.

ANDREA: Why like this?

DAVE: Well that's so... er... so we're calling the spirits up of every direction. OK now Kate, you gotta stand here and face me.

KATE: Do you really think someone used this place for black magic? Or is it just a rumour?

JERRY: (IMPATIENTLY) C'mon Dave!

DAVE: (TO JERRY) Sshh! (He takes a piece of paper, obviously a page torn from a book, from his pocket, and turns to Kate. He begins to read from it, looking in turn at the others. He's really trying to come across as serious about it) In the name of the Lords of Darkness, rulers of the Earth, kings of the Underworld, rise, rise to this place. Ah... Azazal. (Sound like sigh is heard as the candle is blown out. Dave and Andrea look at it, Dave isn't bothered) Know ye all who dwell in the light of professed righteousness that the others who know the keys and the angels have opened the gate.

A sound like groaning voices fills the air; Dave is startled, Kate looks scared. Andrea is scared -- she jumps to hug jerry for protection. Jerry simply grins. Kate and Dave are very uneasy, looking around. Andrea looks down and screams, again and again. Andrea's POV: many rats running around her feet. The others are obviously scared now. Still screaming, andrea runs off into the forest.

JERRY: Forget this! (Runs after Andrea, shouting) Andrea!

Kate is turning to follow them. Dave throws something at the rats which bursts into flame as it hits the ground. He turns and they run after the others.

We see Andrea, sobbing, upset, running, frantically reciting a prayer of some sort. She is practically hysterical.

ANDREA: ....believe in Jesus Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our deaths...

JERRY: Andrea! Wait!

He has almost caught her up when a line of flame appears suddenly on the ground. He stumbles and falls to his knees in front of it, blinded by the light. He gets to his feet, shielding his face. A groan-like, animalistic sound is heard. He turns and a thin, bony, cadaverous hand seizes his throat and lifts him up... Up... He is choking.



SCENE 3
NEXT DAY
SAME SPOT
8:55 A.M.

It is still raining. A gloved hand drops a white tarp to reveal Agent Scully, crouching under an umbrella. She has obviously been looking under the tarp and wears a look of faint disgust.

OAKES: A hunter found him early this morning.

SCULLY: Couldn't have been dead for more than 12 hours.

She straightens up. During the following we see that she and Mulder are standing over what is obviously a body under the tarp. Sheriff John Oakes is standing on the other side of the body, while uniformed police are searching the area in the background. Everyone carries umbrellas. Throughout the discussion Oakes, a worried-looking man in around his early forties, has an air of "I know this sounds crazy but" about him -- he is well shook up, nervous, but serious in his suggestions.

OAKES: They say this arena's used for witches' ceremonies.

MULDER: "They"?

OAKES: Well.. everybody... everybody who lives around here knows about the things that go on in this town. They say there are people who control things.

SCULLY: (polite disbelief) Any evidence to substantiate those rumours, Sheriff Oakes?

OAKES: Well, Agent Scully... look at the body... the eyes and heart have been cut out.

Mulder looks on bleakly

SCULLY: Many homicides include victim desecration.

OAKES: I know he and his friends listened to devil music!

MULDER: "The Night Chicago Died"? (He walks away)

OAKES: (Turning to follow Mulder as he moves away) You know what I mean. Heavy Metal bands that influence kids...

Oakes moves to join Mulder, who is walking up to the stump, Scully following.

MULDER: Was Jerry Stevens or his friends ever witnessed participating in witchcraft?

OAKES: No.

SCULLY: More rumours.

OAKES: (Pointing) This stump here is supposed to be the ceremonial altar. What do you think?

Mulder moves closer to look at it

MULDER: I think with a few turquoise chips, a picture of John Wayne and three cans of shellac it'd make a pretty nice coffee table.

OAKES: Well you see all that wax? Someone's been lighting candles in there.

Under the above, Scully has been examining the bag of bottles Jerry had been carrying. She straightens up, then notices something else, goes over to pick it up. It's the page Dave was holding.

SCULLY: Any idea who Jerry Stevens was with out here?

OAKES: Oh... we assumed he was alone.

SCULLY: Well, most people don't set out to drink two six-packs by themselves. (Mulder nods) I also found this (Holds up page). It has some purple ink on the edge, like a library identification stamp... (CU On page: it's torn and crumpled. We see the end of a title, "in America", on the top, and underneath some words recognisable from the incantation.) ...and the end of the title says "In America". I'm surprised your people overlooked it.

OAKES: I'm sorry, I gotta apologise here. You're... you're right, I admit we're a little...rattled...here. (Hesitantly) That's why I called the FBI. This may involve a deeper conspiracy. (MULDER rolls his eyes) See... I grew up around here. Ever since I was a kid I heard... stories. This is a weird area, it has a strange air that I could chalk up to imagination... till today... (SCULLY hands him the page; he takes it) I'll have my staff start checking libraries for you, Agent Scully.

He walks off. Mulder walks over to Scully.

MULDER: Better hide your Megadeth albums.

SCULLY: Theories like that are why I can't take him seriously.

MULDER: The homicide did have a ceremonial presentation -- the manner in which the body was displayed...

SCULLY: Mulder, I got the impression you didn't believe him either.

MULDER: I didn't want to incite his already clearly aggravated imagination. But there is a weird feel to this place, maybe there is some truth to those rumours.

SCULLY: I think he incited your imagination. I think this case is nothing more than a murderer taking advantage of local folklore. I mean there's nothing odd about -

She is cut off as something falls onto her umbrella, knocking it. Other thuds are heard. Cut to shot from above. Frogs are falling heavily onto the pair's umbrellas. Cut back to the agents -- they look bemused, Mulder looking up, shielding his face, Scully ducking, definitely startled. The thudding stops. Cut to shot of the ground -- many frogs hopping around their feet.

MULDER: So... lunch?

SCULLY: Mulder, toads just fell from the sky! (Looks at him, taken aback)

MULDER: I guess their parachutes didn't open. You were saying something about this place not feeling "odd"?

He walks away. Scully stands still for a moment, then follows him, stepping gingerly over the frogs.



SCENE 4
CROWLEY HIGH SCHOOL LIBRARY

MLS: Mulder is at the loans desk, flicking through a box of library cards. CU on the cards. We see one for Stephen King's "Four Past Midnight", then one for M.R. Krashewski, "Witch Hunt: a history of the occult in America". Mulder starts to lift the card out. Back to the MLS; we see Scully walk into the library and join Mulder.

SCULLY: The National Weather Service says there are tornadoes in Northern Massachusetts. The wind probably picked up the animals into the storm. (Doesn't look totally convinced, despite her words).

CU LIBRARY CARD -- last borrower "DAVE DURAN".

MULDER: "Witch Hunt: A History of the Occult in America". (He hands her the card)

SCULLY: Last checked out to a Dave Duran.



SCENE 5
INT. DAY. SCIENCE LAB A TYPICAL HIGH-SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB/CLASSROOM.

We pan along the benches, pausing briefly by a neat, dark girl (Shannon Ausbury), then along to dave. Dave is edgy, very ill at ease, tapping his equipment with pencils, fidgeting, looking over his shoulder. We follow his gaze and see Kate and Andrea at the back of the classroom. They are also nervous. We hear a school bell ring.

PADDOCK: OK people... People, may I have your attention please. (MCU MRS PADDOCK: A typical plain "old maid" type teacher, floral dress, unflattering hairstyle, glasses on a chain round her neck.) Mr Kingary (???????) is off sick today, so I'll be substituting. My name is Mrs Paddock. I'm going to take the roll...

She is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dave starts up, hearing it. Paddock crosses to open the door. We see Dave's POV: Mulder and Scully, who step a little way into the room. They can only just be heard.

SCULLY: ...FBI, we'd like to speak with a Dave Duran...

Dave, hearing his name, makes a mad dash for the window, clambering over a bench and knocking equipment everywhere as he tries to scramble out head-first. Mulder pelts round after him, catches him as he is half-way through, pulls him back by the legs.

DAVE: (Muffled) Let me go!



SCENE 6
CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

CU Dave, frightened, defensive but sticking to his story. Desperate to be believed.

DAVE: I'm not into that stuff at all, I swear. (SIGHS) Jerry was my best friend. Look, I swear, I've never done anything like that.

SCULLY: What made you go to a place you heard was a witches' altar?

Dave turns his head, we follow his gaze and see Kate and Andrea standing together in a corner. He looks back to Scully, who is sitting opposite him.

DAVE: (Sighs) We were just trying to get some.

ANDREA: (Low voice, to Kate) I told you.

Scully and Mulder turn to look at them, then back to dave. Mulder is standing next to and looking out of a window which looks out on a hallway.

SCULLY: Why did you take the book?

DAVE: Because I don't know a thing about witchcraft, and we wanted to make it sound good... but I never thought...

SCULLY: You never thought what?

DAVE: That it would work.

MULDER: (Turns away from window) If you didn't kill Jerry Stevens, why did you run away from us in the classroom?

DAVE: I'm scared, man.

MULDER: Of us?

DAVE: Of it. That ceremony! I'm afraid we called up some devil or something. (SIGHS)

Mcu of Kate and Andrea, eyes downcast, they look scared too. We pan past Dave to see Ausbury, Deborah, Calcagni and Vitaris standing in a close group in the area outside the office, looking in and conferring.



SCENE
RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE 7

AUSBURY: (Low voice, fierce) One of you killed Jerry Stevens. Who? (He looks at each of them in turn; they all look at each other) He was displayed according to the rites of Azazal. Who else would know about the ritual? We stopped doing this because--

CALCAGNI: I went out there. We were supposed to have a Mass, no-one else showed, so I left.

VITARIS: It wasn't any of us.

CALGAGNI: Something's here... a presence amongst us. Angry, I can feel it.

He stops and looks up as we hear the sound of a door opening. The others look up. As Ausbury turns to see we see their POV: Scully showing Kate, Audrey and finally Dave out of the office. Mulder follows. Ausbury starts forward.

AUSBURY: (Incredulous) You're letting them go?

MULDER: (Shrugging) There's no evidence to warrant an arrest.

He walks toward them, Scully close behind.

DEBORAH: They never leave evidence.

AUSBURY: We heard how Jerry Stevens was killed. An occult ritual.

VITARIS: They've reached into our area from outside.

MULDER: (Aside, to Scully, but audible by the others) "They" again.

AUSBURY: Those three kids are obviously under occult influence.

DEBORAH: They reach into our children. In music, television, books...

CALCAGNI: They prey on children's innocence.

SCULLY: (Can't believe what she's hearing) The FBI recently concluded a seven-year study and found little or no evidence of the existence of occult conspiracies.

CALCAGNI: And J. Edgar Hoover never admitted to the existence of the Mafia. (He half-smirks. The others try to hide smiles)

SCULLY: (Voice rising a little, a bit exasperated but staying reasonable) Look, if the number of murders attributed to occult conspiracies were true, it would mean thousands of people killing tens of thousands of people a year, without evidence, without being exposed... it would be the greatest criminal conspiracy in the history of civilisation.

Ausbury turns to his colleagues, then back. He walks towards Mulder and Scully.

AUSBURY: Finally, you people understand what we're up against.

MULDER: (Looks at Scully, makes quick decision) Our investigation is ongoing.

Mulder reaches to Scully, to draw her away. She goes, but looks back in sheer disbelief at Ausbury. Ausbury looks back at the others.



SCENE 8
SCHOOL CORRIDOR

The agents turn into the corridor. Mulder crosses to a drinking fountain and bends to drink.

SCULLY: (Exasperated) Mulder, this is mass hysteria. And our presence here on a routine homicide only gives validity to their fears of occult murder.

Mulder stops drinking, pauses, notices something. CU to shot of water swirling down drain of drinking fountain.

MULDER: (Half to himself) The water...

SCULLY: What's wrong with it?

MULDER: It's going down the drain counter-clockwise! Coriolis force in the Northern Hemisphere dictates that it should go down clockwise.

SCULLY: That isn't possible.

MULDER: Something's here, Scully. Something is making these things possible.

Scully looks again at the water, puzzled.



SCENE 9
SCIENCE LAB

School bell sounds in the background. MCU of Mrs Paddock as students file out, passing her papers. Cut to mls from behind her, we see that Kate and Andrea are the last to go.

PADDOCK: Girls... may I have a word? (They look nervous, uncertain, but come over warily. Mrs Paddock is the picture of concern. She says kindly) I heard on the grapevine what happened, and, well, I know how hard it is to talk to adults sometimes, even though you feel like you want to... (The girls have "where is this going" expressions) ...well, because you're young adults... What I'm trying to say is, if you feel like talking, I'm here to listen, ok? (Smiles)

The girls smile wanly.

ANDREA: (Subdued, but genuine) Thanks Mrs Paddock.

Kate murmurs acquiescence.

PADDOCK: Hang in there.

The girls turn and leave. Mrs Paddock straightens the papers in her hand. We follow her hand down as she reaches to her desk drawer, which opens to reveal a dissecting tray containing a fresh and bloody human heart and two eyeballs. She places the papers on top and shuts the drawer. We pan up to see her smiling into the distance.



SCENE 10
OUTSIDE SCHOOL

BRIEF SHOT KIDS WALKING AWAY, SAYING GOODBYES ETC.



SCENE
RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

CAPTION: CROWLEY HIGH SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE

Scully is at a desk, working at a laptop computer, other staff going about their business around her. Pan past her to the window of Calcagni's office, where we can see Mulder and Calcagni, seated, in conversation.



SCENE 11
CALCAGNI'S OFFICE.

MULDER: (Looking through notes) Your records indicate a high incidence of students complaining of depression, headaches, eating disorders...?

CALCAGNI: This is high school. (Smiles, nods). It's normal for students to display abnormal behaviour.

MULDER: (Looks up) I'm assuming you're familiar with the early indications of repressed memory?

CALCAGNI: Just because a student has a headache doesn't mean he's repressing a memory.

MULDER: In your counselling you've found no evidence of past ritual abuse?

CALCAGNI: (SHAKES HEAD) None.

Mulder gets up, walks to the door and opens it, then turns back to Calcagni

MULDER: Would it be possible for me to speak to any of the students who've had chronic complaints?

CALCAGNI: That would be a betrayal of the doctor-patient relationship. (Shakes head again) Sorry.

Mulder looks at him thoughtfully, then leaves, shutting the door behind him. Cut to

Mulder coming out of the office, walking round to where Scully is. She continues concentrating on the laptop.

MULDER: For the body of student of complaints, he was pretty quick to dismiss my concerns.

SCULLY: Maybe there's nothing here.

MULDER: (Looks back at the office, then at Scully) Well, he's hiding something.

SCULLY: Take a look at this. (Mulder steps round to look at the screen) I found this on the Internet (Points, runs finger along screen as she speaks. cut to cu of screen: item under newsbytes: current events. Text is dated 1934. Scully reads item as we see it, we cut back to her about halfway through.

SCULLY READS:) "The discovery yesterday of a mutilated teenaged boy in the forest has police officials distressed about the possibility of a conspiratorial organization of Dark Forces."

MULDER: (Interest quickens) Where's that pulled from -- the local paper?

SCULLY: (Reading) "The Jew is known to remove organs and sacrifice teens in their religious ceremonies". (To Mulder) It's taken from "Volkischer Beobacter", a Nazi newspaper in 1934. The rumours are the same, but the blanks have been filled in with whoever must be feared or persecuted at the time. In this case, it's occultists.

Mulder crouches down by the desk, looks at her seriously.

MULDER: Modern witches, known as Wicca, are a religion. They have a great reverence for all life in Nature, they do not cast harmful spells, they don't worship Satan. Even the Church of Satan has renounced murder and torture. Their influence here wouldn't account for the frogs, or the water draining backwards, or most importantly, the murder.

SCULLY: Well, if not witches, then what?



SCENE 12
SCIENCE LAB

Mrs Paddock is wheeling around a trolley holding a large glass tank filled with what looks like dead piglets. She is doling them out to the students as she goes.

PADDOCK: For your final examination, one-half of your grade will be based on your diagram of a dissected pig embryo. (She hands one to Shannon Ausbury, who looks at it with some revulsion. The boy next to Shannon looks at it uneasily, then back at Shannon who looks faintly ill) Of course, these are actually hog embryos, belonging to the order of the archeodactyl (?????), or creatures with hooves. Be sure to remove the heart and lungs and draw a diagram of each. Be neat. (Mrs Paddock stops her trolley by a glass tank containing a huge snake. She opens the lid and tosses in a dead hog as she talks) Extra credit will be given for dissecting the heart. (We hear student groans in background. She smiles at the snake, then crosses to the front of the room) You have until the end of the period.

Mcu on Shannon, who is now looking quite ill, twitching a little, looks ready to vomit.

BOY: I'll cut it open... if you do the heart.

Shannon nods, can't take her eyes off the hog, closes her eyes as we hear the squelchy sound of it being cut open. Cut to cu of the embryo with its guts showing. Cut back to ecu on Shannon, sweating, her eyes start open, she gasps, makes other noise of distress. Cut to paddock, looking up sharply. Cut back to Shannon, obviously very distressed. Ecu on embryo heart, which beats. Ecu on Shannon, who is gasping as if she cannot breathe. Cu on the embryo, which moves its head from side to side. We hear a squeal which turns into Shannon (in cu) screaming. Brief shot of other kids in the class, startled, looking round. Back to Shannon, who screams again and again. Cut to Paddock, looking on dispassionately. Back to Shannon whose screams are mixed with hysterical sobs. Back to Paddock, who has a knowing look on her face.



SCENE 13
RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

Shannon is seated on a couch, wrapped in a blanket, still obviously distressed but quiet now. She rocks gently back and forth, oblivious to everything around her. Paddock is sitting beside her. She reaches out and strokes shannon's hair.

PADDOCK: (KINDLY) I've had this happen before. Some kids just have trouble dissecting things.

CALCAGNI WALKS OVER TO THEM.

CALCAGNI: Shannon -- I'm trying to reach your father and get him to pick you up.

SHANNON: (Becomes aware of surroundings) No!

She jerks back. Mulder and Scully, in a corner of the area, notice immediately. Calcagni crouches down in front of her, takes her hands reassuringly.

CALCAGNI: I'm sure he'll be here soon.

SHANNON: (SHOUTS) No!

She wrenches herself away, gets up, runs out of the office. Mulder follows her.

CALCAGNI: Shannon honey, come back!

PADDOCK: Shannon? Shannon!



SCENE
SCHOOL CORRIDOR

Shannon runs down the hall, sobbing wildly. Mulder runs after her.

MULDER: Shannon! You're remembering! (Shannon slows, halts just past the drinking fountain. She is crying again, but more controlled this time. Mulder walks slowly toward her, very concerned. He says softly) Tell me what you're remembering.



SCENE 14
Benches outside school, away from the main building

Shannon is sitting huddled on one set of benches, facing a very concerned scully sitting opposite her. Mulder stands by scully's side. Shannon's crying and distress escalates during the scene; she has trouble speaking, this is very hard for her. She is clearly finding this very painful.

SHANNON: (SOBBING, HALTINGLY) You know who my stepdad is, right? (MULDER AND SCULLY NOD) Jim Ausbury on the PTC. (DEEP BREATH). All right, well, my Mom, she's a teacher. Well, was a teacher. My real Dad, he uh, he ran away, and my Mom met Jim at some seminar or something... and they um, they got married. My sister and I moved up here when I was about... um, four. She was about two. Anyway... (OVER SHOT OF SCULLY, VERY CONCERNED, LISTENING) ... a, a couple of weeks ago, my class, we took a field trip to what they call the American Stonehenge... and... and.. I remembered when I was four years old, Jim took me in his car near there, and he um... he made me... in the back seat... (MULDER AND SCULLY EXCHANGE GLANCES; SHANNON'S DISTRESS INCREASING) ...he told me that if I ever told anybody that he would hurt me... As he touched me, well, I would pretend that I was like, out of my body. Deep in the ocean, down with the fish, in the dark water... Somehow, I don't know, I managed to block out all these things, but... lately it's all been... I'm remembering, you know? The others too.

SCULLY: Others?

Mulder looks quickly at her, then back to Shannon

SHANNON: ...Yeah... Men and women. They would... come to the house, you know, when my Mom was away? And they would.. uh... take me down to the basement... (BRIEF SHOT OF MULDER, LISTENING DISPASSIONATELY) It was really dark... it was like painted red, with a dirt floor. They would wear these robes, black and red and they would... sing, and they would chant, and then they would tie me and my sister up, these men and women... they would make us... do things. They called me a breeder! (RENEWED TEARS) They would get me pregnant, and then they would kill the babies... (SCULLY LOOKS AT MULDER, HER EXPRESSION UNREADABLE) ...I've had three children, and they're all buried in the cellar. (MULDER LOWERS HIS EYES) One night, Jim murdered my sister for a sacrifice. She was only eight years old! He told everybody that she died in an accident. (SCULLY MOVES TO SIT BESIDE HER; MULDER NOW LOOKS PAINED, THE STORY HAS TOUCHED A NERVE IN HIM) ...Today brought it all back, clear like it happened yesterday...

SHE MOVES TOWARD SCULLY, WHO HOLDS HER AS SHE GOES INTO A FRESH BURST OF SOBBING.(ad break)



SCENE 15
AUSBURY RESIDENCE

A QUIET, SUBURBAN STREET. MULDER AND SCULLY'S CAR PULLS INTO THE AUSBURY'S DRIVEWAY, WE HEAR THEIR VOICES OVER.

MULDER: Imagine... if what she said is true...

SCULLY: Why don't we just wait and see what her parents have to say?

The car stops, they get out and walk towards the front door. They get about halfway along the path when the door opens and Jim Ausbury hurries out to meet them. Mrs Ausbury is visible behind him. She stays in the doorway, hugging her cardigan to her.

AUSBURY: (WORRIED, AGITATED) Where's Shannon? They told me you were bringing her home.

SCULLY: She wanted to remain with friends. And... under the circumstances, we thought it best.

AUSBURY: Circumstances? Why wouldn't she want to come home?

LIVING ROOM, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Cu Ausbury, clearly very shaken. Mrs Ausbury's sobbing can be heard in the background.

AUSBURY: Someone, or something, has obviously put these things into her mind.

He looks at Mulder, who catches Scully's eye and nods silently towards the kitchen.

SCULLY: Mrs Ausbury? Er, perhaps you'd like a glass of water.

We see Mrs Ausbury, overcome, sobbing quietly. She manages a tiny nod. She is barely audible.

MRS AUSBURY: ...Yes, thank you...

Makes visible effort to pull herself together. Mls of room, we see that the ausbury's are sitting side by side on a couch, Scully sitting on a chair opposite them, Mulder standing to one side of Jim Ausbury.

MULDER: Mr Ausbury?

He motions toward the kitchen. Ausbury looks at his wife in concern, he clearly doesn't want to leave her, but gets up and walks out of shot. Mulder follows. Mrs Ausbury is left hugging herself nervously, still upset but calmer. Scully shifts in her seat.

SCULLY: Mrs Ausbury... your daughter has not accused you of any involvement in these activities. (MRS AUSBURY SHAKES HER HEAD SLIGHTLY) Do you have any idea why Shannon might have said these things?

MRS AUSBURY: (SIGHS) Jim and I have been having... marriage problems, lately... we're committed to working them out. Maybe we haven't been... paying enough attention to Shannon. (PAUSES AS IF DECIDING WHETHER TO SPEAK FURTHER) She and I don't... we don't get along. We fight.

SCULLY: Have you ever known Shannon to be pregnant?

MRS AUSBURY: Of course not! (DEFENSIVE) She's fifteen years old! How can you possibly believe such--

SCULLY: Have you ever had another child?

MRS AUSBURY: (VISIBLY STARTLED, NODS) A girl. Theresa... (QUIET) She died.

SCULLY: At eight years old?

MRS AUSBURY: (SHAKING HER HEAD GENTLY, IN AN OLD SADNESS) Eight weeks. (SOFT) It was crib death.

SCULLY SIGHS.

Cu glass under tap, overflowing. A hand turns the tap off, pan up to Ausbury's face. Mulder stands behind him, walks closer.

MULDER: Did you do it?

Ausbury turns to look at him, the beginnings of shock and anger on his face. The glass in his hand shatters, the noise startling them both. He drops the remainder of the glass into the sink.

AUSBURY: (CONTROLLED, BUT VERY ANGRY) I would kill anyone who did the things to her that she claims.

He turns and walks to the other side of the kitchen, begins cleaning his hand up on a teatowel. Mulder's attention is caught by something out of shot on the opposite side of the room. He walks toward it.

MULDER: That's not a very Christian tenet.

We see him over by a wooden door. He opens it. Ausbury doesn't notice.

AUSBURY: Thou -- God of Vengeance -- shine forth. (BITTERLY)

MULDER'S POV: LOOKING DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS INTO A CELLAR.

MULDER: Even the Devil can quote scripture to fit his needs.

Ausbury turns and sees what Mulder is doing. The door slams shut by itself, startling Mulder. Ausbury doesn't seem to notice. He is furious, shouting.

AUSBURY: How dare you! Get out of our house! (GESTURES ABRUPTLY). As far as I know, you put those ideas in my daughter's head. Now get -- out! (MULDER, LOOKING LESS CERTAIN THAN BEFORE, MOVES TO LEAVE. AUSBURY WATCHES HIM GO) The Devil travels in many forms. And you may be one!



SCENE 16
SCIENCE LAB

MCU MRS PADDOCK, LOOKING CONCERNED.

PADDOCK: (KINDLY) Are you sure you're up to this, Shannon? I heard about what you said.

Shannon is at her bench, with a fresh hog embryo on a tray in front of her. Mrs Paddock stands on the other side of the bench.

SHANNON: I'll be OK. (SMILES BRAVELY) I don't want to miss the final. (PADDOCK SMILES)

PADDOCK: I'll be in my office, if you're feeling funny. (THEY EXCHANGE SMILES, PADDOCK STARTS TO WALK OUT THEN TURNS BACK) Maybe you ought to remove your jewelry. You wouldn't want to lose it in some pig's guts. (SHANNON GRINS, TAKES OFF HER BRACELET AND HANDS IT OVER) I'll hold it for you until you're finished.

Paddock walks back to her office. Shannon breathes deeply, steels herself for the job. Cut to her pov of the embryo on the tray. Cut to Shannon again; over her shoulder, we can see Paddock in her office, looking out. She closes the venetian blinds.



SCENE 17
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Cu of a candle, flickering. A hand rises in front of it and stops just over the flame. It is holding Shannon's charm bracelet. We hear weird animalistic groans. Pan up to Mrs Paddock's face. She is sweating, eyes staring fixedly, breathing in a laboured and weird-sounding way.



SCENE 18
SCIENCE LAB

Shannon looks down at the embryo. She seems strangely calm, almost as if she is making a decision. She picks up a scalpel and looks at it.



SCENE 19
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Groans, breathing noises etc. Paddock's other hand, shaking, rises from her desktop. She brings it up slowly in front of her face, then pinches the thumb and forefinger together as if she is holding something between them.

SCIENCE LAB

Cu Shannon's hand with scalpel, held between her thumb and forefinger, echoing paddock's gesture.

PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Paddock lowers the hand until it rests under the wrist of the hand over the flame.

SCIENCE LAB

CU Shannon's hand with the scalpel, moving to rest gently against the underside of her other wrist.

PADDOCK'S OFFICE

CU Paddock's face, then her hand as she makes a violent slashing gesture under her outstretched wrist. Cu on her face as we hear a scream from outside. Cut to bracelet falling onto desktop; the scream seems to die as it lands.

SCIENCE LAB

Curving pan from above, showing Shannon sprawled face down on the floor of the lab, her stool knocked over, pig embryo and tray on the floor next to her, blood pooling under her wrist. The sound of Paddock's breathing subsides as we get closer to Shannon.

Lightning and thunder going on outside, the flashes visible even in the lit room, which is full of policemen examining things. Scully is talking to a seemingly distraught Mrs Paddock and making notes. Mulder is examining the snake's tank. He straightens up and looks over at Scully and Paddock.

PADDOCK: (UPSET) I heard the crash, and the chair, and came running out of the office.

SCULLY: Did you see anybody leaving the room? (Mulder looks over at her again, then walks towards her office. Paddock doesn't notice; she shakes her head in response to Sscully's questioning) Did you hear the door open?

PADDOCK: I lock the doors after school, when I'm alone. I... I get afraid.



SCENE 20
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Mulder wanders in, looks around. He notices shannon's bracelet on the desk and picks it up.



SCENE 21
NIGHT. CAR PARK OUTSIDE SCHOOL

Ausbury, Deborah, Vitaris and Calcagni are standing in the rain, huddled under umbrellas, watching the police cars and other activity near the school.

DEBORAH: I feel a dark angel is amongst us. It wants a sacrifice.

VITARIS: (INCREDULOUSLY) It's been years since we've done that.

CALCAGNI: Exactly. Exactly. We haven't kept our faith.

AUSBURY: (SHAKEN, ANGRY) Are any of you... responsible... for my daughter? (HE DOES NOT LOOK AT THEM AS HE ASKS)

CALCAGNI: We all are. (AUSBURY LOOKS SHARPLY AT HIM) She was sacrificed... (HE LOOKS INTENTLY AT EACH OTHER MEMBER OF THE GROUP AS HE SPEAKS) ...for us. It's a portent. Shannon's death allows us to get rid of the police, the FBI... it can all be blamed on her. (AUSBURY IS SPEECHLESS)

DEBORAH: Jim. You tell them she had a thing for Jerry Stevens. She killed him out of jealousy.

VITARIS: (SLOWLY, AS IF THINKING IT OUT AS HE SPEAKS) She cut out his eyes, because she couldn't stand to have him look at another girl. And his heart, because she was heartbroken. (AUSBURY IS STONE-FACED)

CALCAGNI: When they leave, and they're gone, we must rekindle our faith rather than lose it.

LIGHTNING FLASHES, ILLUMINATING AUSBURY. THUNDER AS HE TURNS AND STARES AT THE OTHERS.



SCENE 22
SCIENCE LAB

MCU PADDOCK, WET-EYED, TEAR TRACKS ON HER CHEEKS.

PADDOCK: I never imagined she would hurt herself like that. I'm old-fashioned, Agent Scully, I can't bring myself to believe children are capable of such things as they are these days. (She looks away, stifles a sob. Scully remains impassive. Paddock notices mulder who has returned and is holding Shannon's bracelet. He looks up, meets her gaze) She wanted me to hold that for her.

Mulder looks again at the bracelet, then motions silently to Scully.

SCULLY: (TO PADDOCK) Excuse me...

She puts her pen down on a bench, then walks away with Mulder. They speak quietly.

MULDER: Her office has a faint odour of incense. (LOOKS BACK AT THE DISTRAUGHT PADDOCK).

SCULLY: She says it's to block the smell of formaldehyde.

MULDER: It's also used in Black Mass rituals.

SCULLY: Well, I've got to admit there are some oddities to her story.

MULDER: What do you mean, oddities?

SCULLY: Well, the man she replaced has taken two sick days in a fifteen-year career. The morning of Jerry Stevens' murder Mr Kingary (???) developed necrotizing fasciitis.

MULDER: Flesh-eating bacteria? (APPRECIATIVELY) That's very rare.

SCULLY: I know. And when I questioned the other staff members about Mrs Paddock's background, no-one can even recall hiring her. (Big lightning crash. They both look up, startled, then back at each other. Cut to Paddock staring over at them. She turns back to look at the bench in front of her, slowly focusing on Scully's pen) Oh, look, I'm even getting caught up in this. I mean I'm... I'm sure that Mrs Paddock's arrival and the teacher's sickness is just a coincidence. And the fact that no-one can recall hiring her -- it's just a bureaucratic oversight.

MULDER: No, I've got a feeling this is something we both should get caught up in. I'm going to get a search warrant for the Ausbury house -- I've been told they're staying with friends. (HE GLANCES OVER AT PADDOCK) You check deeper into Mrs Paddock.

MORE LIGHTNING. THIS TIME THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

COP: Power's out.

Mrs Paddock reaches forward and grabs the pen, holding it in both hands as she watches Mulder and Scully.



SCENE 23
KITCHEN, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

It is very dark. Mulder enters with his flashlight, walks over to the cellar door, noting it is bolted shut. He opens it, shines his torch down the staircase and goes down.
CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Mulder reaches the bottom of the steps and walks around the cellar, shining the light around. We see that it has a dirt floor and red walls. He turns sharply. Ausbury is standing behind him.



SCENE 24
RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

Scully is working on her laptop again. The light from the computer and occasional lightning flashes are the only illumination. Cu of the compter screen reveals she is doing a name search for "Paddock, Phyllis H." the computer searches, then comes up with the results "prior arrests: none" and "outstanding warrants: none". Cu Sscully, "hmm"-ing, deep in thought.



SCENE 25
CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Ausbury is looking at the wall, Mulder stands impassively behind him.

AUSBURY: My religion, my family, Agent Mulder, goes back in this town seven generations. They fled persecution from people being persecuted, all in the name of religion. (SAID WITH DISTASTE. HE TURNS TO FACE MULDER) I was raised to believe Christianity was synonymous with hypocrisy. Man's natural tendency was to do as thou wilst, not do unto others. (HE WALKS SLOWLY PAST MULDER. MULDER TURNS, WATCHING HIM) We believe... Man is nothing but an animal, no better, no worse, than those who walk on four legs. And though I believed our faith kept us powerful in the community, wealthy, good health, I... I came to see hypocrisy in the others. (HE TURNS TO LOOK AT MULDER) In me. (EMPHATICALLY) When they told me to blame my dead daughter for Jerry Stevens' death, my reaction... I was sick that they would villify an innocent... someone I loved... (BECOMING EMOTIONAL) just to protect themselves. And at that moment, I knew... I am better than an animal! That my... previous beliefs were responsible... for her no longer being with us. And that it was time to talk to you.

MULDER NODS SYMPATHETICALLY.



SCENE 26
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Lightning, thunder. Paddock is in animalistic groaning mode again, holding Scully's pen over the candle.



SCENE 27
RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

Cu scully looking thoughtfully at the laptop. Cu screen, showing the results of a work search on Paddock. There is a list of legitimate-looking teaching jobs stretching from 1974 to the present.

SCULLY: (TO HERSELF) Clean.

41. INT. NIGHT. PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Paddock's hand over the candle. Groans, breathing, shaking, sweating as before.



SCENE 28
CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Mulder is pacing up and down. Ausbury looks resolved, somehow at peace.

MULDER: Did you abuse Shannon?

AUSBURY: (EMPHATIC) Never sexually.

MULDER: The rituals.

AUSBURY: (SIGHS). The blood of the young is considered very powerful. We'd include them in the ceremonies... against their will. (MULDER LOOKS AWAY IN DISGUST) They were too young to be trusted not to talk. (EMPHATIC) But we never physically hurt them. We'd slip over the ancient rituals that we didn't want to do.

MULDER: Like... drinking grape juice instead of wine at Communion? (AUSBURY HALF-NODS, WALKS AWAY) What about Shannon's memories? (AUSBURY TURNS BACK.)

AUSBURY: We'd perform a sort of post-hypnotic suggestion that repressed their memories. (MULDER DISGUSTED AS BEFORE) When they came of age, eighteen, twenty- one, then they were made aware of the religion, and brought into its practice. When she recalled the past events, she must have mixed up reality with... with that crap that's on Geraldo and the tabloids.

MULDER: Did the others kill Jerry Stevens? (AUSBURY SHAKES HIS HEAD) Shannon?

AUSBURY: (TINIEST OF PAUSES, BUT ANSWERS EMPHATICALLY) No.

MULDER: But you are responsible. You knew the possibilities contained in your beliefs, no matter how watered down. (AUSBURY IS IMPASSIVE, STONY-FACED) Did you really think you could call up the Devil and ask him to behave?



SCENE 29
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Paddock, groaning, breathing etc, stretches out a hand stiffly and knocks the receiver off her telephone. She jerkily stabs out a sequence of numbers, then picks up the receiver.



SCENE 30
CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

MULDER: Who are the others? (MULDER'S PHONE RINGS TWICE. HE HAULS IT OUT OF HIS POCKET EXASPERATEDLY) Yeah? (WE HEAR SCULLY'S VOICE, FAINT AND SCARED)

SCULLY: Mulder... the school... I'm in trouble.

WE HEAR A BUZZ OF STATIC, AND SHE IS CUT OFF

MULDER: Scully? (HE PACKS THE PHONE AWAY) I've got an emergency. (He takes Ausbury by the arm and leads him unprotestingly to the staircase) I'm placing you under arrest. (He handcuffs ausbury to the bannister and puts his torch down on the stairs) I'll be back for you later.

He dashes up the stairs, closes the door and bolts it. Ausbury watches him go.

Mulder runs out of the front door, gets into the car and backs it out of the driveway in a tearing hurry.

Ausbury, sitting on the floor next to the stairs, is crying. He is the picture of despair. The camera pans up his cuffed arm to the top of the stairs. Cut to cu of the bolt, which suddenly slides open. Mcu of the door creaking quietly open; there is nobody there. Ausbury does not notice. cu top step: the snake from the lab slides into view and starts making its way down the stairs. We follow it down, watching past Ausbury who remains unaware of it until it slides over his right shoulder and around his neck. He yells in fright and tries to shake it off, but it winds around and around his neck and body. We see him trying to pull it off, then hear him starting to choke; faint cracking sounds can be heard, implying his bones being crushed perhaps.



SCENE 31
CAR PARK OUTSIDE SCHOOL

Mulder's car pulls up. He leaps out, and runs into the building, getting his gun out as he goes.

CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Cu on Ausbury's face as he chokes, bone noises still evident. He is finally still. The snake slides down onto the cellar floor, then turns to face Ausbury's foot and widens its jaws.



SCENE 32
DOOR OF RECEPTION AREA OUTSIDE CALCAGNI'S OFFICE

Mulder, gun out, opens the door and enters the reception area. Scully is still at the desk.

MULDER: Scully!

SCULLY: (LOOKS UP, STARTLED) Mulder! What's wrong?

MULDER: (LOWERING GUN) You called me! You said you were in trouble.

SCULLY: No, I didn't touch the phone. (MULDER LOOKS BEMUSED.)



SCENE 33
CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Cu on the snake's head, atop a hideously engorged body, as it closes its mouth.



SCENE 34
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Cu on Paddock's face, she looks almost in pain. She holds the candle up to her face, licks her lips quickly, then opens her eyes. They are not human. At first they look almost black, but we then see the pupils are oval, like cat's eyes. Ecu on one showing blotchy red and blue iris, strange and disturbing patterns.

AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Long shot showing that Mulder and Scully's car is back in the drive.

KITCHEN, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Long shot from the kitchen showing the view to the hall. We see flashlights, then Mulder and Scully coming through to the kitchen.

MULDER: Ausbury confessed to conspiracy. He was going to give up the names of everybody involved, parents, teachers...

SCULLY: I checked on Mrs Paddock's background. I don't think she's involved.

Cu of Mulder's face as he pauses, cut to follow his torch as it shows the cellar door is ajar. He looks at Scully, pulls out his gun, advances carefully to the door. Mulder knocks it aside, goes downstairs. Scully follows.

CELLAR, AUSBURY RESIDENCE

Cu of handcuffs, still attached to the bannister but now empty. Ausbury has vanished. Mulder and Scully reach the cellar floor and shine their lights around. Mulder's light picks out a crushed and bloody skeleton, folded in on itself, about a metre away. They go over to it, both crouch down.

SCULLY: My God. (FASCINATED) You think that's some kind of acid?

Mulder turns, shines his torch on the stair posts.

MULDER: There's no evidence of any reaction of the wood from the acid. (HE TURNS BACK) There are tracks in the dirt... they're from a snake.

SCULLY: (BRUSHING HAIR BACK, DISBELIEF) That's impossible! It would take a large python hours to consume and weeks to digest a human being.

MULDER: You really do watch the Learning Channel. (HE GETS UP, GOES TO PICK SOMETHING UP FROM THE FLOOR. HE HOLDS IT UP, PLAYING HIS TORCH OVER IT) Scully. (SHE TURNS TO LOOK) Snakeskin.

SCULLY: (PAUSES BRIEFLY) There's a python in Paddock's room.



SCENE 35

CONFERENCE ROOM, CROWLEY HIGH SCHOOL

Cu on ptc plaque as in opening shot, different angle. Lighting, thunder etc subsequent shots reveal the office is lit by three candles.

VITARIS: (MATTER OF FACTLY) Sheriff Oakes called me. Jim Ausbury is dead. He was talking to the FBI.

DEBORAH: (IMPASSIVE) Did they kill him?

CALCAGNI: (SEEMS JUST SLIGHTLY AGITATED, BUT IN CONTROL) You know who killed him. Ausbury was no believer. He had no real faith, no devotion. He was punished for his doubts. (HE LOOKS BETWEEN THEM) We have to act. Or the same thing will happen to us. If it's not already too late.

DEBORAH: (SWALLOWING -- SHE LOOKS RATTLED FOR THE FIRST TIME) We have to assume Jim told them who we are.

CALCAGNI: (CALM, RATIONAL) If Mulder knows, it will make the offering all the more meaningful.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER. A FAINT MOTOR NOISE OUTSIDE IS HEARD. DEBORAH CROSSES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT. WE SEE HER POV: MULDER AND SCULLY'S CAR ARRIVING.

DEBORAH: They're here. (Vitaris blows out the candles. Calcagni crosses to the door, Deborah and Vitaris follow him. Calcagni opens the door) Lock the office.

CALCAGNI FEELS AROUND IN HIS JACKET.

CALCAGNI: No keys. (SLIGHT NOTE OF PANIC) They were in my pocket!



SCENE 36
SCIENCE LAB

Pan through the lab, showing furniture overturned, equipment broken, to door, which opens. Mulder and Scully step through. Choking groans can be heard. Mulder goes one way, Scully another. Scully notices something.

SCULLY: Mulder. (Paddock is lying on the floor next to the bench with the snake's tank on it. The tank is broken and empty. Scully crosses to her, Mulder follows. They both crouch down) Mrs Paddock? What happened?

Paddock is bleeding from the nose. Her glasses have been knocked to the floor beside her, she is clutching her abdomen. She speaks feebly and is wild-eyed.

PADDOCK: I... I... I came back... they were taking the snake...(As she speaks, Mulder and Scully are making their coats into a makeshift pillow and blanket for her) Miss Brown, Mr Vitaris... there are things about them I learned, I must tell you... I think they killed that boy!

Mulder has his phone out and is waiting for a response

MULDER: We know about that.

PADDOCK: (WHISPERING, LOOKING ROUND WILDLY) Conference room... it's all there!

THE PHONE IS BUSY. MULDER PUTS IT AWAY AS HE SPEAKS.

MULDER: Paramedics must be tied up by the storm. You just stay there, Mrs Paddock. I'm going to lock the door.

HE TAKES HIS FLASHLIGHT AND HURRIES OFF.

SCULLY: Just stay still. We'll be back.

She hurries after mulder. Cu on Paddock, lit by storm. She stops shaking and lies almost inanimately still.

HALL OUTSIDE CONFERENCE ROOM

Mulder and Scully approach the conference room door. Scully knocks it open, Mulder enters, gun at the ready. The room appears empty. Satisfied it appears safe, they both go in.



SCENE 37
CONFERENCE ROOM

Mulder shines his torch around, keeping his gun ready. Scully puts her light down, tries the drawers of filing cabinets with no luck. She crosses to the desk and opens the drawer. cu on contents: a glass jar containing eyeballs. She picks it up, holds it so Mulder can see. He shines the torch on it, motions for her to come closer. She walks over to him, holds it in the torch beam. They look at each other. Scully is about to say something when a bright light and loud crash sound behind Mulder. He turns just in time to be hit with a chair held by Vitaris. He stumbles and knocks into a set of bookshelves which falls on Scully. She cries out as she is knocked to the floor. Vitaris charges at Mulder again, but overshoots and runs into the desk. Mulder grabs him, slams him down onto the desk and hits him. Scully scrabbles for her gun, but Deborah appears, snatches it and trains it on Scully, who goes still, hands held over her face. Mulder and Vitaris are trading punches. Vitaris goes down, but Mulder is felled from behind by Calcagni, who has belted him on the head with his own torch. Calcagni looks down at him.



SCENE 38
CROWLEY HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

Deborah walks across the gym, dragging Scully behind her. Scully's hands are tied behind her back, and her legs are tied together. Vitaris appears dragging mulder, similarly tied. They make for a door on the other side of the gym. Calcagni follows, torch in one hand and shotgun in the other.



SCENE 39
GYMNASIUM SHOWERS

Calcagni turns the water on in two stalls. Water flows out full-bore; Mulder and Scully, lying on the tiles, cough and splutter as it hits them. Mulder is bleeding from a head wound.

CALCAGNI: It'll make the blood easier to clean up.

Shot of Deborah and Vitaris looking down at the agents. Deborah raises her hands to eye level. She is clasping a large, ceremonial, dagger.

DEBORAH: Dominus Inferus Vobisum!

CALCAGNI/VITARIS: Et conferum (?????)

They shine their torches on Mulder and Scully. Deborah moves over to Mulder and kneels. She raises the dagger higher, preparing to strike. We hear the shotgun being cocked in the background.

DEBORAH: Zeine ist die hand die verletzt. (Paul raises the gun and aims it) Forum dubai (????) (She brings the dagger down sharply. We hear a shot)



SCENE 40
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Paddock groaning, breathing etc; hand over candle



SCENE 41
GYMNASIUM SHOWERS

Calcagni cracks open the gun and the spent cartridges pop out onto the floor. He reaches into his pocket for more ammunition. He is staring fixedly downwards. Cut to Mulder and Scully, both still alive, struggling, turning to look up at him. Back to Calcagni, who raises the gun, up, up until it is pointing at his own head. Cut to Mulder and Scully, who exclaim in horror and look away. A flash, a shot rings out.



SCENE 42
PADDOCK'S OFFICE

Cu of a set of keys dropping onto the desk. Cu Paddock through the candle flame.

PADDOCK: You're right. It is already too late. SHE BLOWS OUT THE CANDLE.(ad break)



SCENE 43
GYMNASIUM SHOWERS

MULDER AND SCULLY ARE STRUGGLING TO GET FREE.

SCULLY: Oh God... Mulder, did you see his face? (HE NODS, SHE CAN'T SEE HIM) It was as if something else had control of him.

MULDER: Paddock.



SCENE 44
SCIENCE LAB

Mulder and Scully, now free, soaked, come into the lab, looking around.

SCULLY: Mrs Paddock? (Mulder walks to where they left her. There is no sign of her, only their coats) Mulder.

Mulder goes over to her. She is at the blackboard. Mulder shines his torch where she is looking. There is writing on the board. We pan with the light along the words... "Goodbye. It's been nice working with you." Mulder and Scully look at each other. The power suddenly returns. They switch off their torches and look around the room, which is a mess, stools, racks etc knocked over, equipment smashed and broken. They turn back to the board, then back to each other.

[Fade to black]

SCENE 1
FOLKSTONE, NORTH CAROLINA

(Early morning, winter. Residential street. House of PRIVATE JACK MCALPIN and his wife ROBIN MCALPIN. ROBIN MCALPIN is lying in bed alone just waking up to the sounds of a toddler crying.)

MRS. MCALPIN: (sleepily) Your turn. (no answer) Jack? (she gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom door where she hears someone being physically ill) Honey? (toilet flushes) Are you still feeling sick?

PRIVATE MCALPIN: (angrily, coming out of the bathroom) Whats the matter with you? Cant you hear the baby is crying?

(He roughly passes by her. Later, she sits at the breakfast table with their toddler eating breakfast. )

MRS. MCALPIN: (to toddler) How bout some cereal, Honey?

(PRIVATE MCALPIN, still angry, comes downstairs in army fatigues, pours himself cereal.)

MRS. MCALPIN: (quietly) You were having those awful dreams again last night.

PRIVATE MCALPIN: I didnt sleep long enough to be dreaming.

MRS. MCALPIN: I want you to go to the doctor. Find out whats wrong. Will you do that?

PRIVATE MCALPIN: (yelling) Id just like to eat my breakfast in peace! Do you think thats possible.

(MRS. MCALPIN cowers under his yelling and begins crying. The baby begins crying and she tries to comfort him. PRIVATE MCALPIN takes a bite of his cereal. When he looks in his bowl he sees an mass of wiggling meal worms. He spits out the food in disgust and runs out the door.)

MRS. MCALPIN: (crying, not understanding) Jack, what is it?!

(He runs out door past jockey statue that has been painted white. He gets in car and drives away quickly. Camera switches back to the statue which now has black maggoty things crawling on its face. PRIVATE MCALPIN is driving very fast. He looks at himself in the rearview mirror. His face is covered with black and red pustules, but only in the mirror. We see that his face is actually clear. He steers the car at full speed into the trunk of a large tree beside the road. The car is totaled. Camera pans around to show an intricate symbol painted on the backside of the tree.)

SCENE 2
COUNTY ROAD 10
FOLKSTONE, NORTH CAROLINA

(MULDER and SCULLY are driving along rural road. SCULLY looks through the file on PRIVATE MCALPIN.)

MULDER: Private John McAlpin-- one of the few, the proud ... the dead. Last week he wrapped his car around a tree. Died on impact.

SCULLY: (reading) Drug and alcohol tests came back negative. Car shows no evidence of brake, steering or any other mechanical failure.

MULDER: The military is calling it a suicideTheyre especially concerned because its the second one in as many weeks.

SCULLY: Both at the same base?

MULDER: Yeah, except that it's not exactly a base. Flip to the back. The Marines were all stationed at the Folkstone processing center in North Carolina. More than 12,000 refugees waiting for asylum from Uncle Sam.

SCULLY: Wasn't there a riot there about a month ago?

MULDER: A ten year old boy was killed but the uh, details of his death were never released.

SCULLY: Why did the military contact us?

MULDER: They didn't. Mrs. McAlpin contacted the Bureau when the military refused her request to investigate her husband's death further.

SCULLY: She doesnt believe it was suicide.

MULDER: (pointing) There.

(MULDER stops beside the tree that MCALPINE ran into. They get out and look at the symbol painted on the tree.)

MULDER: This is the tree that stopped Private McAlpin's car. State police reported there's graffiti on the bark.

SCULLY: It looks like some kind of ritual symbol.

MULDER: Most of the refugees at Folkstone are Haitian.

SCULLY: Mrs. McAlpin believes voodoo was behind her husband's death?

MULDER: Mrs. McAlpin doesn't believe her husband killed himself. She wants to know who did.



SCENE 3

(MCALPINs house. The toddler plays on the floor as MRS. MCALPIN talks to MULDER and SCULLY at the kitchen table.)

MRS. MCALPIN: Jack used to tell these jokes. Well, they were pretty dumb, I guess, but the way he told them always made me laugh. Then he got transferred to the camp and nothing was very funny anymore.

SCULLY: Did he ever discuss with you what went on there? What his duties included?

MRS. MCALPIN: No. He'd just come home angry, mostly at himself though sometimes he'd turn it on Luke and me.

SCULLY: Was he ever treated for depression or stress?

MRS. MCALPIN: No. I tried getting him to talk to someone, even our minister, but Jack believed in dealing with his own problems.

MULDER: Did he believe in voodoo?

MRS. MCALPIN: The Marines, his family and football pretty much sums up everything Jack believed in.

MULDER: So, when did you first think that his death involved something out of the ordinary?

MRS. MCALPIN: One of the boys in his squad told me what they found at the accident and he said it was some kind of voodoo curse -- the same one they found on the stool that Puerto Rican boy used to hang himself.

MULDER: Who told you that?

MRS. MCALPIN: Harry Dunham. He's from New Orleans so he's pretty superstitious about that type of thing.

MULDER: What about you?

MRS. MCALPIN: My husband had just died so I didn't give it much thought either way... Not until Luke dug this up out of his sandbox.

(MRS. MCALPIN reaches down and produces a large pink conch shell with the same symbol that was on the tree painted on the lip of the shell. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MRS. MCALPIN: I know it sounds crazy me worrying about all this but the truth is, I'm scared. I'm scared for my child... And I just don't know what to do anymore.



SCENE 4
FOLKSTONE INS PROCESSING CENTER

(MULDER and SCULLY enter military-like compound with an armed escort, SCULLY a pace behind MULDER. Barbed wire fences and aluminum buildings. Not a pleasant place. Haitian male refugees stare at them. In the mess hall, one of the men grabs SCULLY and begins yelling at her in Creole. A young Haitian boy, CHESTER, pushes the man away from SCULLY.)

CHESTER: Go! Go! Get away! Get away! (the man leaves) Hes crazy. Too much rum. (smiles at SCULLY, a young con artist) For such a pretty lady its dangerous out here. You need something pour vous gardez --- for protection. (produces small decorated cloth bag from his pocket) Your lucky charm.

SCULLY: (ignoring him) Come on, Mulder.

MULDER: How much?

CHESTER: Five (changes mind) Ten.

MULDER: Ill give you five.

SCULLY: (over it) Lets go, Mulder.

MULDER: You should always carry protection. Hold on. (hands CHESTER money and takes small cloth bag) There you go.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY sit in COLONEL WHARTONs office. COLONEL WHARTON is tough, no nonsense Marine.)

COLONEL WHARTON: I'm still not clear just what it is you're investigating here.

SCULLY: Two of your men have died in the past two weeks allegedly of self-inflicted injuries.

COLONEL WHARTON: And I've taken every measure to see it doesn't happen again. I've even flown in the 528th combat stress control detachment from Camp LeJeune.

SCULLY: But your soldiers aren't in combat.

COLONEL WHARTON: In some ways what we're dealing with here is worse.

SCULLY: How so?

COLONEL WHARTON: We're soldiers. We're not prison guards. And we're being asked to police a hostile population of foreigners without the resources to feed or house them. There are bound to be some conflicts.

SCULLY: So your men are getting the brunt of the refugees' frustration?

COLONEL WHARTON: It's hatred, plain and simple. They hate us and all I can do is see that they're processed as efficiently as possible.

MULDER: Colonel Wharton, a, uh... A certain ritual sign was found at the scene of both deaths. Is there anything you can tell us about that?

COLONEL WHARTON: Not much. Apparently, it's some sort of voodoo marking.

MULDER: But you haven't investigated it as a possibility.

COLONEL WHARTON: Possibility of what? All I know is voodoo caused a riot in my camp. One night they held some secret ceremony. The next day all hell broke loose.

MULDER: We understand a refugee was killed-- a young boy.

COLONEL WHARTON: No one felt that tragedy more deeply than me. Fortunately, I was able to isolate the one responsible for instigating all the trouble.

MULDER: Who would that be?

COLONEL WHARTON: His name is Bauvais. Pierre Bauvais. Thinks he's some kind of revolutionary.

MULDER: Do you think we could speak with him?

COLONEL WHARTON: If you don't mind listening to his laundry list of complaints.

SCULLY: I'd also like to examine Private McAlpin's body. I have a signed consent from his wife.

COLONEL WHARTON: (indicating soldier standing at the door) Private Dunham will help you with whatever you need.

(PRIVATE DUNHAM opens door for them. MULDER guides SCULLY out, his hand on her lower back. As they pass him, PRIVATE DUNHAM glances nervously back at COLONEL WHARTON, then follows MULDER and SCULLY.)



SCENE 5
TEMPORARY CAMP MORGUE

(SCULLY is interviewing the coroner, FOYLE.)

CORONER FOYLE: Cause of death was no great mystery. That boy was doing 60 when he hit the tree.

SCULLY: So they pronounced him at the scene?

CORONER FOYLE: His head was hanging on his shoulders like a broken peony and he had no respiratory or cardiac functioning. I saw no reason to conduct an autopsy then and I still don't. Well, you can see for yourself.

(CORONER FOYLE roughly opens the drawer. They stare in shock at the badly decayed dog carcass lying where a human body should be.)

CORONER FOYLE: What kind of a sick joke is this? Jackson!

JACKSON: (voice off camera) Sir?

CORONER FOYLE: (exiting) Who the hell's been in here?! Someones tampered with McAlpins body and I want to know who!

(SCULLY looks down at the dog corpse.)



SCENE 6
PROCESSING CENTER BRIG

(Same time, PRIVATE DUNHAM leads MULDER down to BAUVAISs cell, solitary lockup area.)

MULDER: Youre Harry Dunham.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Yes, sir.

MULDER: You knew Private McAlpin? His wife said you were friends.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: We were in the same squad.

MULDER: Any idea why he might have killed himself?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: I can't say, sir.

MULDER: You can't say or you won't say?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: I'll be right here if you need me.

(MULDER enters BAUVAIS chain link cell. BAUVAIS is a large Haitian man, very calm and mysterious. Thick Creole accent.)

MULDER: My name is Mulder. I'm with the FBI. I was hoping you could answer some questions about the two US Marines who took their own lives.

BAUVAIS: It is a terrible shame.

MULDER: I'm not convinced it's as simple as that.

BAUVAIS: You do not believe I was involved in this, do you? How could I be... When they keep me locked up in here?

MULDER: You tell me. These photographs were taken at the sites of both deaths. (shows him photos) The shell was found buried under one of the soldiers' homes. Can you tell me about the symbol?

BAUVAIS: Why? What do you expect to learn from this?

MULDER: Just the truth. One of the Marines left behind a wife. She's too frightened to even mourn. She deserves some peace of mind.

BAUVAIS: It is the Loco-Miroir the crossroads between the two worlds-- the mirror in which a man must confront his true self. These Marines... Maybe they didn't like what they saw.

MULDER: Colonel Wharton says you incited the riot last month.

BAUVAIS: My country was born on the blood of slaves. Freedom is our most sacred legacy.

MULDER: Does that mean you would kill to preserve it?

BAUVAIS: Wharton will not let us return home... Which is all we ask.

(SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I need to speak with you.

BAUVAIS: Shes come to tell you the Marine is gone.

(BAUVAIS and SCULLY stare at each other. SCULLY is clearly unnerved by the man.)

SCULLY: How did you know?

BAUVAIS: Its the spirits. The Loa have warned you.

(BAUVAIS stands backlit. SCULLY can only see his outline. Shades of "Irresistible".)

SCULLY: Somebody stole McAlpin's body and replaced it with what looks like a dog's corpse.

BAUVAIS: They will only warn you once. After that, no magic can save you.

(MULDER quickly steps between BAUVAIS and SCULLY blocking her from the prisoners intense stare.)

MULDER: Come on, Scully. Let's go.

(They exit.)



SCENE 7

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY on the road. SCULLY driving.)

MULDER: So what do you think happened to Private McAlpin?

SCULLY: Somehow, Bauvais must have switched the bodies.

MULDER: It's quite a trick considering he's been confined for the last month.

SCULLY: Well, then he had somebody else do it.

MULDER: But you said there was no trace evidence. And security is practically impossible to breach.

SCULLY: I was only suggesting that whoever did it was clever and thorough. I wasnt suggesting that some kind of spirit did it.

MULDER: Well, just in case, I believe in covering my bases.

(MULDER hangs the cloth charm he bought from CHESTER in the camp on the rearview mirror. SCULLY rolls her eyes.)

SCULLY: Mulder, voodoo only works by instilling fear in its believers. You saw how Bauvais tried to intimidate me. I'll admit the power of suggestion is considerable but this is no more magic than a pair of fuzzy dice.

MULDER: Scully, look out!

(SCULLY slams on brakes almost hitting a figure who is walking in the middle of the road as if sleepwalking. MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car and approach him.)

MULDER: Hey...

SCULLY: Private McAlpin?

(MCALPIN does not respond.)



SCENE 8
PCYCHIATRIC INFIRMARY

(Camp medical facilities. MCALPIN sits rocking, still in a daze.)

SCULLY: Hes nonverbal, nonresponsive to voice, touch or pain. The neurologists suspect he suffered a severe concussion resulting in amnesia.

MULDER: Its a plausible diagnosis. Only I'm more interested in how he came back to life.

SCULLY: Well, obviously, he never left. Dr. Foyle made a gross mistake when he signed the death certificate. Its not the first time something like thats happened.

MULDER: Did you get a copy of the blood test?

SCULLY: Yeah. (reads) Electrolytes, white and red counts are all normal. Except this is strange. The lab detected trace levels of tetrodotoxin in his blood. (MULDER begins pacing.) That's a poison found in the liver and reproductive organs of puffer fish-- a Japanese delicacy.

MULDER: Somehow, I get the feeling Private McAlpin didn't frequent too many sushi bars.

SCULLY: You have a theory how it got into his blood?

MULDER: What do you know about zombies?

SCULLY: Well, I hope you don't intend to tell Robin McAlpin that she married one?

MULDER: In 1982, a Harvard ethnobotanist named Wade Davis did extensive field research in Haiti on the zombification phenomenon. He analyzed several samples of zombie powder prepared by voodoo priests and he found tetrodotoxin to be common to all of them.

SCULLY: But, Mulder, its a lethal poison.

MULDER: But in small enough doses it can cause paralysis and depress cardiorespiratory activities to such a low level that the victim might appear clinically dead.

SCULLY: Well, zombie or not, Jack McAlpin is alive.

MULDER: Exactly. Which is what makes me wonder about the other Marine who allegedly killed himself.



SCENE 9
FOLKSTONE MUNICIPAL CEMETERY

(Graveyard. Day. MULDER and SCULLY walk into the cemetery.)

SCULLY: Why did they bury Private Guttierez here?

( A large black dog growls at them. GROUNDSKEEPER comes up behind the dog. )

GROUNDSKEEPER: They beat you to it. You're the FBI, aren't you? (to dog) Stay. Easy, Wong.

MULDER: (showing badge) Yeah. We've arranged to exhume the body of Manuel Guttierez.

GROUNDSKEEPER: Right. The Marine. I prepared the dig as soon as I got the judge's order, but it's too late.

SCULLY: Too late?

GROUNDSKEEPER: Yeah. The body snatchers got there first. I caught them more than few times right in the act but it's getting I can't keep up anymore. That's, uh, why I got this.

(Opens his coat to show them a pistol.)

SCULLY: Don't the police intervene?

GROUNDSKEEPER: They got their hands full trying to protect the lives of the living. I am all these people have to preserve their rest.

MULDER: These body snatchers What do they do with the bodies?

GROUNDSKEEPER: Ah, they sell them.

MULDER: To who?

GROUNDSKEEPER: Well, it varies. When the local medical school ran short of cadavers rumor had it that the snatchers got $200 a head. But mostly, it's the voodoo types who do the buying. A lot of folks in these parts go in for that with the medicines and the potions and... Yeah, here we are.

(They look into an empty grave.)

GROUNDSKEEPER: Look at that. They dug him up right under my nose. Hows he supposed to rest in peace like this? (MULDER looks at the name on the coffin) They can do what they like with the pigs and the chickens but this is a desecration. This is uncool.

SCULLY: Mulder ..

(She points to a figure digging near a grave several yards away.)

GROUNDSKEEPER: Look at that. See what Im talking about?

(Begins to pull out his pistol, but MULDER stops him.)

MULDER: Let us take care of this.

GROUNDSKEEPER: Knock yourselves out.

(MULDER and SCULLY run toward the figure digging near a grave. It is the young boy from the prison, CHESTER. He tries to run, but MULDER grabs hold of him.)

CHESTER: (struggling in MULDERs grasp) Let me be! I didn't do nothing! What did I do?

MULDER: Maybe you can tell us.

(They look down at CHESTERs bag which has fallen open. It is full of live frogs which begin hopping away. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

SCULLY: (looking at the frogs) Maybe I should kiss a few and find out if one is Guttierez.

(Later, they sit in a fast food restaurant. MULDER and SCULLY watch as CHESTER greedily devours a cup of french fries.)

CHESTER: Fresh bones. They pay good. But I go there for the frogs. You find the best frogs at the cemetery.

SCULLY: How do you get out of the camp?

CHESTER: I go, and then I come back.

SCULLY: What about your parents? Are your parents at the camp?

MULDER: What about a name?

CHESTER: (proudly) Chester Bonaparte.

MULDER: What do you do with the frogs, Chester?

CHESTER: For each one I catch, I get 50 cents.

MULDER: From who? Who pays you for them?

CHESTER: (mysteriously) Bauvais. His magic is the most strong. He even made my fries disappear.

MULDER: Hey, Chester. I got magic, too, and I bet I can make your fries reappear.

CHESTER: Merci!

(MULDER opens his wallet and hands CHESTER some money. CHESTER grins and runs off to the counter for more fries.)

SCULLY: Mulder, certain frog species secrete a substance called bufotoxin. It's chemically similar to what we found in Private McAlpins blood. I think we should ask Bauvais what he's doing with those frogs.

MULDER: (speaking very quietly to SCULLY) I didn't want to say anything before because I wasn't sure, but I think we're being followed. It's a gray four-door sedan in the parking lot. Keep an eye on Chester.

(MULDER goes outside and sneaks around to the drivers side of a gray car. He points his gun at PRIVATE DUNHAM.)

MULDER: Out of the car, Private. You've been following us.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Look, I had to warn you.

MULDER: You didnt seem too interested in helping us before.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: I couldn't talk then-- not with Colonel Wharton so close by. And not with him right there. (indicates CHESTER as SCULLY helps him into the backseat of her car)

MULDER: Chester? He's just a little boy.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: No, sir, he is not.

SCULLY: (approaching the men) Whats going on?

MULDER: Private Dunham was just about to tell us why we're in danger.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: You're putting yourselves into the middle of something you don't understand.

MULDER: But you do?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Bauvais warned him. He told the Colonel he'd take his men one by one unless...

MULDER: Unless what?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Unless the Colonel let his people go back to Haiti. But the Colonel... He just had us turn up the heat on all them beatings and all.

SCULLY: Colonel Wharton sanctioned beatings of the refugees?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: He ordered it, and worse. The things he is making us do to those people.

SCULLY: Why hasn't anybody stepped forward or filed a complaint?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: None of us feel good about it, Maam, but you don't join the Marines to feel good.

MULDER: You said that Bauvais threatened the Colonels men.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: He said he'd take their souls.

MULDER: You believe he can do that?

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Jack was my friend, and look what happened to him.

SCULLY: Well, we don't know what happened to him but there is a medical explanation for his condition.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: Back home, an associate of my daddy's, Clyde Jessamin, once crossed a man on some kind of real estate deal. And not two weeks passed before Jessamin's daughter took ill with something the doctors couldn't make heads or tails of. All they could do was shoot her full of morphine the pain was so bad. She died five minutes past midnight on her wedding day, and when they did an autopsy to try and figure it out, all they could find was a bunch of snakes squirming around inside her belly.

SCULLY: Sounds like an old wives tale.

PRIVATE DUNHAM: No, Maam. Its not. You see, Im the one who was supposed to marry her.

(MULDER and SCULLY watch him drive away then head back to their own car.)

SCULLY: Think hes telling the truth?

MULDER: Till I can figure out why hed lie, yeah.

SCULLY: Hes superstitious, and superstition breeds fear. Its what Voodoo is all about. Its just as irrational as avoiding a crack in the sidewalk.

MULDER: Why would he be trying to avoid Chester?

(Their car is empty, CHESTERs fry cup on the back seat.)

MULDER: Chester? Chester?

(They see him several yards away. MULDER chases him on foot, SCULLY follows with the car.)

MULDER: Chester! Chester! Stop! Im not going to hurt you! (to SCULLY) Its okay. Ill get him. Chester! Chester!

(MULDER reaches the end of the pier. It is deserted. He looks in the water. A black kitten is on top of a barrel near the end of the pier. It meows. MULDER stares at it in confusion, then looks around.)



SCENE 10

(Next morning. COLONEL WHARTONs office. He is eating.)

PRIVATE KITTEL: Can I get you anything else, sir?

(Knocking at the door. COLONEL WHARTON is irritated.)

COLONEL WHARTON: Just get the door.

(MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

COLONEL WHARTON: (dismissively) Im sorry. Im having my breakfast.

MULDER: (polite sarcasm) Thats all right. We already ate.

(PRIVATE KITTEL leaves.)

COLONEL WHARTON: I understand you obtained a court order yesterday to exhume Private Guttierez.

MULDER: Thats right.

COLONEL WHARTON: You should know I filed a complaint with the Justice Department.

MULDER: His body was missing-- stolen from his coffin apparently.

COLONEL WHARTON: Now you see what we're facing here. What kind of barbaric religion would desecrate a grave?

SCULLY: We suspect it was an act of retaliation.

COLONEL WHARTON: Retaliation?

SCULLY: For your mistreatment of the detainees.

COLONEL WHARTON: What the hell are you talking about?

SCULLY: Physical abuse of political refugees is a prosecutable crime under international law.

COLONEL WHARTON: (chuckles) It's Bauvais, isn't it? He's the one you're getting this garbage from. Look, nobody ever said this was a hotel but it's hardly a concentration camp.

SCULLY: Then there is no official policy of harassment?

COLONEL WHARTON: If anything, its my men who are being harassed. The UN, the relief organizations, theyre all so busy protecting the rights of these refugees nobodys looking out for my men.

MULDER: Well, well let you finish. Wouldnt want your breakfast to get cold.

(MULDER and SCULLY exit. COLONEL WHARTON returns to his breakfast. As he cuts the slice of ham, he stops in horror as he sees fresh blood pouring out of the ham.)

(MULDER and SCULLY outside are getting into their car, SCULLY driving.)

MULDER: Whartons left these people no choice but to fight back with the only weapon they have.

SCULLY: Sorry, Mulder, theres a big difference between nasty looks and raising the dead.

MULDER: Not according to Private Dunham.

(SCULLY cries out as she takes hold of the steering wheel.)

SCULLY: Ah!!!

MULDER: What?

(SCULLY pulls a vine covered with thorns from the steering column.)

SCULLY: More scare tactics. (tosses vine out the window)

MULDER: (reaching for SCULLYs bleeding hand) Let me see that.

SCULLY: No. Its nothing.

(As they drive away, camera shows the symbol painted on the pavement under the car.)



SCENE 11

(BAUVAISs cell. PRIVATE KITTEL has been beating BAUVAIS. COLONEL WHARTON stands outside the cell.)

PRIVATE KITTEL: I don't think he's in any condition to talk.

COLONEL WHARTON: That's right, Private. You don't think. You follow orders.

PRIVATE KITTEL: But sir...

COLONEL WHARTON: You're dismissed.

(PRIVATE KITTEL leaves reluctantly. COLONEL WHARTON approaches BAUVAIS.)

COLONEL WHARTON: (threatening, grabs BAUVAISs collar) Ouvri barriere pou' moi. I want the secret. Maybe you should tell me now while you can still talk.

BAUVAIS: Ma vie nan mains bon dieu..

COLONEL WHARTON: No, papaloi. Your life is in my hands.



SCENE 12

(MULDER enters his hotel room. Something falls from the top of the door. A playing card, the 10 of diamonds.)



SCENE 13
COUNTY ROAD 10

(Later, night, next to diamond shaped road sign, route 10. MULDER sits in the car. Another car arrives. X opens the passenger door and gets in the car.)

MULDER: I was surprised to get your card. I had assumed our last contact... would be our last. Why are you here?

X: Your investigation is faltering, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I've got a renegade Marine who may be violating every human rights provision...

X: These people have no rights. In 24 hours all access to Folkstone will be restricted to military personnel. No press, no third-party monitoring.

MULDER: What about Scully and me?

X: You'll be called back to Washington on a priority matter.

MULDER: (sighs) They're making the camp invisible. Why?

X: In case you haven't noticed, Agent Mulder, the Statue of Liberty is on vacation. The new mandate says if you're not a citizen you'd better keep out.

MULDER: Why hold them up? Why not just repatriate them?

X: During our most recent involvement in Haiti three US soldiers took their own lives. Of those men, two were under Colonel Wharton's command.

MULDER: Youre saying the military's sanctioning Wharton's revenge? These people are innocent civilians. Some people in Congress might have a real problem with that.

X: By the time they get a committee together it'll be as if none of this ever happened.

(X gets out of the car.)



SCENE 14

(SCULLYs hotel room. She is on the phone, frustrated.)

SCULLY: (on phone) You don't understand. I've been on hold for half an hour. I'm trying to locate a Private Dunham.

(SCULLY scratches at her hand which is puffy and still bleeding. She looks up at her reflection in the mirror with concern.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

(SCULLY hangs up then knocks at MULDERs door, #7.)

SCULLY: (through door) Mulder, I just got through to Dunhams barracks. Mulder? Your door's unlocked.

(SCULLY enters MULDERs room and crosses to the bathroom where there is the sound of water.)

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to this. Dunham's been AWOL since last night...

(SCULLY sees bloody water seeping out from under the bathroom door.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Slowly, SCULLY enters the bathroom. A dead man lies in the overflowing tub. It is PRIVATE DUNHAM.)

SCULLY: Oh, God.

(SCULLY turns off the water, then turns to see PRIVATE MCALPIN stumble into the bathroom.)

MULDER: Scully? (enters bathroom holding gun on PRIVATE MCALPIN)

SCULLY: (relieved) Yeah.

MULDER: I found him wandering around outside. You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah. It's Dunham.

MULDER: When I found him. He had this in his hand.

(Shows her a bloody knife.)



SCENE 15

(MULDER and SCULLY interrogate MCALPIN back at the base. COLONEL WHARTON is also present.)

MULDER: Do you recall leaving the hospital?

PRIVATE MCALPIN: These past few days I don't recall much of anything... Except feeling real heavy like Im asleep and I can't wake up.

MULDER: Do you remember killing Private Dunham?

PRIVATE MCALPIN: All I remember is being there seeing him in all that blood.

SCULLY: Why did you sign the confession?

COLONEL WHARTON: The Private asked and I apprised him of what you found at the crime scene.

PRIVATE MCALPIN: Who else might it have been?

MULDER: Colonel... Can we have a word outside?

(COLONEL WHARTON steps out of the cell with MULDER and SCULLY.)

MULDER: What exactly did you tell him?

COLONEL WHARTON: If you're suggesting that I coerced Private McAlpin...

MULDER: I need to know that he signed that confession voluntarily?

COLONEL WHARTON: Of course he did.

MULDER: Since his reappearance has Private McAlpin had any contact with Bauvais?

COLONEL WHARTON: Not to my knowledge.

MULDER: Well, we'd still like to speak with Bauvais.

COLONEL WHARTON: I'm afraid that's impossible.

MULDER: Why?

COLONEL WHARTON: (smug) Because he's dead. Last night he cut his wrists with a bedspring. I'll have the report sent to your motel along with the Private's confession. Since both matters are being handled internally Ill assume your business here is finished.

(COLONEL WHARTON leaves. SCULLY rubs her head with a small moan. )

MULDER: What's wrong?

SCULLY: (holding her head) I'm fine. It's just a headache.

(MULDERs phone rings. While he talks, SCULLY turns away and rubs her hand. She is NOT fine. )

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder... Okay, Mrs. McAlpin. We can be there in fifteen minutes.



SCENE 16

(MCALPIN house. MRS MCALPIN is very upset.)

MRS. MCALPIN: First I thought I lost him... As if that wasn't hard enough to deal with. Now they're saying he's killed Harry.

SCULLY: He said it himself. He signed a confession.

MRS. MCALPIN: I don't care. It doesn't make sense. Jack and Harry were friends.

MULDER: Mrs. McAlpin, you said on the telephone that Private Dunham came here last night. What did he want?

MRS. MCALPIN: He was on his way to see you.

MULDER: For what reason?

MRS. MCALPIN: He wouldn't tell me. He said if anything happened to him... (crosses to a drawer) I should give this to you. He told me not to open it.

(She hands them a sealed envelope. Off camera, we hear the baby crying )

MRS. MCALPIN: Luke's been in a mood since all this started. It's almost like he knows what's going on. I'll be right back.

(MRS. MCALPIN leaves the room to attend to the crying baby. MUDLER and SCULLY look at a black and white photo of soldiers in a tropical area.)

SCULLY: (looking at picture) Thats Bauvais. And Wharton? They must have known each other when Wharton served in Haiti.

MULDER: When in Rome



SCENE 17

(Night. COLONEL WHARTONs office. MULDER and SCULLY enter the deserted office and begin looking around with a headlight on a stick. SCULLY finds a paper in the trashcan.)

SCULLY: Mulder Dunham and Guttierez both filed complaints against Colonel Wharton. They both cited incidents of abuse --- dates, times

(MULDER finds a set of dogtags in a trunk.)

MULDER: Scully. Look at this. Check out the name on the dogtags.

(Door opens. PRIVATE KITTEL interrupts their snooping and holds them at gunpoint.)

PRIVATE KITTEL: Come with me, please. Take the light out of my eyes.

MULDER: Wheres Wharton?

PRIVATE KITTEL: Youll find out soon enough.

MULDER: He killed Bauvais. If you know anything about it youll be tried as an accessory to murder

PRIVATE KITTEL: Shut up! Bauvais got what he deserved. After what he did to McAlpin and Guttierez?

SCULLY: It wasnt Bauvais.

PRIVATE KITTEL: (unsure) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Those men were about to testify against Colonel Wharton. He stopped them before they did.

MULDER: If you dont believe us, look in the trunk.

(PRIVATE KITTEL does. Sees human bones.)

MULDER: (handing over dogtags) This is whats left of Private Guttierez. Now wheres Bauvais body?

PRIVATE KITTEL: We buried him this afternoon .. in the municipal graveyard.



SCENE 18

(Later, in graveyard. Night. Lots of candles surround gravesite. COLONEL WHARTON drags a coffin out of the ground.)

COLONEL WHARTON: (places knife on coffin, then sprinkles a powder around the coffin) Au nom de saints et de la lune. Au nom de saints et de la lune. Au nom de saints et des etoilles.

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the graveyard. SCULLY has her hands over her face as if in pain.)

MULDER: What is it, Scully?

SCULLY: Im all right.

MULDER: You dont look all right.

SCULLY: No, Im fine. Ill catch up with you. Just go get Wharton.

(MULDER nods, gets out of the car and heads across the graveyard. SCULLY watches him go then looks around herself nervously. She scratches her hand which is very swollen. She looks in the rearview mirror then begins gasping for air in terror. She looks back at her hand. A clear pus like fluid seeps out of the wound then a pair of mens fingers push up through the wound. SCULLY screams weakly, and the man who approached her when she first arrived at the camp suddenly appears in the car with her and begins throttling her.)

(CUT TO: MULDER walking through graveyard toward COLONEL WHARTON who is making the symbol on the ground.)

MULDER: Federal Agent! Drop the knife, Wharton.

COLONEL WHARTON: (speaking Creole)

MULDER: Drop the knife!

(COLONEL WHARTON, still speaking Creole, begins to lower knife to the ground, but then suddenly stabs it into the earth. MULDER screams in pain and falls to the ground clutching his gut.)

MULDER: Ah!!!

(COLONEL WHARTON is startled to see BAUVAIS standing behind him.)

BAUVAIS: Ca qui fait mal, ce mal li we. He who does evil, evil he will see.

(BAUVAIS blows powder into WHARTONs face. WHARTON screams and falls back.)

(CUT TO: Interior of car. SCULLY still being choked by the Haitian man who is speaking Creole to her. SCULLY desperately reaches for the charm hanging on the mirror. As soon as her fingers close around it, the man disappears. SCULLY looks down at the charm in her hand which is not hurt. She is startled by a cats meow. She looks up to see the black kitten on the hood of the car. Shaking, SCULLY gets out of the car. SCULLY runs to MULDER and helps him sit up.)

SCULLY: (breathing heavily) Mulder

MULDER: Youre okay?

SCULLY: I feel better than you look.

(They sit for a moment catching their breath and looking at each other.)

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: I dont know.

(SCULLY looks at COLONEL WHARTON.)

SCULLY: Hes dead. Did you kill him?

MULDER: No. It was Bauvais.

(SCULLY opens the coffin and sees BAUVAIS, also dead, lying in it.)



SCENE 19

(Next day at the camp. Detainees are being loaded into trucks. MULDER and SCULLY arrive.)

SOLDIER: Heres the passenger manifest you asked for.

SCULLY: Thank you.

SOLDIER: Theyre petitioning to have Bauvais returned to Haiti.

MULDER: Too bad it has to be in a box.

SCULLY: Is this a complete list?

SOLDIER: As far as I know.

SCULLY: There was a boy. His name was Bonaparte. Chester Bonaparte?

SOLDIER: Poor kid. He died six weeks ago in that riot.

(Surprised, MULDER and SCULLY watch the soldier leave. They dont look at each other.)



SCENE 20

(Graveyard, day. Dog stands over an open grave barking. GROUNDSKEEPER drives up in bulldozer to fill in the grave. Camera pans down to inside the casket in the ground as it is covered. COLONEL WHARTON is conscious and panicked as he realizes what is happening to him. He screams and beats on the casket, but there is no chance of him being overheard over the sound of the barking dog and the motor of the bulldozer. Fade to credits.)

[THE END]

                                      COLONY



SCENE 1

(A mist surrounds the sky. Mulder talks over the scene.)

MULDER: I have lived with a fragile faith built on the ether of vague memories from an experience that I can neither prove nor explain.When I was twelve, my sister was taken from me, taken from our home by a force that I came to believe was extraterrestrial.

(A light shines down from the mist.)

This belief sustained me, fueling a quest for truths that were as elusive as the memory itself. To believe as passionately as I did was not without sacrifice, but I always accepted the risks... to my career, my reputation, my relationships... to life itself...

(A whirring sound grows louder as the light grows brighter. The light is coming from a helicopter. A man waves the helicopter down towards the landing pad as an army ambulance pulls up, sirens blaring. The back doors open up and man file out.)

MAN: Let's move out!

(The men scream to each other and a few take Mulder out of the helicopter. He is in some kind of bodybag on a metal stretcher. They run in with a nurse who is carrying an IV.)

NURSE: We need a frostbite bay, stat!

(They run into the ER.)

DOCTOR: All right, let's get ready, please!

(The medical officials put an oxygen mask on him and cut off his clothes. Beeping and talking can be heard.)

Basal temp's eighty-six degrees.

NURSE: Right eye dilated.

(She pulls up the other eyelid and shines a flashlight into his other eye.)

Left eye dilated.

DOCTOR: All right, people, let's get him into that tub or we're going to lose him.

(The nurse looks back at his pulse.)

On three... one, two, three...

(The doctor and some other people lift Mulder up. Scully runs in through the outside doors and is stopped by a security guard.)

SECURITY GUARD #1: Hold it...

SCULLY: An Agent Mulder was brought here tonight?

SECURITY GUARD #1: This is an authorized area, military personnel only.

SCULLY: I'm a federal agent!

(She tries to push past them but they stop her.)

SECURITY GUARD #2: Ma'am!

SECURITY GUARD #1: Hold on, you're not going anywhere until we can see some I.D.

SCULLY: There's no time for this.

(She shows her badge to both of them.)

A man is dying.

(Mulder is put him into a frostbite tank. The warm water covers most of his body. He talks over the scene.)

MULDER: What happened to me out on the ice has justified every belief. If I should die now, it would be with the certainty that my faith has been righteous. And if, through death, larger mysteries are revealed, I will have already learned the answer to the question that has driven me here... that there is intelligent life in the universe other than our own... that they are here among us... and that they have begun to colonize.

(Scully bursts into the emergency room. The people are talking in the background. Scully looks at Mulder and holds up her badge.)

SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I'm Agent Mulder's partner. What are his vitals?

(The doctor walks over to her.)

DOCTOR: He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.

SCULLY: No... you've got to get him out of the tub.

DOCTOR: He's dying, he's lost all his body heat.

SCULLY: You've got to listen to me! If you keep him in there, you're going to kill him! The cold is the only thing that's keeping him alive.

(Mulder flatlines.)

NURSE: His heart stopped!

DOCTOR: Give me one amp of epinephrine in a cannula!

SCENE 2
RESEARCH VESSEL ALTA; BEAUFORT SEA, ARCTIC CIRCLE; TWO WEEKS EARLIER

(The vessel moves along past icebergs jutting out of the water. A man climbs down from the upper look-out deck and opens up the door. The captain walks out.)

OFFICER: You got to see this captain, we got a UFO or something buzzing us.

(The captain puts on his hat and goes to the ladder.)

Right up here.

(The captain climbs up the ladder to the deck. The man follows. Two men are standing with binoculars. A circular light is hovering in the distance.)

It's been just hovering up there for about twenty minutes.

CAPTAIN: Could be a helicopter.

OFFICER: Not the way it flew over us.

(The man to their left stops looking through the binoculars.)

MAN: It's coming at us again.

(The light grows larger and races by the side of the ship.)

OFFICER: It's going to crash...

(They watch as the light crashes into a distant iceberg, exploding in a fireball.)

CAPTAIN: Reverse engines!

DECKHAND: Reverse!

CAPTAIN: We're going after it.



SCENE 3
WOMAN'S CARE FAMILY SERVICES AND CLINIC; SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA

(A doctor, Landon Prince walks down the hallway towards the lounge.)

WOMAN: Thank you very much.

NURSE: You're welcome.

(He walks into the lounge and pours himself a cup of coffee. Doctors and nurses are sitting around. The TV can be heard.)

ANCHORMAN: ...has been covering this story and files this report.

REPORTER: Two days ago, the crew of an ice cutter working the arctic circle thought they had seen a UFO when a strange aircraft plunged into the Beaufort Sea. But a short time later, they recovered what is now believed to be a Russian fighter pilot from the icy water where he miraculously survived the extreme arctic temperatures.

(Prince is paying attention now. On the TV, the crewmembers of the ship hoist the man up onto the boat with a pulley.)

The man was airlifted to a military hospital in Alaska where he was listed in stable condition. But while authorities have been trying to determine just who the pilot is, we've learned that he's apparently walked out of the hospital...

(The camera shows a clear shot of the pilot's face. Prince's expression becomes ghostly.)

...and is now listed as missing. Reporting from our field...

(Prince runs out of the lounge and down the hallway. He goes through the swinging doors and is grabbed by the pilot on TV, the Alien Bounty Hunter. The assassin slams the doctor up against the wall by the neck.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Where is he?

LANDON PRINCE: I don't know!

(The Bounty Hunter pushes him down onto the ground and kneels over him. He pulls his head back and takes out a small metallic tube, called a gimlet. A long, sharp point shoots out of the front of the tube and the Bounty Hunter poises to strike down with it. The doctor struggles against his attacker, but to no avail. The assassin shoves the point into the back of the doctor's neck, which leaks a green fluid and bubbles. The Bounty Hunter then gets up and rips off the cover to the electric box, which sparks and catches fire. The room burning behind him, he walks out nonchalantly as the alarm rings and the hallway fills with smoke.)



SCENE 4
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is leaning over his desk when Scully comes in and takes off her coat.)

MULDER: I have been looking for you.

SCULLY: I was just down the street. Someone fired more shots at the White House last night.

MULDER: You got to wonder about a country where even the President has to worry about drive-by shootings.

(He walks over to his computer and sits down. She stands next to him.)

SCULLY: What are you working on?

MULDER: I found these in my e-mail this morning... three obituaries.

SCULLY: Sent by whom?

MULDER: Nobody I know but obviously somebody who knows me.

(He clicks on a few keys and the text box expands on the monitor.)

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: The deceased are Doctor Landon Prince of Scranton, Pennsylvania...

(He expands another box.)

Doctor Dale Gayhart of New York City...

(He brings up the third obituary.)

...and Doctor Harvey Buchanon of Tea Neck, New Jersey. All worked in abortion clinics. They died in separate arson fires.

SCULLY: Sounds like the work of militant right-to-lifers.

MULDER: Sounds like it.

SCULLY: Why would somebody send them to you?

MULDER: It's taken me all morning to figure that out.

SCULLY: What did you find?

(Mulder walks over to his desk and hands Scully a picture of Prince.)

MULDER: This is the latest victim, Doctor Landon Prince. And these are the other two victims... Doctors Gayhart...

(He hands her another picture. The man is identical to Prince in every respect.)

...and Buchanon.

(She is given a third picture of another identical man.)

SCULLY: Triplets?

MULDER: Nope. I can't find any blood connection between them. In fact, I can't find any records on them at all. It's as if before they died, they never existed.

SCULLY: What?



SCENE 5
SCRANTON, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder and Scully are standing with the federal marshall, who is looking over a folder.)

FEDERAL MARSHALL: Doctor Prince performs legal, clinical abortions which seems to be having its own share of occupational hazards these days.

MULDER: You don't know anything else about him?

FEDERAL MARSHALL: Nah, he went about his work quietly. None of his family's come forward.

SCULLY: What about the man you arrested, this, uh, preacher?

FEDERAL MARSHALL: Reverend Calvin Sistrunk. He's got a motive, he's threatened these abortion docs before. He was carrying this when we arrested him.

(He hands Mulder a clip from a newspaper with an advertisement that has a picture of Prince and reads "Do you know this man? Call (212) 555-2884.")

We're hoping for an indictment.

MULDER: As soon as you locate Doctor Prince's remains.

FEDERAL MARSHALL: Yes... but that fact hasn't been released.

MULDER: Well, there have been two identical fire deaths. Neither body has been found.

FEDERAL MARSHALL: We're quite certain he was in the building. His car was in the parking lot. We found his keys in the stairwell where the fire was started. He's been missing since the incident. Could be we'll just be finding teeth and bone.

(The door opens behind Scully and an officer leads in Reverend Sistrunk.)

CALVIN SISTRUNK: Good afternoon.

(He sits down.)

FEDERAL MARSHALL: Reverend Sistrunk... these are Agents Scully and Mulder. They want to ask you...

CALVIN SISTRUNK: ...if Doctor Prince burns in hell's fire for his murder of the unborn? If his damnation is God's will?

MULDER: Is that what you think, Reverend?

CALVIN SISTRUNK: I guess it's a question of opinion.

MULDER: Well, it's my opinion that whoever killed Doctor Prince will also be linked to two other murders. How do you feel about that?

CALVIN SISTRUNK: There are those who endorse the killing of the heathen sinner in God's name, but I, sir, am not one of them.

MULDER: Have you been to New York or New Jersey in the past two weeks?

CALVIN SISTRUNK: No, sir.

(Mulder shows him the advertisement.)

MULDER: This clipping, where'd you get it?

CALVIN SISTRUNK: From the newspaper. Obviously, there are more of God's soldiers seeking this man for judgement.

MULDER: Which newspaper?

CALVIN SISTRUNK: The local paper, up in Binghamton.



SCENE 6
GLOBE AND MAIL; BINGHAMTON, N.Y.

(The woman at the desk is looking at the advertisement.)

WOMAN: Oh, yeah. I remember this one. The man who placed this payed cash.

SCULLY: Would you recognize his face?

WOMAN: I might.

(Scully shows her a mugshot of Sistrunk.)

No. That's not him.

MULDER: Do you have a record of his name or address?

WOMAN: No, we don't. He wouldn't sign anything. In fact, he called and asked to place that ad a second week, so we did but he never came back to pay.

MULDER: Thank you.

WOMAN: Sure.

(The agents walk away.)

SCULLY: I've got a bad feeling about this case, Mulder.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Well, nothing about it makes sense. We've got three deaths of identical victims, no bodies, a virtual non-suspect...

MULDER: Sounds just like an X-File.

SCULLY: You don't even know who sent you that information. I mean, we've been set up before.

(Mulder looks at a map. He goes over to it, Scully following.)

MULDER: If somebody really wanted to set us up, would they give us this little to go on? There's something bigger here, Scully. I'd be willing to bet there are more of these guys out there.

SCULLY: More victims?

MULDER: Unless we get to them first. The deaths follow a pattern... New Jersey, New York, Scranton...

(He puts his finger on the map and moves it to the next city as he says the name.)

...and then an ad is placed here in Binghamton looking for a man exactly like the others. The killer's moving in a northernly direction.

(He looks over at the woman.)

Uh, eh, uh... excuse me? Excuse me.

(She looks at him and they walk over to her.)

The, uh, number in the ad, is th... would that be a voice mail?

WOMAN: Yes, it is.

MULDER: How, how would you access that?

WOMAN: Well, you'd start by paying the bill.

(Mulder looks at Scully and takes out his wallet. He gives Scully the ad, who walks over to the phone. Mulder gives the woman his credit card.)

Dial the number, then press twelve-thirty six.

(Scully does so. The woman walks to the back. Mulder paces a little.)

SCULLY: There's twenty four messages responding to the ad. The first caller has seen the man in the photo in Syracuse.

(Scully takes a pen and pad out.)

MULDER: That's north.



SCENE 7
FBI FIELD OFFICE; SYRACUSE, N.Y.

(Agent Barrett Weiss picks up the phone.)

BARRETT WEISS: Special Agent Weiss.

MULDER: Yeah, this is Agent Mulder. I need to enlist your help.

BARRETT WEISS: Shoot.

(He takes out a pen and starts to write down what Mulder says. Cut to Mulder and Scully, who are walking out of the post office.)

MULDER: I'm heading your way with Agent Scully. We have reason to believe a man in your area may be in danger. His name is Doctor Aaron Baker, he's living somewhere in Syracuse. We need you to find him and sit on him...

(They get to their car. Cut back to Syracuse.)

...until we get there.

BARRETT WEISS: You got it. I'll call you back with an address as soon as I track him down.



SCENE 8
737 26TH STREET; SYRACUSE, N.Y.

(Weiss pulls up to the house, looks at his paper, then goes to the front door. He is about to knock when he hears talking.)

AARON BAKER: There were years, years when our people did get along, where we could share in the entire planet.

(Weiss looks through the window.)

But you seem to be...you seem to be unwilling to share.

(A man puts his hand on Baker's shoulder.)

I don't understand, I don't understand! You did not fail...

(Weiss starts back down the stairs. The Bounty Hunter throws Baker against the wall, holding him by the throat.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Your plans will not succeed.

(Weiss walks around to the back door. The Bounty Hunter slams Baker's face into the wall and flicks open his gimlet. As Weiss continues to sneak around the house, Baker falls to the floor, dead. Weiss slams open the door and points his gun at the Bounty Hunter, much to the assassin's surprise.)

BARRETT WEISS: Federal agent, drop your weapon! I said drop it!

(He hears a bubbling and looks down to see Baker's body turn into a green liquid, bubbling and oozing. The "body" starts to deteriorate. Weiss is reasonably confused.)

What the hell...

(The assassin raises his hand to throw the gimlet but Weiss shoots him three times in the chest. The assassin does not move, merely leaks the same green liquid that Baker and Prince had. Weiss stares at him in awe until he starts gagging and choking. He screams, holding his head. Mulder and Scully pull up to the house. They walk up the porch and knock on the door. Agent Weiss comes up behind them.)

Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes, Agent Weiss?

(Weiss takes out his badge.)

BARRETT WEISS: Yes, sir.

MULDER: Did you find Doctor Baker?

BARRETT WEISS: No, I'm afraid not. No one's home. There's two weeks worth of mail in the mailbox.

MULDER: Uh, we may already be too late but we should take a look around anyway.

BARRETT WEISS: Not much to see.

(Mulder and Scully walk around the house. Weiss puts his badge away and walks back to his car. Opening the trunk, he looks at the real Barrett Weiss, dead, naked except for his underwear, bound and gagged. His eyes, nose and mouth are inflammed. "Weiss" looks around, then his facial features and body mass change to that of the Alien Bounty Hunter's. The Bounty Hunter throws the keys down on the dead agent, then closes the trunk and walks away.)



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner, sitting at his desk, pushes a button on the phone and the secretary is heard on the other end.)

SECRETARY: Agent Mulder has arrived.

SKINNER: Send him right in.

(Mulder walks in.)

Agent Mulder, please have a seat.

MULDER: Sorry I'm late, I just flew in.

SKINNER: From?

MULDER: Syracuse.

(He sits down.)

SKINNER: Where you were doing what?

MULDER: Agent Scully and I were following up a lead on a case.

SKINNER: Did anyone authorize this investigation, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: No, sir.

SKINNER: Do you have paperwork on this case?

MULDER: No, sir. I'd assumed we had an understanding with respect to the X-Files.

SKINNER: I'm sure it doesn't surprise you, Agent Mulder, that the people I have to answer to aren't quite so understanding. Particularly when one of their field agents is found dead.

MULDER: What?

(Skinner stands.)

SKINNER: Special Agent Barrett Weiss.

(He tosses a photograph at Mulder of Weiss' body.)

Out of the Syracuse office. His body was found stuffed in the trunk of a car in front of a house that you sent him to.

(Mulder looks at the photograph in disbelief.)

MULDER: It's impossible... I spoke to Agent Weiss, I saw him at the house.

(Skinner pounds his fists on the desk and gets in Mulder's face.)

SKINNER: Save it, Agent Mulder, save it for your report because until this matter is cleared up, your butt and mine are in a sling and your investigation, official or otherwise, is terminated.

MULDER: Sir...

SKINNER: Don't underestimate the seriousness of this matter, Agent Mulder. A man is dead.

(Mulder stares down towards the floor as Skinner sits down.)

I want a full accounting on my desk in the morning.

(Mulder nods and walks out.)



SCENE 10
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder walks into the office to the phone's ringing. He throws his jacket across the room and picks up the phone, sitting down.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: Where are you?

(Cut to Scully, who is sitting at her desk in front of her computer, her glasses on.)

SCULLY: I'm at home.

MULDER: Agent Weiss is dead, Scully.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Somebody killed him and Skinner hit the roof. We're being grounded until he gets a full accounting.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

I just wish I knew what the hell was going on.

(Cut to Scully, who looks at the computer screen.)

SCULLY: Have you checked your e-mail this morning, Mulder?

MULDER: No, why?

SCULLY: Because I received something unsettling and I wondered if you'd gotten it too.

(Cut to Mulder, who starts typing on his computer.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: It's a digitally scanned photograph. There's another one, Mulder.

(A picture slowly comes up of another identical doctor.)

His name is Doctor James Dickens.

(Cut to Scully.)

And Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: He's right here in Washington.

(The e-mail message on her computer next to the picture reads:

"Mail 485723
DATE: -- Image enclosed
TO: D_Scully@FBI.gov
FROM: 82974@anon.server.ca

Dr. James Dickens, Washington D.C."

Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Stay where you are, Scully, I'll be right there to pick you up.

(He hangs up.)



SCENE 11
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder pulls up and sees someone standing on the porch. They pass each other on the walkway and the man looks back.)

AMBROSE CHAPEL: Agent Mulder?

(Mulder looks back.)

My name is Ambrose Chapel.

(He walks up to Mulder, showing his badge.)

I work with the Central Intelligence Agency. I need to talk to you about the case you're working on.

(Mulder looks at his badge.)

MULDER: What case is that?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: The murder of certain identical victims. I have a story to tell, Agent Mulder. Believe me, you want to hear it.

(Inside, Scully and Chapel are sitting across from each other. Mulder is standing away from them.)

We've known of their existence for a decade. We had no idea they were in the country until last year.

SCULLY: Who are they?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: We're working on vague intelligence reports but it appears early in the Cold War, Soviet scientists stumbled onto genetic anomaly in sets of identical twins. They were able to isolate the specific DNA material that gave the twins their facial features, hair color, texture... and they were able to reproduce it.

(Mulder is behind Scully now, having walked around during Chapel's rant.)

SCULLY: Are you saying these men are clones?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: By all outward appearances.

(Scully and Mulder look at each other.)

MULDER: How did they get here?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: The program went by the codename "Gregor"... the name given to every clone. We believe the original Gregor came here sometime in the mid-70's on a German passport. Using that same document, they were able to bring a small cadre of clones into the country. Several of which have obtained strategic positions in the medical establishment.

MULDER: For what purpose?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: In the event of war, they would mobilize simultaneously at different facilities across the U.S. to contaminate blood supplies, sabotage pharmaceutical factories... essentially destroy the country's immune system.

(He takes a sip of water.)

SCULLY: If you've known about this for a year, why hasn't anything been done?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: Well, this is where the story gets perhaps even more incredible. In a secret agreement, someone is allowing the Gregors to be systematically eliminated by a man who I believe is a Russian spy killer in exchange for the absolute suppression of the program's existence and to obtain the science that created it.

MULDER: What's your business in this?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: I believe we share similar sentiments on our government's policies of denial which is why they've been trying to contact you.

SCULLY: Who?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: The Gregors. You've obviously got a reputation as someone who might protect them and bring these misdeeds to light.

(Mulder looks at Scully.)

MULDER: What makes you think we've been contacted?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: Your inquiries into their deaths...

(Chapel pulls out a piece of paper and Mulder picks it up.)

And your response to the ad I placed.

(On the paper is a copy of the same advertisement as in the newspaper. Mulder sits down.)

We're talking state-sanctioned murder. If we can find them first, maybe the truth can be known.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other.)

MULDER: We know where one of these man may be.

(Chapel smiles and nods slightly.)



SCENE 12
GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND

(A van is running outside. Dickens takes his briefcase off of a machine and looks at four large green vats. He pushes a few buttons and walks out. The name on the door is "3243 Edmonton." He gets in the van and looks at a young woman in the driver's seat.)

JAMES DICKENS: Okay, let's go.

(They drive off.)



SCENE 13
DICKENS' APARTMENT

(The van pulls up the apartment complex. They walk in and Dickens puts down his briefcase. Outside, Mulder, Scully and Chapel get out of a car. Dickens is hanging up his labcoat as someone knocks on the door.)

JAMES DICKENS: Who is it?

SCULLY: Agents Scully and Mulder, we're with the F.B.I.

(The woman grabs her coat and walks out of the room. Dickens opens the door and sees the two agents.)

MULDER: Doctor Dickens?

JAMES DICKENS: Yes?

MULDER: I believe you've been trying to contact us.

JAMES DICKENS: Uh...

(Chapel steps into view and glares at the doctor.)

SCULLY: May we come in, Doctor Dickens?

JAMES DICKENS: Um...

(He starts to back away from the door, staring at Chapel in fright.)

MULDER: It's okay, sir, there's nothing to be afraid of!

(Dickens turns and runs across the room. Mulder chases him. He jumps out the window and lands on the ground from about four stories up. The three look out the window at Dickens' body.)

SCULLY: I'll call the paramedics...

(She runs off. Dickens stirs.)

MULDER: He's moving... he's getting up!

(Dickens stands up, adjusts his glasses, and starts running. Mulder and Chapel walk away from the window.)

SCULLY: I'll call you back.

(She hangs up and goes to the window to see Dickens running down the street, followed by Chapel and Mulder. Mulder runs directly after him, but Chapel stops and turns right. Scully runs out the door as the woman watches her from behind the curtains. Dickens runs out into the street and Mulder follows. An oncoming car honks and crashes into Mulder, sending him flying up into the windshield, which cracks. Mulder rolls down off the hood and lands in the street, groaning and grabbing his side. Scully runs up to him and kneels down. He sits up.)

You okay?

(Mulder whispers as he talks.)

MULDER: Okay. I just got the wind knocked out of me. Don't lose him! Go!

SCULLY: Okay...

(She runs off as the driver gets out of the car and goes to Mulder.)

MAN: Are you all right?

(Dickens runs down an alley and looks at the fence in front of him. He looks back to see Chapel standing at the entranceway. Chapel slowly stalks towards him. Dickens looks around and sees a fire escape. He climbs up onto the dumpster and pulls down the ladder, a look of terror on his face. Chapel reaches up and grabs Dickens foot. Dickens gasps and is pulled down, but Chapel's face is no longer there, replaced by the Alien Bounty Hunter's. Scully runs down the alley and looks around, seeing no one. She takes out her gun and walks slowly down the alley. A man groans and she looks towards the dumpster, where Chapel stands up from behind it. She sighs in relief and lowers her gun.)

AMBROSE CHAPEL: He's gone.

SCULLY: Where?

AMBROSE CHAPEL: He blindsided me. Went up the fire escape before I could grab him. I'm going to go see if I can find a way up on the roof.

(He walks away. Scully watches him, warily, then looks around, walking to behind the dumpster. She steps in something and looks down to see a puddle of green liquid. She tries to wipe it off her foot and walks away. The puddle, clearly in the shape of a fallen body, starts to bubble and fizz as it turns into gas.)



SCENE 14
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is walking to his desk as Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

MULDER: Like I should've used the crosswalk. A lot better than my phone.

(He sits down and waves his decimated cellular phone. She takes off her coat and puts down her briefcase.)

SCULLY: Maybe we should've dropped this case when you were told.

MULDER: Scully, if what our friend from the C.I.A. says is true, this could blow the lid off one of the biggest national security conspiracies ever.

SCULLY: Our friend from the C.I.A. is about as unbelievable as his story... as is everything about this case. I mean, whatever happened to "trust no one," Mulder?

MULDER: Oh, I changed it to "trust everyone." I didn't tell you?

(He stands and pulls out a folder from a stack.)

I ran a full background check on this guy. Ambrose Chapel is a seventeen-year veteran, special intelligence clearance. He's the real thing, Scully.

(He hands her the folder. She opens it and looks at it. There is a picture clipped onto the file.)

SCULLY: Why would a man with his experience need our help... and how could he let a man that he's been looking so hard for slip away so easily? You know, that doctor wasn't running away from us, Mulder, he was running away from Agent Chapel.

MULDER: I think you're being overly paranoid about him, Scully.

SCULLY: Paranoid. Have you stopped to consider that maybe it was Agent Chapel who killed that field agent in Syracuse?

(Mulder walks to his desk.)

MULDER: Is that what you want me to put on my report to Skinner? Because I would be more than happy to have you explain that to him.

SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, that is not my job.

(She throws down the folder.)

You'll pursue a case at the expense of everything, to the point of insanity, and expect me to follow you. There has to be somewhere to draw the line.

MULDER: Three identical men are dead. A fourth identical man is alive and on the lam. If the pursuit of this case seems like insanity to you, feel free to step away from it.

SCULLY: An F.B.I. agent died because of our pursuit of this case.

MULDER: Those are the risks we take. You either accept them or you don't. We all draw our own lines.

(He sits down. Scully stares at him, then looks away.)

SCULLY: I have to show you something.

(She reaches into her briefcase and pulls out a shoe with a part of the sole melted off.)

I got these a week ago.

(She hands the shoe to Mulder and sits down on his desk.)

I stepped in something last night that ate clean through the sole. Now, maybe I'm being paranoid, but it was in the exact spot where this man Chapel said the doctor escaped.

(Mulder is pushing a pencil through the hole.)

MULDER: Why don't you send it to our lab guys for analysis?

(He hands the shoe back.)

And while you're at it, why don't you arrange for an autopsy bay?

SCULLY: An autopsy bay?

MULDER: In putting together my report for Skinner, I came across something I think you'll appreciate. Whoever killed that field agent in Syracuse was so clever, no clear cause of death can be established.

(Scully looks at him in disbelief.)



SCENE 15
AUTOPSY BAY; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Agent Weiss is layed out on an examining table with a sheet over him. Scully is reading off of a clipboard. Mulder is standing off to the side.)

SCULLY: There's no penetrating knife or gunshot wounds. No ligature marks or abrasions from strangulation. The toxicologocial is clean... and the blood work... well, the blood work is strange.

(Mulder looks over her shoulder at the file.)

MULDER: Strange how?

SCULLY: Well, there's evidence of polycythemia, excessive production of red blood cells.

(Mulder walks around to the other side of Weiss.)

MULDER: How excessive?

SCULLY: Extremely. The doctor who made this report has it in here that the blood was curdled like jelly. As if something caused the blood to thicken or clot prior to death.

MULDER: Due to what?

SCULLY: Possibly a coagulating agent introduced into the body, but it would've shown up on the toxicological.

(Mulder walks back over.)

MULDER: Didn't Agent Chapel say something about these doctors being able to contaminate the blood supply? Couldn't one of those contaminants have been used to kill this man?

SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder, I... there was a doctor's bag I took as evidence from the apartment.

(A man walks in.)

MAN: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

MAN: Assistant Director Skinner's been looking for you.

MULDER: All right, I'll be right there.

(The man walks out.)

Check the bag. See if you can find anything that'll connect.

SCULLY: Well, Skinner's going to want to know why you didn't file your report. What're you going to say?

MULDER: Just the truth. I got hit by a car.

(He smiles and walks out.)



SCENE 16
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is writing at his desk when Mulder walks in, carrying a folder.)

MULDER: I'm sorry this is so late. I had trouble with the, uh, data from the, uh, autopsy...

(Skinner walks over to him.)

SKINNER: That's not why I called you in here, Agent Mulder. Uh... your father's been trying to reach you. There's been a family emergency.

(Mulder looks at him, surprised.)

MULDER: Thank you.

(He walks out.)



SCENE 17
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is on the phone, it is ringing. A woman picks up.)

MRS. MULDER: Hello?

MULDER: Mom?

MRS. MULDER: Fox. Is that you?

MULDER: Yeah, I, I didn't expect you to answer. Wha, what are you doing at Dad's? Is he all right?

MRS. MULDER: Yes. Let me put him on.

WILLIAM MULDER: Hello?

MULDER: Dad?

(He sits down.)

I got a message there was a family emergency.

WILLIAM MULDER: Yes, I received a very strange phone call this afternoon. I called your mother. We think it's important that you come up here as soon as possible.

MULDER: Can you tell me what this is about?

WILLIAM MULDER: I'll know more when you get here.

(He hangs up. Mulder, confused, hangs up as Scully walks in, carrying the briefcase.)

SCULLY: I didn't find anything much to go on but we've got an address.

(Mulder gets up.)

MULDER: Check it out, I'll call you as soon as I can.

SCULLY: Where you going?

MULDER: Home.

(Mulder grabs his coat and leaves. Scully looks at the tag on the briefcase which reads:

"NAME: Dr. James Dickens
ADDRESS: 3243 Edmonton Street.
CITY: Germantown.")



SCENE 18
3243 EDMONTON STREET

(Scully pulls up in front of the building, which looks to be one in a series of warehouses. She opens the door slowly and walks in, her gun in hand. She steps in something and looks down to see a lot more of the same green liquid on the floor. She keeps walking through it nonetheless and sees the giant room with the four large vats of the green liquid. One is pushed over with a resounding crash by Agent Chapel, better known as the Alien Bounty Hunter. The room is in complete shambles. The small bags with tubes attached that were in the vats litter the floor. Chapel looks down at one and steps on it, watching the green liquid pour out and smiling to himself. He hears footsteps and turns to see Scully's shadow moving back down the hall. Following the shadow, he sees the outer door close. He walks out just as Scully speeds away.)



SCENE 19
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully paces back and forth, the phone to her ear. Mulder's machine picks up.)

MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

(It beeps.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I need to talk to you immediately. I've got some new information on this case.

(She walks over to the window and looks through the blinds. She sees a gray car parked outside.)

Mulder, I think I'm in danger. I'm in my apartment and I think I've been followed.

(She hangs up.)



SCENE 20
MARTHA'S VINEYARD; WEST TISBURY, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder gets out of his car and runs up the walkway to the front porch. His father sits in a chair off to the side.)

WILLIAM MULDER: Your mother needs some time.

(Fox looks at him as he lights a cigarette.)

MULDER: You said it was an emergency.

(William stands and walks over to him. Fox goes to hug him but William extends his hand. Fox shakes it, disappointed.)

WILLIAM MULDER: She wanted you to come. It's a difficult time. I appreciate your coming on such short notice.

MULDER: What is it, Dad?

(William takes a puff of his cigarette.)

WILLIAM MULDER: The certainty... becomes a comfort that allows you to move on.

(Fox looks through the window and sees his mother, crying, talking to someone.)

We bury our memories so deep after all that has been destroyed... never expecting...

MULDER: Who is Mom talking to?

(William takes another drag off his cigarette.)

WILLIAM MULDER: Your sister.

(Mulder looks in the window, then back at his father in disbelief. He runs into the house. The door slams shut behind him as he walks into the living room. His mother and the woman stand up. Samantha walks up to Mulder, and it is the same woman that we saw with Dickens.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Fox.

(She nods. Mulder just stares blankly at her. At sunrise, Fox's mother is in bed and Fox closes the shades.)

MRS. MULDER: After all those sleepless nights, now I can hardly keep my eyes open.

(He fluffs her pillow. He lays her down and tucks her in.)

MULDER: You're exhausted. We all are. It's after 5:30.

MRS. MULDER: Oh, I just need a couple of hours.

(He turns off the lamp and kisses her forehead.)

MULDER: Try and get some sleep.

(He walks over and closes the other shades. She sits up.)

MRS. MULDER: Fox...

MULDER: Yeah, Mom?

MRS. MULDER: It is really her...

(She stares at him, waiting for a response.)

Isn't it?

MULDER: I... I don't see who else it could be.

(They stare at each other.)

Now go to sleep.

(Mulder walks out on the front porch and closes his eyes. The birds chirp and he looks to his right. Samantha is sitting in the chair, draped in a blanket. She smiles brightly.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Is it too late for a game of Stratego?

(Fox laughs.)

MULDER: It's twenty-two years too late.

(He walks towards her.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: I don't think Dad can think of anything to say. He just... sat here.

MULDER: So much has happened. Where do you begin?

(She stands and looks out into the yard.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: I must have been nine or ten when I was returned. I had no memory. I was placed with a family who raised me as a daughter.

MULDER: Who were they?

SAMANTHA MULDER: I knew they weren't my parents but I didn't remember Mom or Dad..or you.

MULDER: But you came to remember... us.

SAMANTHA MULDER: I started having trouble several years ago. It was diagnosed as free-floating anxiety. Nothing worked for me. I hit rock bottom... until I underwent regression hypno-therapy. And it all started coming back...

(She starts to cry.)

The abductions, the tests...

(They hug and Mulder looks about to cry as well.)

I'm in danger, Fox.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SAMANTHA MULDER: You've been contacted. You know there's a man hunting my father and the other doctors.

MULDER: Your f... your father.

SAMANTHA MULDER: My adoptive parents. They're only visitors here... what people would call "aliens." A bounty hunter's been sent to kill them. You've met this man. His lies to you have caused others like my father to die. He won't stop until he's killed them all and anyone who tries to stop him. He'll come for me soon.



SCENE 21
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully walks out of her bathroom, running suit on, takes her fanny-pack, and leaves. She closes the door and the phone rings a few seconds later. The machine picks up.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi, this is Dana Scully.



SCENE 22
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder is on the other end.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: Please, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

(The machine beeps.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's Mulder, pick up the phone. Okay, if you're screening, pick up the phone, I need to talk to you.

(He sighs.)

All right, do not under any circumstances trust the C.I.A. agent. Your life may be in danger, now call me.

(He hangs up. Samantha sits, watching him.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: She may not be able to recognize him.

(She stands.)

He has the ability to disguise himself.

MULDER: Disguise himself how?

SAMANTHA MULDER: As anyone.

MULDER: As anyone? You got to be kidding.

SAMANTHA MULDER: No. You can't recognize him, but I can.



SCENE 23
BUS STOP

(Scully runs up to a bus stop as the bus pulls up. She gets in, deposits her change, and looks around. Not seeing Chapel, she pulls off her hood and sits down in the back of the bus. She looks at all the men and pulls her cellular out of her fanny-pack. She dials a number.)

MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message, please.

(It beeps.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I just left my aparment and I don't think I've been followed. I'm going to be staying at the Vacation Village Motor Lodge off the I-90 in Germantown. Now, by the time you reach me, I should have some very important information for you regarding this case.

(She hangs up. A few seats down, watching her, is the Alien Bounty Hunter.)



SCENE 24
3243 EDMONTON STREET

(Scully sneaks over to the building she was in before and takes out a small gun with a long metal stick in the front. She puts the stick into the keylock and pulls the trigger. The door unlocks. She slowly opens the door to the room and sees the lab is still in shambles. She splashes through the liquid on the floor and bends down at one point, looking at one of the small bags with the tubes attached. Picking up the tube, she sees a small alien-shaped figure in the bag. She stares at it. After a few seconds, it moves. She stands up, looking at it in awe as a man, looking exactly the same as the other clones before, looks at her through the barrels off to the side. She hears him moving around and looks at him. He starts running. She puts down the bag and gives chase.)

SCULLY: Wait.

(She takes out her gun and he stops at a wall.)

Stop! Federal Agent! Put your hands against the wall. Do it!

GREGOR CLONE #1: You won't shoot me.

SCULLY: Put you hands against the wall... now.

(He turns around.)

GREGOR CLONE #1: You cannot harm us.

SCULLY: Sir...

(The wall turns out to be a sliding door, which he moves to reveal a stairway and a few hallways.)

GREGOR CLONE #1: It's all right.

(Two more clones walk down the stairs and another comes in from the right.)

We are the last remaining. Unless you protect us, we are already dead.

(She stares in amazement. Later, there are police cars swarming outside. Scully is walking with another agent.)

SCULLY: These men are to be held in maximum security protective custody. No visitors, no press, no anybody... okay?

FBI AGENT: Yeah. Can I ask? Who are these guys?

SCULLY: I'll let you know when I figure it out myself.

(She walks away. He gets into one of the cars. There is a Gregor in different back seats to each car. Scully walks over to the first one, who looks back at her as they drive off. From the rooftops, the Alien Bounty Hunter watches Scully.)



SCENE 25
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder plays back his machine. Samantha stands off to the side.)

SCULLY ON MACHINE: ...I should have some very important information for you regarding this case.

(It beeps. He dials a number. It rings.)

MAN: Vacation Village.

MULDER: Yeah, I need to speak to Dana Scully, please.

(Cut to the Vacation Village Motorlodge in Germantown.)

MAN: Just a moment.

(He scans down the guest list. Cut back to Mulder's apartment.)

I'm sorry, there's no one registered by that name.

MULDER: All right, I need her to call Fox Mulder as soon as she checks in, okay? Fox Mulder.

MAN: Fox Mulder.

MULDER: Yes.

(Cut to the Vacation Village Motorlodge.)

MAN: Will do.

(He hangs up and picks up a pencil and pad. The pencil tip breaks off.)

Now who's this message for?

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: I'd like a single for one night, please.

MAN: Uh... see what I got.

(Scully walks into her room and chainlocks the door. She goes into bathroom and starts running a shower. She grabs a towel and closes the door. The cellular phone inside her fanny-pack rings.)



SCENE 26
FEDERAL STOCKADE; TILESTON, VIRGINIA; 7:05 PM

(A guard walks down the hallway past the jail cells. A Gregor is seated in each one. He opens the door at the end and looks at another one. The federal marshall walks in.)

FBI AGENT: Whose post is this?

GUARD #1: Mine, sir, we're on changeover.

FBI AGENT: I'm going to talk to the prisoners.

(They walk over to the door.)

Oh, you want to get me a coffee... sugar and milk, no cream.

(The guard hands him the keys.)

GUARD #1: Do you want me to keep an eye open?

FBI AGENT: No, just get me the coffee.

GUARD #1: Yes, sir.

(The marshall unlocks the door and walks in. The guard locks the door behind him. The marshall walks over to the first clone's cell. He is sitting a pensive state but slowly looks up at the marshall. The marshall turns his hand around to reveal the Bounty Hunter's gimlet. It flicks open. The marshall is obviously the Bounty Hunter in disguise.)



SCENE 27
VACATION VILLAGE MOTORLODGE; GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND

(THE TIME IS 11:21. Scully is asleep. There is a knock on the door and she wakes up. Turning on the lamp, she gets out of bed.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

MULDER: Scully, it's me.

(She pulls back the curtain slightly and looks out the window. She walks over and opens the door.)

I got your message.

SCULLY: Where've you been?

(Her cellular phone rings.)

Hang on...

(She walks away from Mulder and picks it up.)

Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, it's me, where are you?

(Scully's body becomes tense.)

Scully? Are you there?

(She slowly turns to see Mulder closing the door.)

Scully?

(Her breathing becomes heavy as she stares at the Mulder standing in front of her.)

                                    END GAME



SCENE 1
BEAUFORT SEA; 67 MILES NORTH OF DEADHORSE, ALASKA; USS ALLEGIANCE;
CRUISING DEPTH 1,000 FEET

(The captain of the submarine runs down a hallway passing officers.)

OFFICER #1: Sir.

(He salutes. The captain keeps moving.)

OFFICER #2: Captain.

(He salutes as well. The captain goes to a ladder and climbs up it to the control room. He moves over to a man at the radar station.)

CAPTAIN: What have you got?

RADAR OFFICER: I'm not quite sure, sir. We picked up some paint approximately two minutes ago.

(The captain looks at the radar screen.)

CAPTAIN: Looks like the damn thing's just hanging there.

RADAR OFFICER: Yes, sir. It's approximately two-hundred meters below the ice. Looks to be about eighty meters across and it's noisy.

CAPTAIN: Noisy, how?

RADAR OFFICER: It's emitting radio signals across the spectrum but it's... it's just random noise, sir. We can't detect any pattern.

CAPTAIN: Get me Pacific Command on the satellite uplink.

RADAR OFFICER: Yes, sir.

(He stands and adjusts some controls. The captain gets on the phone.)

CAPTAIN: Yes, admiral. I don't know what we found but it appears to be some kind of craft.

(Some murmuring is heard through the phone.)

Yes, sir, that's correct.

(More murmuring.)

But we're on a cartography mission, admiral. My crew isn't prepared to...

(Murmuring.)

Yes, sir.

(More murmuring.)

Understood, sir.

(He hangs up and walks over to the control panel.)

Set a course heading 0-4-7.

(The man at the panel starts flipping switches. The captain moves back over to the radar officer.)

RADAR OFFICER: Toward the object, sir?

(The captain picks up the phone.)

CAPTAIN: Weapons room.

(A man is heard over the phone.)

MAN: Aye, sir.

Lock torpedoes on target. Prepare to fire on command.

RADAR OFFICER: Captain, shouldn't we at least attempt to identify this object first?

CAPTAIN: We have our orders, Lieutenant.

RADAR OFFICER: But, sir...

(A loud buzzing suddenly starts. The officers cover their ears and the ship rumbles. People scream to each other as consoles start exploding, knocking people and papers over. The buzzing grows louder. Finally, it stops.)

MAN: Everything's down, negative!

(People still scream to each other as the red warning lights come on.)

CAPTAIN: Reactor's gone down.

(He picks up the phone.)

MAN: Over here...

CAPTAIN: Engine room?

(The lieutenant stands up.)

RADAR OFFICER: That won't work, captain. We've only got battery power.

(The captain hangs up the phone.)

CAPTAIN: I'm going down there. Prepare to surface at once!

(He runs back down the stairs. The radar officer looks around.)

RADAR OFFICER: Surface into what? We're under thirty-two feet of glacial ice.

SCENE 2
VACATION VILLAGE MOTORLODGE; GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND

(Scully stands, ear to the phone. We see Mulder standing behind her, but Mulder is also on the phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Scully? Are you there? Scully? What's going on?

(She slowly turns around and looks at Mulder. He mouths the words "who is it?")

SCULLY: No, sorry.

(She hangs up.)

MULDER: Who was that?

SCULLY: It's a wrong number. Where have you been, Mulder? I've been trying to get a hold of you.

MULDER: I, I was trying to reach you. I went by your house but you weren't there. I got here as quickly as I could.

SCULLY: Why didn't you call when you got my message?

MULDER: I, I, I did call. I, I couldn't get through.

(She turns around, grabs her gun and aims it at Mulder.)

SCULLY: Put your hands against the wall.

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?

SCULLY: I said put your hands against the wall!

MULDER: What's wrong?

SCULLY: Do it!

MULDER: Scully, it's me...

(He turns around and puts his hands against the wall. Scully moves up to him.)

SCULLY: I don't know who you are.

MULDER: Okay, I'm going to take my left hand and reach into my pocket and get my I.D., okay? Just don't shoot me. I got shot once and I didn't much care for it.

SCULLY: I said keep your hands up.

(Mulder spins around and backhands her with his left then punches her with his right as he spins, sending her flying into the near wall. Her nose is bleeding. She slumps down against the wall as "Mulder" walks up to her.)

MULDER: Where is he?

(She reaches for her gun but Mulder grabs her by the throat and lifts her above his head against the wall with one hand.)

That was him on the phone, wasn't it? Tell me where he is.

SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.

(He throws her up and she breaks through a glass table. He looks down at her and his face morphs to that of his true identity, the Alien Bounty Hunter. Later, there is a knocking on the door.)

MULDER: Scully?

(He breaks open the door. The room is dark. He tries the light switch, but it won't work. Samantha is standing behind him in the doorway.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: He's been here.

(He picks up the lamp and turns it on. He looks down at the broken table. Samantha walks over to him.)

Your partner is alive.

MULDER: How do you know?

SAMANTHA MULDER: He took her to get me.

MULDER: There's no sign of a break-in. She wouldn't have just let him in.

SAMANTHA MULDER: She might not have known who he was. She might have thought it was you.

(They start walking back to the car.)

He's going to contact you. He's going to say he wants to make a trade, your partner's life for mine.

MULDER: Why, why does he want to kill you?

SAMANTHA MULDER: Because I know how to kill him.

MULDER: How?

SAMANTHA MULDER: By piercing the base of his skull.

MULDER: That would kill anybody.

SAMANTHA MULDER: Yes, but this is the only way to kill him and it must be precise. I'm fairly sure it'll work.

MULDER: Fairly sure?

SAMANTHA MULDER: He's got powers I've never seen before. If it doesn't work, there's a chance you could die.

MULDER: From what?

SAMANTHA MULDER: Their blood is toxic, human exposure to it is fatal.

(Mulder looks away, thinking.)

I know this must seem incredible to you...

MULDER: No, no, no, no, no... that's just it. It doesn't seem incredible at all. Now, how do we find him?

SAMANTHA MULDER: We don't. He'll find us.



SCENE 3
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(THE TIME IS 12:38. Mulder paces around his apartment as Samantha sits on the couch.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: He'll call.

MULDER: You're sure?

SAMANTHA MULDER: I know what he wants.

MULDER: And if he doesn't get it?

SAMANTHA MULDER: I know this is hard for you, Fox...

MULDER: No, it's not hard. It's unbelievable.

SAMANTHA MULDER: You don't believe me.

MULDER: After twenty-two years, why come back?

SAMANTHA MULDER: I've explained to you...

MULDER: No, no, you've explained only what you had to! I know next to nothing about these people you call your parents or about the man who wants to kill them.

(She stands.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: The men you've been seeking are the progeny of two original visitors, clones who have been attempting to establish a colony here since the late 1940's.

MULDER: A colony?

SAMANTHA MULDER: Loosely. The community, by necessity, is dispersed. There are clones identical to my parents living in virtually every part of the country.

MULDER: What are they trying to accomplish?

SAMANTHA MULDER: It's their belief that our stewardship of the planet is being forsaken, and that by default, they'll someday become the natural heirs.

MULDER: And in the meantime?

SAMANTHA MULDER: Through hybridization, they've been working to erase that aspect which has forced the community to scatter... their identical natures.

MULDER: All the clones worked in abortion clinics, why?

SAMANTHA MULDER: Access to fetal tissue. Though the biologies are incompatible, they finally found a way to combine human DNA with alien DNA.

MULDER: And this man... why has he been sent to kill them?

SAMANTHA MULDER: The experiments weren't sanctioned. It was considered a dilution of their species, a pollution of their race. So a bounty hunter was dispatched to destroy them and terminate the colony.

MULDER: That's a good story... but I've heard a lot of good stories lately.

SAMANTHA MULDER: I've got no reason to lie to you. I'm your sister, Fox, you have to trust me.

(They look at each other. There is a knock on the door. Mulder picks up his gun off the table, takes it out of the holster and walks to the door.)

MULDER: Who is it?

SKINNER: It's Skinner.

(Mulder looks at Samantha, who runs off to the side.)

Mulder?

MULDER: The door's open.

(Skinner opens the door and sees the apartment is dark. He walks in and looks at Mulder, who is sitting on the couch.)

Make yourself at home.

(Samantha takes a sharp object out of a kitchen drawer. It has a wooden handle with a long metal point sticking out of it.)

SKINNER: What's going on here, Agent Mulder? Why are the lights out?

MULDER: Orders from my opthamologist.

SKINNER: Are you all right?

(Samantha starts to sneak up behind him.)

MULDER: Yeah, I'm fine.

SKINNER: I've been trying to reach you and Agent Scully.

MULDER: I haven't checked my messages.

SKINNER: Are you aware that Agent Scully incarcerated four men with the federal marshal's office? And those men are now missing?

(Samantha flicks on the lights. Skinner turns around and Mulder stands, pointing his gun at Skinner.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: It's all right, it's not him.

(Mulder sighs in relief and puts the gun down.)

SKINNER: What the hell is going on here, Mulder?

(Both Fox and Samantha walk towards Skinner.)

MULDER: This is my sister, Samantha Mulder.

SKINNER: What?

MULDER: I haven't had time to explain, Agent Scully is missing.

SKINNER: What do you mean, missing?

(The phone rings. Mulder picks it up.)

MULDER: Hello.

(Cut to Scully, bruised and battered, blood over a good part of her face, standing in a phone booth. The Bounty Hunter skulks around the booth.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

(Cut to Mulder, looking up in shock.)

MULDER: Scully, where are you?

(He signals to Samantha, who picks up the phone and listens.)

SCULLY: I don't know, I'm... I'm in a telephone booth.

(Cut to Scully.)

He's got my gun, Mulder. He says he's going to kill me if you don't give him what he wants.

(Cut to Mulder. Skinner watches Mulder, unsure of what's going on.)

MULDER: Well, what does he want?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: A woman who's with you. He says you'll know what I'm talking about.

(Cut to Mulder, who's looking at Samantha. She nods.)

MULDER: All right, tell him we'll negotiate.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: He doesn't want to negotiate. He says he wants to make a trade.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: All right, let me speak to him.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: He wants you to be at Memorial Bridge at Bethesda in one hour.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, I need time, I need more time than that.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(The Bounty Hunter presses down on the switch, hanging up. Cut to Mulder, who hangs up his phone angrily. Samantha hangs up as well.)

SKINNER: Where is she? What's this about a negotiation?

MULDER: We don't, we don't have any time. If I ever needed your help, your trust, I need it now.



SCENE 4
OLD MEMORIAL BRIDGE; BETHESDA, MARYLAND

(Mulder and Samantha drive onto the bridge and stop near the middle. Skinner and a sharpshooter are in the bushes. The sharpshooter is building his sniper rifle.)

SKINNER: Mulder's in position.

(He looks through his binoculars.)

MULDER: We just need to get him out of the car. Make him think we're going to make a trade. We just need one shot.

SAMANTHA MULDER: To the base of the neck.

MULDER: These guys can hollow out a dime at two-hundred yards.

(They look to see another car pulling up.)

And, Samantha. Do not take any unnecessary risks out there.

(She nods. He unbuckles his seatbelt and gets out of the car. The car pulls up and Mulder walks towards it. The Bounty Hunter steps out, gun in hand. He yanks Scully out and grabs her, holding the gun to her head.)

Scully?

(They walk slowly towards him.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Bring her out.

(Mulder stares at him, then looks back at Samantha. They look at each other, then Samantha gets out of the car and walks up to Mulder. They stare at each other. Samantha nods slightly, then starts walking towards the Bounty Hunter.)

SKINNER: Take your shot when you got it.

(Samantha and Scully look at each other.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Step close. Right up close.

(She slowly moves up to him. Through the rifle's scope, we see him push away Scully and grab Samantha. Scully runs over to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, you all right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: I'm okay.

(The Bounty Hunter puts his gun away as Scully gets into the car. The Bounty Hunter slowly inches his way back towards his car. Mulder follows. In the scope, we see that Samantha and the alien are moving behind a column. Samantha looks at Mulder then spins around and attacks the Bounty Hunter with the same weapon she was going to use on Skinner.)

SHARPSHOOTER: I lost the shot.

(The Bounty Hunter grabs Samantha again. Mulder aims his gun.)

MULDER: There's no way out. We've got both sides of the bridge covered. Now let her go.

(He slowly walks towards them. The Bounty Hunter whispers in Samantha's ear.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Tell me where she is.

MULDER: Let her go!

(In the scope, the Bounty Hunter slowly moves into the shot. A shot rings off and the Bounty Hunter staggers. Samantha moans as the Bounty Hunter topples over the side of the bridge and they both plummet into the water. Mulder runs over to the side.)

Samantha! Samantha!

(Morning. Two scuba divers jump off a raft.)

RAFT DRIVER: Spread out.

(The divers move away from the raft.)

Clear!

(He drives off. A car pulls up next to Mulder who is leaning on the railing. Scully gets out.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: You should be in the hospital, Scully.

SCULLY: I was discharged an hour ago and I asked to come here. Have they found anything yet?

MULDER: Nothing yet. You think she could've survived?

SCULLY: Maybe... but the water's thirty-six degrees.

MULDER: Well, maybe she went into hypothermic shock. I've heard about people who have lived after being stranded in water like this... eight to ten hours.

SCULLY: Mulder, why didn't you tell me on the phone that it was her?

MULDER: I couldn't tell you.

SCULLY: Why not?

MULDER: Cause you'd never let me go through with it.

SCULLY: Are you sure that it's your sister?

(He spins around and looks at her.)

MULDER: Why would you even question me on that?

SCULLY: Because back at the motel, Mulder, it was you but, but it wasn't you.

MULDER: Well, it was her.

(He starts walking. She follows him.)

SCULLY: Well, then who is this man and what does he...

MULDER: He's an alien.

(He opens his car door.)

SCULLY: Is that what you're going to tell Skinner?

MULDER: I already told Skinner, that was the easy part. Now I got to tell my father.

(He gets in.)



SCENE 5
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder opens the door and his father is standing there.)

WILLIAM MULDER: You didn't have me come all this way to give me good news.

(Mulder turns away.)

What is it, Fox?

MULDER: Samantha's gone... Dad. I lost her.

(William walks in.)

WILLIAM MULDER: What do you mean, you lost her?

MULDER: There was a man... he was holding my partner hostage in exchange for Samantha.

WILLIAM MULDER: You let this man take your sister. Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?

(Fox turns back.)

MULDER: I, I can't explain it to you, but, um... I believed I was doing the right thing, Dad.

WILLIAM MULDER: Was this your decision?

MULDER: Yes. I'll tell Mom.

WILLIAM MULDER: Do you realize what losing her again is going to do to your mother?

(They look at each other. Fox is about to cry.)

Do you?

(Fox tries to say something but can't. He looks down at the floor, crying.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.

(William goes to leave when he pulls an envelope out of his pocket.)

WILLIAM MULDER: Your sis... Samantha left this at the house for you.

(He puts it down on the table and leaves, slamming the door shut. Mulder walks over to the envelope and opens it. He takes out a letter and a keycard to a clinic that says 4A. The letter reads:

"If anything should happen to me or if we become separated, you must meet me here:
1235 91st St.
Rockville, Maryland")



SCENE 6
WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES CLINIC; ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND

(Mulder pulls up in his car. As he gets out of the car and walks up the stairs to the gate, his cellular phone rings. He takes it out and turns it on.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Scully is on the other end.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: Scully, she left a path in case we got separated. I think she's alive.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I think you should come back as soon as you can.

MULDER: Why? What'd you find?

SCULLY: It's your sister.

(In the background, a team of agents takes Samantha's body off of a raft.)

We just pulled her body out of the river.

(Cut to Mulder, who's face turns to a combination of shock and sadness. Cut back to Scully.)

Mulder, I'm so sorry.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Are you sure?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah.

(She sighs.)

You know... whatever you're feeling, you can't blame yourself.

(Cut to Mulder, who exhales deeply.)

MULDER: What about a second body? Did you find a second body?

(Cut back to Scully. The agents carry the body up the hill.)

SCULLY: No, not yet.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'll be there as soon as I can.

(He starts down the stairs slowly.)



SCENE 7
OLD MEMORIAL BRIDGE; BETHESDA, MARYLAND

(A female and male agent run around from the back of the FBI ambulance to Scully.)

FEMALE AGENT: Agent Scully? There's something you need to see.

SCULLY: What is it?

FEMALE AGENT: It's the body we pulled from the water. Something strange is happening.

(Scully and the two others run up to the truck. Scully swings open the doors to see Samantha, her face green and bubbling. The three look on in horror and disbelief as Samantha's face fizzes and starts to cave in.



SCENE 8
WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES CLINIC; ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND

(Mulder stands on the stairs, thinking. He turns back and runs the keycard down through the sensor. The door opens and he walks in. He looks around the room, which is full of boxes, and hears a beeping. He takes out his gun and walks towards the beeping. Stopping at a stairwell, he hears some noise downstairs, which is where he moves. He moves into a room where a person is standing at a desk. He points his gun.)

MULDER: Federal agent. Put your hands where I can see them and turn around. Slowly.

(The person turns around.)

Who are you?

(She takes off her goggles and doctor's mask. It is Samantha. Mulder lowers his gun.)

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #1: She's dead, isn't she?

MULDER: What the hell is going on?

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #1: Come, please. There's not much time.

(She opens a door.)

MULDER: Who are you?

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #1:Please.

(Mulder tentatively walks into the room and sees another Samantha clone standing at a computer, green vats all around her.)

MULDER: It was all a lie.

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #1: We needed your help. We knew you could be manipulated.

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #2: He'll be coming. We must hurry now.

MULDER: Who?

(Another Samantha clone walks up behind him, this one in a lab coat.)

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #3: The man who's been sent to kill us.

MULDER: He's dead.

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #1: How do you know?

MULDER: He was shot. In the back of the neck!

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #2: How did he die?

MULDER: He fell off a bridge... with one of you.

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #3: Then we don't know for sure. You could have been followed. Come with me.

(She walks out of the room.)

This way, Agent Mulder.

(Mulder looks at the first clone then follows her down the hallway to a door. The third clone slides her keycard down a sensor and opens the door.)

The rest of us are dispensable.

(Another clone steps out.)

She was the first. The one from which we all came. The one you must save.

(Mulder realizes that Samantha was indeed not Samantha, that they were all alien clones.)

MULDER: I'm not your savior.

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #4: You must help us. You have no choice.

MULDER: No, I... I do have a choice and my choice is to walk out of here.

(He starts to walk away.)

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #4: We know where your sister is.

(Mulder turns back.)

Ask yourself, Agent Mulder, how else would we know so much about her?

(A fire alarm goes off.)

SAMANTHA MULDER CLONE #3: He's here.

(She starts to walk away. Mulder turns back and walks down the previous hallway, gun in hand. He walks down a hallway flooded with smoke, coughing. He reaches a doorway and when he turns to go through, he is met with an open fist by the Bounty Hunter. Mulder goes down, nearly unconscious. The Bounty Hunter flicks open his gimlet and steps over Mulder's body. He looks down the hallway, then goes back the way Mulder came. Mulder groans on the floor. The fire trucks arrive. Firemen run around, some pulling out hoses, some running into the building as it burns. A fireman runs through some fire and comes across Mulder.)

FIREMAN: I found one!

(He kneels down and starts to help Mulder up, who is coughing.)

Sir, we're going to get you out of here.

MULDER: What about the others?

FIREMAN: We got real lucky. There are no others.

(He leads Mulder up the stairs.)

MULDER: No. Wait. There were women in here.

FIREMAN: We looked. You're the only one here.

MULDER: No. You've got to keep looking...



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is typing up her report. We hear her speaking over it.)

SCULLY: After being treated for smoke inhalation, Agent Mulder was released from Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition. At his request, the abortion clinic where he was found has been searched repeatedly but the bodies of the women he insists perished there were not found. My report on this case remains incomplete. Many aspects continue to defy explanation including the identities of the identical men and women. Agent Mulder's claim of alien origins cannot be substantiated. The man suspected in their disappearances is still at large...



SCENE 10
US MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

(A man in a quarantine containment suit is standing over Weiss' body, which has been dissected. Stitch marks run around Weiss' neck and down his chest. He picks up a scalpel off a tray. Scully can still be heard.)

SCULLY: ...and has now been charged with the death of F.B.I. Special Agent Barret Weiss, whose body has been quarantined at the U.S. Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Weiss' cause of death involved a thickening of the blood. It is now believed that he was subjected to a virulent strain of virus whose origin and behavior are also unexplainable.

(A man in a labcoat, Able Gardner, walks in with Scully, talking.)

It is my hope that further analysis of this contagion will aid in the solution of this case.

(Scully looks through a microscope at a sample of Weiss' blood, which has many long blue viruses in it.)

This is a retrovirus?

GARDNER: Yes, but none of us here have ever seen anything like it. Do you recognize it?

SCULLY: Was the thickening of Agent Weiss' blood an immunological response to the virus?

(Gardner walks around Scully to a computer.)

GARDNER: Apparently. When the body's exposed to it, it triggers a massive production of red blood cells. Now, take a look at this.

(A picture comes up on the screen of blood with a few blue viruses in it.)

We took a second culture and were able to control it's growth.

SCULLY: What did you do to it?

GARDNER: All we did was lower the temperature by five degrees fahrenheit.

SCULLY: So the virus is inhibited by cold.

GARDNER: Knocked out by it. For some reason, this retrovirus goes dormant at cold temperatures.

SCULLY: We pulled a body from the river yesterday that was chilled near freezing. When it started to thaw, it began to corrode.

GARDNER: Corrode?

SCULLY: If you find out anything else, you let me know as soon as possible.

(She walks out as the man in the containment suit works on Weiss in the back.)



SCENE 11
KENNEDY CENTER; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(X walks around the side of the building and walks up to Mulder. He is wearing a tuxedo.)

X: You wanted to see me?

MULDER: How was the opera?

X: Wonderful, I've never slept better. I don't like these hasty public meetings, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I'm sorry. I need your help.

X: It's over. The fat lady is singing.

MULDER: I need to know what you know.

X: Okay, they're all dead.

MULDER: No. One of them is alive, the one who was sent to kill them. Where is he?

X: A nuclear submarine located his craft in the Beaufort Sea five days ago. They were ordered to destroy it but they were disabled. An attack fleet left port from Anchorage this morning to make sure this man does not leave.

MULDER: I got to get up there.

X: You'll only win the war if you pick the right battles, Agent Mulder. This is a battle you can't win.

(He walks away.)



SCENE 12
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Scully knocks on Mulder's door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me, are you there?

(She looks down and sees two newspapers stacked. She kicks one, then unlocks the door and goes inside. Sitting down and putting her coat on the chair, she goes to his computer and turns it on. The modem dials a number. She looks at his window and sees an "X" in masking tape on it. The computer beeps and she sees a small box that reads:

"Message Notice
E-mail message waiting
Mulder, 000517"

She double-clicks on it and it expands to an e-mail to Scully with the heading:

"MAIL-238479
TO: Dana Scully, 001813
FROM: Fox Mulder, 000517"

We hear Mulder reading the letter.)

MULDER: Scully, when you get this message, I will be too far away for you to stop me, but where I'm going I cannot allow you to follow. I won't let you jeopardize your life and your career for reasons purely personal to me. You were right, Scully... you said a line has to be drawn somewhere. I'm drawing it for you here. I'll contact you when I can.

(She gets up.)



SCENE 13
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner sits at his desk, writing. Scully opens the door.)

SCULLY: Sir?

(He looks at her.)

I'm sorry to come unannounced, sir, but your assistant wasn't at her desk.

(He stands.)

SKINNER: What is it, Scully?

SCULLY: May we speak off the record, sir?

SKINNER: About?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder.

(He walks over and closes the door.)

He's gone.

SKINNER: Where?

SCULLY: I don't know, I was hoping that you could tell me or help me to find out.

SKINNER: When I spoke to Agent Mulder the day before yesterday, he said he was going to take some time off.

SCULLY: He told me the same thing but I don't think this matter with his sister is settled. Sir, is there any way that you can reach him through unofficial channels?

(He thinks about this.)

SKINNER: I can't help you, Agent Scully.

(He turns back towards his desk.)

SCULLY: Please?

(He looks back at her.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, you and I both have a greater responsibility to consider and that is to the F.B.I. Agent Mulder's actions in this case are in violation of his duties, his oath of trust and bureau protocol. He's risked my position, your life.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder has saved my life!

SKINNER: If he wanted or expected you to the same, he would have told you where he was going.

(He walks back to his desk and sits down.)

Please close the door on your way out, Agent Scully.

(She stares at him for a few seconds, then leaves. Skinner picks up his pen to write, then slams it down and looks back at the door.)



SCENE 14
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Scully turns on Mulder's desk light and shines it through the window on the "X." Later on, she falls asleep. There is a knock on the door and she wakes up. She opens the door and sees X standing there. X is surprised to see her.)

SCULLY: Where is Mulder?

X: Sorry, I must have the wrong apartment.

(He starts walking down the hall. Scully walks after him.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder? I need to know, damn it!

X: I'm sorry, you've mistaken me for someone else.

SCULLY: I'm losing time!

(He presses the button on the elevator and gets in.)

X: I'm sorry. I can't help you.

(The door closes. X lets out a deep breath and looks down at the floor. The elevator stops and the door opens. X goes to leave but his path is barred by Skinner.)

Excuse me.

SKINNER: Did you tell her what she needed to know?

(X looks at him with a strange face, then goes to pull out his gun in realization. Skinner grabs him by his trenchcoat and slams him up against the back wall of the elevator.)

How hard do you want to make this?

X: No harder than it has to be.

(X headbutts Skinner then punches him with a right hand, knocking him back. X once again goes to pull out his gun but Skinner grabs him and punches him in the gut. He then delivers his own headbutt and throws him into the corner. He grabs him by the trenchcoat again but before he can pick him up, X points his gun in Skinner's face. Skinner as a big cut on his forehead.)

I've killed men for far less.

SKINNER: You pull that trigger, you'll be killing two men. Now I want to know where Mulder is.

(There is a knock on Mulder's door. Scully opens it and sees Skinner standing there, looking ragged and disheveled. Blood runs down the side of his face from the cut. His nose and lips are bloody.)

Agent Mulder took a commercial flight to Tacoma, Washington. From there, he caught a military plane to Deadhorse, Alaska.

(Scully looks at him, shocked. She motions for him to come in. He does so and walks over to the table.)

He used his F.B.I. credentials to charter a Rollagon all-terrain vehicle. It's still a ten-mile hike across the ice.

(He leans over and writes something down on a piece of paper.)

These are the coordinates of his final destination.

(He hands the paper to Scully.)

SCULLY: How did you get this?

SKINNER: Unofficial channels.

(Mulder looks at a small digital control he has that charts his location. Carrying a flashlight, he walks a little farther and sees the top of the submarine sticking out above the ice. He walks around and climbs up the ladder. He opens the hull door and climbs inside. The room is dark and quiet. He takes off his hood and unzips his coat. He shines his flashlight around the equipment. No signs of life. He shines it down on the floor and sees a man lying dead. Moving the flashlight more, he sees two more men slumped down on the floor. Suddenly, there is a bang and footsteps.)

MULDER: Hey!

(He runs after the noise, gun in hand.)

Stop!

(He walks down a ladder and looks tentatively down the hallway. There is another bang and he turns to see a man running down a hallway a few doors down. He runs after him and sees another ladder going down. He hears a clang to the left of him and goes toward it. There are a few more bangs and he spins around to see a man wedged in between a pipe and a wall. The man gasps.)

Who are you?

MAN: Lieutenant Terry Wilmer.

MULDER: Step out of there!

(The man slowly starts to move out of his spot.)

Come out!

(He moves out from between the pipe and the wall. Afterwards, the man is sitting down at a desk, the flashlight in front of him, shining in his face. Mulder is standing in back of him and to the right. When the man speaks, it is very shaky, like whimpering.)

What happened to you?

MAN: I don't know. We, uh... we just lost power. We, we... we drifted under the ice for days. Then, um... then we hit a...

(He turns his head towards Mulder, who points his gun.)

MULDER: Don't look at me, face forward!

(The man turns back.)

MAN: We hit a shallow patch and punched through, okay? That's what happened.

MULDER: So why did you run?

MAN: A man came. He, um... he sealed most of the men below decks without any air and, uh... and then he started to execute the rest of us.

(Mulder moves directly behind him. The man is crying.)

Every... they're all dead. I, uh... I thought you were him, I didn't know if you were him.

MULDER: How is it you managed to survive?

MAN: I hid under the body of a chief petty officer, okay? I, uh... I played dead.

(Mulder flips a switch and the submarine regains power. The man looks around and hears a clicking. He looks to see that Mulder has handcuffed him. Mulder holds the gun to the back of the man's neck.)

What's this for? What are you, crazy?

MULDER: No. I'm just tired and you're not getting back to your ship until I get the truth. Now tell me where my sister is.

MAN: I don't know what you're talking about.

MULDER: Base of the neck! Now, you tell me how I can find her and I'll let you get back to your ship before it's destroyed!

MAN: Please... please...

(His voice suddenly changes to a very strong tone.)

You're making a really big mistake.

(He tosses Mulder across the room. The man stands and Mulder looks up at him. The man suddenly grows taller and his features change. He is the Alien Bounty Hunter. Mulder looks on in awe as the Bounty Hunter tugs at the handcuff and tosses Mulder back the other way.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: If I wanted to, I could've killed you many times before.

MULDER: Where is she?

(The Bounty Hunter throws him back down to the floor.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Is the answer to your question worth dying for? Is that what you want?

MULDER: Where is she?

(Mulder is thrown back to where he was. He groans and coughs.)

Just tell me where she is.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: She's alive. Can you die now?

(The Bounty Hunter starts dragging him out the door, knocking over the chair. Mulder grabs his gun off of the floor and shoots the Bounty Hunter in the back. The alien leaks green and looks back at Mulder, who screams in pain as the toxic gases attack him. Mulder is dragged up the hull and thrown onto the floor. The assassin starts to climb back down, looks at Mulder and closes the hull, snapping the handcuffs in two. Mulder tries to hang on but drops down to the ice and tumbles beneath the wing. He groans and coughs, his face discolored from the cold and the poison. The riding lights come on. The wing turns and assumes a vertical position. The sub starts to sink, the wing speeding down at Mulder, about to chop him in half. With the last of his strength, he rolls out of the way.)



SCENE 15
EMERGENCY ROOM; EISENHOWER FIELD

(Scully bursts into the emergency room. Mulder is sitting in a tub, an oxygen mask on. The people are talking in the background.)

NURSE: No change in B.P. or pulse.

(Scully looks at Mulder and holds up her badge.)

SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I'm Agent Mulder's partner. What are his vitals?

(The doctor walks over to her.)

DOCTOR: He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.

SCULLY: No... you've got to get him out of the tub.

DOCTOR: He's dying, he's lost all his body heat.

SCULLY: You've got to listen to me! If you keep him in there, you're going to kill him! The cold is the only thing that's keeping him alive.

(Mulder flatlines.)

NURSE: His heart stopped!

DOCTOR: Give me one amp of epinephrine in a cannula!

SCULLY: You don't know what you're dealing with here! Agent Mulder has been exposed to a retrovirus resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome.

DOCTOR: I want you out of my E.R. right now. Nurse!

(A nurse walks over to her.)

NURSE: Yes, doctor. Ma'am...

SCULLY: His blood has thickened...

NURSE: Ma'am...

SCULLY: That's why his heart is failing!

(The doctor spins around.)

DOCTOR: No, his heart is failing because he's lost all his body heat!

SCULLY: No, the only thing saving him right now is the hypermetabolic state induced by the cold. Now, if you don't do what I'm saying, you are going to kill him!

(The doctor stares at her for a second. She takes off her coat.)

Let's get him out of that tub now.

(The doctor holds an oxygen mask over Mulder's mouth as Scully readies the defibrillators.)

MAN: A hundred joules, charged and ready.

SCULLY: Clear!

WOMAN: Clear.

(She puts the defibrillators down on Mulder's chest and they go off. Still no pulse.)

No rhythm.

MAN: Charge?

DOCTOR: No.

SCULLY: Clear!

WOMAN: Clear.

(Scully tries again. A slight pulse picks up.)

DOCTOR: I'm picking up a faint pulse.

(Scully puts the defribillators down.)

SCULLY: I want a digoxin 0.1 milligram I.V. Hang a heparin drip at 1,000 units per hour. And get him two units of fresh frozen plasma now.

(The nurse runs off to do so.)

DOCTOR: This patient's not even in...

SCULLY: He's going to make it.

(She runs her hand through his hair.)

MAN: Let's get the plasma going. Okay, let's get a second line ready.

OTHER MAN: Push the adrenaline...

(Later, Mulder lays on his hospital bed, oxygen tube in his nose. Scully sits at his bedside. We hear her voice over the scene.)

SCULLY: Transfusions and an aggressive treatment with anti-viral agents have resulted in a steady but gradual improvement in Agent Mulder's condition. Blood tests have confirmed his exposure to the still unidentified retrovirus whose origin remains a mystery. The search team that found Agent Mulder has located neither the missing submarine nor the man he was looking for.

Several aspects of this case remain unexplained, suggesting the possibility of paranormal phenomena... but I am convinced that to accept such conclusions is to abandon all hope of understanding the scientific events behind them. Many of the things I have seen have challenged my faith and my belief in an ordered universe...

(Later, a nurse opens the door to Mulder's room for Scully, who sits down at his bedside. He no longer has the oxygen tube and is looking much healthier than before.)

...but this uncertainty has only strengthened my need to know, to understand, to apply reason to those things which seem to defy it. It was science that isolated the retrovirus Agent Mulder was exposed to, and science that allowed us to understand its behavior. And ultimately, it was science that saved Agent Mulder's life.

(Mulder groans. Scully looks up at him and smiles. He slowly turns to look at her.)

Hey. How you feeling?

(Mulder can only whisper.)

MULDER: Like I got a bad case of freezer burn. How did I get here?

SCULLY: A naval reconnaissance squad found and choppered you to Eisenhower Field.

(He nods.)

Thanks for ditching me.

MULDER: I... I'm sorry, I... I couldn't let you risk your life on this.

SCULLY: Did you find what you were looking for?

MULDER: No. No. But I... I found something I thought I'd lost. Faith to keep looking.

(She smiles.)

[THE END]
                                          FEARFUL SYMMETRY



SCENE 1
IDAHO MUTUAL INSURANCE TRUST, FAIRFIELD, IDAHO

(Two janitors are cleaning the lobby after hours. A radio is playing, and the younger one is dancing with his mop. The older one looks over at him.)

JANITOR 1: [They don't pay you to dance, Roberto!]

JANITOR 2: Okay, okay.

JANITOR 1: (pointing overhead at the security camera) [God is watching.]

JANITOR 2: Okay.

(The first janitor lays a cigarette on end on the floor. The floor begins to shake and the cigarette vibrates across the floor tile. The security camera shakes in its support, and a loud thumping is heard. The first janitor turns off the radio, and he and second janitor look toward the large front window. Suddenly it shatters. They duck, then run to the window to look outside. A path of destruction works its way up the street. First a car is crushed, then a street sign is bent and a sidewalk stand is crushed. A second car is then crushed and shoved onto the sidewalk. The janitors look on in amazement. The first janitor crosses himself.)

JANITOR 1: Santa maria san locos.

(Some road construction men are drinking coffee when they hear an approaching rumble.)

WORKER 1: What the hell is that?

(They see nothing, but the road barricades leading to them are crushed one by one.)

WORKER 2: Hey! Get out of the way!

(They scatter except for the first worker who stays in the roadway. He is suddenly thrown backward and there is the sound of an angry elephant. The other men go to their fallen co-worker.)

WORKER 3: He's hurt bad, man!

WORKER 2: Hurry up! Get an ambulance!

(It is early morning and a truck tractor is bob-tailing down a highway in the fog. The driver calls in on his CB radio.)

BREWER: (to CB) This is Wesley Brewer out on Route 7. Looks like About an 8:00 ETA on that trailer pickup. This fog's gonna slow me down.

DISPATCHER: (on CB) 10-4, Wesley.

(Out of the fog ahead, an elephant suddenly appears, heading straight for the tractor.)

BREWER: Mother of God!

(He slams on the brakes, and the tractor comes to a stop inches from the elephant. The elephant moves alongside the cab and stares at Brewer for a moment, then moves on.)

(Two state police cars speed down the highway, sirens blaring. They stop at a group of people standing on the road. A young child is crying. They approach the elephant, lying on its side in the road.)

WOMAN: She was just lying there when we found her, officer.

(The elephant is alive but unable to get up. As the young child continues to cry, another child kneels in front of the animal. The elephant moans.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Scully is outside the Idaho Mutual Trust Building, interviewing the two janitors.)

SCULLY: So you saw nothing when the window broke? No one outside?

JANITOR 1: No.

JANITOR 2: (shaking his head) Nothing.

JANITOR 1: We heard a noise like thunder. Then glass everywhere.

SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.

(The janitors leave. Mulder, who was in the building, climbs out through the broken window frame.)

MULDER: What did the janitors say?

SCULLY: They claim they didn't see anything.

MULDER: That's not surprising. The security monitors don't have a recording of anything either. Just a giant implosion of glass like some kind of giant shock wave.

SCULLY: What the janitors describe sounds more like a sonic boom.

MULDER: No sonic boom did this. (points to the crushed car on the street) The construction worker who was killed had his spine crushed like a string of seashells, a circular abrasion on his torso in roughly the shape of an elephant's foot. Other workers at the site said they felt the ground shake followed by a faint whiff of animal odor in the wind.

SCULLY: Mulder, if you're still suggesting that the elephant did this, it just defies logic. Somebody would have seen it.

MULDER: Well, if somebody would have seen it, Scully, we wouldn't be here. Another vehicle would have left evidence of a collision - distress to the metal, or paint. I can see signs of neither of those things. I'd be willing to admit the possibility of a tornado but it's not really tornado season. I'd even be willing to entertain the notion of a black hole passing over the area ... (Scully gives him a skeptical glance) ... or some cosmic anomaly, but it's not really black hole season, either. (he smiles) If I was a betting man I'd say that it was, uh, ...

SCULLY: An invisible elephant?

MULDER: I saw David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear once.

MEECHAM: Agent Mulder?

(A man approaches who just drove up in a panel truck.)

MULDER: Yeah.

MEECHAM: Ed Meecham, Fairfield Zoo. Sorry for the holdup. We had trouble transporting Ganesha's body this morning.

MULDER: This is Agent Scully.

MEECHAM: (to Scully) Hi.

SCULLY: Have they determined what he died of?

MEECHAM: She. Ganesha was a 12-year-old Indian female. Near as I can figure, she ran herself into exhaustion.

MULDER: How did she escape?

MEECHAM: Well now, there's a puzzle. When I got the call this morning, I expected to find her cage open or something but it was locked tight just like I left it.

MULDER: Any idea how she could have escaped a locked cage?

MEECHAM: No, sir. No signs of tampering.

MULDER: I've read about something called the elephant rebellion in zoos across the country - a high incidence of elephants turning on their keepers, destroying their pens. Was Ganesha ever a problem like that?

MEECHAM: Elephants are very big, very willful animals.

MULDER: So you're saying there were problems?

MEECHAM: Well, the person you're gonna want to talk to about that is Willa Ambrose.

SCULLY: Ambrose?

MEECHAM: She's a naturalist. She was hired by the Board of Supervisors last year to oversee things. Well, now she's supposed to be the reigning authority.

MULDER: Well, let me ask you something. In your opinion, the damage here on the street - could this have been caused by an escaped elephant?

MEECHAM: In my honest opinion?

MULDER: Yeah.

MEECHAM: Sure. Will you excuse me?

(Meecham walks away. Mulder walks along looking at the trash on the street.)

SCULLY: What're you looking for, Mulder?

MULDER: A local paper. I want to see if David Copperfield's in town.



SCENE 3
FAIRFIELD ZOO

(The zoo is open. Mulder and Scully approach a zoo worker.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose.

WORKER: (pointing) There.

SCULLY: Thank you.

WORKER: Sure.

(They approach Willa Ambrose, who is standing with a clipboard along one of the zoo's paths.)

SCULLY: Miss Ambrose?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yes.

SCULLY: I'm Agent Dana Scully. (flashes her badge) This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.

WILLA AMBROSE: How can I help you?

SCULLY: Well, a federal employee was fatally injured last night, and there seems to be a case developing around the elephant that escaped from your zoo.

WILLA AMBROSE: It was my understanding that the eyewitnesses to the accident said that they didn't know how the man was killed.

MULDER: Actually, what we're trying to determine is how Ganesha escaped.

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, what did Ed tell you?

MULDER: He said he found the cage locked, the same way he left it.

WILLA AMBROSE: What more can I say?

MULDER: I don't want to belabor this, but a man was found trampled to death. An animal from your zoo was found 43 miles from here. No one's looking to place any blame, we're just trying to understand the facts that led up to this incident.

(They are now in a concrete building, and Willa shows them a heavy padlock on a seven-foot heavy metal door.)

WILLA AMBROSE: This is where Ganesha was held when she wasn't in her habitat.

MULDER: Who has keys to this lock?

WILLA AMBROSE: Only myself and Mr. Meecham. Otherwise, this is a restricted area. (Scully is looking at the tops of the bars to the cage) Elephants aren't particularly good jumpers if that's what you're thinking.

SCULLY: No, I was just wondering why such a small pen for such a large animal.

WILLA AMBROSE: The zoo was built in the 1940s. The pens and habitats are all too confining. I was brought on to expand and create more humane environments. Unfortunately, these things take time.

(Mulder has been looking at a tie-down ring with chains attached.)

MULDER: Those, uh, chains on the ground there?

WILLA AMBROSE: Those are tie-downs. They're meant to restrict the animal's movement. I disallowed their use when I came to work here.

MULDER: Disallowed their use by whom?

WILLA AMBROSE: It was Ed Meecham's practice. It reflected an old, nonprogressive zoo policy.

MULDER: How's your relationship with Ed Meecham?

WILLA AMBROSE: I'm his boss and I'm a woman, and Ed doesn't like that much.

SCULLY: Would he be vindictive enough to let Ganesha go as an act of sabotage?

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, if he did that would be foolish. The facility is running at a deficit and in danger of losing its funding.

MULDER: Have you spoken about the incident with Ed?

WILLA AMBROSE: No. I think Ed's got enough dealing with the W.A.O.

SCULLY: W.A.O?

MULDER: It's the Wild Again Organization - they're a radical group that believes any captive animal is a crime against nature.

WILLA AMBROSE: Believe me they're gonna have a field day with this one. Excuse me.



SCENE 4
CONSTRUCTION SITE, HIGHWAY 24

(Among the debris from the previous night's accident, Scully and Mulder are talking to Kyle Lang, leader of the local W.A.O. Scully and Mulder are examining some photographs taken of Ganesha lying on the highway.)

KYLE LANG: The W.A.O. believes only tragedy results from keeping animals in captivity. In the wild, an elephant like that would roam an area 20 square miles, minimum. Ganesha weighed in excess of 5000 pounds, and she was being held in a 50 by 50 foot cage.

SCULLY: And you consider that inhumane treatment?

KYLE LANG: It's like you or I living in a pickle barrel.

SCULLY: According to FBI files, you've been arrested over a dozen times for activities involving the kidnapping of circus and zoo animals.

KYLE LANG: The W.A.O. sees it as liberation.

SCULLY: Hmmm. Were you involved in the liberation of Ganesha?

KYLE LANG: That would make me an accessory to murder, wouldn't it? (Scully arches her eyebrows) Endangering these animals is against everything we believe. These are incredibly spiritual creatures. Their rituals and behavior are linked to a past no man ever witnessed. Did you know they actually bury their dead? They can visit an elephant graveyard centuries old and know instinctively where the bones of their ancient ancestors lie.

MULDER: What do you think Ganesha was running from?

KYLE LANG: You want to see what she was running from? I'll show you.

(They are now in the W.A.O. office. Lang is showing them a video of two men forcibly pulling an elephant to its feet. Another younger member of the W.A.O. is in the room with them.)

KYLE LANG: This is how Ed Meecham treats these majestic animals.

MULDER: This is still going on?

KYLE LANG: Ed Meecham's a barbarian. He's been torturing animals at the Fairfield Zoo for years. We figure he's still at it. Eventually we're

gonna get some proof. We're here to put pressure on the zoo. We're keeping track of what goes on there.

MULDER: Even though Willa Ambrose claims that she's put a stop to most of his old practices?

KYLE LANG: Whatever Willa Ambrose's intentions, she's too preoccupied to really know how Meecham operates.

SCULLY: Preoccupied with what?

KYLE LANG: A lawsuit she's fighting against the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla named Sophie. Willa rescued her from a north African customs house ten years ago. Raised her like a child. Now the Malawi government wants her back.

SCULLY: Will they win?

KYLE LANG: This is a perfect example of man's imperialism over the animal kingdom - this craven impulse to turn animals into objects for our own selfish pleasure.

SCULLY: I thought you said she rescued this gorilla.

KYLE LANG: Yeah, rescued her so she could spend a life behind bars. Her obligation should have been to return the gorilla to the wild. All animals should run free.

SCULLY: Even if that means trampling a man to death?

KYLE LANG: Maybe he should have gotten out of the way.

MULDER: I'm sure he would have if he'd seen it coming. Thanks for your time, sir, and we'll get back to you soon.

(Scully appears annoyed at Lang. On their way out, Scully notices a video camera on a shelf.)

(They step out of the W.A.O. office. It is now dark.)

MULDER: It's all happening at the zoo, Scully.

SCULLY: Well, we found our suspects.

MULDER: You think they busted out the elephant?

SCULLY: Well, you heard the man - "all animals should run free."

MULDER: What about all the eyewitness accounts, the security tapes from the video camera, the fact no one saw an elephant until it was miles away from the zoo?

SCULLY: Well, the lights they were using at the construction site were mercury vapor, 10,000 candlepower. They can restrict a man's ability to adjust his vision to the dark. And their security cameras are poor quality. A gray elephant may not have registered an image on tape in the dim light in front of the building.

MULDER: Ah, I'm not buying it, Scully. I think these guys are all talk.

SCULLY: These guys are dedicated to exactly this kind of activity, unabashedly. Did you check out the night vision camera they had lying on the shelf?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: It wouldn't surprise me if they tried to capitalize on their success.

MULDER: By doing what?

SCULLY: By liberating another animal. Willa Ambrose said that the zoo was in trouble financially. A loss of another big exhibit could shut them down entirely.

MULDER: All right. You keep an eye on the W.A.O.

SCULLY: And where are you going?

MULDER: Talk to the animals.



SCENE 5
JOJO'S COPY CENTER

(Mulder is in a satellite conference room. Frohike and Byers are projected onto the screen.)

FROHIKE: Beam me up, Scotty.

MULDER: Did anybody ever tell you the camera loves you, Frohike?

FROHIKE: Yeah, the arresting officers at the "Free James Brown" rally.

BYERS: So what's this costing the taxpayers, Mulder?

MULDER: Uh, about 150 bucks an hour.

FROHIKE: Ouch. Almost as much as Bill Clinton's haircuts.

MULDER: Where's Langley?

BYERS: He has a philosophical issue with having his image bounced off a satellite.

FROHIKE: What are you doing in Idaho?

MULDER: I'm in the town of Fairfield. What do you know about it?

BYERS: They got a little zoo there. Lots of strange lore - animals escaping, disappearing without a trace.

MULDER: Any idea why?

FROHIKE: You're not far from the Mountain Home Air Base. Major UFO hot spot.

BYERS: Weird fact, Mulder. No animal at Fairfield Zoo has ever brought a pregnancy to term.

FROHIKE: Not a cub or a chick.

BYERS: The woman who runs the zoo has a gorilla that knows sign language - supposedly with a vocabulary of 1,000 words.

(Mulder's cell phone rings. Frohike steps toward the camera.)

FROHIKE: If that's the lovely Agent Scully, let her know I've been working out. I'm buff.

MULDER: (smiling) (to phone) Mulder.

(It is the lovely Agent Scully. She is a short distance from the entrance to the zoo.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I was right. I just followed the kid from the W.A.O. to the zoo. He's just about to make it over the fence.

MULDER: All right, I'll be right there, Scully.

(The kid scales the chain-link fence. Scully runs to the fence and climbs over it as well. The kid walks through the zoo, with Scully keeping a discreet distance. The kid climbs over a stone barrier. As Scully approaches the barrier, a hand grabs her shoulder and turns her around. She gasps in surprise.)

ED MEECHAM: What the hell are you doing here?

SCULLY: There's a member of the W.A.O. on the premises.

ED MEECHAM: Come with me.

(They enter a zoo building, as the kid continues through the zoo. He pulls the night vision camera out of a flannel bag.)

(Mulder pulls up at the zoo entrance and he also climbs the fence.)

(The kid walks alongside a tiger's cage, and the tiger snarls at him. Several other animals, including a lion, a cougar, a baboon and several birds, start making lots of noise.)

(Scully and Meecham are still inside a zoo building. They hear the racket outside.)

SCULLY: What's going on?

(In another building, Willa Ambrose looks up as Sophie, in a cage across the room, also become agitated.)

WILLA AMBROSE: (motioning with sign language) It's okay, Sophie. Calm down.

(Outside, the kid points the night vision camera at the tiger and begins filming. Suddenly, there is a blinding light and the kid shields his eyes. When the light fades, the tiger has disappeared. He hears a roar behind him and whirls around but sees nothing. He is knocked to the ground and drops the camera, which is still filming. His face has several large cuts as if he's been clawed. He is then grabbed by the neck and thrashed from side to side, although there is no animal visible. He screams as the camera continues filming.)



SCENE 6
W.A.O. OFFICES

(Scully is questioning Kyle Lang. Several police officers are also in the room.)

KYLE LANG: I don't know what you're talking about.

SCULLY: You have no idea what he was doing at the zoo?

KYLE LANG: If you're asking me if I have any idea of his intentions, the answer is simple. Not the slightest.

(Scully holds up a plastic bag with the night vision camera in it.)

SCULLY: What if I said I saw this camera sitting up there on the shelf yesterday?

KYLE LANG: Guess I never noticed it before.

SCULLY: A tiger is missing, and a member of your organization is dead. For such a principled man, you show an amazing lack of emotion.

KYLE LANG: If the tiger killed this person, then it was a natural act.

SCULLY: Well, if I find evidence that he was releasing those animals under your orders, I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life behind bars.

(Mulder opens the door and enters.)

MULDER: Scully?

(He motions to her. Scully walks out, handing the bag with the camera to an officer at the door. They walk through the building.)

SCULLY: You know, that guy really pisses me off.

MULDER: You okay, Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: You calmed down?

(She shoots him a not-so-pleasant look.)

SCULLY: Have they found the tiger yet?

MULDER: No, but I looked at the cassette from the kid's recorder. He wasn't killed by the tiger.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Unless it's trick photography, that kid was killed by some kind of phantom attacker.

SCULLY: You saw his body, Mulder. That kid was mauled to death. He had deep claw marks on his chest and on his back.

MULDER: I can't explain it either, but I know someone who might be able to.

(Mulder and Scully are walking through a building at the zoo.)

MULDER: Excuse me? Miss Ambrose? May we have a word with you?

(Willa Ambrose is carrying a clipboard and was just going into a room with a "Sick Animal - Restricted" sign on the door.)

WILLA AMBROSE: I don't know anything more than I've already told the police. I have nothing to say.

MULDER: Is this where you keep Sophie?

WILLA AMBROSE: Sophie is ill.

MULDER: You think we could meet her? We're not here to try to take her away from you.

(She opens the door.)

(Sophie is sitting in her cage, moaning.)

WILLA AMBROSE: About six weeks ago I had to take Sophie out of her public habitat. She'd become so withdrawn and depressed, she'd curl into a ball in the corner of her cage and just shiver.

MULDER: Did you ask her why?

WILLA AMBROSE: All the time.

MULDER: What'd she say?

WILLA AMBROSE: "Light afraid." Literally, she's afraid of the light.

SCULLY: She speaks to you?

WILLA AMBROSE: Over 600 words using American sign language. She understands over a thousand. I'll show you her vocabulary list.

(She steps over to her desk.)

SCULLY: Is this who you wanted to speak to, Mulder?

MULDER: It's basic investigative procedure, Agent Scully - interview all possible witnesses.

(Willa returns and hands both of them a piece of paper.)

WILLA AMBROSE: Gorillas are highly sensitive creatures, and Sophie's use of language skills makes her even more so.

SCULLY: Why would she be afraid of the light?

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, you've obviously heard about the trouble with the Malawi government. There's a chance that Sophie could be taken away from me, and I think that she knows that.

(Mulder has been looking at some "drawings" on the wall.)

MULDER: Are these Sophie's?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yes.

MULDER: What do you think they mean?

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, until recently Sophie desperately wanted a baby. The brown object in the center (points to one of the drawings) is her expression of that.

MULDER: Have you tried to mate her?

WILLA AMBROSE: We were looking for a partner but under these stressful conditions I didn't want to put her through it.

MULDER: Do you have a veterinary facility here?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yeah.

MULDER: All right, this may seem like a rather strange request but it might help explain what's been going on here. I'm gonna need your help on this, too, Scully.

(Mulder and Scully are standing on a scaffold, while Willa works below, exposing Ganesha's chest cavity. Scully is wearing gloves and coveralls and a flashlight on her head.)

SCULLY: I hope you know what you're getting us into, Mulder.

MULDER: I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find.

SCULLY: This isn't exactly in my job description.

MULDER: And the next thing you know, they'll be doing it on MTV Sports.

WILLA AMBROSE: (from below) Okay. The elephant's cavity is clear. I'm ready for you.

(Scully climbs down the scaffold to join her.)

WILLA AMBROSE: The knife's right down there.

SCULLY: Okay.

MULDER: I've been told there's never been a successful pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo.

WILLA AMBROSE: Sounds like you've been talking to Kyle Lang.

(Scully takes the knife and kneels down, out of sight. Various squishing noises are heard.)

MULDER: Well, is it true?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yes. But I don't think for the reasons Kyle claims - not because Ed Meecham has done anything to these animals.

MULDER: Why then?

WILLA AMBROSE: Because bringing a pregnancy to term in captivity is always difficult.

MULDER: But a perfect failure rate?

WILLA AMBROSE: I know. It's one of the things I was determined to change when I came to the zoo.

MULDER: Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha?

WILLA AMBROSE: No. Mating an elephant out of the wild is rarely successful. There have only been six elephants born in captivity over the last ten years.

(Scully re-appears with a large piece of elephant tissue that she hands to Willa.)

WILLA AMBROSE: Here's the uterine tissue, but I'm still not clear on what you expect to find.

(Scully is now examining the uterine tissue with a magnifier.)

SCULLY: You're right, Mulder. The signs in the uterus and ovaries are unmistakable.

WILLA AMBROSE: So what did you find?

SCULLY: This animal had been pregnant.

WILLA AMBROSE: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: There's evidence of hyperplasia and the corpus luteum is ruptured.

WILLA AMBROSE: That's not possible.

MULDER: Neither is an invisible elephant.

WILLA AMBROSE: What is going on here?

MULDER: Whatever it is it's been going on for some time, and I think you'll find evidence of the same thing when your tiger returns.



SCENE 7
BLAKE TOWERS CONSTRUCTION SITE, DOWNTOWN BOISE

(Two workmen are carrying a large piece of wood over their shoulders.)

WORKER 1: I still can't believe you bet on the Chargers.

(There is a loud thump in the background. The other worker stops.)

WORKER 2: You hear that?

WORKER 1: Hear what?

(There is a second sound, much closer and sounding more like a roar. The two men look to their right, wide-eyed.)

(Some time later, police and emergency vehicles surround the building. A van pulls up, and Ed Meecham gets out with a rifle.)

ED MEECHAM: Where's the tiger?

POLICEMAN: Somewhere inside the construction site. He's got two men trapped in there.

(Willa, Mulder and Scully approach.)

WILLA AMBROSE: Put the gun away, Ed.

ED MEECHAM: You want to be responsible for another death, Miss Ambrose?

WILLA AMBROSE: I think we can capture this cat without any harm to anyone.

ED MEECHAM: This is no time for wishful thinking.

WILLA AMBROSE: I'm ordering you, Ed.

ED MEECHAM: (with sarcasm) Yes, ma'am. Lead the way.

WILLA AMBROSE: Thank you.

(Willa steps past him. She moves through the construction site, loading a tranquilizer into a gun. Mulder and Scully follow some distance back.)

SCULLY: How'd the tiger get all the way across town without being spotted?

MULDER: I don't know, but we better find it before Meecham does.

(Meecham stands nearby, still carrying his gun.)

(The tiger moves through the building. The two workmen are on a grating just above the animal. Willa Ambrose moves into the same area. The workmen call to her from above.)

WORKER 1: (whispers) Hey! Shhh! It was just here.

(Willa moves slowly through the area. The tiger watches from the shadows, then makes a run at her. Willa hears the tiger roar at the last moment and turns, her hands up. A shot is fired. Mulder and Scully hear the shot and run toward it, finding Meecham lowering his weapon. The tiger is dead at Willa's feet.)

ED MEECHAM: It's all right, Willa. They don't all talk and draw pictures.



SCENE 8

(A sign on the entrance to the zoo reads "Zoo Closed to the Public Until Further Notice." Inside, in a room looking out into the zoo's aquarium, a board meeting is concluding.)

BOARD MEMBER: This last incident has left the Board with no choice but to withdraw all funding.

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, if that's your decision, there's nothing else I can say.

BOARD MEMBER: I'm sorry.

(The board members leave. Willa is near tears, a combination of sorrow and frustration, as Mulder enters and closes the door behind him.)

WILLA AMBROSE: I'm out of a job. They've cut off all funding. The animals are being shipped out to other zoos starting Monday.

MULDER: I'm sorry.

WILLA AMBROSE: It could not have happened at a worse time.

MULDER: You mean for Sophie?

WILLA AMBROSE: What I had going for me was my position here. Having a place for her. Have the results come in on the tiger?

MULDER: Agent Scully just finished the test. The tiger had been pregnant too.

WILLA AMBROSE: It's impossible. Theres no chance those animals could get pregnant. No way.

MULDER: What if they've been artificially inseminated?

WILLA AMBROSE: That's an extremely fine and complex process. I would have known.

MULDER: Unless it was done somewhere else.

WILLA AMBROSE: Where?

MULDER: What do you know about alien abduction?

WILLA AMBROSE: (laughs in disbelief) You're ... you're ... you're kidding me. (Mulder stares at her with no response) You think these animals were taken aboard some space ship?

MULDER: I don't know where they're being taken but there's obviously some problem getting them back. Due to what is probably an astrological variation, a trouble with the time-space continuum - these animals that are being taken from locked cages are being returned roughly two miles westsouthwest of the zoo.

WILLA AMBROSE: Aliens impregnating zoo animals?

MULDER: Yes, and harvesting the embryos.

WILLA AMBROSE: Why?

MULDER: Maybe their own Noah's ark? To preserve the DNA of these animals that we're depleting to extinction. Whatever it is, that's probably the reason why you've never had a successful birth at this facility.

WILLA AMBROSE: I think that's the most ridiculous thing I've heard.

MULDER: I understand that you might think it's ridiculous. Maybe you should ask Sophie.

WILLA AMBROSE: You think this is what she's so afraid of?

MULDER: I believe she's pregnant, and she's afraid of them coming for her baby.

(Mulder and Willa are standing at the door of Sophie's cage.)

WILLA AMBROSE: (signing to her) Sophie, come here. I want to ask you a question. It's okay, Sophie. Come here.

(Sophie makes a motion with her arms.)

MULDER: What'd she say?

WILLA AMBROSE: She says, "man, woman - hurt." She thinks you or your partner are going to hurt her or me. Sophie ... (signs again) ... man, woman are here to help you. They want to know about Sophie's baby.

(Sophie moans and seems uneasy.)

MULDER: Can I ask her a question?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yeah.

MULDER: Will you ask her if she wants to leave here?

WILLA AMBROSE: (signing) Sophie - do you want to leave here?

(Sophie motions with her arms again.)

WILLA AMBROSE: She says "light afraid." (signs again) Sophie, what are you afraid of? Tell me.

(Sophie motions again.)

MULDER: What did she say?

WILLA AMBROSE: She said, "baby go flying light."

(Scully knocks and enters.)

SCULLY: I just finished up in the infirmary. A sheriff's deputy came looking to serve you papers. I think it's about Sophie.

WILLA AMBROSE: What am I going to do?

MULDER: Whatever you do, you can't leave Sophie here. Not if you want to protect her.

WILLA AMBROSE: I have nowhere else to take her.

DEPUTY: (knocks, then enters) Excuse me. Willa Ambrose?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yes.

DEPUTY: I'm serving you with a court order to release a gorilla named Sophie into protective custody.

(Willa takes the order from the deputy.)

(A vehicle pulls up in front of a downtown building. Kyle Lang is typing a report at his desk. Willa Ambrose appears in front of him.)

KYLE LANG: What are you doing here?

WILLA AMBROSE: I've come to ask for your help, Kyle.

KYLE LANG: Help with what?

WILLA AMBROSE: Sophie. They've taken her into protective custody.

KYLE LANG: Let her go, Willa.

WILLA AMBROSE: They're putting her in an iron cage as we speak - without bars, without windows. It'll kill her.

KYLE LANG: Sophie's been behind bars her entire life. Let her go home, Willa. She'll have the freedom she deserves.

WILLA AMBROSE: (angrily) Freedom to what - be killed by poachers and have her hands cut off as souvenirs?

KYLE LANG: They've promised she'll be in a preserve.

WILLA AMBROSE: She's mine, Kyle! I won't let her go! (pleading) Please, come on. We can find a place for her here - a private reserve. You know people.

KYLE LANG: (shaking his head) That's against everything I stand for.

WILLA AMBROSE: She's pregnant.

KYLE LANG: What?

WILLA AMBROSE: Sophie's pregnant.

KYLE LANG: I don't believe you, Willa.

WILLA AMBROSE: It's true.

KYLE LANG: Well what if she was? Is the baby gonna live out its life behind bars, too? Look, Willa, she doesn't belong to you. She's not your child. She belongs with other gorillas, not selling tickets for a zoo.

WILLA AMBROSE: You won't help me?

KYLE LANG: No.

(She leaves.)

(Ed Meecham is driving a forktruck, carrying a large metal cage. He sets it down. Mulder watches from a short distance. Scully approaches him.)

SCULLY: You want to see something interesting?

(She hands him a newspaper clipping.)

MULDER: Where did you get this?

(The clipping shows a younger Willa Ambrose and Kyle Lang, standing with his arm around her shoulder. The headline below reads "Naturalists Willa Ambrose and Kyle Lang will bring the animal back to the U.S.")

SCULLY: I was looking for a pen to finish my report in Willa's office, and it was in her drawer.

MULDER: It's a small world, after all.

(They look up to see Willa approaching the large steel cage. Sophie starts banging on the cage and moaning loudly, and Willa rushes to the front of the cage and signs to Sophie.)

WILLA AMBROSE: It's okay, Sophie. It's okay, honey. Sophie, Sophie, Sophie - don't worry. I'm with you.

(Sophie calms down. Mulder and Scully look on, then step away. Willa is fighting back tears as Sophie nuzzles her hands through a hole in the door of the cage.)

WILLA AMBROSE: I love you too.

(At night, a truck pulls up in front of the main zoo entrance and Kyle Lang gets out. Kyle steps into Willa's office.)

KYLE LANG: Willa?

(No one is there. He walks through the zoo building and opens the door marked "Maintenance Entrance.")

KYLE LANG: Willa? Are you there?

(No answer. He walks into the darkened area, passing cages of animals.)

KYLE LANG: Willa? Where are you? Willa?

(He steps to Sophie's cage and looks in but it is empty. He is suddenly thrown across the room and into another cage. He looks up to see a large metal cage falling onto him. He screams.)



SCENE 9

(Willa is being questioned by Scully and Mulder in her office.)

WILLA AMBROSE: I told you, it happened exactly the way it did with the tiger. I heard the animals going crazy. I got out of bed to check on Sophie and she was gone. That's when I found Kyle.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea what he would have been doing at the zoo?

WILLA AMBROSE: No.

SCULLY: We have a witness who says that you visited Kyle's office yesterday. Is that true?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yeah.

SCULLY: For what purpose?

WILLA AMBROSE: Basically, to tell him he'd won. That the zoo was being shut down, that Sophie was being taken into protective custody.

SCULLY: Did you ask him to help you take Sophie to prevent her from being taken from you?

WILLA AMBROSE: No. That would be against everything Kyle believed in.

SCULLY: But he helped you to rescue her originally, isn't that correct? He had a connection to you and to this animal that went back several years.

WILLA AMBROSE: Whatever connection he and I had was over long ago.

SCULLY: But you asked him anyway ... to help you.

WILLA AMBROSE: No.

SCULLY: Then what was he doing here last night, and why did he give you this note?

(She hands her a small piece of paper. On it is written "Willa - Let's talk. Kyle.")

WILLA AMBROSE: I don't know. I told you.

SCULLY: Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo?

WILLA AMBROSE: If he did, it was probably late at night after he jumped over the fence like a good W.A.O. soldier. Anyway, why don't you ask Agent Mulder what he thinks happened? He seems to have a novel theory. Maybe it was alien abduction.

MULDER: Scully, can I talk to you for a second?

(They step outside.)

SCULLY: You think she's telling the truth?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

SCULLY: Well, Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance of the animal match the previous incidents.

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: And you've been pushing this alien abduction angle.

MULDER: I still am, but in this case, Willa's reactions are all wrong.

SCULLY: You mean to losing Sophie?

MULDER: I think she knows where Sophie is, and Kyle Lang died because he knows what she's capable of.

SCULLY: You think she killed him?

MULDER: I think she'd do anything to protect that animal.

SCULLY: Even wait atop a stack of crates for a former lover to walk underneath?

MULDER: I think an examination of the body will give us a lot clearer picture of what happened last night. You do that, and I'll check out the warehouse.

(Mulder walks through the warehouse, examining Sophie's cage and seeing some straw just outside the door to it. He hears a noise and steps over to see Ed Meecham closing an electric door at the loading dock. Outside, it looks to be late afternoon.)

(It is now dark, and Ed Meecham backs his truck up to another loading dock. He gets out, carrying a gun, and enters the building. Mulder watches from his car, then gets out.)

(In her office, Willa is packing up her belongings, including a picture of Sophie and her. Scully enters.)

SCULLY: Looks like you're in a hurry.

WILLA AMBROSE: Well, there isn't much to hang around for, is there?

SCULLY: I'm afraid there is. I found evidence that Kyle died a wrongful death. He was hit with a cattle prod. There's gonna be an investigation so I have to read you your rights.

WILLA AMBROSE: It was an accident. Kyle surprised Ed. He wasn't supposed to be there.

SCULLY: Ed Meecham took Sophie?

WILLA AMBROSE: Yes. (near tears) There was no one else to turn to.

SCULLY: Where is she, Willa?

WILLA AMBROSE: Ed has her. She's in some building on the road to Boise.

(Ed Meecham walks through the other building, carrying a flashlight in one hand and the gun in the other. Mulder steps in front of him, gun raised.)

MULDER: Put it down, Ed. There's been enough violence, don't you think?

ED MEECHAM: I didn't kill Kyle Lang.

MULDER: Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.

ED MEECHAM: (putting down the gun) I was only doing what she paid me to do.

MULDER: (picks up the gun) Where is the animal, Ed?

ED MEECHAM: Down the hall.

MULDER: Okay. You show me where - we're gonna go there together. Come on.

(They walk through the building, Mulder following with his gun on Meecham. They approach a storage room, and there are loud roars and banging noises coming from it.)

MULDER: What's she doing?

ED MEECHAM: She's throwing herself against the door. She's gone crazy.

(Mulder steps to the door and looks through the reinforced glass at the top of it. Something hits the glass, startling him. He backs away.)

MULDER: She's scared.

ED MEECHAM: Yeah? Well, she's gonna kill herself.

MULDER: Okay, Ed. Well, you're going to have to save her. Take your tranquilizer gun. I'll be right behind you.

(He hands Ed the gun and takes his flashlight. Ed opens the door.)

ED MEECHAM: I've only got one dart in this thing, so you got to get her out in the light.

(Mulder points the flashlight around in the room.)

MULDER: You see her?

ED MEECHAM: I think she's over in that corner over there.

(Sophie suddenly comes out of the shadows, knocking Mulder down. Meecham ducks out of the room, locking the door behind him.)

MULDER: Hey, Meecham!

(Meecham disappears, leaving Mulder in the room with Sophie.)

MULDER: I'm not gonna hurt you.

(Sophie moves toward Mulder, striking him again. She then moves away and sits accross the room. Dazed, Mulder watches as she motions with her arms. Then there is a blinding light as Mulder loses consciousness.)

(Some time later, Scully is unlocking the door to the room. Mulder lies on the floor, alone in the room. A policeman is with Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder?

(She sees him and rushes to his side. He is bleeding from a cut on the top of his head. Scully touches his head and he awakens, moaning loudly.)

SCULLY: Sorry. Lie still.

MULDER: Where's Sophie?

SCULLY: Lie down. (to policeman) Can we get a paramedic in here?

POLICEMAN: Yes, ma'am.

MULDER: Meecham.

SCULLY: Ed Meecham's been arrested. We picked him up on the way to Boise. That's how we found you here.

MULDER: They took Sophie.

SCULLY: Who did?

MULDER: Where's Willa?

SCULLY: She's outside. She's going in to make a statement about Kyle Lang.

MULDER: I got to talk to her.

(He gets up and hurries out of the room. Scully picks up his gun and follows. Mulder runs outside, where it is early morning and foggy. Willa gets out of the back seat of a police car as she sees Mulder approaching.)

WILLA AMBROSE: Where is she?

MULDER: She's gone.

WILLA AMBROSE: What did he do to her?

MULDER: It wasn't Ed. She tried to tell me something.

(He motions with his arms, like the ones Sophie made earlier.)

MULDER: What is that?

WILLA AMBROSE: That doesn't make any sense.

MULDER: What does it mean?

"Man save man."

(A report is heard from the police radio.)

DISPATCHER'S VOICE: (on radio) We've just received a report of a large animal spotted down off the interstate just west of the service road off ...

MULDER: That's her.

WILLA AMBROSE: She's heading back towards the zoo.

(They quickly get into the car.)

(Later, their car approaches the site. There are several cars and police vehicles there, along with a number of bystanders. They get out of the car.)

WILLA AMBROSE: (to an officer) Where is she?

OFFICER: (pointing) Over there.

(Willa runs in that direction.)

SCULLY: (to officer) What happened here?

OFFICER: Animal got hit by a car. Ran off in the field.

(Mulder and Scully run after Willa, crossing a field. Willa comes to Sophie, who is lying dead. She throws herself to Sophie's side, crying.)

WILLA AMBROSE: Oh, no. Oh, no, no. Sophie! Sophie! Oh, no, no.

(She puts her head down on Sophie as Mulder and Scully watch.)

(Mulder and Scully drive away from the area. Both stare straight ahead somberly.)

MULDER: (voiceover) Willa Ambrose and Ed Meecham have been charged with manslaughter for the death of Kyle Lang. And though the courts will rule on this matter, and justice will be no doubt be served, the pall of a greater tragedy remains. The motives of the silent visitors who set these events in motion remain unclear. Could this be a judgement on a global rate of extinction that has risen to 1000 times its natural rate in this century? An act of alien conservation of animals we are driving hard toward oblivion? And if so, might it follow that our own fate and existence could finally be dependent upon the conservatorship of an extraterrestrial race? Or in the simple words of a creature whose own future is uncertain, will "man save man?"

(As they drive, they pass a church with a sign in front on which is written "Man has no pre-eminence above a beast: for all is vanity. Eccl 3:19.")

SCENE 1
NORWEGIAN SEA, 65 DEGREES LATITUE,
8 DEGREES EAST LONGITUDE

(A lifeboat marked '925' hits the water and there are sounds of men preparing to abandon a ship. As some men climb down to the lifeboat, the captain confronts his lieutenant on deck. The captain appears to be in his mid-thirties, the lieutenant a few years younger.)

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: This is mutiny!

LT. HARPER: No, sir. It's survival.

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: They'll come for us! They're sending help!

LT. HARPER: By the time they get here, it'll be too late. It may already be too late.

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: Don't do this! (the captain raises a gun at the lieutenant) That's an order!

SAILOR: (from the lifeboat) Lieutenant Harper?

LT. HARPER: Shoot me if you want, Captain Barclay, but I'm not waiting around so I can wind up like the others.

(The lieutenant climbs over the rail and down to the lifeboat. The captain lowers his weapon.)

SAILOR: Cast off!



SCENE 2
18 HOURS LATER

(On board the Lisette, the captain and his first mate are playing blackjack on the bridge.)

LISETTE CAPTAIN: Hit me.

(The radar blips. They check the radar screen and see the echo of a boat straight ahead.)

LISETTE FIRST MATE: It looks like she's just drifting out there.

LISETTE CAPTAIN: Mmmm ... we're heading straight for her. (to radio) This is the Lisette, Canadian fishing vessel CV233, please identify. (no response) This is the Lisette, come in please. (still no response) (to first mate) Cut the engines and meet me up on deck.

(On deck, they search the night with a spotlight. They see a lifeboat ahead, marked '925'.)

VOICE FROM LIFEBOAT: Hello out there. Hey!

LISETTE CAPTAIN: We're throwing you a line. Grab it and we'll pull you in.

(They throw out a line, and someone in the boat catches it and anchors it to the boat. As the captain and mate pull them in, they scan the crew with the spotlight.)

LISETTE CAPTAIN: Is everybody all right? Are there any injured?

(They see a group of men, all of whom appear to be extremely old. The man in front, wearing a lieutenant's pin on his lapel, appears to be Lt. Harper.)

SCENE 3
BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL, BETHESDA, MARYLAND

(Scully gets off an elevator and meets Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully. Thanks for coming.

SCULLY: What was so urgent that you couldn't tell me over the phone?

MULDER: I didn't want to waste any time. A Navy destroyer escort, the USS Ardent, has been missing in the North Atlantic for the past 42 hours.

SCULLY: Missing?

MULDER: Yeah, there's been no radio contact, no distress signals picked up. Search planes and satellites haven't picked up anything either.

SCULLY: You're saying that a ship and its entire crew just vanished?

MULDER: Well, that's what it looked like until last night. A Canadian trawler picked up 18 survivors.

SCULLY: Well, they must have reported what happened.

MULDER: Only one of those survivors is still alive. He's been taken into the ICU under heavy security.

SCULLY: What's wrong with him?

MULDER: That's what I was hoping you could tell me. (they see a soldier guarding a door at the end of the hall) They won't let me in to see him, but because of your medical background, I was able to get you a clearance code. I want your opinion on this. His name is Harper, Lt. Richard Harper.

SCULLY: Mulder, wh ...?

MULDER: Meet me back in my office when you're finished. Thank you. (he leaves)

(In the hospital room, an extremely old looking man is on a respirator and is being attended to by a nurse. Scully reads the patient's chart.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. Is this Lt. Richard Harper?

NURSE: That's what his wristband says.

SCULLY: And he's been positively identified?

NURSE: All military personnel are fingerprinted. Those records were crosschecked at the time of admittance.

SCULLY: Well, then I think there's been some kind of a mistake here. According to this report, Lt. Harper is 28 years old. (the nurse says nothing and walks away) Why hasn't a systemic workup been ordered on this patient?

(A doctor enters the room behind Scully.)

DR. LASKOS: I wasn't aware that my diagnostic decisions required your approval. I'm the physician in charge of this patient. Let me see your clearance.

(Scully hands her badge to the doctor, who looks it over.)

SCULLY: Can you tell me what's going on here? How can you explain what happened to this man?

DR. LASKOS: This clearance code is invalid. Where'd you get this? Who are you?

SCULLY: I am a medical doctor and I would like to see the autopsy reports on the remaining victims.

DR. LASKOS: I haven't got time for this. Give me my patient's chart and leave before I have you removed.

(Scully hesitates a moment, then returns the chart and exits the room.)



SCENE 4
MULDER'S OFFICE

(Mulder is examining some photos as Scully enters.)

SCULLY: Something very strange is going on here, Mulder.

MULDER: Did they let you in to see Lt. Harper?

SCULLY: Yeah, I saw somebody, but whether it was actually the Lieutenant ...

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: He looked about 90 years old. Off by about half a century. You don't seem too surprised.

MULDER: I want to show you something, Scully. (he takes her to map on the bulletin board with a number of locations marked by pins) This was the course of the USS Ardent when she disappeared. Now, I've been tracking the points of departure and destination for each of these X-files. On December 12, 1949, a Royal Navy battleship disappeared between Leeds and Cape Perry. The sea was calm, the weather sunny. In 1963, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, a fleet of Soviet minesweepers left from here for Havana. All 6 vessels vanished without a trace. All in all, I've counted 9 unexplained disappearances. Each of them passed through here - the 65th parallel.

(He points to a circled area on the map in the Norwegian Sea where all the ships' courses intersect.)

SCULLY: Another Bermuda Triangle?

MULDER: It's more like a wrinkle in time, if Lt. Harper is any indication.

SCULLY: (frowning) A wrinkle in time? Wh ...

MULDER: You know anything about the Philadelphia Experiment?

SCULLY: It was a, uh, a program during World War II to render battleships invisible to radar. But then the Manhattan Project heated up, and it was discontinued and most of the scientists were relocated to Los Alamos.

MULDER: Except none of those scientists ever made it to Los Alamos.

SCULLY: Where were they sent?

MULDER: Roswell, New Mexico.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that the Philadelphia Experiment used alien technology?

MULDER: Less than nine months after the alleged crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico, the USS Eldridge did more than just hide from radar screens, it disappeared altogether from the Philadelphia Navy Yard only to reappear minutes later, hundreds of miles away, in Norfolk Virginia.

SCULLY: That's not possible, Mulder, not without defying all laws of, of time and space.

MULDER: Those physicists may have been trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth.

SCULLY: Wormholes?

MULDER: Actual portals where matter interfaces with time at a relatively decelerated or accelerated rate. I'm betting that the military never stopped the work it began 50 years ago.

SCULLY: And that's what you think happened to Lt. Harper?

MULDER: I'll find out soon enough. I'M BOOKED ON AN 8:30 flight to Norway.

SCULLY: Have you let Skinner in on this?

MULDER: I'm giving myself a 24-hour head start before I give Skinner my report. I want this one myself.

SCULLY: (looking back at the map) I'm going with you. If that really was Lt. Harper, I want to know what happened to him.



SCENE 5
PORT OF TILDESKAN, NORWAY

(Mulder and Scully are talking to a captain at a crowded sailors' bar. The sailor points to an area of a map and speaks Norwegian, apparently saying "no" as he walks away.)

NORWEGIAN SKIPPER/SAILOR: Nei! Nei! Det er altfor farlig [No! No! It's way too dangerous]

MULDER: 0 for 5.

SCULLY: What is it, Mulder? Why are they so afraid? My father spent the better part of his life at sea. He had a healthy respect for the ocean, but he never feared it. I see fear in these men's eyes.

(A man at a nearby table speaks up and approaches them.)

TRONDHEIM: Brooklyn couldn't have taken you up there anyway. Your ship has to be classified ice class before it can even go past the Lofoten Basin. My name is Trondheim - Henry Trondheim. The ship you want is the Zehar, a 50-ton trawler with a double hull. It's my ship.

SCULLY: You're American.

TRONDHEIM: I was born and raised in Pensacola. I ran a charter business there. I got fed up with tourists.

MULDER: How do you feel about the sea north of Beerenburg?

TRONDHEIM: This time of year, it'll be 10 hours minimum, each way.

MULDER: So you've been there?

TRONDHEIM: A few times. A few times I got some of my best hauls out of there.

SCULLY: Why is everyone else so afraid to go there?

TRONDHEIM: Well, legends. They grew up on stories.

SCULLY: What stories?

TRONDHEIM: A huge stone came out of the sky and crashed into the pack ice.

SCULLY: A meteorite?

TRONDHEIM: An evil god. They worship it by staying away. So ... exactly what is it that you're looking for up there?

MULDER: A number of things. How good are you?

TRONDHEIM: About as good as you're going to get, considering no one else will take you there.

MULDER: When can we leave?

TRONDHEIM: As soon as we shake on a price.

(Mulder nods.)

(Later, they are en route on board the Zehar. It is dark and there is a thick fog. The radar blips and Trondheim checks it, while his mate, Halverson, looks with binoculars. Scully stands beside Trondheim, while Mulder, looking queasy, emerges from the lavatory. Scully approaches him.)

SCULLY: Feeling any better?

MULDER: Uhhh ... You're lucky you inherited your father's legs.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: His sea legs.

SCULLY: (smiling) Oh.

MULDER: (to Trondheim) It's been about 12 hours. You said it was only gonna take 10. What's going on?

TRONDHEIM: I told you before, the visibility is lousy. I've never seen it this thick.

MULDER: How much longer 'til we get there?

TRONDHEIM: Well, we're right where you want to be. I even think we've got what you're looking for. Except one minute it's right in front of us and the next minute it's not. Like something's messing with my radar ... and my navigation system. I can't explain it.

(The radar screen shows an echo fading in and out, while his instruments show his bearing fluctuating widely. Halverson sees the outline of a ship emerging in the fog, straight ahead.)

HALVERSON: Captain! Pass på! [Look out!]

(Trondheim throws the ship into reverse but the ship ahead gets closer and closer.)

TRONDHEIM: We're gonna hit!

(They collide, and all four are thrown forward.)

TRONDHEIM: Halverson! Check the hull for damage!

(The four have now moved their gear onto the deck of the Ardent.)

TRONDHEIM: I don't get it. This is what you're looking for?

MULDER: The USS Ardent. It's a destroyer escort.

TRONDHEIM: All right ... what do you want with it, anyway? It's a ghost ship. I mean, look at all this corrosion. No one's been aboard this vessel in 20, 30 years.

(Mulder finds the ship's nameplate, which says "U.S.S. Ardent, 1991". The nameplate is heavily corroded and barely readable.)

MULDER: Scully. (she comes over and looks) Let's check the crew quarters first.

(They go below into the crews quarters. They find a number of bodies, all of which look extemely old and are heavily crusted with a white residue.)

SCULLY: Mulder. They almost look mummified.

MULDER: Like they've been dead a very long time.

SCULLY: Except for this strange residue.

(She reaches with a knife to scrape some of the white residue off a dead man's hand, but when she touches it, the hand breaks off. They hear an engine starting.)

SCULLY: What was that?

MULDER: An engine.

TRONDHEIM: My ship!

(They hurry back on deck and see the Zehar pulling away from the Ardent.)

TRONDHEIM: No! That's my ship!

MULDER: Hey!

TRONDHEIM: You're taking my ship!

MULDER: Hey!

TRONDHEIM: Hey! (very upset, he grabs Mulder by the lapel) That's my ship!

(Halverson grabs Trondheim's shoulder.)

HALVERSON: Ta det med ro! [Take it easy!]

Trondheim releases Mulder as the Zehar fades away into the fog and darkness.)



SCENE 6

(Mulder and Scully are on the bridge of the Ardent. Mulder is working on the radio from below while Scully tries it out.)

SCULLY: Nope.

MULDER: All right. (he makes an adjustment) Try it again.

SCULLY: No. What is it?

MULDER: It's caked with the same residue that's covering everything.

SCULLY: So we can't even send a distress signal.

(Mulder stands as Trondheim comes up from below.)

TRONDHEIM: The engine's so corroded down there you can't even ... you can't even tell what it is. I've never seen anything like it. Halverson's trying to salvage some parts, but basically what we are is dead in the water.

SCULLY: Well, the radio's dead too.

TRONDHEIM: Somebody's not telling me what's going on here. (neither Scully nor Mulder respond) Now look, that ship wasn't just my livelihood, that was my life. I have a right to some straight answers.

MULDER: What we're seeing here may be the result of some kind of military experiment.

TRONDHEIM: Military experiment?

MULDER: An artifical time band, where matter moves through time at an accelerated rate.

TRONDHEIM: Tell me in English.

MULDER: Time may be speeding up.

TRONDHEIM: Right. That's almost as crazy as Halverson's "there's a rock that comes down from the sky ...".

MULDER: The ship ... the ship was launched in 1991. I don't know how else to explain the extent of the corrosion or the decay of the bodies down below.

TRONDHEIM: (to Scully) You're not buying any of this, are you?

(Before Scully can respond, they hear a yell. The three quickly go down to investigate and they hear a door creaking. Weapons raised, Mulder and Scully move back in the ship. Scully finds Halverson, dead, lying on the deck with blood coming from a wound in his head. She kneels to check him as Mulder and Trondheim catch up.)

MULDER: What happened?

SCULLY: His skull's been fractured.

TRONDHEIM: Who was that? Halverson!

(They hear another noise from farther back in the ship. Mulder and Scully investigate, while Trondheim kneels over Halverson's body. In the ship's galley, Mulder hears a noise and approaches the door to a small compartment. When he opens it, he finds a very old looking man cowering and clutching a bottle of whiskey.)

MULDER: Who are you?

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: Captain Barclay. Commanding officer, USS Ardent.

(Later, Mulder gives Barclay a glass of water drawn from a faucet.)

MULDER: Here you go.

(Barclay drinks, shakily holding the glass with both hands.)

SCULLY: Captain Barclay, um, according to your log, shortly after the navigation system failed, several of your crew members saw something in the sea - a growing light.

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: It, it came up through the fog, in the middle of the night. Like it was on fire.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea what it might have been?

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: Power loss. Everything stopped. Everything. Even the sea. Even the wind. Then the ship, my ship, she began to bleed through the hull near the rivet seams.

HALVERSON: (laughing) He's a drunkard. He's a drunkard! And he killed Halverson. To hell with him, I don't have to listen to his lies!

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: I'm no liar. It happened, first to some of my men and then to all of them.

SCULLY: What happened?

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: Time got lost.

(Mulder and Scully exchange a glance as Barclay starts wheezing.)

SCULLY: It's OK, captain. You can take it easy. We're gonna do whatever we can to help you out.

CAPTAIN BARCLAY: What can you do? You can't do anything. I'm 35 years old.

(Mulder pulls Scully aside for a quiet, private conversation.)

MULDER: There's no way he killed Halverson.

SCULLY: Yeah, I'd have to agree with you. That blow that killed Halverson was delivered with considerable strength, and he can't even hold a glass with two hands.

MULDER: That means there's somebody else on board.

(Next morning, an emotional Trondheim prepares to bury Halverson's body at sea.)

TRONDHEIM: You were a good first mate. You left me alone, and you did your job. It's a shame this had to happen to you so young.

TRONDHEIM: God vei videre [Farewell/Goodbye, old buddy]

(After saying a few words in Norwegian, Trondheim then lets Halverson's shrouded body slip overboard. As Trondheim crosses himself, a man approaches and takes a swing at him with a pipe. He ducks under it, but the man then knocks Trondheim to the deck. As he raises the pipe for a third try, Mulder appears and draws his gun on him.)

MULDER: Put it down! Put down the pipe! Put it down!

(He complies. Trondheim gets to his feet and kicks the pipe away. He then grabs the man by the throat.)

TRONDHEIM: I could kill you for what you've done.

MULDER: Back off, Trondheim!

TRONDHEIM: He killed Halverson!

MULDER: He may be our only chance to figure out what happened. Look at him. Look at him! He hasn't aged. Back off!

(Trondheim releases him.)

TRONDHEIM: His name's Olafsson.

MULDER: You know him?

TRONDHEIM: Everybody in Gildeskal knows him. He's a pirate whaler. He's a wanted criminal. He supplies whales to the Japanese black market. Blues, belugas, sperms.

MULDER: Ask him how he got here.

(Trondheim asks Olafsson a question in Norwegian.)

TRONDHEIM: Hvordan kom du hit? [How did you get here?]

OLAFSSON: Dra til helvete [Go to hell!]

(Olafsson's terse reply prompts Trondheim to lunge at him again but Mulder stops him.)

MULDER: We'll question him later. I don't want to leave Scully alone, in case there are others.

(Olafsson, Trondheim and Mulder go back below and join Scully. Trondheim gives a terse command to Olafsson in Norwegian as he pushes him along.)

MULDER: I think we found who killed Halverson.

TRONDHEIM: He'd have killed me too, if it wasn't for Mulder.

SCULLY: The ship's log says something about four Norweigian sailors who were picked up when their vessel had sunk.

TRONDHEIM: I guarantee it was Olafsson's men, took my boat and left him stranded there. It's just like these dogs to slit each other's throats.

MULDER: Maybe we should ask the Captain some more questions.

SCULLY: Mulder, Captain Barclay is dead. I don't know how it happened, it was just in the last 15 minutes. It's just like those men below. It's more than rapid aging, Mulder. It's almost as if he's turning into a pillar of salt.

MULDER: Is that what this substance is?

SCULLY: Well, it appears to be crystalline, but beyond that ...?

MULDER: All right, we're all tired. Let's stow the captain's body and tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest. I'll take first watch, in case he's not alone.

(Later, all are asleep except Mulder. His wristwatch timer goes off and he walks toward Scully, who is asleep with her head on a table.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Mmmm. I just fell asleep.

MULDER: You want a few more minutes?

SCULLY: No. I'm up.

(As she lifts her head, we see that her face looks about 20 years older.)

MULDER: Scully ...

(She sees that Mulder is similarly affected.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened to you?



SCENE 7

(Trondheim is looking in a mirror. He is also showing signs of aging. Mulder and Scully are nearby.)

SCULLY: Time acceleration is an equation, Mulder, a theory.

MULDER: Then theoretically it's possible. What else could it be?

SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, it isn't a time warp. None of us has directly observed any of the phenomenon recorded in the ship's log. There is no hard evidence to indicate that this is a time warp.

MULDER: We're the evidence, Scully! Look at us! We're aging by the minute.

SCULLY: Well, if this is rapid aging phenomena, then why hasn't our hair greyed or started to fall out?

TRONDHEIM: (motioning toward Olafsson) Then what about him, huh? What about him? Why isn't he getting old?

(He directs some words at Olafsson.)

TRONDHEIM: Hvorfor blir du ikke gammel? [Why haven't you gotten older?]

MULDER: Relax, relax, Trondheim. Save your energy.

TRONDHEIM: (to Mulder) I don't have to listen to you. It's because of you that we got into this.

MULDER: Nobody twisted your arm.

TRONDHEIM: I signed on to bring you here. Not to die.

SCULLY: Mulder, what do you know about free radicals?

MULDER: Is this a quiz?

SCULLY: They are highly reactive chemicals containing extra electrons. Now, they can attack DNA proteins, they can cause our body tissue and cell membranes to oxidize.

MULDER: Grow old, you mean?

SCULLY: It's the prevailing theory on how our bodies age.

MULDER: So you think something is triggering that reaction in us?

SCULLY: This is just a theory. But what if this ship is drifting towards another massive metallic source, like a meteor. Maybe it's way down deep in the ocean or embedded into an iceberg. But the two could effectively be acting as positive and negative terminals with the ocean itself being a kind of giant battery. That level of electromagnetic energy could be exciting the free radicals and effectively oxidizing every piece of matter in its field.

(Trondheim notices several drops of red liquid falling onto the floor from above.)

MULDER: It makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent to rust would be rapid premature senescence.

TRONDHEIM: What the hell?

(They look up and see that liquid is leaking from a flange in an overhead pipe.)

SCULLY: Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding.

(Mulder rubs some of the liquid between his fingers.)

MULDER: It's not blood, Scully. It's rust. Trondheim, you keep an eye on Olafsson.

TRONDHEIM: Where are you going?

SCULLY: Mulder. Where are we going?

MULDER: I'm not sure yet, but we don't have much time to get there.

(Mulder and Scully walk back through the ship. Mulder is looking at the overhead pipes. All are darkly colored except for one yellow pipe.)

MULDER: See this yellow pipe? It's the only one that hasn't corroded through.

(As they follow the pipe, Trondheim and Olafsson are still in the dining order. They converse in Norwegian.)

OLAFSSON: Hei, Trondheim, komme her. Det er noe jeg vil fortelle deg. [Hey Trondheim, come here. There's something I want to tell you.]

TRONDHEIM: Det er ikke noe du kan fortelle meg som jeg er interesserte i. [There's nothing you can tell me that I want to know.]

OLAFSSON: Er du sikker? Hvor gikk de andre du, tror du? Og hvorfor tror du de etterlot deg? [Are you sure? Where do you think the other two went? And why do you think they left you behind?]

TRONDHEIM: Jeg vet hva du prøver å gjøre, Olafsson. [I know what you're trying to do, Olafsson.]

OLAFSSON: Hvis du ikke stoler på meg, så stole på de egne øyne. Du så hva som hendte til kapteinen. Det tar bare et par timer. Men du behøver ikke å dø. [If you don't trust me, trust your own eyes. You saw what happened to the captain. It only takes a few hours. But you don't have to die.]

TRONDHEIM: Vi må alle dø. [We all have to die.]

OLAFSSON: Ikke på denne måten. [Not like this.]

TRONDHEIM: (angrily) Hvorfor skulle jeg høre på deg? Du er en løgner og en morder. [Why should I listen to you? You're a murderer.]

OLAFSSON: Jeg bare drepte gutten for å overleve. Du ville gjøre det samme. Du kan fremdeles gjøre det. [I only killed the boy in order to survive. You'd have done the same. You still might.]

TRONDHEIM: OK, jeg hører hva du sier. Fortell meg den store hemmeligheten. [OK, I'm listening. Tell me this big secret.]

OLAFSSON: Først la meg gå. [First, let me go.]

TRONDHEIM: Hvordan vet jeg at du forteller sannheten? [How do I know you're telling the truth?]

OLAFSSON: Se på meg, Trondheim. Og så, se på deg selv. [Look at me, Trondheim. Then take a look at yourself.]

(Mulder and Scully have followed the pipe to where it goes down through a hatch labeled "sewage processing hold". They open the hatch, descend some stairs and open a large door. Inside they find many rats as well as clothing and other signs that the area has been recently occupied.)

MULDER: Olafsson and his men.

SCULLY: Why would they hold up here?

(Mulder notices a slow drip from a faucet in a large tank in the room.)

MULDER: This is the only drinkable water on the ship. We were both wrong, Scully. It's the water. All the other water's been contaminated.

SCULLY: Contaminated how?

MULDER: Something must have gotten into the desalination tanks where all the ship's potable water is stored. But the water in the sewage system is recycled again and again. It doesn't come from the sea.

SCULLY: Well, if you're right, then Captain Barclay's drinking binge is what kept him alive.

MULDER: (banging on the tank) The water from this tank may do the same for us.

SCULLY: It doesn't sound like there's very much left.

(In another part of the ship, Olafsson sits motionless next to blood-stained pipes, apparently killed by Trondheim. Trondheim is using his hand to drink water out of the toilet.)



SCENE 8

(Back in the crew dining area, Mulder holds up the rope that was binding Olafsson and confronts Trondheim. Olafsson is nowhere to be seen.)

MULDER: What happened? You were supposed to watch him.

TRONDHEIM: I feel pretty bad about it. I shouldn't have dozed off. Well, what do you want me to say? He's gone, he got away.

MULDER: (angrily) I want to know what happened?

TRONDHEIM: I can ask the same of you. You're the one that tied him up.

MULDER: There's nothing wrong with my knot! This rope's been severed!

TRONDHEIM: I don't like being interrogated. I don't owe you any explanations.

(Trondheim starts to walk past Mulder, who grabs him by the shirt. Trondheim grabs Mulder as well, and they grapple briefly.)

SCULLY: Trondheim!

(Mulder draws his gun.)

MULDER: Let go of me.

SCULLY: Look, we have a lot of work to do here. I'm gonna need blood and urine samples from both of you.

TRONDHEIM: What for?

SCULLY: We found out what caused the aging.

TRONDHEIM: What is it now? The two of you are full of theories. First it's one thing, then it's another. By the time you figure out what it is, we'll all be dead.

MULDER: It's the water, Trondheim. Something got into the de-sal tanks, but the water in the sewage system is untainted.

SCULLY: It kept Olafsson alive this long, maybe it will slow the process in us.

TRONDHEIM: This is good news, isn't it? So what happens now?

(It is now daylight outside. Scully is writing in a journal.)

SCULLY: (voice-over) It has been 18 hours, 45 minutes since the onset of symptoms. Rudimentary blood tests have revealed impossibly high concentrations of sodium choloride - salt - though the contaminated water itself is not saline. It appears to catalyze existing body fluids, causing massive and rapid cellular damage. The untainted water has slowed the degenerative progression in Trondheim and me, but Mulder has fared less well, perhaps because of the dehydration he suffered on the way here.

(Mulder places a urine sample on the table. While Scully looks somewhat older than previously, Mulder is more considerably aged and has developed a twitch in his neck.)

MULDER: I think I just lapped George Burns.

SCULLY: I'll be right back.

(Scully takes the sample to a make-shift laboratory that she has set up across the room. Trondheim edges up behind her.)

SCULLY: If you've got something to say, say it but don't hover behind me like that.

TRONDHEIM: The water isn't helping him.

SCULLY: Then maybe we should double his rations.

TRONDHEIM: What for? A lake full of water isn't going to bring him back.

SCULLY: We don't know that for sure. Not yet.

TRONDHEIM: Look at him! We've wasted too much water on him as it is.

SCULLY: Who are you to decide?

TRONDHEIM: You don't have to be a doctor to see that he isn't gonna make it. But you and me, Scully ... you and me ... we better start looking out for ourselves.

(Mulder looks over his shoulder at Scully and Trondheim, but it is not clear whether he heard them. Scully has transferred the sample to a test tube and drops a reactant into it. The sample turns red.)

(Later, Scully writes in her journal as Mulder sleeps.)

SCULLY: (voice-over) Mulder's urinalysis continues to indicate his kidneys' failure to excrete the substance I'm calling "heavy salt". Whether the untainted water taken from the sewage system is even helping him at all is unclear. What does remain clear to me is that I can't give up trying.

(Across the room, Trondheim turns off a lantern to go to sleep.)

(Later, it is dark outside and Scully is leaning her head against a pipe and dozing. She awakens to see that Trondheim is no longer there. She hears a bump and the sound of water flowing. She grabs a flashlight and heads back to investigate. She hears a rumble and sees the water being pumped from the toilet, which has a yellow pipe behind it. She goes back into the sewage processing hold and opens the door, finding Trondheim at work inside.)

SCULLY: Trondheim! What are you doing?

TRONDHEIM: Listen to this. (he bangs the water tank with a wrench) You know what that is? It's a funeral bell. There's only a few gallons left, maybe less.

SCULLY: There's enough to keep us all alive for a few more days.

TRONDHEIM: Or one of us alive long enough to be rescued.

(He walks toward her. Scully draws her gun and cocks the hammer.)

SCULLY: Don't come any closer.

TRONDHEIM: What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

SCULLY: Trondheim, listen to me. The navy knows where we are. They know these coordinates and they're gonna be here soon. So why don't we just go back up into the mess hall ...

(He continues to approach her and she gives ground.)

TRONDHEIM: Why don't you just go ahead and shoot me if you think that I'm gonna let Mulder have another drop.

(He pushes her back out of the room and closes the door, wedging the wrench in the handle and locking himself in.)

SCULLY: Trondheim! Trondheim!

(Scully frantically goes through the crew's quarters and galley looking for other sources of water. She finds a snow globe in the quarters and a can of sardines in the galley. She carefully drains the liquid from the sardines into a glass. When she comes back to the dining area, Mulder is awake and reading her journal. He continues to look worse than her.)

MULDER: You're almost out of pages. It's good you kept a record.

SCULLY: Trondheim's locked himself in the sewage hold. He's backflushed all the water and he's keeping it for himself. I looked everywhere and this is all I could find. (she places a capped jar half full of yellowish liquid on the table) It's sardine juice, half a dozen lemons and uh, the water from a snow globe. (Mulder licks his lips) It's not Evian, but ...

MULDER: You go ahead and drink it.

SCULLY: No, Mulder!

MULDER: It's the only logical choice, Scully. You're a woman. Your life expectancy is greater, and your body retains more water in fatty tissues.

SCULLY: That's more reason for you to drink it.

MULDER: You have a much greater chance of surviving until help comes.

SCULLY: Don't do this, Mulder.

MULDER: Don't be so stubborn, Scully. You know I'm right.

SCULLY: Well, there isn't much liquid to make a difference anyway.

MULDER: There might be.

(He pushes the jar across the table toward her. Scully looks at him, then the jar, then downward for a moment.)

SCULLY: No.

(There is a metallic groaning sound and the ship suddenly shudders, knocking both Mulder and Scully to the floor. The jar vibrates along table. In the sewage hold, Trondheim is also knocked to the floor. In the dining area, Mulder and Scully get back to their seats.)

SCULLY: What was that?

MULDER: The outer hull must have finally corroded through, which means we're taking on water.

SCULLY: Mulder ... the water.

(The jar is broken on the floor. They look at one another as odd noises continue to be heard from the ship.)

(In the sewage hold, several pipes burst and spray water. Suddenly a bulkhead gives way and water starts pouring in. Trondheim removes the wrench and struggles to open the door, but it won't open.)

TRONDHEIM: Uhhh! Can't open the door! Help me! Help me! Help me!

(He continues to call and bang on the door as the hold fills. Then there is silence as he has drowned.)



SCENE 9
14 HOURS LATER

(Mulder, trembling badly, sits to the side as Scully writes in her journal.)

MULDER: I always thought when I got older I'd maybe take a cruise somewhere. This isn't exactly what I had in mind. The service on this ship is terrible, Scully. (she smiles) It's not fair. It's not our time. We still have work to do.

(Scully puts down her pen and turns toward him.)

SCULLY: Mulder ... When they found me, after the doctors and even my family had given up, I experienced something that I never told you about. Even now it's hard to find the words. But there's one thing I'm certain of. As certain as I am of this life, we have nothing to fear when it's over.

(Mulder has slumped over to his side.)

MULDER: I'm so tired.

SCULLY: You should sleep.

(She strokes his forehead.)

(Later, Scully writes in her journal.)

SCULLY: (voice-over) Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at approximately 4:30 this morning, the 12th of March. There is nothing more I can do for him, or for myself. Supplies are exhausted, no food or liquid consumed for over 24 hours. The outer hull most probably flooded, though for now the inner hull is supporting the ship's mass. Among Halverson's belongings, I found a children's book of Norse legends. From what I can tell, the pictures show the end of the world - not in a sudden firestorm of damnation as the Bible teaches us, but in a slow covering blanket of snow. First the moon and the stars will be lost in a dense white fog, then the rivers and the lakes and the sea will freeze over. And finally a wolf named Skoll will open his jaws and eat the sun, sending the world into an everlasting night. I think I hear the wolf at the door.

(Scully drops her pen and her eyes close.)

(Later, a rescuer boards the vessel and searches the decks below with a flashlight. In the dining area, he finds Mulder and Scully slumped over on opposite sides of a table, as well as her journal.)

(Much later, Dr. Laskos at Bethesda Naval Hospital is shining a light into Scully's eyes to check her response and trying to awaken her. She looks considerably better.)

DR. LASKOS: Agent Scully? Agent Scully, can you hear me?

SCULLY: (groggily) Mmmm. Yeah.

DR. LASKOS: It's been 36 hours since your rescue. I've got you on dialysis with a high-flux filter. You're obviously responding well. Your electrolytes are almost back to normal and your fluid status has been corrected.

(Scully opens her eyes, swallows and raises her head slightly but then it falls back on the pillow and she closes her eyes. As her mind clears, she raises her head again.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Where is he?

(She looks to her right and sees Mulder in the next bed, still unconscious but looking much better.)

DR. LASKOS: His endocrine system was considerably more compromised than yours. Frankly, we didn't think that he'd make it - until we discovered this. (she shows Scully's journal) Based on your observations, we're giving him a course of synthetic hormones, which seems to be working.

SCULLY: Whatever caused this is still out there. I have to talk to a naval liaison. We have to salvage the ship in order to study the salt ...

DR. LASKOS: Agent Scully, the ship was taking on water. It sank less than an hour after you were rescued.

(There is a closing view of the fog-covered North Atlantic.)

[THE END]
                                          HUMBUG



SCENE 1
GIBSONTON, FL

(Two kids splash each other in the pool, laughing.)

YOUNGER GLAZEBROOK SON: Stop!

(They continue play-attacking as someone strange watches them from the trees. It's green eyes staring at them, he breathes heavily and makes his way through the trees. It's skin looks scaly. The boys do not notice it as it walks out towards the lawn quietly. The older one hears it and looks in the general direction. The younger one does the same, then splashes the older brother. This incites the older brother to splash back, and they continue playing. The strange being swims into the pool and slowly approaches them underwater. He jumps out, screaming. The boys scream back. The younger one splashes the man lightly as he picks the boy up playfully.)

Oh, Dad, cut it out.

OLDER GLAZEBROOK SON: Beautiful, Dad.

JERALD GLAZEBROOK: Quit picking on your brother. Remember he loves you!

YOUNGER GLAZEBROOK SON: No, I don't!

OLDER GLAZEBROOK SON: We're glad you're back home, Dad.

JERALD GLAZEBROOK: Ah, not as glad as I am.

OLDER GLAZEBROOK SON: Did you see a lot of weird stuff this year?

JERALD GLAZEBROOK: Yup, it was the weirdest show ever. But right now, your mother thinks you guys are getting ready for bed and if she comes out here and finds you guys still in the pool, she's going to kill me. So come on, out of the pool.

(He puts his youngest son down. The boys moan and whine. In the forest, something else is watching them.)

YOUNGER GLAZEBROOK SON: Awww...

OLDER GLAZEBROOK SON: Awwww, Dad...

JERALD GLAZEBROOK: Quit your whining. Come on or no bedtime story. Out you go, that's it.

(The thing in the trees is more of a monster than the Alligator-Skinned Man, weezing as it breathes. It winces constantly and it's face is bloodied naturally. The boys start back to the house.)

OLDER GLAZEBROOK SON: Come on, Dad, there's no school tomorrow...

(Jerald floats on his back a little, shooting water up into the air with his mouth. The thing watches and makes it's way into the pool. It approaches Jerald and he stands, looking at it.)

JERALD GLAZEBROOK: What the hell?

(It screeches and bites into Jerald's side. It repeatedly does so as Glazebrook screams with each bite. It rips through the skin and Jerald holds himself up on the ladder as blood pours out into the pool. It screams and snarls in victory.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder hands Scully a picture of Glazebrook's face.)

SCULLY: What happened to him?

MULDER: Nothing you can ascertain from that photograph. The victim suffered from ichthyosis, a congenital skin disease characterized by the shedding of the epidermis in the form of scales.

(He hands her another picture of a large wound in the side of Glazebrook.)

This shows the entry wound of the undetermined weapon. There were no other injuries inflicted upon the body, no internal organs removed and/or cannibalized, and there's no signs of sexual molestation either.

(He stands.)

That's forty-eight attacks over the last twenty-eight years. Occurring in every state in the continental U.S. almost, the first in Oregon and the last five in Florida.

(He shows pictures of various people with the same wounds.)

The victims range from all different age groups, races, both male and female. The mutilations appear so motiveless that one would suspect some form of ritual yet they adhere to no known cult. A lone serial killer would have been expected to escalate the level of violence of his attacks over such an extended period of time. So what do you think, Scully? What are your initial thoughts?

(Scully looks at the picture of Glazebrook.)

SCULLY: Imagine going through your whole life looking like this.



SCENE 3

GIBSONTON, FL

(There is a picture of Glazebrook on his coffin. There are flowers all around and the mourners sit off to the side. The priest is at the podium.)

PRIEST: "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death..."

(Scully and Mulder walk over. Sheriff Hamilton nods to them from across the way.)

"I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies."

(Mulder walks past Scully in the row of seats and they sit down.)

"Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me..."

(He turns the page with his foot, having no arms.)

"...all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever." We are gathered here today to mourn the passing of Jerald Glazebrook.

(In the front row of seats, Glazebrook's wife rubs the back of her eldest son in comfort. She has a thick beard. Her younger son is seated next to the other son. Scully watches them.)

Beloved husband, father, friend and entertainer.

(Scully looks at a man in the front row as he takes out a flask and drinks from it. There is a smaller person attached to him, who has his head in the bigger man's side and is also dressed in a suit.

We mourn not only the passing who overcame the obstacles of his earthly incarnation but also the passing of the love that dwells in his all too-human heart. We mourn the passing of the admiration and the respect he instilled in his fellow colleagues.

(Scully looks in back of her at a row of other circus freaks, each deformed in some way. There is a fortune teller, a teenager and a little kid, both of whom have the same problem. Scully and the little boy smile at each other.)

We mourn the passing of the laughter and the enjoyment he brought each audience who saw him.

(Mulder slowly looks to his right and slowly looks up at the giant sitting next to him.)

For although Jerry was a world-renowned escape artist, there is one strongbox from which none of us can escape.

(The coffin starts to shake violently. Sheriff Hamilton tries to hold it down and looks to some other people.)

HAMILTON: Help...

MAN #1: I got it...

(Other men run up to the coffin and lift it up and away from the grave. A bump starts moving underneath the covering of the grave.)

WOMAN #1: Move it out of there...

WOMAN #2: Oh my lord!

(As the congregation moans and gasps, a man breaks through the covering, growling, carrying a railroad spike and a hammer.)

MAN #2: I don't believe it...

BLOCKHEAD: Having not known the deceased personally, I am in no position to perform a proper eulogy. I'm sure he was a nice guy, et cetera, et cetera. But as an admirer of the man's work, I am in a position to perform an impromptu tribute in his honor. Namely, ramming this spike into my chest!

(He does so with one quick blow, sparks flying off of the contact point. Blood coats the front of his sweater. The crowd gasps and cringes. Even Mulder and Scully flinch. The man, Doctor Blockhead, staggers around, screaming.)

MAN #3: You crazy, don't you have any respect at all?

BLOCKHEAD: I think I hit my left ventricle!

(Hamilton grabs his arm and Blockhead shoves him off.)

WOMAN #2: This is a funeral!

BLOCKHEAD: Get back, fascist!

(People start jumping at him left and right. In fact, the whole congregation starts after him.)

MAN #2: For crying out loud!

MAN #4: Get him out of here! Get him out of here!

WOMAN #3: You're awful!

(Mulder and Scully are left all alone, seated where they were. The rest of the seats are pretty much in disarray. They sit in silence for a second.)

MULDER: I can't wait for the wake.



SCENE 4
PHIL'S DINER

(Mulder, Scully and Hamilton are sitting at a table.)

MULDER: On his vicap form, Jerald Glazebrook's occupation is listed as artist.

HAMILTON: Jerry was an artist... the best escape artist since Houdini. He should have been headlining Vegas but his skin condition kept him on the sideshow circuit.

SCULLY: I guess I didn't realize that sideshows were still in existence.

HAMILTON: There are about two or three of them still around.

MULDER: I got the impression that Glazebrook wasn't the only sideshow performer residing here.

HAMILTON: The town was founded back in the 20s when some of Barnum and Bailey's troops started coming down here during the winter off-season.

SCULLY: You know, this town's history might help explain our case's history. A sideshow performer would have toured much of the country over the years. And their isolation from everyday society caused by their physical deformities could have built up pathological resentments so intense that murder might be...

HAMILTON: Now, now, hold on a second. Around here, we refer to them as "very special people." Now, some of them may be different on the outside but it's what's inside that counts. And on the inside, they're as normal as anybody.

SCULLY: Until their arrests, many serial killers are considered by their friends and family to be quite "normal." If you truly regard these people as normal, then you must also consider the possibility that they are capable of committing these crimes.

HAMILTON: It's just been my experience that many people have a harder time accepting these people's deformities than they do themselves.

(Mulder opens up the menu and looks at a picture.)

MULDER: Sheriff, what is this? This design here, it's, uh, copyrighted by Hepcat Helm.

(He points to a picture of a monkey with a mermaid's tail, then at the copyright logo.)

Is that a local artist?

(Hamilton chuckles.)

HAMILTON: A bit too local. His workplace is right behind my station house.

MULDER: Do you think that we could meet Hep... cat?



SCENE 5
HEPCAT HELM'S WORKSHOP

(A grotesque rubber head sits on a pike as Screamin' Jay Hawkins' song, "Frenzy", plays loudly. Hepcat Helm is sitting at his desk painting as Hamilton walks in, followed by the agents.)

HAMILTON: Hepcat! Hepcat!

(Hepcat looks at them, then turns down the music.)

HEPCAT HELM: Who are the rubes?

HAMILTON: These are F.B.I. Agents Scully and Mulder. This is Hepcat Helm. He operates a carnival funhouse.

HEPCAT HELM: Oh man, how many times have I told you not to call it that?

(He throws down the handkerchief and goes over to them and looks at Mulder.)

It's not some rinky-dink carny-ride. People go through it, they don't have fun. They get the hell scared out of them. It's not a funhouse, it's a tabernacle of terror.

(Hamilton looks over at Mulder.)

HAMILTON: It's a funhouse.

(Mulder takes out the menu and shows the picture to Hepcat.)

MULDER: Mister Helm, I wanted to ask you about this menu illustration. I recognized most of the historical portraits you've drawn here, but what's this here?

(Scully rolls her eyes at the words "historical portraits.")

HEPCAT HELM: It's the Feejee Mermaid.

(He walks back to his desk carrying the menu.)

HAMILTON: Is that what that thing is?

SCULLY: What's the Feejee Mermaid?

HEPCAT HELM: The Feejee Mermaid. It's, it's the Feejee Mermaid!

HAMILTON: It's a bit of, uh... humbug Barnum pulled in the last century.

HEPCAT HELM: Barnum billed it as a real live mermaid but when people went into see it, all they saw was a real dead monkey sewn on the tail of a fish.

(Mulder walks over to him.)

MULDER: A monkey?

HEPCAT HELM: A mummified monkey.

HAMILTON: It supposedly looked so bad, he had to exhibit it as a "genuine fake."

HEPCAT HELM: Oh, but see? That's why Barnum was a genius. You never know where the truth ends and the humbug begins. He came right out and said, "This Feejee Mermaid thing is just a bunch of B.S." That just made people want to go and see it even more. So, I mean... who knows? Maybe for box office reasons, Barnum hocked it as a hoax... when in reality...

MULDER: The Feejee Mermaid was a reality.

(Hepcat exhales loudly and shrugs. Mulder walks back over to Hamilton.)

Sheriff, we're going to need to find a place to stay tonight.

HAMILTON: There are lodgings right across the way, but, uh... what's all this about?

(Mulder takes out a picture of a long row of small footprints in the sand heading towards a rock pile.)

MULDER: These tracks were found at several of the past few crime scenes. They've defied exact identification but one expert speculated that they might be simian in nature.

HAMILTON: You don't mean to tell me you think these tracks were made by the Feejee Mermaid?

SCULLY: Do you recall what Barnum said about suckers?

(She nods slightly towards Mulder.)



SCENE 6
GULF BREEZE TRAILER COURT

(The proprietor, Mister Nutt, is a midget. He climbs up a small stepladder and puts it down on the desk in front of the two agents. Nutt's dog sits on the counter.)

MULDER: Tell me, have you done much circus work in your life?

NUTT: And what makes you think I've ever spectated a circus, much less been enslaved by one?

MULDER: I know that many of the citizens here are former circus hands and I just thought that maybe you would have done...

NUTT: You thought that because I am a person of short stature that the only career I could procure for myself would be one confined to the so-called "big top." You took one quick look at me and decided that you could deduce my entire life.

(Mulder shakes his head a little. The dog whimpers as Nutt starts around to the area in shelf in back of the desk.)

Never would it have occurred to you that a person of my height could have possibly obtained a degree in hotel management.

(He holds up his degree.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, I meant no offense.

(Nutt walks back up to the desk.)

NUTT: Well, then why should I take offense? Just because it's human nature to make instantaneous judgments of others based solely upon their physical appearances? Why, I've done the same thing to you, for example. I've taken in your all-American features, your dour demeanor, your unimaginative necktie design...

(Mulder looks down at his tie.)

...and concluded that you work for the government. An F.B.I. agent.

(Mulder looks at Scully, who arches her eyebrows in surprise.)

But do you see the tragedy here? I have mistakenly reduced you to a stereotype. A caricature. Instead of regarding you as a specific, unique individual.

MULDER: But I am an F.B.I. agent.

(He holds up his badge. The dog whimpers some more. Nutt smirks a little and takes out another paper.)

NUTT: Register here, please.

(He rings the bell. Mulder and Scully are led by their trailers by the bellhop, a man named Lanny. He is the man with the smaller twin that has the twin's head inside of his chest at the funeral. He is also carrying their bags.)

MULDER: Tell me, have you done much circus work in your life?

LANNY: I was on the stage for most of my life. I was a headliner.

SCULLY: Did it not bother you to have other people staring at you?

LANNY: Best work I ever had. All I had to do was stand there. Occasionally, I'd say...

(He stops and stands tall as if on stage. They watch him.)

"Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like you to meet my brother Leonard."

(He pauses.)

"Excuse him, he's a little shy." Big laughs, I tell you, big laughs.

(They start to walk again.)

MULDER: Why'd you give it up?

LANNY: Mister Nutt, the kindhearted manager here, convinced me that to make a living by publicly displaying my deformity lacked dignity... so now I carry other people's luggage.

(They come to a set of trailers.)

I believe these are your trailers. If they are not, then I am wrong.

(Mulder takes the suitcases from him.)

Oh, that's most considerate. Thank you very much.

(They shake hands and Lanny starts off.)

Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite.

(He turns back in a worried manner. I walks back hurriedly, unscrewing his flask.)

No, no! That, that's not what I meant. I, I didn't mean to imply we had bedbugs. I, I meant to say, "Don't let... don't let the..."

MULDER: The Feejee Mermaids bite.

(Lanny tips his flask to him.)

LANNY: Yes, that's right, the Fee, the Feejee Mermaids. Don't, that's right, that's...

(He takes a sip from his flask and starts off.)

That, that's exactly... the Feejee Mermaids bite...

SCULLY: Mulder, what is this Feejee Mermaid business?

MULDER: Every murder investigation begins with a list of possible suspects. You should try not to be so exclusive, Scully.

(He hands her her suitcase.)

SCULLY: As long as you try not to let the atmosphere of this town distort your list all out of proportion.

(They stare at each other.)



SCENE 7
HEPCAT HELM'S WORKSHOP

(Hepcat Helm is listening to the same song as before, playing it extremely loud. He is painting a mask for his funhouse, then he walks over to a desk under the window and wipes off his hands. He takes an instrument and goes over to another sculpture, this one made mostly of glass. Reflected in the glass, in the window behind him, is the small monster slowly crawling in through the window. Helm stands up and the monster is gone. He goes to work on another part and sees the small monster crawling towards him in another reflection, looking blurred and distorted. He turns around and looks at it.)

HEPCAT HELM: What the hell?

(It pounces, it's grotesque face flying at it. Blood splatters over the menu as it pries it's jaws into his neck. There is a gash in his head.)



SCENE 8
GULF BREEZE TRAILER COURT

(Mulder is going for his morning jog. He stops in the road, trying to catch his air, and hears some splashing in the lake next to the road. Looking over, he sees a half-naked man coming out of the water, wearing only a loincloth. He has a tattoo of a puzzle all over his body, some of the pieces painted blue, mostly around the head and shoulder regions. He crouches down and starts eating the fish as Mulder watches intently. The strange man looks over at Mulder and throws down the fish, then starts off towards the forest.)



SCENE 9
SCULLY'S TRAILER

(The time is 7:15. Scully's eyes flicker open. Birds chirp outside as she looks out the window. She closes her eyes for a second and looks back outside, still laying down. A man seemingly falls off her roof. She sits up and sees that there is actually a men bouncing on a trampoline outside her window while another two people watch. In the background, people are performing various stunts. There is a frantic pounding on the door. She loosely puts on her robe and opens the door. Lanny stands there, his robe also loosely tied on.)

LANNY: Uh, ma'am... sheriff, he, uh... wants to see you.

(Leonard is exposed out of Lanny's stomach. Scully can't help but stare at him. Lanny, meanwhile, has his eyes on her cleavage, which is partly exposed. They both slowly look at each other, then look down at their objects of interest, then tie their robes up tighter.)

There's been another murder.



SCENE 10
HEPCAT HELM'S WORKSHOP

(Hamilton is standing over Helm's body, writing down notes on his pad. Scully is kneeling over Helm. Mulder is looking at the window. There is a streak of blood on it.)

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: Unit Thirteen, man down...

MULDER: Hey, Scully, there's some blood on the window here we should send to the lab.

SCULLY: Why run a test on the victim's blood?

MULDER: No, not this window.

(He walks over to the adjacent window as she stands.)

This window. This seems to be the point of entry and there's a... smear of blood on the outside of the window.

(He takes off some blood from a streak on the outside of the window with his finger.)

SCULLY: Why would there be blood before the attack?

HAMILTON: Why didn't the attacker just come through the open door? For a person to crawl in and out of these windows, they'd have to be a contortionist... or just plain crazy. Or both.



SCENE 11
GULF BREEZE TRAILER COURT

(Doctor Blockhead is suspended over a vat of hot water in a straitjacket, grunting and groaning. He starts unbuckling the straps when Mulder and Scully walk over.)

MULDER: While they're performing the autopsy, I want to go down to the...

(Mulder and Scully watch from a short distance as he frees himself. He throws off the straitjacket, takes the key and looks at the agents.)

BLOCKHEAD: How many people do you know that can get out of a straitjacket in under three minutes?

SCULLY: Fortunately, none.

MULDER: We caught your act yesterday at the funeral. That was some trick with the railroad spike.

(Blockhead unlocks his restraints and jumps down.)

BLOCKHEAD: Doctor Blockhead does not perform "tricks."

(He walks over to a toolbox and opens it up. He takes out a hammer and a nail. There are a number of skull pins next to the nails. Mulder and Scully walk over to him.)

Doctor Blockhead performs "astounding acts of body manipulation and pain endurance."

(He puts the nail in his left nostril and begins tapping it into his head as Mulder and Scully watch on in horror and awe.)

SCULLY: You must be one of those rare individuals whose... nerve endings don't register pain.

(He puts the hammer down and pulls out a pair of pliers.)

BLOCKHEAD: You just keep telling yourself that.

MULDER: Have you ever performed this tr, uh, act on anyone else?

BLOCKHEAD: What, are you sick? I tell my audiences that if they're stupid enough to try this themselves, they'll end up with a slight lobotomy. I am a professional.

MULDER: Exactly how does one become a professional blockhead? May I?

(He takes the pliers and starts to pull the nail out from Blockhead's head.)

BLOCKHEAD: Starting in my homeland of Yemen, I studied with yogis, fakirs and swamis, learning the ancient arts of body manipulation.

(Scully and Mulder grimace all through Blockhead's speaking as he slowly pulls out the nail. Mulder looks at the bloody nail.)

But most men know nothing of these arts. For instance, did you know that through the protective Chinese practice of Tiea Bu Shan, you can train your testicles to draw up into your abdomen?

MULDER: Oh, I'm doing that as we speak.

(The Conundrum pops out of the vat, gasping for air. They all look at him in shock.)

I saw him this morning down by the river, he was eating a fish.

BLOCKHEAD: He knows between-show snacks will ruin his appetite.

(He rubs the Conundrum's bald head.)

MULDER: I could be mistaken. Maybe it was another bald-headed, jigsaw-puzzle-tattooed, naked guy I saw.

SCULLY: Is this... man also a body manipulator?

BLOCKHEAD: No. In the classical sense, the Conundrum's a geek.

MULDER: He eats live animals.

BLOCKHEAD: He eats anything... live animals, dead animals, rocks, light bulbs, corkscrews, battery cables, cranberries...

SCULLY: Human flesh?

BLOCKHEAD: Only the Conundrum can answer that question. But he doesn't answer questions, he merely... poses them.

(He takes out a jar of crickets.)

When an audience partakes in the Conundrum's human piranha act, they are left to ask themselves...

(He pours out some crickets onto the Conundrum's head, who eats them joyously.)

"Why." But... where are my manners?

(He holds out the jar to the agents.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(She takes a cricket, puts it in her mouth, smiles and walks away. Mulder looks at her, then at the crickets, and leaves. He catches up to Scully, and watches her in disbelief. She smiles, reaches behind Mulder's ear, and "pulls out" the live cricket.)

It's an old sleight of hand my uncle once taught me. He was only an amateur magician, but he was still better than those two.

MULDER: Well, I'm going over to the lab to see if they can test the blood on the window against the blood on Doctor Blockhead's nail.

(He holds out his hand, then moves it in a clockwise direction. When he finishes the circle, he is holding out the nail. He starts off.)

Everybody's uncle is an amateur magician.



SCENE 12
GIBSONTON MUSEUM OF CURIOSITIES
3:14 PM

(Scully walks into the old cabin. The bell rings as the door opens. There is a sign next to a pot that says "Freaks Free; Others Please Leave Donation." Scully walks over to it, puts a bill in, and starts looking around. She looks at a picture of siamese twins. Passing various strange things in jars, she picks up another picture of the siamese twins. They are named Chang and Eng. The curator walks out behind her. His face is disfigured and is reflected in a small mirror.)

CURATOR: Welcome to my museum. May I put to rest any questions you may have conjured?

SCULLY: I was just reading about the fascinating life of Chang and Eng and wondering if their death was just as fascinating.

CURATOR: Oh, very much so. On a cold January eve in 1874, Eng awoke to find his brother had passed away during the course of the night. A few hours later, Eng himself departed from this world. Now, these facts themselves may be less than fascinating but imagine... imagine being Eng and lying there.

(He puts his disfigured hand on her shoulder.)

Knowing that essentially half your body was now dead... that the rest must inevitably follow... and being able to do about it absolutely nothing. At the autopsy, it was officially concluded that Chang died of a cerebral hemorrhage.

SCULLY: And what was the official cause of Eng's death?

CURATOR: Fright.

(He smiles and starts to walk away.)

SCULLY: Do you have any information on blockhead or geek acts?

(They walk into another room.)

CURATOR: This is a historical collection of human curiosities. Blockheads are skilled performers.

SCULLY: Like magicians?

CURATOR: Like sword swallowers who really do swallow swords. And geeks are neither skilled nor curiosities. They're merely unseemly... not even attaining the level of "gaffs."

SCULLY: "Gaffs?"

(The curator takes a picture of two siamese twins who look very different.)

CURATOR: Observe closely the dissimilarity of the facial features. Conjoined twins are always identical. These twins are phonies... gaffs.

SCULLY: Sort of like the Feejee Mermaid?

(He laughs and puts the picture down.)

CURATOR: You're investigating the Alligator Man's murder, yes? I have something I believe you might find of some interest.

(He hands her a picture of "Jim-Jim, the Dog-Faced Boy.")

SCULLY: What does this have to do with the Glazebrook murder?

CURATOR: I've recently come into possession of an authentic P.T. Barnum exhibit. Now, I don't show this display to all my customers... only those with the intellectual curiosity to appreciate it.

(He walks over to a door behind Scully.)

Barnum billed it as "the great unknown."

(He opens the door. Scully is about to enter, but he stops her.)

I must first ask of you two favors. Tell no soul what you witness in here.

SCULLY: And the second favor?

CURATOR: An additional donation of five dollars.

(She hands him five dollars and steps inside the dark room. He locks the door behind her. She walks over to the only object in the room, a trunk cast in a spotlight. She tentatively opens the trunk to find... nothing. A door swings open to her left with an "Exit" sign above it. A buzzer goes off and she looks down at the trunk, smiling slightly at having been duped.)



SCENE 13
SCULLY'S TRAILER

(Mulder hears a clanking and a groaning underneath the trailer. He looks under and sees a small figure moving around. He walks over to where the small figure is, unhooking his holster. He kneels down and Mister Nutt crawls out.)

MULDER: Does Agent Scully know that you're under her crawlspace?

NUTT: I was merely repairing the plumbing on this unit. I know what you're thinking, my friend, but you are grossly mistaken.

(He and Mulder stand.)

Just because I am not of so-called "average" height does not mean I must receive my thrills vicariously. Not all woman are attracted to overly tall, lanky men such as yourself. You'd be surprised how many women find my size intriguingly alluring.

MULDER: And you'd be surprised how many men do as well.

(Nutt, offended and disgusted, walks off. Mulder looks at his footprints. Scully steps out of her trailer.)

SCULLY: Oh, it's you. Is Mister Nutt finished with the plumbing?

(Inside, Mulder and Scully sit across from each other.)

MULDER: The blood from the window matched the blood from the nail but they were both O-positive. They've been sent for further analysis. I ran a background check on Doctor Blockhead. His real name is Jeffrey Swaim and he wasn't born in Yemen, he was born in Milwaukee. He does not hold a doctorate.

SCULLY: Well, I ended up running a bit of a background check myself.

MULDER: On who?

(She flips open a folder.)

SCULLY: On an orphan discovered in the wild forest of Albania in 1943. "Although physically adept at catching his own food, he could not speak a word, save for a few savage grunts. Brought to this country, he was exhibited behind a locked cage, necessitated by his feral ferocity, where he would terrify onlookers by devouring chunks of raw meat." However, for reasons I could not ascertain, he ran away from the circus and spent a vague number of years mysteriously roaming about, supporting himself through a number of non-descript jobs. Eventually, he wound up in Gibsonton, where he took up a career in law enforcement and has spent the past four terms serving as sheriff.

MULDER: You're talking about Sheriff Hamilton?

SCULLY: I'm telling you that before becoming Sheriff Hamilton, James Hamilton was Jim-Jim, the Dog-Faced Boy.

(She hands him the picture given to her by the curator.)



SCENE 14
SHERIFF HAMILTON'S HOUSE

(Sheriff Hamilton is digging a hole in the front yard with a shovel. Scully and Mulder are in the bushes watching him. Hamilton looks up at the full moon, then cuts something, rubs it on his hand and throws it into the hole. He recovers the hole and walks inside. Mulder and Scully wait until he is gone, then walk over to the hole and start to uncover it. Mulder is using a shovel while Scully is playing look-out. Mulder stops and they whisper to each other.)

MULDER: You know, Scully, hypertricosis does not connote lycanthropy.

SCULLY: What are you implying?

MULDER: We're being highly discriminatory here. Just because a man was once inflicted with excessive hairiness, we've no reason to suspect him of aberrant behavior.

SCULLY: It's like assuming guilt based solely on skin color, isn't it?

MULDER: Yeah.

(They look at each other, then kneel down and start digging with their hands. Mulder takes out a napkin and puts the object in it. Hamilton walks out and shines a flashlight on them.)

HAMILTON: May I ask what you're doing?

MULDER: We're exhuming... your potato.

(He holds up the napkin with the sliced potato that Hamilton buried and they unearthed.)

HAMILTON: May I ask why?

(They stand.)

SCULLY: Sheriff, it, it's, it's been documented that many serial killers possess a fascination with police work, some of them even holding positions on their local force... so surveillance of investigation team members is often utilized as a precautionary...

MULDER: We found out you used to be the Dog-Faced Boy.

(He hands Hamilton the advertisement of the Dog-Faced Boy. Hamilton looks at it and smiles.)

HAMILTON: Boy, look how skinny I was back then.

SCULLY: So that is you.

HAMILTON: Oh, sure. I spent the first half of my life as Jim-Jim. Then one morning I noticed a bald spot on top of my head and realized I was not only losing my hair but my career as well. Eventually all the hair went... on top of my head, anyways. The rest of my body is still pretty hairy, which is why I never go to the beach.

SCULLY: That doesn't quite explain the potato.

HAMILTON: I got, uh... some warts on my hand.

MULDER: That doesn't quite explain the potato.

HAMILTON: To get rid of warts, you rub a sliced potato on your hand and bury it under a full moon.

(Mulder and Scully look embarrassed.)

Investigation isn't going too well, is it?

(Mulder throws the potato back in the hole.)



SCENE 15
TRAILER PARK

(The Conundrum walks along, a piece of paper in his shorts. The manager's dog starts barking at him, and he runs after it. After chasing it for a while, the dog runs into his doggy-door and the Conundrum slides after it, just missing it. Mister Nutt opens the door and looks at him. The Conundrum stands, ashamed, and hands him the paper with one of Blockhead's skull pins in it. Nutt looks at it, and it is a check with the name "The Conundrum" at the top. Nutt closes the door.)

NUTT: So, tell me, Commodore... why are the weirdos the only ones that pay their rent checks in advance?

(He walks away, but the dog continues growling and barking at the door.)

I warn you, you tattooed cretin, I have a licensed firearm and I'm more than eager for an opportunity to use it!

(He goes to open the door when the mutant's hand reaches out and grabs his ankle. He screams as he falls to the ground. The thing pulls his foot through the door and starts trying to pull Nutt through as he looks on in horror. He finally kicks it away and crawls back in. The mutant shoves it's head through the door, screaming. Nutt screams as well.)



SCENE 16

(A man with bloody hands unlocks the door and walks in, waking Scully up. She sits up in bed, pointing her gun. Lanny puts his bloody hands on her shoulders.)

LANNY: I found him. He's dead. He's dead...

(She looks at him, confused.)



SCENE 17
MISTER NUTT'S TRAILER

(Hamilton points out the blood on the outside of the doggy-door to Scully)

HAMILTON: Lanny says all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.

(Inside, Mulder is looking at Nutt's body. Lanny is also there, standing of to the side in his robe.)

MULDER: Scully, come here!

LANNY: He was like a brother to me...

(Hamilton puts his hand on Lanny's shoulder. Scully kneels down next to Mulder.)

MULDER: I don't know if a contortionist can get through that doggy-door, Scully, but look at this...

(He shows her the skull pin, which is in Nutt's hand. Lanny starts screaming and banging on the door. Hamilton grabs him and turns him around.)

HAMILTON: Lanny! Lanny! Take it easy. You're going to hurt yourself.

LANNY: So what?

HAMILTON: So you might hurt me in the process.

(Scully looks a little disappointed. Lanny hugs Hamilton, who looks at the agents.)

He gets this way sometimes. I'll have to toss him in the drunk tank.

MULDER: We'll take Jeffrey Swaim into custody.

HAMILTON: C'mon, Lanny, let's go...

(They walk out. Mulder stands up and walks to the door.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder...

(She stands.)

For a while there, I was beginning to suspect this case involved something a bit more, um...

MULDER: Freakish?

(She shrugs a little and nods, kind of like an embarrassed "yes.")

You really shouldn't complain about banality, Scully, when your main suspect is the human blockhead.

(He smiles and starts out.)



SCENE 18
DOCTOR BLOCKHEAD'S TRAILER

(Doctor Blockhead has attached hundreds of hooks into his chest. All of the hooks have ropes on them. He is adjusting them, sitting on a bed of nails when there is a knock on the door.)

BLOCKHEAD: It's open!

(Scully walks in, showing her badge, followed by Mulder.)

SCULLY: Mister Swaim, federal agents, we're here to qu...

(She stops, looking at him.)

BLOCKHEAD: It's a variation of an American Indian sun dance ritual. I suspend myself by these hooks and the pain becomes so unbearable I leave my body. If people knew the true price of spirituality, there'd be more atheists.

SCULLY: Mister Swaim, we're here to take you into custody to question you about some recent murders.

BLOCKHEAD: I don't answer any questions until I talk to my lawyer.

MULDER: Who's your lawyer?

BLOCKHEAD: I represent myself.

(Scully grabs his arm.)

SCULLY: Sir, if you're going to be uncooperative, I'll have to handcuff you.

BLOCKHEAD: What gives you fascists the right to do that?

(Scully stands him up and handcuffs him.)

SCULLY: Did I not mention we're federal agents?

BLOCKHEAD: Did I not mention I'm an escape artist?

(He throws off the handcuffs, puts them on Scully, pushes her into Mulder and runs out the door. Mulder, despite trying to stop his fall, falls onto the bed of nails.)

SCULLY: Mulder, are you okay?

MULDER: It's more comfortable than a futon.

(The door swings open and Sheriff Hamilton stands there, holding Blockhead by the roped hooks.)

HAMILTON: Hey... look what I caught.

(He gives the ropes a little tug.)

BLOCKHEAD: Ouch!



SCENE 19
POLICE STATION

(In the drunk tank, Lanny moans and groans. He has blood on his hands still, and his eyes open when he ears a slithering sound. He looks onto the ceiling and sees something horrific.)

LANNY: What the hell?

(The thing on the ceiling squeals happily as it crawls to the window. Lanny screams.)

No! No!

(Hamilton leads Blockhead into the station by the arm. Mulder and Scully follow quickly.)

BLOCKHEAD: This has all the makings of one of those mistaken identity, miscarriage of justice things that prove so popular on Sixty Minutes.

(Hamilton sits him down. Mulder holds up a bag containing the skull pin. Hamilton sits at his desk.)

MULDER: Does this belong to you?

BLOCKHEAD: The fifth amendment of our beloved constitution says...

(He stops and everyone turns when they hear a high-pitched moaning.)

MULDER: What is that?

HAMILTON: It's Lanny in the drunk tank. He'll be all right once he sleeps it off.

(Scully is looking down the hallway at Lanny.)

SCULLY: No, I don't think he's going to sleep this one off.

(They all run over to Lanny's cell, including Blockhead, who is led by Mulder. They look at Lanny, who looks dead, blood on his hands. There is blood on the wall underneath the window.)

MULDER: There's been another attack.

HAMILTON: How could anyone have gotten in there?

SCULLY: No one got in, but some one got out.

(Lanny moans. Hamilton unlocks the door.)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: I'm not sure myself, Mulder, but I think we'll know more when we find Leonard.

MULDER: Leonard?

SCULLY: Lanny's brother.

(The agents walk in, followed by the others. Scully rolls Lanny over and pulls his robe away to reveal that Leonard is gone and there is a wound where he once was.)

HAMILTON: Oh, God, they extracted the twin.

SCULLY: No, the twin extracted itself.

(Mulder kneels down and looks at the wound.)

MULDER: But it's an appendage...

SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder... this wound is identical to the other victims' wounds. With one exception. He's not bleeding.

(Mulder stands.)

HAMILTON: If you're trying to tell me his twin brother can crawl out of his body and then go gallivant around town, you're as drunk as he is.

(Scully stands up.)

SCULLY: You said it yourself, Sheriff. It's what's inside that counts. I have a feeling that Lanny has an internal anomaly that allows his conjoining twin to disjoin

MULDER: But, how? H-how...

LANNY: How could I turn him in without turning myself in?

SCULLY: Lanny, why does he attack other people?

LANNY: I don't think he knows he's harming anyone. He's merely seeking... another brother.

(He moans, almost crying.)

HAMILTON: Are you in pain, Lanny?

(Lanny sits up.)

LANNY: It hurts. It hurts not to be wanted. I don't know why he hates me so. I've taken care of him for all of our lives. Maybe that is the reason why.

SCULLY: How long can he survive outside of your body?

LANNY: Long enough... to understand that you cannot change the way you were born. Don't worry. He'll come back. He always does. I'm still his only brother.

(Lanny lays back down.)

MULDER: Sheriff, we're going to need the paramedics.

(Hamilton runs off.)

Scully, you're the medical expert. If you think the twin can disengage, I believe you but how mobile could such a thing be?

(Scully looks out the window and sees a small figure crawl along the ground quickly. The gate in the back swings open.)

SCULLY: Too mobile.

(Scully looks at him and runs out. Mulder follows. Blockhead looks at Lanny.)

BLOCKHEAD: So your twin can, uh...

(He makes a "going out" motion.)

And then...

(He makes a "coming in" motion. Lanny nods.)

What an act!

(Scully and Mulder run out of the gate to the nearest building, which is large and brown. They hear a snarling growl.)

SCULLY: I'll cover the back.

(She runs off and Mulder runs up the steps. He flicks the switch next to the door and the generator turns on. Taking out his gun, he opens the door and begins walking down the dark hallway. He peeks around the corner and sees Leonard crawl backwards down the adjacent hallway away from Mulder. Mulder aims his gun, but is too late. He runs that way and turns the corner. He runs down the next hallway. Turning the corner, he finds a dead end. He pushes against it, then heads back. Scully hears another growl then some footsteps. She turns the corner and points her gun.)

Freeze!

(A rumbling starts and a suspended mannequin with a head similar to Leonard's comes flying at her on a rope from the ceiling and stops, cackling and making strange noises.)

The funhouse.

(Mulder turns another corner and finds another dead end. He hears a growl and sees Leonard crawling away again. He runs down that hallway and quickly turns the corner, slamming into a wall. He staggers into the adjacent wall, which spins around, taking Mulder with it. Scully walks into the hall of mirrors. Everywhere around her, there are Scullys. She hears another growl and turns to see Leonard on the ground. She fires at him but only ends up breaking the mirror that reflected him. She looks at the shards and sees Leonard is nowhere around. She starts walking down a hallway and bumps into a mirror. Turning left, she walks down another hallway and Mulder slides out of a shaft in front of her. She instinctively points her gun, but steps back when she sees who it is.)

MULDER: I thought I heard a shot fired.

SCULLY: I think we better go outside and catch this thing coming out.

(She steps over Mulder and walks down the hallway. The agents run out and see Leonard crawling into the woods. They run down the road and point their guns at another small figure. The figure starts barking and they lower their guns.)

It's the manager's dog.

MULDER: The trailer park.

(The dog leads them through the forest.)



SCENE 20
CONUNDRUM'S TRAILER

(The Conundrum steps out of his trailer, carrying a garbage bag. He puts it in the can as Leonard sneaks up behind him. He turns and screams as the mutant jumps onto him and starts biting. Mulder and Scully run into the park, hearing screaming and shrieking. They come to the Conundrum's trailer and see him lying on the ground, looking a little bloated. They kneel down next to him.)

SCULLY: Are you all right?

MULDER: Have you seen a, uh... uh...

(He tries to show how big it is, but runs off in frustration, not expecting an answer. Scully runs off as well. The Conundrum looks at his stomach and rubs it as it gurgles contentedly.



SCENE 21
GULF BREEZE TRAILER COURT

(In the morning, the sheriff is talking to a deputy. Scully is walking slowly towards the middle of the camp.)

HAMILTON: Uh, check out the area behind that trailer. Let me know what you find.

(The deputy walks off and Hamilton turns to Scully.)

Now, you're sure it was the twin you saw running around here. I mean, maybe it was the Fiji Mermaid and he jumped back in the river and swum his way back to Fiji.

(Hamilton walks away as Mulder walks up to her.)

MULDER: Now you know how I feel.

(Mulder keeps walking. Scully walks up to Doctor Blockhead, who is tying various pieces of junk to the roof of his car. The Conundrum gets into the front seat.)

SCULLY: You're taking off?

BLOCKHEAD: With that thing still on the loose?

SCULLY: They've been searching for it all day. It can't have sustained itself for this long.

BLOCKHEAD: It will probably try to crawl back up into it's brother.

SCULLY: No, his brother Lanny died last night. I already performed the autopsy on him this morning.

(Blockhead throws the rope over and walks around the car.)

BLOCKHEAD: So, I guess it's true, you can never go home again.

SCULLY: His body wounds were non-fatal. He died as a result of advanced cirrhosis of the liver.

(Blockhead starts tying things on this side.)

BLOCKHEAD: Oh, there's a moral to the story. Lay off the booze.

SCULLY: Well, his body possesses some anatomical discrepancies... some offshoots of the esophagus and trachea that almost seem umbilical in nature and... I've never seen anything like it.

(Blockhead finishes tying.)

BLOCKHEAD: And you never will again. Twenty-first century genetic engineering will not only eradicate the siamese twins and the alligator-skinned people, but you're going to be hard-pressed to find, uh, a slight overbite or a not-so-high cheek bone. You see, I've seen the future and the future looks just like him.

(He points at Mulder, who is standing in front of a trailer in a classic model pose. Hands on his hips, one foot up on the step, looking off into the distance.)

Imagine going through your whole life looking like that. That's why it's left up to the self-made freaks like me and the Conundrum to remind people.

SCULLY: Remind people of what?

BLOCKHEAD: Nature abhors normality. It can't go very long without creating a mutant. Do you know why?

SCULLY: No, why?

BLOCKHEAD: I don't either, it's a mystery. Maybe some mysteries are never meant to be solved.

(He gets in the driver's side as Mulder walks over. He looks at the Conundrum, who looks sick.)

MULDER: What's the matter with your friend?

BLOCKHEAD: I don't know what his problem is. Maybe it's the Florida heat.

SCULLY: Hope it's nothing serious.

CONUNDRUM: Probably something I ate.

(He smiles at the agents and the two freaks drive off. Scully and Mulder watch them go, then look at each other in realization.)

[THE END]

                                            THE CALUSARI



SCENE 1
LINCOLN PARK, MURRAY, VIRGINIA

(The Holvey family is enjoying an afternoon in the park. A miniature train chugs by and young Charlie Holvey watches from a railing, holding a balloon on a string. His mother, Maggie, is a short distance away with Charlie's younger brother, two-year-old Teddy, while his father, Steve, approaches with four ice cream cones.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Charlie! Come on, Charlie. (to Teddy, handing him a balloon) Here you go, sweetie.

STEVE HOLVEY: Charlie, hey! Ice cream! (kneeling and offering a cone to Teddy) Hey buddy, you want some ice cream? Huh? (to Charlie) Here, Charlie. Here you go.

(Charlie takes the ice cream but doesn't seem very happy about it. As young Teddy holds his ice cream cone, he lets go of the balloon and it drifts up and away.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Look. There it goes.

STEVE HOLVEY: There goes your balloon.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Going to balloon land. Go bye-bye. (Teddy falls, dropping his ice cream, and starts to cry) Oh, sweetie. Don't cry.

(Maggie picks Teddy up. Steve offers one of the other ice cream cones to him.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Hey, look! Here's some ice cream! Here's some ice cream! Want some ice cream? Look.

(Teddy continues to cry, so Steve takes Charlie's balloon and offers it to Teddy. Charlie does not look pleased.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Teddy. Teddy. Here's your balloon. Look at that.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Shhh! Oh, such a mess. We gotta clean you up.

STEVE HOLVEY: Charlie and I will wait for you.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (to Teddy) You're amazing.

(Maggie heads off with Teddy. Steve remains with Charlie.)

CHARLIE: That was my balloon.

STEVE HOLVEY: Eat your ice cream before it melts.

CHARLIE: I don't want any ice cream. I want my balloon.

STEVE HOLVEY: (slightly annoyed) We'll get you a balloon, OK?

CHARLIE: No, I want my balloon.

STEVE HOLVEY: (more annoyed) Fine. (takes Charlie's ice cream cone) We'll get you another balloon. (to himself) That was a waste of good money.

(Steve puts all of the ice cream cones into a trash can. In the restroom, Maggie wipes the ice cream from Teddy's face.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: There we go. Yes. Yes.

(She picks him up and puts him in front of the sink, attaching his his halter to one of the sink supports.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: There we go. That's a boy. Good boy. OK. OK, Teddy. I'll be right back, OK?

(She goes into one of the stalls and closes the door. She sings to Teddy to keep his attention.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (singing) There were six in a bed and the little one said "Roll over! Roll over!" So they all rolled over and one fell out. Five in the bed and the little one said "Roll over! Roll over!" ...

(Teddy has let go of his balloon again and watches it float up to the ceiling.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: ... And they all rolled over and one fell out. Four in the bed and the little one said, "Roll over! Roll over!" ...

(The balloon has mysteriously moved across the ceiling, then down a foot and out through the gap at the top of the restroom door. Maggie leans down and looks under the stall door to check on him. She sees Teddy's legs.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: ... So they all rolled over and one fell out. Three in the bed and the little one said, "Roll over! Roll over!" So they all rolled over and one fell out. Two in the bed and the little one said "Roll ... "

(Maggie finishes up and opens the door to the stall, only to see Teddy's empty halter on the floor and no sign of Teddy.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Teddy? Teddy?! (she runs outside) Teddy?! Teddy?! Teddy?!

(Teddy is following the balloon, which is leading him down an embankment and out of Maggie's sight. Rather than flying up and away, the balloon behaves as if the string is being held by an invisible entity. Charlie watches from a distance.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (still not seeing him) Teddy?! Teddy?!

(The balloon leads Teddy down to the railroad tracks. Nearby, a family poses as the father takes their picture. Beyond them, the man sees Teddy near the tracks. The train whistle sounds.)

MAN: There's a kid on the track!

STEVE HOLVEY: (seeing him) Oh my God! Teddy! Teddy! Get away from there!

(Steve runs toward him, while Charlie stands impassively. Maggie hears Steve's shouts and runs toward Teddy as well. The balloon has led Teddy onto the tracks, where Teddy is now holding it by the string.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Teddy!

STEVE HOLVEY: Come here!

(The train rounds the curve and the engineer sees Teddy ahead. He tries to stop the train but it doesn't respond. He sounds his whistle repeatedly. Charlie continues to watch from a distance, showing no emotion.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Teddy!

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Teddy, get off of the tracks!

(As his parents run toward him, Teddy continues to hold the balloon, not hearing the warnings. Steve reaches the fence beside the tracks just as the train goes by.)

STEVE HOLVEY: No!!!

(The balloon drifts away. Maggie and Steve wait for the train to pass, then rush out onto the tracks.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Oh my God!!!

(They kneel, crying. Steve hugs Maggie.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Maggie ... Teddy ...

(Charlie has walked a ways toward the tracks but stands there, still showing no emotion. The balloon comes down just behind him.)

SCENE 2
DR. CHARLES BURKS' LAB,
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK

(Mulder has the photo taken by the man at the park projected on a screen and is pointing out details to Scully.)

MULDER: This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago. The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two. (he points out Teddy, who is at the gate in the fence next to the tracks) He was killed just seconds after this was taken.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: According to the police report, he wandered onto the tracks of the park's miniature train. The conductor was unable to stop due to a malfunction in the braking system. Teddy's father works for the State Department, so a coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the accident.

SCULLY: And did the inquest come up with anything unusual?

MULDER: No. No, but the County Medical Examiner called me afterwards. He was disturbed by this case and by this photograph, and I think with good reason. You see, this is a helium balloon here, and the one thing I did learn in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up, up and away, but you see this is moving away from him, horizontally.

SCULLY: Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?

MULDER: Well, I called the National Weather Service and they said on the day that Teddy died the wind was blowing north. But you see, the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.

SCULLY: Pulled? By whom?

MULDER: I don't know. That's why I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging. Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a simple photographic print.

(Dr. Chuck Burk is sitting in front of a large computer monitor. Mulder and Scully come around behind him. Chuck is a somewhat pompous fellow.)

DR. BURK: Not details - information. Watch the monitor. We have limitations on how much information the eye can perceive unaided, but with this special software - which I designed - we can, uh, depict hidden information. (he displays the image on the monitor and enhances the contrast) We can manipulate it. Enhance it. Now watch right here. There it is.

(After several passes, the image shows a light, human-like outline of a person holding the balloon string.)

DR. BURK: (pointing to the outline) There's clearly a concentration of electromagnetic energy.

SCULLY: So you're saying that, uh, a ghost killed Teddy Holvey. (Mulder nods and points to the screen as Burk smirks) Has anyone checked the camera that took this photo - the lens or the pressure plate?

MULDER: It all checked out, Scully. (hands her the camera) I think from the information here, this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.

SCULLY: Mulder, this information is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the, in the foliage of an elm tree. It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.

(Burk leans back in his chair, still smirking.)

MULDER: (reaching for an evidence bag) In order to get on those tracks, Teddy Holvey had to escape this child-proof halter that his mother had tied to a bathroom sink.

SCULLY: I've seen some pretty slippery two-year-olds.

MULDER: So the C.M.E. took it home and put it on his own two-year-old and found it was physically impossible for the kid to reach around and free himself, so unless Teddy Holvey was the reincarnation of Houdini - and that would be an X-file in itself ...

(Burk arches his eyebrows at Scully.)



SCENE 3
HOLVEY RESIDENCE, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

(It is night, and Mulder and Scully pull up in front of the house. As they approach the door, an old woman in a black shawl watches them warily from an upstairs window. The window has a small stained glass hanging in front of it, with a reverse swastika.)

(Mulder and Scully are with Maggie and Steve in their living room. There is a fire in the fireplace.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: I don't understand. There's already been a formal inquest.

MULDER: We're here apart from that investigation. We have reason to believe something may have been overlooked.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Like what?

MULDER: The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Oh my God.

STEVE HOLVEY: There were over a hundred witnesses. We saw Teddy ourselves. (the fire in the fireplace suddenly flares up) He was chasing a balloon. There was no one else around ...

(Mulder and Scully notice Charlie standing in the doorway.)

STEVE HOLVEY: ... It was an awful accident. But that's all it was - an accident.

(Charlie looks up and to his left, then runs away as if called by someone. Scully wanders over to the door.)

MULDER: Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: He was just a baby. Why would anybody want to hurt him?

STEVE HOLVEY: Look, I don't know what you're getting at. We loved Teddy. If you're suggesting that this is anything like that woman who drowned her kids in the lake, you're way out of line.

(Scully sees that Charlie has gone to the old woman, Golda, who is on a landing midway up the stairs. She is drawing a symbol on the back of Charlie's hand - a reverse swastika with four dots around it.)

MULDER: Mrs. Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: I already told the inquest. I heard nothing.

(Scully has returned to the others.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey, at the time of the accident, did you have any hired help?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: No. My mother came to live with us once Teddy was born.

MULDER: Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening around the house, uh, things moved, odd objects appearing, anything like that?

(A loud, shrill alarm sounds.)

STEVE HOLVEY: It's that damn smoke detector. I'll be right back.

(He walks out. As he exits, the lights go out.)

MULDER: Ah ... does this happen often?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: It's an old house. We have a problem with the wiring.

(The lights come back on and Golda is standing in the doorway with Charlie.)

GOLDA: Diavol lol ... diavol lol ... nu ieste el cauza.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mother!

GOLDA: Diavol lol.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mother, it was just a false alarm.

GOLDA: No. Asea este problema ta baiatul este blestemat. [We must perform the ritual or the killings will continue.]

(Mulder notices the reverse swastika on the back of Charlie's hand and a red string tied around his wrist.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mother.

GOLDA: (shouting) Ye dracul!

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (also shouting) Stop it!

SCULLY: What is she saying?

STEVE HOLVEY: (returning) Maggie!

GOLDA: You marry a devil. You have devil child!

(Golda leaves, pushing Charlie in front of her.)

STEVE HOLVEY: I'm sorry.

(The next morning, Mulder studies a reverse swastika in a book as Scully enters with a file.)

MULDER: You recognize this?

SCULLY: Sure, it's a swastika.

MULDER: It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot. It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck. It's been used by various cultures since the middle ages. The Holvey's child had one on the back of his hand last night. My guess it was drawn there by the old lady, to protect the boy.

SCULLY: You're right. I saw her drawing it.

MULDER: And you didn't think that was strange?

SCULLY: Well, I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get - but just not from ghosties or beasties. Take a look at this. (hands him a folder) Have you ever heard of Munchausen by Proxy?

MULDER: Yeah, my grandfather used to take that for his stomach.

SCULLY: It's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status. If you take a look at Teddy Holvey's medical history, you'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years that he was alive. That's once every three months.

MULDER: (reading the file) Projectile vomiting at three months. Diarrhea at four months. Vomiting ... diarrhea ... diarrhea.

SCULLY: Each time they were unable to determine the cause of the illness.

MULDER: And no one questioned this?

SCULLY: Well, the family moved around a lot because of Steve's job, and records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital. But this kind of abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.

(She hands him a second folder.)

MULDER: Charlie had medical problems, too?

SCULLY: Since his brother was born, which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in. Often the perpetrator of Munchausen by Proxy will view the child as evil. The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.

MULDER: Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully? (she nods)



SCENE 4
STATE DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and Scully are in Steve Holvey's office.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Things have been strained since Golda - my mother-in-law - moved in with us. I met Maggie in Romania in 1984. Golda forbade our marriage - said I was the devil. After I transferred back to the U.S., things got somewhat better, until Teddy was born and she came to live with us. That's when the strangeness really started.

MULDER: What kind of strangeness?

STEVE HOLVEY: Superstitions rule Golda's life. She'll spit when anyone compliments the kids. Once she moved in with us, she started pouring hot water over the threshold to ward off demons, tying red strings around the kids' wrists. One day I caught her throwing chicken guts on the roof. Then Teddy and Charlie started getting sick - a lot.

SCULLY: And you suspect Golda?

STEVE HOLVEY: She'll call Charlie evil right to his face. But at the same time, she dotes on him like she's afraid of him.

MULDER: Afraid of him or for him?

STEVE HOLVEY: I just don't know.

SCULLY: Are you familiar with Munchausen by Proxy?

STEVE HOLVEY: Are you accusing us of child abuse?

SCULLY: Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.

STEVE HOLVEY: I can never say this to Maggie, but I've wondered if it wasn't Golda who snuck in and let Teddy out of the bathroom that day.

SCULLY: I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr. Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.

(She hands him a card on which is printed "Karen F. Kosseff, L.C.S.W., Psychiatric Social Worker, FBI ...")

STEVE HOLVEY: Oh boy. This is gonna be hard.

(At the Holvey house, Maggie and Steve are arguing in the next room, while Mulder and Scully are with Charlie, who sits at the kitchen table. Golda is at the kitchen stove, cooking something in a pot.)

STEVE HOLVEY: Maggie!

MAGGIE HOLVEY: What do they want? To take Charlie away from here?

STEVE HOLVEY: They just want him to talk to the social worker. She's expecting him.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Social worker? You know them. They'll put lies into Charlie's head.

STEVE HOLVEY: You're being unreasonable.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: You want to take him away from me. You blame me for Teddy, and now you want to take him away from me.

STEVE HOLVEY: I'm not gonna listen to this. This is ridiculous. If you want to come, you can, but I'm taking Charlie now.

(Golda discreetly sprinkles a powder into the pot, taken from a yellow envelope that she took from her apron pocket. Scully sees her.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: No, Steven. He's my son, too.

(As Golda brings the pot to serve Charlie, Scully steps forward.)

SCULLY: What was that?

STEVE HOLVEY: There's nothing more to say.

GOLDA: (to Scully) (Rumanian)

STEVE HOLVEY: (entering the kitchen with Maggie) Come on, Charlie. Let's get your coat.

GOLDA: (under her breath) (Rumanian)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: You have no right to do this!

STEVE HOLVEY: Maggie. (to Charlie) Come on. (to Mulder and Scully) We'll meet you out front.

(Maggie walks out. Scully eyes Golda suspiciously, then leaves.)

(Steve and Charlie enter the garage and get into the car.)

STEVE HOLVEY: OK. You buckled in there?

CHARLIE: Yeah.

STEVE HOLVEY: Good. (he tries the automatic garage door button mounted on the visor, but the garage door doesn't open) Damn it.

(He gets out of the car.)

(Mulder and Scully bring their car to the front of the house.)

(Steve gets a stepladder and climbs up to the garage door opener, throwing his tie over his shoulder. He tries the manual button on the opener a couple of times, but nothing happens. Below, the car doors lock shut mysteriously. The chain on the garage door opener suddenly starts, catching Steve's tie. It pulls him into it, and the ladder falls out from under him as Charlie screams.)

CHARLIE: No! No! Daddy! No! No!

(As Steve chokes and struggles, he kicks in the rear windshield of the car.)

CHARLIE: Daddy! No! Daddy! No!

(The garage door opens, and from out front Scully sees Steve hanging from the garage ceiling.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(They get out of the car and run to the garage. Mulder grabs Steve's legs but it's too late.)

CHARLIE: Daddy! No! Daddy! No! Daddy! Daddy!



SCENE 5

(That night, still at the Holvey house, Scully closes the door to Maggie's bedroom as she sleeps on the bed with a doctor nearby. She approaches two policemen standing down the hall.)

POLICEMAN: See this?

(He opens the door to a room and Scully enters. There are many candles in the room. A table in the center of the room has two dead roosters on it as well as candles and other trinkets. She also sees the small stained glass with the reverse swastika. Through the window, Scully sees Golda standing next to a car as three men emerge, all dressed in black coats and wearing black hats. They converse briefly in Rumanian and Golda points toward the garage.)

(Scully enters the garage, where Mulder is on the stepladder collecting evidence from the garage door mechanism.)

SCULLY: Find anything?

MULDER: Yeah, maybe.

(He climbs down and hands her a plastic packet containing a black powder.)

SCULLY: Looks like ash.

MULDER: Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this.

(He scrapes some from the top of the car.)

SCULLY: The Holveys said earlier that they had some problems with the wiring of the house. It could be from the motor shorted out ...

MULDER: No, I checked the motor. It's working fine.

SCULLY: Well, what do you think it is?

MULDER: I don't know, but I'm gonna have this analyzed.

SCULLY: Well, before we do anything, I think we should get Charlie out of this house. I just put a call into a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.

MULDER: Uh, the courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters.

SCULLY: Not when a child is in danger ... and not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.

MULDER: Really? You still think this is Munchausen by Proxy, Scully?

SCULLY: Without a doubt. (the garage door starts to open) What did you do?

MULDER: I didn't do anything.

(As the door rises, on the other side they see Charlie, with Golda behind him and the three men next to her.)

GOLDA: Stay away from our house!

(She takes Charlie into the house.)

(Scully is in the office as Mulder enters with a piece of paper.)

MULDER: Hey. You want to see something weird?

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Chem-lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey's house. (he hands her a graph with a flat horizontal line) No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: It contains nothing organic or inorganic. In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist. (grabs his coat) Come on.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

MULDER: To get a second opinion.



SCENE 6
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK

(Back in Burk's office, he examines the powder.)

DR. BURK: Oh, wow. Haven't seen this for a while. Not since India, 1979.

SCULLY: India?

MULDER: Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia, he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.

DR. BURK: It's called vibuti - holy ash. Technically, it's known as an apport - something that materializes out of thin air.

SCULLY: Wait a second. Nothing just materializes out of thin air.

DR. BURK: You've read the Bible? You remember the story about Jesus creating the loaves and the fishes?

SCULLY: Yeah, but that was a parable.

DR. BURK: In 1979, I witnessed a guru named Sai Baba create an entire feast out of thin air.

SCULLY: Too bad you didn't take a picture. You could have run it through your computer and seen the entire Last Supper.

(Mulder smiles broadly in reaction to Scully's joke.)

DR. BURK: Vibuti is, uh, created during the presence of spirit beings, or during bilocation, which is, uh, a phenomenon where a person's energy is transported to a different location.

MULDER: That energy could have been what set off the garage door opener.

DR. BURK: Yeah.

SCULLY: Yeah, that or somebody activated the remote control.

MULDER: Well, who are you suggesting did that?

SCULLY: Well, who was standing outside when the garage door opened unexpectedly on us yesterday?

MULDER: The old lady ... and Charlie.

(At the Holvey house, Charlie eavesdrops against the door to Golda's room. Inside, Golda and the three men chant in Rumanian. They stand around the table with the dead roosters and light matches, tossing them into a pot of reddish liquid in the center of the table. Golda pours a liquid into the pot, and smoke rises from it. In the smoke appears an image of Charlie, which yells in Rumanian at Golda and the men.)

(Maggie answers the front door to find Karen Kosseff.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Mrs. Holvey? My name is Karen Kosseff. I'm a social worker with the FBI. I've been instructed to file a report for the court. May I come in?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (shaking her head) No. Please, I've already had enough trouble.

KAREN KOSSEFF: I understand, Mrs. Holvey, but if you won't talk to me, I'm going to have to put that in the report and it could very well complicate your situation.

(Maggie reluctantly lets Kosseff in.)

CHARLIE: (from upstairs, sounding frightened) Mommy!

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Charlie?

(They run upstairs, finding Charlie on the floor in front of Golda's door.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Oh my God! Charlie? It's OK, Charlie. (she takes him in her arms) It's OK. It's OK, Charlie. It's OK. (Kosseff catches up) He's been sick. My mother was supposed to be looking after him.

(They hear the chanting from Golda's room and see lights and smoke coming from underneath the door.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mother! Mother!

(She throws open the door and sees Golda and the men, still performing their ritual.)

GOLDA: (to Maggie) (Rumanian)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Get out of my house.

GOLDA: (to Maggie) (Rumanian)

FIRST MAN: (also to Maggie) (Rumanian)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (hugging Charlie protectively) Get out!

(The men look at each other and at Golda. Golda nods and they leave.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (to Golda, still in the room) I have had enough, Mother. I want you out of my house.

GOLDA: [The boy's blood must be cleansed. It is the only way.]

(She grabs Charlie and pulls him into the room, closing and locking the door. Maggie pounds on the door.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (yelling) No! Mother! Mother!

(Inside, Golda picks up a large knife and pulls Charlie's hand to her. Charlie looks frightened.)

GOLDA: [We must finish this.]

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mother!

(Kosseff has run outside as Mulder and Scully pull up in their car.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Agent Scully. The grandmother's taken the child. She's locked him in the room with her. She may have a knife. I've called 9-1-1.

(They all run toward the house.)

MULDER: What happened?

KAREN KOSSEFF: There were three strange men. They were performing some kind of ritual.

(They hear Charlie yelling from upstairs.)

CHARLIE: No! No, Nana!

(Inside, Golda moves the knife toward Charlie's palm. Suddenly the candles all go out. Golda clutches Charlie to her and waves the knife at an unseen enemy and screams. She stops and hugs the boy.)

GOLDA: Mihai! Mihai! Mihai! It is the only way.

(She puts the knife to Charlie's palm again, but he screams and runs to the corner of the room and cowers. A table suddenly flies across the room, striking Golda. She falls.)

(Outside, Mulder and Scully reach Maggie, who is still pounding on the door. Mulder draws his gun.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Mama!

(Inside, Golda regains her senses to see Charlie standing over her, holding the two dead roosters.)

CHARLIE: Esiti din mina trup periti.

(He drops the roosters onto her and they suddenly become alive, squawking and pecking at her. Golda screams as she bleeds from the roosters' attack.)

(Mulder breaks in the door to find the room quiet and Charlie standing calmly next to the table. Maggie and Scully run to Golda, who lies dead on the floor. Two dead roosters are next to her.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (crying) Oh my God! Mama! Mama!

(Mulder stares at Charlie, who looks back at him impassively.)



SCENE 7

(Mulder and several policemen are collecting evidence in Golda's room. Mulder sniffs the contents of a glass container on the table. Scully enters.)

MULDER: Did you talk to Charlie?

SCULLY: He says he doesn't remember anything. Now, the coroner's preliminary report states that she died of a heart attack ... but those wounds, Mulder, I'd swear it looked like her eyes were pecked out.

MULDER: Well, there was more ash on the floor under the old woman's body, and look at this. (hands her the glass container)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: It's mugwort. I think it's a ceremonial herb.

SCULLY: You think this was a ritual killing?

MULDER: No. The reverse swastika on the window and the red string around Charlie's wrist - those are protective devices.

SCULLY: Protection against what?

MULDER: I don't know, but I think the old woman knew the family was in trouble, and those men were here doing a ritual to help her.

(They hear Maggie yelling and head out to see what's going on.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: I told you before. Get out of my house!

(Maggie is downstairs with the men.)

FIRST MAN: (Rumanian)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: I am not interested in your superstition. Now get out. Now!!!

(The men go out the front door as Mulder and Scully come down the stairs.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: It's all right.

MULDER: Who are they?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: They are the Calusari. In Romania, they are responsible for the correct observance of sacred rites.

SCULLY: What did he say?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: He said it's not over. The evil is still here.

MULDER: Excuse me.

(Mulder goes out the front door and runs to catch up with the Calusari. He speaks to the first man, who is the head Calusari.)

MULDER: Sir? Can I have a word with you? Sir, I'm with the FBI. I'd like to ask you some questions.

(He flashes his badge but the Calusari continue to walk toward their car.)

MULDER: You were trying to protect the family, weren't you? You said there was still evil here. Sir? (grabs the head Calusari by the arm as he reaches the car) I can arrest you if I have to.

HEAD CALUSARI: The evil that is here has always been. It has gone by different names through history - Cain, Lucifer, Hitler. It does not care if it kills one boy or a million men. If you try to stop us, the blood will be on your hands.

(He gets in the car along with the other men and they pull off.)

(Later, Maggie Holvey stands at the mantlepiece, looking sadly at pictures of her family. Mulder and Scully enter.)

MULDER: Mrs. Holvey? I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: My mother used to say that evil follows evil. Once someone suffers a misfortune, they'll always have bad luck. I used to think that was just a superstition. Now I don't know what to believe. I blamed her, you know. for all that's happened. I thought maybe she was putting a curse on us to punish me.

SCULLY: Punish you for what?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: For abandoning the old ways. I was raised to believe as she did, in spirits, the unseen world. When I married Steve and came to this country, I left all that behind.

MULDER: Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (nods) She was trying to cleanse the house of evil. She thought Charlie was responsible somehow. (near tears) How could he be responsible for all this horror? He's just a little boy.

SCULLY: I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.

(Maggie nods.)



SCENE 8
ST. MATTHEW'S MEDICAL CENTER, ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

(Karen Kosseff is talking to Charlie in a playroom in the center. Charlie sits quietly, playing with an Etch-a-Sketch. Mulder, Scully and Maggie are in an adjoining room, watching and listening.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Charlie? I was told they found you in your grandmother's room yesterday. Can you tell me about it? (he shakes his head) Do you remember how you got there?

CHARLIE: No.

KAREN KOSSEFF: Your mother said you were there. Don't you remember?

CHARLIE: (sharply) I wasn't there.

(He gets up and walks away.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Many people saw you in the room.

CHARLIE: It wasn't me! I wasn't there! It wasn't me!

(He kicks some toys across the room.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Who was in the room?

CHARLIE: No!

KAREN KOSSEFF: Was there someone else in the room?

CHARLIE: No! I didn't hurt her!

KAREN KOSSEFF: Charlie? Charlie? Who hurt your grand ... Charlie?

CHARLIE: It was him!

KAREN KOSSEFF: Who? Charlie, who?

CHARLIE: It was Michael! Michael! Michael!

(Mrs. Holvey gasps and turns away from the window.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: We never told him. It was agreed upon. It was our secret.

MULDER: What secret, Mrs. Holvey? What are you talking about?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Michael. He was Charlie's twin. He was stillborn. Steven and I agreed never to tell Charlie about it. My mother, she wanted to perform a ritual of separation when she heard of Michael's death, to divide their souls. She said if we didn't, the world of the dead would follow Charlie. But it was just a superstition.

(Inside, Charlie is on the floor and Kosseff is trying to help him.)

KAREN KOSSEFF: Charlie? (to the others) Help! I need your help!

(They rush into the playroom.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Charlie?

KAREN KOSSEFF: He's having some kind of siezure.

SCULLY: Don't restrain him. Let's turn him on his side so he doesn't aspirate. Charlie, you're going to be OK.

(Later, Scully walks up stairs toward Mulder, who is standing on a landing beside a window. It is dark outside.)

MULDER: How's Charlie?

SCULLY: He's resting. How's Mrs. Holvey?

MULDER: I'm amazed she hasn't broken down completely. She's in the waiting room, trying to get some sleep.

SCULLY: The doctor said that Charlie had some kind of a siezure, but they've been unable to determine a cause.

(Charlie is lying in a hospital bed. A nurse pulls aside the dividing curtain, startling him.)

NURSE CASTOR: Oh, I'm sorry Charlie, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Nurse Castor. Now, I'm just gonna give you a little something to help you sleep.

CHARLIE: No, I don't want a shot.

(She rubs antiseptic on his arm for the shot. Charlie struggles against her.)

NURSE CASTOR: I know, but that's what happens when you spit out your medicine. We have to give it to you some other way.

CHARLIE: No!

NURSE CASTOR: Now, Charlie, I just want you to relax. It's not gonna hurt, and afterwards I'll give you a sucker.

CHARLIE: Leave me alone!

NURSE CASTOR: Charlie, it'll just be a little pinch. Now, I want you to relax.

CHARLIE: Stop it!

NURSE CASTOR: Charlie, now, I want you to behave.

CHARLIE: Leave me alone.

(Across the room, "Michael", Charlie's twin, appears behind the door. Charlie sees him, but the nurse's back is to the door.)

NURSE CASTOR: Charlie, I want you to behave. Just relax.

CHARLIE: No! Don't do it! Don't do it!

("Michael" is approaching the nurse, carrying a metal medical stand.)

NURSE CASTOR: Charlie ...

CHARLIE: No, Michael! Michael, don't!

(Nurse Castor looks over her shoulder just as "Michael" hits her with the stand.)



SCENE 9

(Still at the hospital, Maggie is sleeping on a sofa in the waiting room. She is awakened by Charlie.)

CHARLIE: Mommy? I want to go home now.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Charlie? What are you doing up? Why are you dressed?

CHARLIE: They said I could go home now.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Who said that?

CHARLIE: The doctors. They said I could leave.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: All right, then. Let's just get your coat and we'll talk to the doctors.

(She gets up.)

CHARLIE: No, Mommy. Let's just go home - (firmly) now.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: OK, Charlie. We'll go straight home.

(She takes his hand and they walk out of the waiting room.)

(Mulder walks up the stairs to Scully, who is on the same stairway landing as earlier. Something out the window catches her attention.)

MULDER: What are you looking at?

SCULLY: Is that Mrs. Holvey?

MULDER: Where?

SCULLY: There. I think she's got Charlie with her.

(Down below, Mrs. Holvey is getting into her car. Charlie is in the front seat as well.)

(Mulder and Scully pull the curtain in Charlie's room to see that Charlie is still in his bed. They hear Nurse Castor, who is lying on the floor in the corner of the room.)

NURSE CASTOR: Uhhh ...

(Scully steps out into the hall to summon help while Mulder helps her up.)

SCULLY: (calling down the hall) Nurse!

MULDER: Are you all right?

NURSE CASTOR: He hit me.

SCULLY: Who? Charlie?

NURSE CASTOR: No ... not him, the other one. There were two of them, two boys.

(Another nurse arrives to help Nurse Castor. Mulder and Scully walk out and down the hallway.)

MULDER: You gotta get to Mrs. Holvey's house.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: That boy you saw leaving with Mrs. Holvey - that wasn't Charlie.

SCULLY: You're saying Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost?

MULDER: A spirit, a ghost - I'm not sure but it's what we saw in the photograph. It's what the old woman was trying to protect the family from.

SCULLY: But, Mulder ...

MULDER: Whatever it is, it's killed three people, and you've got to get to Mrs. Holvey's before it happens again.

(Scully gets on the elevator.)

SCULLY: What are you gonna do?

MULDER: Get help.



SCENE 10

(Maggie is in her kitchen with who she thinks is Charlie, but is actually Michael. She puts some food in front of him.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: There you go, Charlie.

MICHAEL: Aren't you going to have some?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: No, dear. I'm not hungry.

MICHAEL: Tomorrow we can go to the park.

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Yes. Sure.

MICHAEL: Can I have a balloon?

(Maggie starts to look very uneasy.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Uh-huh.

MICHAEL: Can we ride the train, Mommy?

(Maggie looks very uneasy, as she has figured out something's wrong. She fumbles through a kitchen drawer to find some matches.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Now you finish up and mommy will be right back, OK?



SCENE 11

(Maggie is now in Golda's room. It is dark, and she lights a number of candles.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (chant in Rumanian)

(She now lights three matches and drops them into a bowl of liquid. They extinguish as they hit the liquid and float on the surface.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Please, God. Don't let it be true.

(One by one, the matches sink. She gasps when the last one sinks.)

MICHAEL: What are you doing, Mommy?

(She turns to see Michael standing in the doorway. There is a wind blowing in his hair.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (chants in Rumanian)

(She picks up a knife and holds it over her head, approaching Michael. The wind continues.)

MICHAEL: Mommy?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (continues to chant in Rumanian)

(Mulder waits in the hallway outside Charlie's room. Four Calusari enter the hall and walk toward him. He motions toward Charlie's room and they enter the room. Mulder follows.)



SCENE 12

HEAD CALUSARI: (to Mulder) Guard the door.

(Mulder closes the door.)

(Scully enters the Holvey's house. It is dark.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?

(She steps in, turning on a flashlight. She tries the light switch but the lights don't come on. She walks into the foyer and hears a noise from upstairs.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(Back at the hospital, the Calusari surround Charlie's bed and chant in Rumanian and pray. The head Calusari tears open Charlie's pajama shirt. Charlie seems to be asleep. As they continue to chant, one of the Calusari sprinkles a powder on Charlie's chest, and he awakens suddenly and hisses at them. The Calusari restrain him, two holding his arms while a third holds his head. The fourth, the head Calusari, sprinkles a herb into a bowl of liquid and it bubbles. Charlie continues to hiss and starts to thrash on the bed.)

CHARLIE: (loudly) Fie newt, avet a plaratariat. New potex ... new potex ... new potex. Suffragettes agitaball. Pulley tot allso puritay from freeditay. Suffragette a agitaball. Ohh saaa ... pu chette ... agitaball ... boy gotz.

(The head Calusari adds a red powder to the bowl of liquid. The liquid turns red and bubbles more violently, emitting smoke. Charlie continues to thrash about, while the other Calusari continue to chant.)

HEAD CALUSARI: (turning and gesturing to Mulder) Come. Hold him down.

(Mulder comes to the foot of the bed and holds Charlie's feet. Charlie continues to struggle, growls and gives Mulder an evil stare.)

HEAD CALUSARI: (to Mulder) Don't look at him. Look away, or it will recognize you.

(Mulder turns his head, seeing an orange liquid now covering the walls.)

(Back at the Holvey's, Scully opens the door to Golda's bedroom. The stained glass with the reverse swastika shakes, and both windows then blow in. Scully steps back and shields her eyes, then enters. A strong wind howls through the windows. She enters and pans the room with her flashlight. A glass object breaks at her feet. She hears faint chanting in Rumanian, and as she walks along the wall, her head is suddenly touched by a pair of feet. Startled, she spins away and looks up, seeing Maggie pinned against the ceiling by an unseen force. Maggie is chanting. Scully sees a shadow move across the wall and turns quickly back toward the window, but she sees no one. The door to the room suddenly slams shut. She gasps and turns toward the door.)

SCULLY: Charlie?

CHARLIE'S VOICE COMING FROM MAGGIE: Mommy?

(Scully shines her flashlight up at Maggie, who resumes chanting in Rumanian. Scully is picked up by an unseen force and slammed into the corner of the room, next to the window. She falls to the floor, and is then slid, along with some furniture, into the other corner.)

(Back at the hospital, the head Calusari unsheathes a large knife over the bowl of bubbling red liquid. Charlie now screams at them in Rumanian. Mulder continues to hold his feet. The bed starts to shake and rises several feet off the floor.)

CHARLIE: (screaming) It hurts!

(Mulder, responding to Charlie's cry, lets go of his feet.)

HEAD CALUSARI: (to Mulder) Do not let go. He tricks you.

(Mulder grabs Charlie's feet again. One of the Calusari squeezes a liquid into a small cup and hands it to the head Calusari. He adds the contents to the other bowl of liquid and picks up a white feather. As Charlie continues to scream, the head Calusari dips the feather into the red liquid and starts to paint a reverse swastika on Charlie's chest. He continues to scream, as the Calusari continue to chant.)

(At the Holvey's, Michael also screams and picks up the large knife from the floor. He advances toward Scully, the knife held high over his head. Scully shields her head with her arm and tries to twist away.)

(At the hospital, the head Calusari completes the reverse swastika on Charlie's chest. Charlie's body relaxes and the bed falls back to the floor.)

(At the Holvey's, the knife falls harmlessly to the floor next to Scully. The wind stops. Maggie falls to the floor as well. Scully goes to Maggie's aid.)

SCULLY: Are you all right?

MAGGIE HOLVEY: Charlie?

(They look across the room but no one else is there. There is gray ash on the floor and a small wisp of smoke drifting across the floor.)

(At the hospital, Charlie lies quietly on the bed with his eyes closed. He is covered with perspiration, as well as the reverse swastika painted on his chest in red.)

HEAD CALUSARI: Let the boy rest. We must find the mother. The boy needs her.

(The Calusari step away from the bed, leaving Mulder staring at Charlie.)

(Later, Mulder stands in the hallway outside Charlie's room. Scully and Maggie come off the elevator and run toward him.)

MULDER: Scully, you all right?

SCULLY: We're OK. How's Charlie?

(Maggie runs past him and enters Charlie's room, brushing past the head Calusari. It is now daylight outside.)

MAGGIE HOLVEY: (Romanian) Charlie! It's OK! Charlie!

(She runs to his bedside. Charlie is still sleeping but seems OK.)

HEAD CALUSARI: (to Mulder) It is over, for now. But you must be careful. It knows you.

(The head Calusari closes the door. Mulder and Scully stare at each other for a moment, then walk slowly down the hallway.)

MULDER: (voiceover) The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved ...

(Maggie sits on the bed beside the sleeping Charlie as the Calusari stand around the bed and chant.)

MULDER: (voiceover) ... The boy, who will celebrate his tenth birthday next month, remains under the watchful care of his mother. And though I believe him innocent of the crimes, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
GUANACASTE RAIN FOREST; COSTA RICA

(A man lifts up the bark of a tree with a small stick and watches a bug crawl onto it. Hearing birds squawking, he looks up to see vultures hovering over another part of the woods close-by. He deposits the bug inside a glass casing alongside other live bugs, then closes the lid and locks the attache case that it is in. Picking up his backpack as well, he makes his way over to the site. Vultures peck at a dead warthog.)

ROBERT TORRENCE: Get away! Shoo! Get away, shoo!

(He waves the vultures off and kneels down next to the dead animal. Many small bugs of the same species crawl over the carcass and there are huge boils on the animal, signifying some sort of disease. He puts on his rubber gloves. The doctor squeezes at a huge, pulsating boil, which pops and sprays it's pus all over the doctor's face. The doctor gasps in shock, then spits some out of his mouth and wipes his face. Taking off his glasses, he opens his bag and collects a few of the bugs for analysis. Later, at nightfall, he uses his transmitter radio.)

R.B.P. field base, come in.

(Static. He presses down on the button again.)

Field base, come in, please.

(More static leaks through, so he tries again.)

This is Doctor Robert Torrence with the biodiversity project... requesting immediate evacuation from Sector Z-one-five. This is a medical emergency. Please respond.

(His face and neck is covered with the same boils as the warthog had been covered with in the spots that the pus hit him.)

I repeat... Doctor Robert Torrence... biodiversity project. Immediate evacuation from Sector Z-one-five.



SCENE 2
7 HOURS LATER

(Troops make their way through the thick jungle.)

MAN #1: Espera momento. (TRANSLATION: "Wait a minute.")

(They stop.)

Oyeron eso? (TRANSLATION: "Do you hear that?")

(They listen to the vultures squawking.)

Vamanos. Sigenme. (TRANSLATION: "Let's go. Follow me.")

(They run in the direction of the squawking and find vultures leaning over another body. They shoot in the air to scare them off. They look down at the carcass of Robert Torrence, whose face has been horrible ripped apart and has the same pulsating boils, covered with the same bugs.)

SCENE 3
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(A guard walks up the long, cold ramps into a dark hallway with many rooms. He stops at a door and opens up the latch.)

WINSTON: Hey, Bobby? You got some mail.

BOBBY TORRENCE: Don't waste my time, Winston, both of us know I ain't got nobody.

WINSTON: Could be those baptists from Annandale. I hear they been sending fruitcake.

(He slides the package through the hole and shuts the opening. Bobby reluctantly picks up the package, adressed to:

"NOT APPLICABLE NOT APPLICABLE
(804) 555-922
ROBERT TORRENCE
(crossed out section) Cumberland
Correctional Facility
Dinwiddie County
5300"

He opens it up and finds a bloodied newspaper. He unrolls it to find a dead warthog leg. He grunts, drops it and kicks it across the room, then starts yelling out through the hole.)

BOBBY TORRENCE: Hey, Winston! You think this is funny? What kind of crap you trying to pull here? Get this thing out of my crib! Winston! Winston! Winston!

(Nobody hears his screams. Time passes, and Bobby lays on his bed, unable to sleep. He hears a slurping noise and looks over at the warhog leg sitting in the brightened corner of the room. A boil pulsates, about to burst. Gasping in a sort of terror, he stares at it. Later, in the med lab, two doctors in containment suits look over Bobby, who has the same disease now.)

OSBOURNE: When was he exposed?

SIMON AUERBACH: Eighteen hours ago.

OSBOURNE: I've never heard of anything incubating so quickly.

BOBBY TORRENCE: Where's the prison doc? I want to see the prison doc...

SIMON AUERBACH: We're specialists, Mister Torrence.

BOBBY TORRENCE: What's wrong with me?

(Osbourne measures a pustule on Torrence's neck.)

OSBOURNE: Five centimeters. They appear fairly uniform.

SIMON AUERBACH: Basal temperature?

OSBOURNE: One-o-three point five. Oxygen saturation... eighty-one percent.

BOBBY TORRENCE: Sssss, what's wrong with me?

SIMON AUERBACH: Try and relax, Mister Torrence. We're here to help you.

(Winston opens up Bobby's cell and two men walk in, wheeling a laundry bin.)

WINSTON: Put the sheets in the cart. Make sure you get all them pillows too. I'll be back in five minutes.

(He walks out. One of the prisoners, Paul, looks out the doorway at him.)

PAUL: We'll be here.

(The door slams down the hallway.)

See that? He couldn't clear out of here fast enough.

STEVE: The whole cell block's empty.

PAUL: Yeah, McGuire says they're full up at the infirmary. Bringing in more beds.

STEVE: Yeah, well... there's probably something going around.

(He puts the sheets in the bin.)

PAUL: Maybe.

STEVE: Why? Do you know something?

PAUL: I know the sheets ain't going to the laundry. McGuire says they're going to some kind of incinerator.

STEVE: But the laundry pick-up's still happening?

(Paul nods. Steve smiles and laughs a little. More time passes, and an armed guard lead Mulder and Scully down a flight of stairs, followed by more men.)

SCULLY: According to my briefing, the prisoners escaped by hiding in a laundry cart.

MULDER: I don't think the guards are watching enough prison movies.

SCULLY: And they're both serving life terms. Murder convictions.

(The guard picks up the phone near the door and the end of the stairwell.)

GUARD: Everybody's here.

(The door buzzes and opens. They walk through and down the hall a little. Mulder looks through a door window at men in containment suits.)

MULDER: I thought this was about escaped prisoners.

SCULLY: It is.

MULDER: Then who are the men in the funny suits?

(Scully looks through as well.)

SCULLY: I don't know. Looks like some kind of de-con situation.

(The door in back of them swings open and more guards walk in, led by U.S. Marshal Tapia.)

TAPIA: F.B.I. run out of crooked politicians to sting?

MULDER: Excuse me?

(A guard hands Tapia a clipboard.)

TAPIA: Mulder and, uh, Scully?

SCULLY: That's right. We have orders to work with the federal marshals on this manhunt.

TAPIA: Either of you two ever run an escaped convict operation?

MULDER: No.

TAPIA: Well, then you'd be a real big help if you just try to stay out of the way.

(He turns to leave.)

MULDER: Oh, we'd be happy to as soon as we can talk to someone in charge.

(Tapia marches back up to them.)

TAPIA: I'm in charge here.

MULDER: Apparently not or you'd know why our involvement was requested.

SCULLY: We don't know why we've been sent here. Maybe if we talked to the warden or someone...

TAPIA: Well, no one's here. The prison's been taken over by the national guard. They closed off most of the facility.

SCULLY: Why?

TAPIA: I don't know why. The federal marshal's business isn't in here, it's out there, trying to catch those two convicts.

(Everyone walks out except for the two agents.)

MULDER: Where did this case originate, Scully?

SCULLY: It came out of Skinner's office.

MULDER: Did he say why he gave it to us?

SCULLY: No, why?

MULDER: Well, this isn't the type of thing the F.B.I. normally gets called in on. I got a feeling we're not being told the entire story here.

SCULLY: I've got the same feeling, Mulder.

(Mulder looks back at the room with the containment-suited doctors.

MULDER: Do you think you could get in there and find out what's going on?

SCULLY: I can try. Where are you going?

MULDER: To see if I can get in the way.

(He walks out past an armed guard.)



SCENE 4
REST STOP; VIRGINIA

(A camper pulls up and the typical American family unloads.)

MAN: Hey, you girls go with Mom. See you in a few minutes.

(While the two daughters run off with their mother to the bathroom, the father walks into the men's lavatory. As he walks in, Paul steps down from the toilet and opens up the stall. The women of the family run out of the bathroom to see their camper driving off.)

WOMAN: Robert? Robert? Robert!

(Steve, sitting in the passanger seat, hoots and hollers as they drive off, the mother chasing them.)

Robert! Robert, hey!



SCENE 5
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Scully talks through a glass pane to a doctor.)

OSBOURNE: I'm sorry, this is a restricted area.

SCULLY: Who are you?

OSBOURNE: Doctor Osbourne.

SCULLY: Are you the prison doctor?

OSBOURNE: No.

SCULLY: Who do you work for?

OSBOURNE: The C.D.C.

SCULLY: You work for the Centers for Disease Control? What are you doing here?

(Osbourne sighs and starts off. Scully bangs on the door.)

Sir! I'm a medical doctor. I want to know what's going on here.

(He turns back. She bangs on the door again.)

Sir, if you don't let me in, a lot of people in Washington are going to find out that you're conducting a secret quarantine in here.

(Osbourne unlocks the door, opens it slightly, and looks at her.)

OSBOURNE: I'm under strict orders.

SCULLY: So am I.

(She pushes past him, opening the door. She walks rapidly down the hall, him trying to keep up.)

OSBOURNE: All I can tell you is that there is a flu-like illness spreading among some of the prisoners.

SCULLY: How many people are infected?

OSBOURNE: Fourteen men so far.

SCULLY: Any deaths?

OSBOURNE: Ten of the fourteen.

(She stops and looks at him, amazed.)

SCULLY: What are the chances the men who escaped are infected?

(He looks at her, then starts down the hall. She gasps and follows.)



SCENE 6
REST STOP; VIRGINIA

(Mulder walks past many government officials from the federal marshal's office. The woman sobs in the background. Mulder's cellular phone rings and he answers it.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully, who is standing outside a room where doctors are tending to the patients.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I'm starting to get a picture of what's going on here.

(Cut to Mulder, who walks around towards the bathroom.)

MULDER: What did you find?

SCULLY: There seems to be some kind of...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...deadly contagion sweeping the lockdown population.

MULDER: Deadly? How deadly?

(Scully looks at an infected man inside a thick glass casing being wheeled in by another man in a containment suit.)

SCULLY: Well, from what I've seen so far, thirty-six hours after infection, deadly.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, is there a chance any of the escaped men were infected?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: The exact nature of this thing...

(Cut back to Mulder, who starts towards the bathroom again.)

...or how it is spread is unclear. So is their exposure to it and any danger they might pose.

MULDER: I'd say these guys are a danger in any event.

(He looks down at the body of the father, whose face is ripped open. A pool of blood rests under his head.)

Call me as soon as you know anything.

(He hangs up. Cut to Scully, who does the same. Auerbach walks up to her, followed by Osbourne.)

SIMON AUERBACH: I don't care who you are or what your business is, I want you out of here right now.

SCULLY: Not until I get some answers.

SIMON AUERBACH: You're in violation of federal statutes.

SCULLY: I'm a federal agent, sir.

SIMON AUERBACH: Who were you on the phone to?

SCULLY: To my partner, who needs to know if the men he's pursuing are infected.

SIMON AUERBACH: That information is unavailable.

SCULLY: Well, then I want to see charts and I want access to the infirmary.

SIMON AUERBACH: You see what I let you see.

(He storms off. Osbourne looks at her for a second, then follows his colleague. Scully looks over at a medical table and takes some rubber gloves and a doctor's mask.)



SCENE 7
GAS STATION; VIRGINIA

(The camper is being pumped full of gas. The cashier checks his watch and reads his magazine. Cut to the house of a woman named Elizabeth, who cradles her young son and picks up the phone as it rings.)

ELIZABETH: Hello?

(Cut to Paul, who stands at a payphone outside the gas station.)

PAUL: I'm free, baby.

(Cut to Elizabeth.)

ELIZABETH: Paul?

PAUL: Listen, I'm gonna...

ELIZABETH: Where are you?

(Cut to Paul.)

PAUL: I'm coming home.

(Cut back to Elizabeth.)

ELIZABETH: What are you talking about?

(Cut to Paul.)

PAUL: I'm coming to get you.

(Cut to Elizabeth, who smiles and nearly laughs.)

ELIZABETH: What? What?

(The cashier, Angelo Garza looks at the camper nervously and walks outside. He peeks into the driver's seat.)

ANGELO GARZA: Yo! Anybody in here?

(He walks around a little and looks in again. He goes over to the bathroom and knocks on the door.)

Hello?

(A man groans inside. The cashier walks in and sees Steve lying on the floor in pain, a giant pustule on his cheek.)

Hey, man... you okay?

(The cashier kneels down and looks at him.)

You look messed up!

(Steve walks up behind him quietly. He raises up a makeshift weapon and the cashier turns around, gasping.)



SCENE 8
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Scully peeks through the small window on the door to the incinerator room and then walks inside. Scully puts on her rubber gloves and walks slowly around to a pile of bodies in bags, putting on her protective doctor's garb. Inside a bag labeled "001 - Torrence" sits the dead body of Bobby Torrence. She opens up the bag with a knife. Suddenly, Osbourne grabs her arm and spins her around. She screams in fright.)

OSBOURNE: You can't be down here!

(He tries to close the bag.)

SCULLY: I need to know what these men are dying from. You said this was some kind of flu-like illness. What are these?

(She pulls off her mask.)

OSBOURNE: Please! Please! These bodies should not be exposed.

SCULLY: Do all of the victims have these boils?

(He pushes her away, but she walks right back up to him.)

You're burning the bodies, why?

(A boil explodes on Torrence's face, covering Osbourne with it's contents. He gasps in horror and runs out of the room and down the hall. Scully runs after him.)

Doctor Osbourne, wait!



SCENE 9
GAS STATION; VIRGINIA

(Morning. The birds chirp and all is relatively peaceful. The sign swings gently in the wind. The gas pump nozzle still sits in the camper. The silence is broken by three blue cars speeding into the area and screeching to a halt, surrounding the area. The marshals exit their cars, cocking their shotguns and slowly move in on the camper. Other officials surround the camper, aiming handguns. Mulder runs by. The main store is canvassed as well by the authority figures. The camper door swings open and a man runs in, pointing his gun.)

MAN: Freeze! Hands in the air! Freeze!

(Searching the camper, he finds it is empty. He swings open the bathroom door as other men make their way into the camper.)

Freeze! Clear.

(Mulder bursts the bathroom door open to see the attendant in pain on the ground, struggling to get up due to his head wound.)

MULDER: We've got a man down! He's alive.

(Tapia tries to work a soft drink machine as Mulder walks up to him.)

The attendant's name is Angelo Garza. He took a nice crack to the head but he's talking.

(They start walking, followed by other officials.)

TAPIA: Yeah, well, he's lucky they didn't kill him.

MULDER: Kid's got a lot of hair, probably absorbed the blow. He found one of the men in pain on the bathroom floor with a large boil on his face.

(They stop.)

There's a contagion at the prison, these men could be infected.

(Tapia looks at one of his deputies.)

TAPIA: Get on the horn, see what anybody knows about that.

(They walk up to two men standing by a map on the car hood.)

All right, they took the kid's keys, they got in the safe. They got money, the kid's car, possibly a firearm and they got a big head start.

MULDER: Any idea where they're headed?

TAPIA: There are twenty-three possible roads and thoroughfares.

(Mulder looks around.)

MULDER: Either of these guys got a girlfriend, you know?

TAPIA: I wish I could tell you but those records are locked up in the prison. Unless we can access them, this is Smokey and the Bandit.

MULDER: Well, if they had girlfriends, they'd probably try to call them. You think of that?

(Mulder walks up to the payphone and presses zero. It rings.)

OPERATOR: Bell Atlantic Operator, how may I help you?

MULDER: I'm a federal agent assisting in a manhunt for two escaped prisoners. My badge number is J-T-T-o-four-seven-one-o-one-one-one-one. I need to know the last call made from this booth.

OPERATOR: All right, sir...

(Her voice is overpowered by the helicopter landing on the field next to the payphone.)

MULDER: Can you repeat that, please?

(The operator says it again as Tapia and other officials start towards the copter.)

All right, thank you.

(He hangs up and looks at four containment-suited men running towards Garza with a thick glass casing. They burst into the bathroom and put the man into the casing. Tapia runs to them, screaming over the helicopter blades.)

TAPIA: What's going on here? Hey, what are you guys doing here? What the hell is going on here?

(The men ignore him and start back to the helicopter as Garza bangs on the sides frantically, screaming.)

Who authorized this? Hey!

(Mulder runs up to a clean-suited man, who pushes him away.)

MULDER: What's going on here, what's going on?

ANGELO GARZA: Where are they taking me? Help!

MULDER: Who are you?

(The last man closes the door to the helicopter and they fly off.)

TAPIA: Hey! Did you order this?

MULDER: No!

TAPIA: Then who the hell did?

MULDER: I don't know, but there was a call made from that phone booth about two hours bago. I got an address and phone number from Dinwittie County.

(He hands Tapia a notepad, which reads:

"925
August St.
555-6936")



SCENE 10
925 AUGUST ST.

(Paul and Steve drive up, honking their horn. Elizabeth runs out the door excitedly and puts her son down.)

ELIZABETH: Wait here, sweetie. Be right back.

(She looks at Paul as he gets out of the car.)

I thought you were B.S.ing me!

PAUL: I'm gone, sweet thing!

(She gasps as he runs up to her and hugs her tightly.)

They ain't never taking me back.

ELIZABETH: I ain't going to let them.

(They kiss.)

BOY: Mommy! Mommy!

ELIZABETH: I'm coming, sweetie! Daddy's home. Come on.

(She tries to pull him into the house but he leads her back to the car.)

PAUL: I got somebody with me.

ELIZABETH: What?

(He opens the door as Steve groans, boils over a good portion of his face. Elizabeth looks at him in disgust.)

What's wrong with him?

PAUL: I don't know. He's out of it.

(She puts her hand on his forehead.)

ELIZABETH: Oh, hell, he's burning up.

PAUL: We got to get him in the house.



SCENE 11
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Scully is on the cellular phone in the incinerator room, carrying the package and pacing. Bobby's head is still exposed.)

SCULLY: Yes, I'm trying to trace the origin of a package that was sent to Robert Torrence at the Cumberland State Correctional Facilit in Virginia. Y, yeah. The packaging number is D-D-P-one-one-two-one-four-eight. Sure, I'll hold.

(She waits.)

Yeah.

(A man talks on the other end.)

The package was sent from Wichita, Kansas? Did you record the name of the sender?

(He tells her something.)

Could you check that again, please?

(More talking.)

Thank you.

(She hangs up and dials another number. Cut to Mulder, who is sitting in the passanger seat of a car. His phone rings and he takes it out.)

MULDER: Yeah.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What do you know about Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Uh, it's one of, if not the biggest manufacturer of drugs in America. Why?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: They sent a package to a prisoner here who may have been the first victim of the contagion.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Any idea what was in the package?

SCULLY: No, it's empty.

(He leans back and thinks.)

MULDER: Scully, from the description we got, one of the prisoners had a large, purple-ish inflammation on his face.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: That sounds like what I'm finding on all the victims in here. Do you know what that means, Mulder?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, it could spread. I, I, I need to know more about it.

(Cut back to Scully.)

How it's transmitted.

SCULLY: I'm on it.

(She hangs up and looks at the body. She notices something inside the popped boil and pulls out her tweezers. After pulling down her mask, she reaches into the boil and pulls out one of the bugs that had been transmitting the disease before.)



SCENE 12
925 AUGUST ST.

(Steve lays on a bed, his boils incredibly large now.)

STEVE: Got to go. Got to keep moving.

(Elizabeth pats his head down with a cold compress.)

ELIZABETH: Paul... Paul, he's awake. Paul, come here.

(He grabs her wrist and pulls her close. His boil starts to throb.)

STEVE: You got to help me. I, I'm, I'm burning up here. Please, I'm...

(The boil pops, spraying it's diseased pus all over her face. She tries to wipe it off and runs into the bathroom, her son watching her.)

ELIZABETH: Ahh! Paul! Ahh! Oh!

(She desperately tries to wash off the spray on her face, rubbing water all over her face rapidly then drying quickly. She runs into the main room.)

Paul! Paul! Paul!

(The door is kicked open by marshals. She screams as they surround her, all screaming at once. She gets down on the ground at their orders, which are illegible, mingled in with so many others. They cuff her as her son cries. Mulder walks out of the bedroom over to Tapia, who has his gun trained on Elizabeth like the rest of them.)

MULDER: We've got one dead prisoner in the bedroom. The other one's gone.

(She looks up at her crying son.)



SCENE 13
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Scully watches through the window of the door to the medical room as Garza is brought over, lying in his glass casing. Osbourne walks up to her and puts his hand on her shoulder.)

OSBOURNE: Come with me.

SCULLY: Why? What's going on?

OSBOURNE: Just come with me.

(They walk off to a separate medical lab. He closes the door.)

SCULLY: What the hell is going on?

(Osbourne pulls down the right part of his shirt slightly to reveal a huge boil gestating underneath.)

OSBOURNE: I've been infected and they're not letting me out. The entire prison's been quarantined.

SCULLY: By who, the C.D.C.?

OSBOURNE: The C.D.C. has nothing to do with this.

(He walks away a little, Scully watching him intently.)

It's the company. They're behind everything.

SCULLY: Pinck Pharmaceuticals. You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals?

(He nods.)

How did this happen?

OSBOURNE: We finance exploration of new species from the rain forest with potential drug applications. Three months ago, a field entomologist disappeared in Costa Rica.

SCULLY: Disappeared how?

OSBOURNE: We're not sure. He just sent us some samples of an insect.

SCULLY: Like this?

(She pulls out a capsule with the bug inside.)

I found this buried in one of the dead prisoners.

(He takes it.)

OSBOURNE: Faciphaga Emasculata. We were interested in it because of the dilating enzyme it secretes.

(She holds it up.)

SCULLY: Is this what caused the outbreak?

OSBOURNE: No, no, not precisely.

(He sits down in front of a microscope.)

The F. Emasculata is a parasitoid, a bug that carries a parasite. In this case, a deadly parasite that attacks the immune system. The pustules are part of the natural reproductive cycle. They're full of the larvae that you see there in the scope.

(She looks through and sees tiny larvae crawling around.)

SCULLY: So the contagion only spreads when the pustules erupt and the larvae that are expelled burrow into the new host.

(She looks at him.)

OSBOURNE: Agent Scully... you were there when the pustule erupted on me... which means you may also be infected.

(Her mind races.)



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder knocks on the door to Skinner's office. Skinner stands.)

SKINNER: Come in.

(Mulder walks in.)

MULDER: Thank you for seeing me at this late hour, sir.

SKINNER: What is it, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: This case we've been assigned, I believe we've been misled, possibly decieved.

SKINNER: Decieved? By whom?

MULDER: Whoever originated the case.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What is the accusation, Agent Mulder?

(Mulder looks over to a darkened part of the room where a lamp partly illuminates the shadowy figure of the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who sits at a chair. He lights a cigarette. Mulder's eyes widen in realization. He looks at Skinner briefly then walks over to the shadowy man.)

MULDER: That Agent Scully and I were sent on this manhunt without knowledge of the existence or nature of a contagion.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What is the exact nature of the contagion?

MULDER: It's deadly. It kills within thirty-six hours. One escaped convict was infected. He's dead now. The other man may be infected and he's on the loose.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Does anyone know how it's communicated, whether it's a virus or bacteria?

MULDER: No, we just know that over a dozen men have died from it and it appears to be highly contagious.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Then you don't know much, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Why weren't we told the truth?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: We didn't know the truth. What we knew would only have slowed you down.

MULDER: But innocent people could be infected! What you knew could have prevented that.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: How?

(Mulder tries to say something but the Cigarette-Smoking Man cuts him off.)

In 1988, there was an outbreak of hemmoragic fever in Sacramento, California. The truth would have caused panic. Panic would have cost lives. We controlled the disease by controlling the information.

MULDER: You can't protect the public by lying to them.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It's done every day.

MULDER: I won't be a party to it.

(Mulder starts out, looking at Skinner.)

How about you?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You're a party to it already.

(Mulder stops.)

How many people are being infected while you stand here, not doing your job?

(Mulder turns around.)

Ten? Twenty? What's the truth, Agent Mulder?

(Mulder glares at Skinner briefly and walks out, slamming the door. Mulder walks to his car but the seatbelt won't work. As much as he pulls, it won't move so he throws it back in anger. The phone rings and he picks it up.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully as Osbourne prepares some tests in the back.)

SCULLY: Mulder, they're enforcing a full quarantine.

(Cut to Mulder, who switches ears and speaks forcefully.)

MULDER: What?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: One of the epidimiologists who claimed to be with the C.D.C. told me that this was no accident.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Pinck Pharmaceuticals is here trying to clean it up quietly...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...and the government would have to know about it.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Do you have proof of that?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Why else would the national guard be here?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

They're protecting Pinck Pharmacuetical.

MULDER: Okay, listen, Scully. I need to know how this happened. I want you to start documenting everything you can get your hands on.

(Cut back to Scully.)

People have to know about the cover-up.

SCULLY: The public?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: It's a public health crisis.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, we can't leak this, not until we know more.

(Cut to Mulder.)

The fugitive that you're looking for...

(Cut back to Scully.)

He might not even be infected.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, but what if he is?

SCULLY: If this gets out...

(Cut to Scully.)

...prematurely, the panic is going to spread faster than the contagion. Mulder, we can't let this be known.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: What if someone dies because we witheld what we knew?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What if someone dies because we didn't?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

There'll be a time for the truth, Mulder, but this isn't it.

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: Are you okay in there, Scully?

(Cut to Scully, who tenses up.)

SCULLY: Yeah. I'm okay. All I want you to worry about is capturing that fugitive.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Take care of yourself, Mulder.

(They hang up. Cut to Scully, who turns around and watches Osbourne put the specimen of Faciphaga Emasculata into a small plastic casing. Taking off her coat, she sits down.)

OSBOURNE: If you're not infected, you should leave immediately.

SCULLY: And if I am?

(He looks at her for a second, then looks away.)

OSBOURNE: The parasite is undetectable in the bloodstream. This is the only way to test whether or not you've been infected.

(He puts a small casing onto her arm and puts the the bug inside, the bottom open so the bug may crawl around on her skin.)

These uninfected insects act as incubators.

(He tapes it down.)

Now, the insect's bite won't infect you. The contagion can only be contracted through exposure to the larvae.

SCULLY: How long will this take?

OSBOURNE: Thirty minutes... and another two hours before the parasite reproduces enough for us to see it.

(She breathes heavily, looking down at the insect as it begins to lay it's eggs.)



SCENE 15
DINWIDDIE COUNTY HOSPITAL

(Elizabeth sits in a confined chamber. On all sides of the chamber are windows. Mulder stands on one side.)

MULDER: Elizabeth? My name is Fox Mulder, I'm with the F.B.I. Where did Paul go, Elizabeth?

ELIZABETH: I don't know.

MULDER: I think you do know.

(He sits down across from her.)

And I think you know why you're in here. How are you feeling?

ELIZABETH: I'm fine.

(Mulder nods.)

MULDER: Steve felt fine too. Didn't take long for that to change.

ELIZABETH: You're just trying to scare me.

MULDER: You should be scared. If I were you, I'd be scared.

ELIZABETH: You're lying!

MULDER: No, Paul is the one who is lying and if he's infected, a lot of people are going to die.

ELIZABETH: If that's true, how come it's not on TV? How come they're not telling everybody?

MULDER: That's not my decision.

ELIZABETH: Well, whose decision is it? You knew about it and you didn't say anything! Why should I tell the truth if you won't?

MULDER: Elizabeth, Paul is out there somewhere. I have to find him. Now, you can help me... or not.

(She looks at him, smirking. A few minutes later, Mulder rushes out of the room past Tapia, who walks with him.)

He's on a ten o'clock bus to Toronto, she was supposed to be with him.

TAPIA: That bus depot's over a half-hour from here, even doing ninety.

(He turns to one of his officers.)

Get on that phone with the local P.D., I want every man they've got!

(Mulder stops him.)

MULDER: No! No, they don't know what they're dealing with. If he's infected, he could spread it. What we need know is control.

(Mulder and Tapia start off.)



SCENE 16
BUS DEPOT

(The woman at the ticket desk is rightfully nervous at the hacking, coughing sickly man in front of her.)

WOMAN: Toronto, one way?

PAUL: Yes.

(She tries not to stare at the boil on his face but can't help herself. He notices her stare and turns away, towards the people in back of him.)



SCENE 17
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Scully sighs in relief a few times as Osbourne takes off the capsule.)

OSBOURNE: Now, once we harvest the blood from the insect...

(He gasps and groans, his body tensing.)

SCULLY: What?

(Osbourne falls to the floor. Scully kneels down beside him, trying to help. As she lifts his head off the ground, she notices that the boil on his neck is incredibly huge now.)

OSBOURNE: The toxins... they're moving into my brain just like it did on the prisoners. I don't have much longer. I need you to help me.

SCULLY: What do you want me to do?

(He gasps for air and struggles to his feet. Later, down the hall, Osbourne is in a glass casing.)

OSBOURNE: Go on. You have to complete the test.

SCULLY: Why did you confide in me?

OSBOURNE: It's not a secret I feel like taking to the grave. People have a right to know the danger we've put them in. If your test comes back negative... you have to tell them.

SCULLY: How can I prove it?

OSBOURNE: I don't know. But if you don't... it'll just happen again. Don't believe for a second... that this is an isolated incident.

(She stares at him as the respirator wheezes. Back in the private lab, Scully continues tests on the bug, harvesting the blood that it drew out of her. She puts a few drops down on a microscope slide and places it under the microscope. She pauses, hoping desperately, before looking into the scope. Her eyes scan through her goggles for a moment, then she pulls off the goggles and mask, breathing heavily. She sighs in relief. Walking out into the hallway excitedly, she finds that Osbourne is gone.)



SCENE 18
BUS DEPOT

(A young boy runs through the terminal, his mother giving chase.)

ANNOUNCER: Attention please, bus number nine...

MOTHER: Will you wait a second?

BOY: I don't want to miss the bus.

(The boy runs over to the side of a train with a sign over it that reads "Gate 20; Toronto" and puts his bag down.)

MOTHER: You see that? They're still loading the luggage, you're not missing anything.

(The boy runs over to the door.)

You have enough time to give your mother a kiss goodbye.

(He looks around and gives his mom a kiss on the cheek. She reciprocates. He is about to rush off when she grabs his wrist and holds up the ticket.

Wait. Ticket.

(He takes it, both of them laughing. He boards the bus.)

Be careful! Say hi to Uncle Jake!

(They wave to each other. The boy makes his way to the back when a hand grabs his arm.)

BOY: Hey!

(He looks at the sickly Paul, whose boil is now incredibly large, about ready to pop.)

PAUL: What's the time?

(The boy looks at his watch.)

BOY: Twenty to ten.

(Paul slowly lets go of the boy's arm. The boy runs to the back.)



SCENE 19
CUMBERLAND STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY; DINWIDDIE COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(Doctor Auerbach opens the door to the incinerator. Men start to load the bodies in. Scully walks in as the first body is deposited into the incinerator.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

SIMON AUERBACH: This material has been confiscated and will be destroyed according to standard C.D.C. procedure.

SCULLY: You don't work for the C.D.C.

(He looks at her, smirking.)

Where's Doctor Osbourne?

(He looks down at the floor briefly and looks away. She looks down at the nearest bag, which has a label that reads "017 - Osbourne." Osbourne is the next body to be thrown into the incinerator as she looks on in horror.)

He told me what happened here.

SIMON AUERBACH: What happened here was unavoidable.

SCULLY: Well, we'll leave that up to others to decide.

SIMON AUERBACH: Doctor Osbourne is dead. No one in this room will corroborate your story. Just be glad this thing's under control.

(The last body loaded, a man shuts the door as the bodies burn inside, erasing all trace of the disease.)



SCENE 20
BUS DEPOT

(Mulder and company pull up and walk inside. They fan out, searching the rows of people for Paul. Finding no sight of him, Mulder goes to the ticket woman. Tapia scans the next room until Mulder walks up to him.)

MULDER: He's here. He bought a ticket to Toronto.

TAPIA: Son of a bitch.

MULDER: And he's infected.

(Mulder's phone rings. He picks it up as Tapia walks away.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully, still down in the depths of the prison.)

SCULLY: Mulder... I think everything here is under control.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: You okay, Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(Cut to Scully.)

Have you found the second prisoner?

MULDER: Yeah, he's headed to Toronto.

SCULLY: He's alive? Mulder, listen to me. Everything here has been destroyed.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Any evidence whatsoever of a cover-up has been incinerated. That prisoner is the last man who can possibly connect the conspirators.

MULDER: But he's infected. He's going to die.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: If you want the truth, Mulder, he's going to have to make a statement.

(Cut to Mulder as he pulls the phone away from his ear. The name of the destination on the sign of the bus shifts from Thunder Bay to Toronto. Marshals walk around in the back and climb out of other buses. People unload off the other buses as all of Tapia's men start to gain strategic positions. Tapia, in the doorway, waves the people out. Mulder walks up to him.)

MULDER: Hold your men back.

TAPIA: What?

MULDER: I'm getting on the bus.

TAPIA: We've got the situation controlled. That bus isn't going anywhere.

MULDER: There are other passangers on board. The prisoner sees a uniform, he could panic. He panics and innocent people die.

TAPIA: What do you want to do?

MULDER: I get on the bus, I take the seat directly behind the prisoner, I put my gun to his head, I make an announcement to clear the bus.

(Tapia smiles a little and tilts his head as if to say "it could work." On the bus, the boy plays his pocket video game machine as Mulder gets on the bus and gives the driver his ticket.)

BUS DRIVER: Thank you.

(Mulder surveys the bus and finds that Paul is nowhere to be seen.)

Can you take your seat, sir?

MULDER: There's supposed to be a man on the bus.

BUS DRIVER: Sir, I've got a schedule to keep. Now, please, take your seat or I'm going to have to ask you to get off.

(Mulder sits in the seat directly behind the driver and leans forward.)

MULDER: Take the key out of the ignition and turn around slowly.

(He does so as Mulder shows him his badge.)

BUS DRIVER: What is this?

MULDER: I'm with the F.B.I. I need to know if this man has boarded the bus.

(He shows him a picture of Paul, making sure to keep both it and his badge away from the eyes of people behind him.)

BUS DRIVER: Yeah.

(He looks back and sees Paul walking out of the bathroom, coughing and wheezing.)

That's him. Right back there.

(He points to Paul. Paul looks at Mulder, looking ragged and sick, and comes to a quick realization. He draws his gun and Mulder reacts quickly, standing and drawing his gun.)

MULDER: Federal agent! Drop your weapon!

(The people on the bus scream. Paul picks up the young boy and sits down in his seat, putting the boy on his lap. The boy's face is directly next to the boil, which looks ready to pop. Tapia watches the melee from the adjacent bus. He pulls out his walkie-talkie.)

TAPIA: Plan A has gone to hell. Get ready to move, people.

(Mulder keeps his gun trained on Paul, who is more frightened than anything else.)

MULDER: Let the boy go!

PAUL: Move the damn bus!

MULDER: You got over two dozen U.S. marshalls out there, Paul. How far you gonna get?

(Paul looks out his window and sees snipers trained on him from all angles. He gasps, breathing heavily.)

PAUL: I'm dying, ain't I?

MULDER: The question is, how many people are you going to take with you?

PAUL: What is this thing?

MULDER: You were infected in prison.

(Paul smiles and sighs, almost laughing.)

PAUL: It's what Bobby Torrence had.

MULDER: And your girlfriend Elizabeth and possibly your son.

(He slowly inches towards him.)

How many more people do you want to expose?

PAUL: It came from that package in Bobby's cell, didn't it?

MULDER: You saw a package?

(Paul nods lightly, on the verge of tears. The boy is surprisingly calm.)

PAUL: What the hell was it?

(He coughs, his boil starting to pulsate slightly.)

MULDER: All right, everybody, off the bus.

(The people start to file out.)

Just keep going. Just go. Keep moving!

(The people are all off the bus. Mulder looks at the boy.)

All right, come on out. It's okay. Come on out, just slide out. I'm here for you.

(Paul releases his grip on the boy.)

That's it.

(Paul gasps and pushes the boy out. The boy runs out.)

All right.

(Paul chokes and gasps, his boil throbbing.)

All right, Paul, what was in that package?

(Paul seems unable to breathe, much less talk.)

What was in that package? A pharmaceutical company was using you as a guinea pig! If you tell me what was in that package, I'll make sure they don't get away with it! Come on, Paul, you remember. Tell me!

PAUL: It... it...

(Paul is about to tell Mulder when a shot rings out. The glass shatters next to Paul as Mulder looks on in horror. Paul slumps over, dead. Smoke fills the air outside.)

MAN #1: Get out of there!

MAN #2: Keep your distance!

(Two clean-suited men rush on the bus and take Mulder off.)

MAN #1: You have to get off, let's go! Get off!

(The sniper sits in the adjacent bus, his face clouded in smoke.)



SCENE 21
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner looks at the small, last specimen of Faciphaga Emasculata in a capsule. It is dead.)

MULDER: Robert Torrence was patient zero, the first prisoner to contract the disease. Just before being admitted to the infirmary, he received a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals. They orchestrated this entire thing to circumvent years of F.D.A. trials in order to get their drug on the market.

(Skinner puts the capsule down.)

SKINNER: Why are you telling me this, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Because I wanted you to hear it from me before you read it in the papers.

(Skinner sits down.)

SKINNER: I'd seriously reconsider bringing this to the media if that's your intention.

MULDER: The public has a right to know so it doesn't happen again.

SKINNER: And you're going to prove this elaborate conspiracy with a, an empty package and a dead insect? Leave it alone, Agent Mulder. The epidemic was contained.

MULDER: Eighteen people are dead, and if you're helping them cover the truth behind those deaths, then you're just as guilty as they are.

SKINNER: You really have no idea who you're dealing with, do you?

MULDER: I thought I was dealing with you.

(There is a knock on the door and Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: We can't prove a thing, Mulder. They've made sure of it.

(She walks over to him.)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: The Costa Rican government just faxed me the report on the missing scientist.

(She hands him a folder.)

His name is Robert Torrence, the same as our prisoner. It was their failsafe in case it ever came to this so they could blame it on a simple postal error. A mistake.

(Mulder, reading over the contents of the folder, laughs.)

MULDER: That's why we were given this assignment, right? They knew all along... so that even if we succeeded in finding the truth, we'd be discredited as part of it. Am I right?

(Skinner just stares at him.)

Am I right?!

SKINNER: You never had a chance, Agent Mulder. For every step you take, they're three steps ahead.

MULDER: Well, what about you, where do you stand?

SKINNER: I stand right on the line that you keep crossing.

(Mulder shakes his head slightly in disgust.)

SCULLY: Come on, let's go.

(They start out.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder.

(Scully opens the door as they turn around and look at him with great disdain.)

I'm saying this as a friend. Watch your back. This is just the beginning.

(Mulder and Scully walk out. Skinner stares at the door for a second, then at the last remaining trace of the epidemic, Faciphaga Emasculata.)

[THE END]
                                         SOFT LIGHT



SCENE 1
HOTEL GEORGE MASON, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

(A man [Newirth] slips the "Do Not Disturb" sign on the doorknob of his hotel room and prepares to retire for the night. As he reclines in bed to read the paper and have a drink, a second man [Banton] gets off the elevator and nervously walks to the door across the hall. He knocks.)

BANTON: Morris! (knocks again) Morris, I need to talk to you!

(Newirth hears the commotion in the hall. The light on the nightstand dims momentarily. In the hall, Banton knocks again.)

BANTON: Morris, I need to talk to you! Gail Anne is dead. It's my fault. Morris!

(While Banton knocks again, Newirth man gets up from the bed, walks to the door and looks out the peephole while placing his right hand against the door.)

BANTON: Morris, I need to talk to you. Morris, please. Answer the door, damn it!

(Banton steps back from the door. As he does, his shadow from the hall light moves toward Newirth's door and then appears just inside the room. As it touches Newirth's feet, there is a blue flash and Newirth seems to disintegrate, leaving a scorched mark on the carpet that glows blue for a moment. Banton sees the blue glow underneath the door.)

BANTON: Oh no! No. (he quickly unscrews the hall light bulb) My God, no! (he runs away down the hall) No, no, God no, no, no, no!



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
SAME LOCATION

(Scully and Mulder get off the elevator at the end of the hall.)

SCULLY: Two apparent abductions in less than a month, and then this one last night. According to my contact, the Richmond PD has hit a brick wall so I told her we'd come down and have a look.

MULDER: Who's your contact?

SCULLY: Her name is Kelly Ryan. She was one of my students when I was teaching at the academy. She's just been bumped up to detective, and she's a little nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.

(They enter Newirth's room.)

SCULLY: Kelly?

RYAN: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Hi.

RYAN: Hi.

SCULLY: This is Agent Mulder.

RYAN: (to Mulder) Hi. Thank you for coming.

MULDER: Hello.

RYAN: (to Mulder) Heard a lot about you.

MULDER: (to Scully) We'll talk later.

(Scully gives him a sheepish grin.)

RYAN: The missing man is Patrick Newirth, age 52. He's a top executive with Morley Tobacco, up from Raleigh-Durham for a meeting. He arrived on an evening train.

MULDER: How do you know he's missing?

RYAN: He set a wakeup call for 6 AM this morning. When the operator tried to place it, there was no answer.

MULDER: (sniffing the drink on the nightstand) Hmm, scotch. It looks like he barely touched it.

RYAN: Needless to say, he missed his meeting. Uh, they waited three hours before sending hotel security up. The door was locked, security chain fastened, and when they broke in, no Patrick Newirth.

MULDER: Windows?

RYAN: Locked from the inside. We're six stories up, no fire escape. No way in or out of this room.

(Scully walks across the room and crouches next to the heat register.)

RYAN: Agent Scully, what are you looking at?

SCULLY: Uh, the heat register.

RYAN: (with a look of disbelief) You don't think anyone could have squeezed in there?

MULDER: You never know. You guys turn up any forensics evidence at all?

RYAN: Uh, just this.

(She removes a cardboard cover from the scorched mark on the carpet.)

MULDER: Scully, look at this.

SCULLY: What is it?

RYAN: We don't know. The hotel claims it wasn't here before Mr. Newirth checked in. And there were similar burn marks at each of the previous crime scenes.

SCULLY: Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?

RYAN: No, according to his wife, he loathed cigarettes.

SCULLY: Well, that's strange for someone who works for a tobacco company.

MULDER: Did you run a test on it?

RYAN: Yes, sir. It's mostly carbon with some potassium and trace minerals.

SCULLY: Could be the residue from burnt human flesh.

(Mulder is noticing that the charred pattern has a section off the right side with the outline of several fingers.)

MULDER: Does this look like an arm to anybody?

RYAN: An arm?

SCULLY: What are you thinking, Mulder?

MULDER: This burn mark, it's right where I'd be if I were standing here answering the door, right?

RYAN: Yes.

MULDER: And I wouldn't be looking out the peephole unless there was something to look at, right?

RYAN: That makes sense.

(Mulder goes into the hall and taps the light on the far wall. The bulb comes on.)

MULDER: Detective Ryan, can you have this bulb dusted for prints?

RYAN: Of course.

MULDER: And can you run those against Mr. Newirth's. Do you have Mr. Newirth's prints?

RYAN: We got them from his toiletries and check-in slip.

MULDER: OK, can you check those against all hotel employees and registered guests?

RYAN: Anything else?

MULDER: Yeah, do you have the name of the last missing person?

RYAN: Uh, that would be Margaret Wysnecki.

MULDER: Thanks, that should do it. Is this your first case, Detective?

RYAN: Yes sir.

MULDER: Any idea why they gave it to you?

RYAN: No one else wanted it. Because of the lack of evidence, this is still officially a missing persons case, not likely to end up on the front page of the daily paper.

MULDER: Well, don't be so sure about that.

RYAN: Can I ask what you think may have happened?

MULDER: At first blush? Spontaneous human combustion.

(Mulder walks away as Ryan stares in surprise and disbelief. Scully gives her a supportive pat on the arm.)

SCULLY: You're doing just fine.

(Scully catches up to Mulder as he pushes the elevator button.)

SCULLY: Having a little fun?

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Spontaneous human combustion?

MULDER: I have over a dozen case files of human bodies reduced to ash without any attendant burning or melting. Rapid oxidation without heat.

SCULLY: Let's just forget for the moment that there's no scientific theory to support it.

MULDER: (flippantly) OK.

(They get on the elevator.)



SCENE 3
WYSNECKI RESIDENCE, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA

(It is dark, and Mulder and Scully drive up and walk up the sidewalk. Mulder notices that the yard lights on all the other houses in the neighborhood are lit, but not the one at the Wysnecki house.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, can you spare a prophylactic?

(She gives him a latex glove and he opens the fixture and turns the bulb. It comes on.)

MULDER: What are the odds of that, huh?

SCULLY: Darkness covers a multitude of sins.

MULDER: Check this out. My newest tool in the fight against crime - $49.95 at your local hardware store.

(He produces a red flashlight from his pocket and shines a red light on the fixture, which shows the outline of some fingerprints.)

SCULLY: Neat trick. For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.

(They enter the house and find another scorch mark on the carpet in the front hall.)

SCULLY: Look at this, Mulder.

MULDER: What do we know about the victim?

SCULLY: Margaret Wysnecki, age 66. Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco where she worked production line for 36 years. Tobacco? Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco, didn't he?

MULDER: Yeah, but half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks. It's just a coincidence.

SCULLY: Yeah, you're probably right. The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, was an engineer for Polarity Magnetics.

(They enter the kitchen.)

They didn't find any prints in here or anywhere else in the house. What makes you think the prints on the bulb mean anything?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He opens the trash can and pulls out an Amtrak ticket stub.)

MULDER: Ah, look at this, Scully. Someone forgot to empty the trash. M. Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia, return train dated March 17.

SCULLY: That's the same day she disappeared.

MULDER: Patrick Newirth came into town by train, didn't he?

SCULLY: And Gail Anne Lambert ... uh, no it doesn't say anything here that puts her anywhere near the Richmond Train Station.

MULDER: Maybe that was a detail that was overlooked.

SCULLY: Well, even so, what's the significance?

MULDER: Maybe these people aren't just disappearing, maybe they're being hunted. And the hunter is working the train station.

SCULLY: And whatever happened to spontaneous human combustion?

MULDER: Maybe it's not so spontaneous. Get on the phone to your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.

(Scully gets out her cell phone.)



SCENE 4
RICHMOND TRAIN STATION

(Bantock is sitting on a bench in the station, staring at the floor. He rises, still looking at his feet, and slowly walks outside. It is dark and as he passes under a light in an alley, it dims. A police car turns into the alley and approaches him.)

FIRST OFFICER: (to radio) 66, this is 64. Suspicious male, loitering in the alley behind the train station. I'm going to check him out.

VOICE ON RADIO: Roger that, 64, I'm on my way.

(The first officer gets out of his car.)

FIRST OFFICER: Sir, could I speak with you?

(Banton starts running away, down the alley.)

FIRST OFFICER: Hold on, I only want to ask you a couple of questions.

(A second police car enters the alley from the other direction and Bantock stops.)

FIRST OFFICER: All right, stop right there! Don't move, just hold it! Put your hands in the air, sir!

(The second officer gets out of his car and approaches Bantock, who is standing in a lit area.)

BANTON: (to second officer) Stay away from me.

(Banton ducks across the alley into the shadows. The officers aim their guns at him.)

FIRST OFFICER: What do you think you're doing? All right, come on out of there! I just want to talk to you!

BANTON: Stay away from me! I don't want to hurt you!

SECOND OFFICER: Move it!

FIRST OFFICER: Hands where we can see them!

(Banton raises his hands and slowly comes out of the shadow into the light. He looks up at the light nervously.)

BANTON: Please, I'm warning you. I'm a dangerous man.

SECOND OFFICER: Keep moving, pal, out where we can see you. (Banton moves farther out) All right, I want you to lie face down on the ground.

BANTON: (to second officer) Don't come any closer.

SECOND OFFICER: Get down on the ground, sir. Now.

(As the second officer comes closer, he approaches Banton's shadow. Banton steps back.)

BANTON: Please, you don't understand.

(Banton continues to step backward, and now his shadow from another light touches the feet of the first officer, who is standing behind him. The first officer disintegrates with a blue flash.)

BANTON: Oh, God, no!

SECOND OFFICER: Barney!

(The second officer continues to approach Banton.)

BANTON: Don't, no! Stay away.

(The second officer walks into Banton's shadow and he also disintegrates.)

BANTON: (running wildly away, down the alley) Oh, God! No, no, God, not again! No, no, no, no ...



SCENE 5
SAME ALLEY, NEXT MORNING

(The area is roped off and there are several police cars. Mulder and Scully drive up. Ryan walks over to meet them.)

SCULLY: What happened here, Kelly?

RYAN: I sent two patrolmen down here last night, like you told me. They lost radio contact with them just after midnight. All they found this morning was two more scorch marks on the pavement.

MULDER: Nothing else?

RYAN: Nope. Suddenly this looks like it could be a cop killer case, and I'm indirectly responsible.

SCULLY: Well, you were just doing your job.

RYAN: (agitated) Yeah, well they want to know on what suspicions I sent these men down here. And if I tell them I involved the FBI, they're going to snap.

MULDER: The prints you pulled from that light bulb ...

RYAN: I ran it against all the hotel staff and guests, then through the national databases. No match. Some first case, huh?

SCULLY: You just make sure you hang onto this case. I'm sure something will turn up.

(Mulder and Scully walk back and get in the car.)

SCULLY: These ideas of yours, Mulder, you care to share them?

MULDER: Not yet.

SCULLY: You don't have a clue, do you?

MULDER: He was here, Scully, I was right about that.

SCULLY: All right, where does this leave us?

MULDER: Maybe with enough to identify the killer.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: He was here last night. He was also probably here on March 17 and March 31.

SCULLY: Those are the dates that Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick Newirth disappeared.

MULDER: That leaves us with 3 days of train station videotapes to cross-reference and hopefully find out who this guy is.

SCULLY: That's assuming we're looking for a guy.

MULDER: Either way, the security camera's our only witness.



SCENE 6
TRAIN STATION SECURITY OFFICE

(Mulder and Scully are reviewing videotapes with a security guard.)

SCULLY: It could be any one of these people, Mulder ... or none of them. I've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how you expect to find him.

SECURITY GUARD: That's it for March 22 on the arrival deck.

MULDER: Let's go back to the terminal tape.

SCULLY: Again?

MULDER: He's got to be on at least one of these tapes.

SCULLY: Chances are, he's not walking around carrying a sign with an arrow on it.

SECURITY GUARD: There you go.

(Mulder notices Banton sitting on a bench.)

MULDER: See, this guy. Right here. He's always here. What's he doing?

SCULLY: Looking at the floor.

MULDER: Why's he doing that?

SCULLY: Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.

MULDER: Can you freeze this and blow it up 200 percent?

SECURITY GUARD: Sure.

(There's a light spot on his jacket.)

MULDER: OK, can you reframe and blow it up some more? He's got something on his jacket right there.

SECURITY GUARD: I'll see if I can pull it up.

(Mulder reads the name from the blurry image.)

MULDER: Polarity Magnetics.

SCULLY: That's where the first victim worked.



SCENE 7
POLARITY MAGNETICS

(Mulder and Scully walk up stairs and knock on the door. There are no obvious signs of activity.)

SCULLY: Looks like it's been closed up.

(Davey answers the door.)

DAVEY: Yes?

SCULLY: We're agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. We're looking for a man who may have worked here.

(Scully shows him a printout of Banton from the train station tape.)

DAVEY: When was this taken?

MULDER: March 22. Do you know him?

DAVEY: Sure, I know him. Dr. Chester Banton. He was my business partner.

SCULLY: You mean he's not any more?

DAVEY: I don't know, I would assume not. This is the first I've seen of him in five weeks. I wondered if he wasn't going to turn up dead.

MULDER: How's that?

DAVEY: Chester was involved in a terrible accident here.

(Davey, Mulder and Scully are walking through a corridor within the building.)

DAVEY: Polarity Magnetics does - or did - primarily two types of research. Mostly, we were designing mag-lev applications ... uh, people movers, bullet trains ... but for Chester, that was just the way to pay the bills for the really theoretical stuff he was interested in.

MULDER: Which was what?

DAVEY: Researching dark matter, quantum particles, neutrinos, gluons, mesons, quarks ...

SCULLY: Subatomic particles.

DAVEY: The mysteries of the universe. Theoretically, the very building blocks of reality.

SCULLY: Except no one knows if they truly exist.

DAVEY: Chester was sure they did, so sure he bet his life on it.

(Davey keys into a laboratory filled with electronic equipment.)

This is where it happened. Chester was working to isolate a new particle. He'd been working on it for a year.

SCULLY: This is a particle accelerator.

DAVEY: One-fifth the power of the Texas supercollider in a space the size of a Wal-Mart.

MULDER: Powered by what?

DAVEY: Couple of billion megawatts. Virginia Power loved us.

SCULLY: Exactly what happened here?

DAVEY: Well, the work involved bombardment of beta particles with an alpha target. Negative against positive. Chester had everything set and had started the countdown when he realized he'd make a mistake. There was something that needed re-adjusting in the target room. Except you can't stop the countdown once you've begun. There was time to safely make the change, but I'd left the room for a minute when Chester decided to go in. I didn't realize until it was too late that the door had locked behind him.

(Davey punches a code into a keypad and the door to the target chamber opens. Inside they find more equipment and the darkened outline of a man on the wall.)

MULDER: Look at this!

DAVEY: As far as I can tell, it burned Chester's shadow right into the wall.

SCULLY: How did he survive?

DAVEY: All I can figure is - the quanta liberated off the target have virtually no mass, that they slid right through his body.

MULDER: Like getting an X-ray.

DAVEY: A two billion megawatt X-ray. When I looked at the monitor and saw what was happening, that Chester was trapped in here, I panicked. I cut the power but it was too late. I remember looking and seeing Chester. He was perfectly calm. Almost like he wanted it to happen, like he was finally going to experience the dark matter he had theorized in some kind of physical way. As if the truth might come into him. (Davey gets emotional) Excuse me.

MULDER: What do you think, Scully?

SCULLY: Well, this looks like the same kind of material that they found at each of the other crime scenes. Maybe what we're dealing with is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.

MULDER: I'm less convinced of that now.

SCULLY: What do you think it is?

(Davey is back in the outside room eavesdropping on Mulder and Scully from a video and audio monitor.)

MULDER: I don't know. Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr. Chester Ray Banton, maybe even part of him.

SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.

MULDER: I know of one place to start looking.



SCENE 8
RICHMOND TRAIN STATION

(Mulder sits on the bench in the same location where Banton was seen. Scully approaches.)

SCULLY: There's no sign of him, Mulder. Maybe he's moved on. What are you looking at?

MULDER: On the videotape, Dr. Banton kept staring at the floor. I've been trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.

SCULLY: Well, maybe the exposure affected his mind. Nonsensical repetitive behavior is a common trait of mental illness.

MULDER: You trying to tell me something?

SCULLY: I called Detective Ryan. She's having the prints on the lightbulbs checked against Banton's.

MULDER: Did you tell her about Dr. Banton's accident?

SCULLY: No, I only told her that he was a possible suspect, and that it was a bit too early to get her hopes up, and that right now we have more questions than we do answers.

MULDER: Like?

SCULLY: Like a motive, like a murder weapon, like ...

(Mulder has been standing next to the bench observing the overhead lighting and the lack of shadows around his feet.)

MULDER: What if, Dr. Banton ... look here, there are hardly any shadows cast.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: The lighting in here is diffused. It's soft light. What if that was what Banton was looking for?

(Banton comes around a corner toward them.)

SCULLY: Looking for his shadow?

(Mulder spots him.)

MULDER: Dr. Banton!

(Banton runs outside. Mulder and Scully pursue him and corner him in a lighted area on the loading platform. They aim their guns at him.)

MULDER: Stop right there! Dr. Banton!

BANTON: Please, just leave me alone.

MULDER: We're federal agents, Dr. Banton.

BANTON: You don't understand. You're making a big mistake. Stay away from me.

(Banton looks down at his shadow and sees that Mulder is approaching it.)

Wait! It'll kill you, it doesn't care who you are.

(Mulder looks down and sees that he is close to the shadow. He then looks behind him and sees that Scully is approaching a shadow of Banton cast by another light. He shoots out both lights with his gun, leaving all three in the dark.)

BANTON: Thank God!



SCENE 9
YALOFF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL, PIEDMONT, VIRGINIA

(Banton is in a softly lit room. Mulder and Scully, with a doctor, slide open the observation window in the door.)

MULDER: I thought the orders were to keep this patient in the dark.

DOCTOR: He insisted on soft light. It's the only way he'd let us open the door.

(Mulder and Scully enter, while the doctor locks the three of them in the room.)

BANTON: How can you even begin to understand what it's like?

MULDER: We're trying to understand.

BANTON: Living in a train station, day and night. Living like a bum, afraid to fall asleep because of what might happen.

SCULLY: The accident in the lab ... the quanta bombardment ... you believe that altered you physically?

BANTON: You could say that.

MULDER: Can you tell us how?

BANTON: Even if I could, you wouldn't understand.

SCULLY: But it has something to do with dark matter.

BANTON: It has everything to do with dark matter. My shadow isn't mine. It's ... it's like a black hole. It splits molecules into component atoms, it unzips electrons from their orbits, reduces matter into pure energy.

SCULLY: That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?

BANTON: It wasn't me. Gail Anne was my colleague. She ... the night after the accident, I went to see her. I was just standing in the doorway. I was looking right at her ... and then she was gone.

MULDER: You have no control over it?

BANTON: If I could control it, do you think I would let it go around killing people? All I can do is study it, try and divine its true nature before they do.

MULDER: They?

BANTON: The government. (whispers to Mulder) They're after me. And when they find me, they're going to do the brain suck. They've just been dying to do it.

MULDER: The brain suck? For the purpose of ...

BANTON: For the purpose of stealing what has taken me years to accomplish. And don't think they wouldn't kill to get it.

MULDER: But if they killed you, then wouldn't your shadow just ...

BANTON: Disappear? Who knows? That's why you have to get me out of here. If I die, there could be nothing left to tether this thing.

RYAN: (opening the door) Excuse me. I'm going to have to ask you discontinue your interrogation of the suspect.

(Mulder and Scully step out into the hall with Ryan and another detective.)

RYAN: This is Detective Barron. He's the primary on this case.

BARRON: Yeah, I was just wondering what your involvement is here?

MULDER: We caught the guy.

BARRON: I appreciate that. But no one seems to be able to recall inviting the FBI in on this case.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder and I are here strictly in an unofficial capacity.

BARRON: Then who brought you in?

SCULLY: We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.

BARRON: Well, Banton's prints place him at two of the crime scenes, and transit authority tapes show him in the immediate vicinity of two of the most recent victims. So I say this case is looking pretty much explained.

MULDER: Really? Have you talked to Dr. Banton?

BARRON: I hope you're not trying to interrogate me, Agent Mulder. Because I'm not the suspect.

MULDER: I don't think you know anything about this case, which is why you stuck it with Detective Ryan. And I think you should allow her to decide how to proceed.

BARRON: Detective Ryan is handling this case. She's done well, and I see no reason not to continue to let her prosecute it once the prisoner has been transferred.

MULDER: Transferred? Where?

RYAN: To the city jail in preparation for his arraignment.

MULDER: I don't think you fully appreciate this man's condition or the danger that he poses.

BARRON: I don't think you have the authority to tell me, or anyone else in my unit, how to do our job.

RYAN: I think we can handle it from here, Agent Mulder. We'll call you if there's anything more you can do.

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder, let's go.

(Scully and Barron walk away in opposite directions. Mulder catches Ryan by the arm before she can leave.)

MULDER: (to Ryan) Soft light. He needs soft light.

(Mulder catches up with Scully.)

MULDER: Hope you know what you're doing, Scully.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Putting Detective Ryan's ambition ahead of all good sense in this case.

SCULLY: Ambition? She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club, Mulder. Believe me, I know how she feels.

MULDER: The difference is you never put yourself ahead of your work, and that's what happening here.

SCULLY: Look. The fact is, we have no jurisdiction here. We were called in as a favor.

MULDER: And as a favor, we just handed over the A-bomb over to the Boy Scouts.

SCULLY: I'm sure all the necessary precautions will be taken.

MULDER: And I'm sure that Robert Oppenheimer got similar reassurances from his government, the same government that Dr. Banton is afraid of.

SCULLY: You don't believe all this paranoia about brain sucking, do you?

MULDER: That man is scared, and it's not just of his own shadow.

SCULLY: Mulder, as brilliant as Dr. Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional. He demonstrated just about every textbook indicator back there.

MULDER: We've both seen the physical evidence, Scully.

SCULLY: Look, I don't know how to explain it, but that's not our job. I don't know what else we should do.

MULDER: I think I do.



SCENE 10
RICHMOND TRAIN STATION

(Mulder is looking through the station and sees Mr. X. X walks away and Mulder follows. They meet in a deserted stairwell.)

X: All you've given me is a name - Chester A. Banton.

MULDER: Dr. Chester A. Banton. Do you know him?

X: No. Should I?

MULDER: He's being held by the Richmond Police in connection with several bizarre murders. He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons, dark matter. He believes the government is out to get him.

X: It's tax season. So do most Americans.

MULDER: He believes his life is in danger.

X: Is he a dangerous man?

MULDER: Yes.

X: Where is he being held?

MULDER: At the Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital, but not for long.

X: I'm afraid I can't help you.

MULDER: Why?

X: The last time I helped you, I bloodied my fist and regrettably exposed my identity to associates of yours.

MULDER: Yes, I know, and you can trust them as you trust me. I promise.

X: Dead men can't keep promises. The next time the blood and regret could be yours. I'm not at your beck and call, Agent Mulder. I have nothing to gain and everything to lose by helping you. Promise you won't contact me again unless absolutely necessary.

(X heads down the stairs. Mulder waits until he is out of hearing range.)

MULDER: (softly) Promise.



SCENE 11
YALOFF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(As a nurse works at the nursing station, the lights dim briefly, then go out. The nurse picks up the phone.)

NURSE: Frank, are your lights on down there? Ours just went ...

(Mr. X suddenly presses the switchhook on the phone, startling the nurse.)

X: Hi. We're here to transfer Chester A. Banton.

NURSE: I have orders he's not being transferred until tomorrow.

X: Due to the power outage, there's been a change in plans.

(X heads down the hall.)

NURSE: No one's supposed to go in there.

(X is joined by two other men in the hallway. X unlocks the door to Banton's room and the two men go in with a stretcher. The nurse catches up to X in the hall.)

X: Here. Quickly.

NURSE: Who are you?

BANTON: No. Don't do this. Please, please, no, no, don't, leave me alone.

(The two men gag and bind Banton and lift him to his feet. Suddenly the emergency lighting comes on, which consists of a single bulb in Banton's room. There is a blue flash as the two men disintegrate. X looks into the room to see Banton and two scorched spots on the floor. Banton walks out of the room, with X giving way to avoid his shadow. As they stare at each other in the hall, X draws his gun and aims at Banton but then lowers it. Banton runs away down the hall.)



SCENE 12
NEXT DAY AT THE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(Mulder walks down the hall, passing Ryan who is coming out of Banton's room. He enters the room to find Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: What'd you find out, Scully?

SCULLY: Richmond PD had two officers outside watching the entrance. They didn't see anybody come in.

MULDER: According to the floor nurse, there were three men.

SCULLY: Three? The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks from here. Somebody posing as the city engineer.

MULDER: Somebody who would have access to plans for Virginia Power so they could take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.

SCULLY: Somebody from the government coming for Dr. Banton?

MULDER: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, Scully, but my guess is he was unsuccessful and Dr. Banton is on the loose.

SCULLY: That's what Detective Ryan thinks.

MULDER: I saw her leave.

SCULLY: She was in charge of Dr. Banton's transfer and arraignment this morning. She's in some pretty hot water.

MULDER: Well, maybe that was an appointment he was never meant to keep. Let's go.

SCULLY: Where? Mulder, wait. Where are we going?

MULDER: You heard what Dr. Banton said last night.

SCULLY: I heard him say a lot of things.

MULDER: Put yourself in his head, Scully. I think the only reason he hasn't tried to kill himself is because he's afraid his death will release the dark matter.

SCULLY: Wait a second. That's still just a theory, and it's a pretty wild one at that.

MULDER: Whether or not Dr. Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.

SCULLY: And apparently so does whoever it is that tried to take him last night.

MULDER: All that he's been trying to do since the accident is try to control this thing. Now if he's escaped, he's going to go to the one place where he thinks he can do that, and we've got to get there first.



SCENE 13
POLARITY MAGNETICS

(Davey enters a darkened laboratory and reaches for the light switch, but Banton grabs his hand.)

BANTON: Don't turn on the light, Chris, unless you want to die.

DAVEY: Chester, what the hell is going on? The FBI has been looking for you. Where've you been?

BANTON: There's no time to explain, just come with me.

(They step out and start down a corridor.)

DAVEY: What's this about, Chester, you're acting crazy. Talk to me.

BANTON: We've found the dark matter, Chris, it's real, we found it.

DAVEY: What are you talking about?

BANTON: Don't you understand? I'm it. It's ... it's in me.

DAVEY: The accident?

BANTON: They're coming for me, Chris. We have to destroy this thing before they get here.

DAVEY: No, you can't go back in there, Chester.

(Ryan appears in the corridor in front of them, weapon raised.)

RYAN: Police! I'm placing you under arrest, Dr. Banton.

BANTON: A lot of people will die if you do this.

RYAN: Step against the wall, sir.

BANTON: I'm begging you. I don't want to hurt you.

RYAN: I said step against the wall, now.

(As Davey watches, Banton looks up and sees a light over his head. He checks his shadow, then walks toward Ryan.)

BANTON: I'm sorry.

(His shadow touches Ryan and she disintegrates, leaving a scorch mark.)

BANTON: Let's go, we don't have much time.

(Davey stares wide-eyed at the scorch mark, then follows Banton to the particle accelerator lab. Banton operates the keypad to opens the target room door, then steps inside.)

DAVEY: Chester!

BANTON: No matter what they say to you later, you're doing the right thing.

(He closes the door and looks at Davey through a peephole in the door.)

BANTON: Lock it up, Chris.

(Davey operates the keypad to seal the door.)

BANTON: All right, let's get the accelerator on line.

DAVEY: I'm afraid not, Chester.

BANTON: You can do it, Chris.

DAVEY: I can, but I'm not.

BANTON: No, Chris. Tell me you're not working for them.

DAVEY: Wish I could, Chester.

BANTON: You son of a bitch!

DAVEY: Careful, we don't want you to hurt yourself.

BANTON: I'll die before I let them use me.

DAVEY: You're lightning in a bottle, Chester. We're not about to let you die.

(Davey goes to the telephone and dials a number, watching Banton on the video monitor.)

BANTON: Chris, don't do this. Listen to me. This is wrong. You're making a terrible mistake.

DAVEY: (to phone) I've got him. He's not going anywhere until you pick him up.

(A gunshot is heard, and Davey falls across the desk.)

BANTON: Chris? Chris? Chris? What's happening? Chris? Chris?

(Banton is looking through the peephole and suddenly X's face appears on the other side.)

(Mulder and Scully arrive and walk up the stairs toward Polarity Magnetics. They pass a window overlooking the parking lot.)

SCULLY: We're not the first ones here, Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.

MULDER: I was afraid of this.

(They come upon the scorch mark in the corridor.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: (looking at the mark) Oh, damn it!

(As Scully kneels over the mark, they hear an electrical humming noise.)

SCULLY: What's that noise?

MULDER: The accelerator.

(They hurry to the accelerator room. The accelerator is operating but there is no one in the outside area. Mulder goes to the target room door but there is a blinding light from within. Scully goes to the control desk.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(On the video monitor, they see a figure slumped back in a chair in the target room. As they watch, the figure and chair disintegrate, leaving a shadow on the wall. The accelerator shuts off. Mulder goes to the door and looks in, but he cannot open the door.)

MULDER: Scully, look at this.

(Scully looks through the door and sees the new shadow.)

SCULLY: He must have killed her and then killed himself.

MULDER: He couldn't have. This chamber's been sealed from the outside. (he slaps the door)

SCULLY: By who?



SCENE 14
A DARK, UNKNOWN LOCATION

(Mulder and X meet in a dark corridor.)

X: Agent Mulder. I thought you had agreed not to contact me again about this.

MULDER: You lied to me.

X: About?

MULDER: About Chester Ray Banton. You knew who he was, and you used me to lead you to him.

X: You were the one who contacted me, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I won't be your stalking horse, or the government's.

X: You seem to be mistaken about the amount of control you exercise over this arrangment.

MULDER: (angrily) You killed Dr. Banton!

X: Have you lost your mind?

MULDER: A nurse at the hospital identified you! A young detective is dead because of you! Who do you answer to?

X: Despite my loyalty to my predecessor, I've never made you any promises.

MULDER: All right, promise me something right now. Promise me this will be our last meeting. We're finished.

(Mulder walks away.)

X: You're choosing a dangerous time to go it alone, Agent Mulder. Mulder! (Mulder stops and looks back at him) I didn't kill him.

(X exits in the opposite direction.)



SCENE 15
A CEMETARY

FATHER: Mourners are invited to pay their respects to the family at the Ryan home.

(Scully is among the mourners. She crouches over the burial marker, which reads "KELLY RYAN 1965-1995". After a moment, she rises and walks back to Mulder.)

MULDER: How you doing?

SCULLY: I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder. She was my student, and she came to me for help.

MULDER: I know it must be hard.

SCULLY: This shouldn't have happened. This never should have happened.

MULDER: I'm sorry I'm late, I got hung up at the Richmond PD.

SCULLY: Doing what?

MULDER: A missing person report was filed this morning by a Dr. Morris West. He's a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.

SCULLY: I'm not sure I follow you.

MULDER: The missing person was Dr. Christopher Davey. He hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.

SCULLY: Do they have any leads or know where he might be?

MULDER: No. None.

SCULLY: But you do.

MULDER: I've been wondering, what if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?

SCULLY: Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?



SCENE 16
A GOVERNMENT FACILITY

(X walks down a corridor, joining a government scientist in the hallway. A bright light is flashing from within the room.)

GOVERNMENT SCIENTIST: Dr. Davey would have been helpful to us. We'll be studying this man for a long time.

(Inside, Banton is seated with sensors attached to his head. The flashing light is casting a shadow on a photoelectric panel. A single tear falls down Banton's cheek.)

[THE END]

                                      OUR TOWN



SCENE 1
COUNTY ROAD A7
DUDLEY, ARKANSAS

(Forest, at night. Car pulls into a deserted area, then stops. GEORGE KEARNS, 40s and PAULA GRAY, early 20s are in the car. GEORGE is very nervous.)

GEORGE: (stroking her shoulder) We don't have to be out here, you know. It's not like you're still in high school. We can go to the motel.

PAULA: Mm-mm. I wouldn't want anyone to see us.

GEORGE: No onell see us.

PAULA: It's a small town.

(PAULA gets out of the car and closes the door. As she does, GEORGE has a small seizure. He manages to take a couple of pills, then relaxes.)

PAULA: (teasing) George... Come on, George.

(He joins her running through the woods.)

GEORGE: (breathless) Why'd ya change your mind anyway?

PAULA: I dont know. You were pretty persistent, I guess.

GEORGE: Squeaky wheel gets the oil, right?

PAULA: I guess so.

GEORGE: What's wrong with right here? I can just set the blanket down and...

PAULA: Not yet.

GEORGE: Why not?

PAULA: Because... You have to catch me first. (she runs off into the woods)

GEORGE: Aw, come on, now. You don't want me to chase after you, do you?

(He chases her, but cant run as fast.)

GEORGE: Paula! (There is no sign of her. He trips and falls.) Paula?

(Tribal music plays in the background.)

GEORGE: Paula. Where are you?

(He runs, then trips and falls again.)

GEORGE: (in pain) Son of a bitch!

(He looks up and sees he is surrounded by lights getting closer to him. Finally he sees a large figure wearing a primitive ceremonial costume and a painted wood mask raise an axe over his head. GEORGE screams as the axe descends toward him.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(X-Files office. MULDER is looking at file on GEORGE KEARNS.)

MULDER: I dont know, Scully, the mans vanished. He hasnt been seen or heard from in ten weeks.

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder, don't you see what they're doing? They're wasting our time. They're sending us on some kind of a wild goose chase.

MULDER: Chicken chase. (SCULLY looks at him questioningly) George Kearns was a federal poultry inspector assigned to Dudley, Arkansas, home of Chaco Chicken.

SCULLY: I'm not questioning the case's legitimacy, just their motives in assigning it to us. I mean, doesn't it bother you at all that they're undermining your work?

MULDER: They may "think" they are, but on the night George Kearns disappeared a woman on the I-10 saw a strange fire in an adjacent field.

SCULLY: Yes, I read that report. She claims that she saw some kind of a-a foxfire spirit. I'm surprised she didn't call Oprah as soon as she got off the phone with the police.

MULDER: Folktales dating back to the 19th century from the Ozarks describe people being taken away by fireballs. It's supposed to be the spirits of massacred Indians.

SCULLY: (closing her eyes, exasperated) Those are only legends, Mulder.

MULDER: Well, most legends don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks. (hands her a photo of a field with a large burned circle) That photo was taken by state police in the field where the woman claims to have seen foxfire.

SCULLY: This could have been made by anything-- a bonfire.

MULDER: I thought so too. Until I remembered this. (crosses to TV) It's a documentary I saw when I was in college about an insane asylum. Gave me nightmares.

SCULLY: I didnt think anything gave you nightmares.

MULDER: Unh, I was young.

(MULDER starts tape. Man, CREIGHTON JONES in hospital gown pacing back and forth telling his story. There is a panicked tone to his voice.)

JONES: (on video tape) No...They, uh... See, they took... They, uh... They took me away... They took me away-- the fire demons. The fire demons... the fire demons wanted their pound of flesh but, uh... I'm too fast for them. (he starts laughing ) They cannot kill you. See, you can't let them kill you. Oh, no. Don't let them kill you. Don't let them kill you. That's no way to get to heaven. No, sir. No, sir. That's no way to get to heaven....

MULDER: (stopping tape) His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled off the road on May 17, 1961 to take a nap. They found him three days later so deranged by what he'd encountered that he had to be committed. The state police found his car on the I-10 right in the middle of Dudley, Arkansas, home of Chaco Chicken.

(MULDER goes back to his desk. SCULLY, disturbed by the tape, looks at the TV, then at the picture of the burned field.)



SCENE 3
DUDLEY, ARKANSAS

(MULDER and SCULLY investigate the large burned area in the middle of a field. MULDER picks up a fork from off the ground and examines it. SCULLY finds a strange stick in the ground.)

SCULLY: What's this, Mulder?

MULDER: That's a witch's peg. Staking it into the ground is supposed to ward off evil spirits.

(SHERIFF ARENS walks toward them.)

SHERIFF ARENS: (thick southern accent) Can I help you folks? I'm Sheriff Arens. I saw you back at the turnoff.

MULDER: We're with the FBI. Im Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. Were investigating the disappearance of George Kearns.

SHERIFF ARENS: I'm happy to help you but Im not sure how much there is to investigate.

SCULLY: Well, Sheriff Arens, a man is missing.

SHERIFF ARENS: We didn't find any evidence of criminal activity and since no body turned up we just went ahead and filed a missing persons report.

MULDER: Why didn't you mention this witch's peg in your report?

SHERIFF ARENS: Because these fields are filled with witch's pegs. A lot of these old hill people cling tight to their superstitions.

MULDER: What about the scorched area?

SHERIFF ARENS: Illegal trash burning. (MULDER and SCULLY look at him strangely, he shrugs) I keep handing out the citations. They keep doing it anyway. It's cheaper to pay the fine than to haul it to the dump.

MULDER: So you dont believe its foxfire?

SHERIFF ARENS: Sir, foxfire's nothing more than a ghost story about swamp gas.

(SCULLY gives MULDER an "I told you so" smile. He acknowledges the hit with a tight grin.)

SHERIFF ARENS: I don't know what y'all are thinking, but George Kearns was passing through town since he got here six months ago.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

SHERIFF ARENS: Never did fit in-- not at the plant, not even at his own home. It's no big secret that Kearns stepped out on his wife every chance he got.

SCULLY: Did he have many chances?

SHERIFF ARENS: Let's just say George is the type of man you'd expect to go chasing some sweet young thing out of town.

SCULLY: Is that what his wife thinks happened?

SHERIFF ARENS: Push comes to shove, Im sure she does. But, you're welcome to ask her yourself.



SCENE 4

(KEARNS household. MULDER and SCULLY interview DORIS KEARNS.)

DORIS: My husband had a character that leaves something out. I always knew that about him but I didn't have the sense to do anything about it. I guess he saved me the trouble.

SCULLY: So you're fairly certain that he left you for somebody else.

DORIS: George left me a long time ago. Right around the time I turned 40. Leaving town was just a formality.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea who he might be with now?

DORIS: No. And I don't want to know, either.

MULDER: (looking at folder) This inspection report-- your husband was about to file it with the Department of Agriculture the day before he disappeared.

DORIS: I dont know anything about that.

MULDER: He never discussed his work with you?

DORIS: He never told me and I never asked.

MULDER: Well, he cited several major health violations. He was gonna recommend that the plant be shut down.

DORIS: I told you, I dont know a thing about what went on in that plant.

SCULLY: Did your husband ever receive any threatening phone calls or anything unusual in the mail?

DORIS: Sure. There were hang-ups but I always thought it was one of his girlfriends.

MULDER: Let me give you my phone number. If your husband tries to contact you I want you to get in touch with me. Or if you can think of anything else.

(MULDER and SCULLY leave.)



SCENE 5

(Chaco Chicken processing plant. Billboard advertises "Good People, Good Food." MULDER and SCULLY arrive and enter the plant. PAULA is at her locker getting ready. She is shaking, looks ill.)

WORKER: Come on, Paula. Lets go.

(PAULA looks around nervously and swallows some pills dry, then follows the others to the plant floor.)

(On the floor dead chickens are being processed. SHERIFF ARENS is introducing MULDER and SCULLY to JESS HAROLD.)

SHERIFF ARENS: This is Jess Harold. He's the floor manager here. Jess, these people are with the FBI.

JESS HAROLD: Oh, you're here about George Kearns, right?

SCULLY: Well, theres a possibility that his disappearance may have something to do with a report he was about to file with the Department of Agriculture.

JESS HAROLD: (laughs) You got to understand that ever since he got here George has been trying to shut us down.

SCULLY: Well he cited multiple violations.

JESS HAROLD: I know he did. Believe me, I had to answer to every one.

SCULLY: Was there any merit to his claims?

JESS HAROLD: Let me show you something.

(JESS HAROLD leads them to another part of the plant. As they exit, PAULA who was working nearby begins gasping as if in great pain. She looks like shes about to faint. Her COWORKER [who looks a lot like Chris Carter] notices.)

COWORKER: Paula, you okay?

( PAULA gasps. She watches the dead chickens go by on spikes. Suddenly, she sees the severed head of GEORGE instead of a chicken. She pulls the head off the spike, throws it to the floor and runs out of the room. The COWORKER looks down at the dead chicken on the floor, confused.)

(JESS HAROLD continues giving MULDER and SCULLY the tour. SHERIFF ARENS follows along.)

JESS HAROLD: This is where George worked. Not a chicken leaves here without passing through the inspector's station. We've been operating here for 50 years without any trouble with the USDA. Until George came along.

SCULLY: So he really did threaten to shut the plant down.

JESS HAROLD: Oh, he tried, but we got three other inspectors here who consistently give us top marks. Here, see for yourself. (hands her a clipboard) No, the only problem this plant ever had was George.

SCULLY: Problem enough to do something about?

(MULDER looks around the plant.)

JESS HAROLD: If you're suggesting any kind of unsavoriness, I guess anything's possible, but youve got to understand about George. He had a bone to pick with everyone-- even the federal government.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

JESS HAROLD: He filed a big worker's compensation suit-- claimed he was getting terrible headaches from his job. "Line hypnosis" his lawyers called it.

SCULLY: Yeah, I read about that. It's caused by high-speed repetitive activity.

JESS HAROLD: I will not deny that a lot of chickens go through here every day, but we've always operated well within federal guidelines.

SCULLY: What happened to his lawsuit?

JESS HAROLD: Well, it was dismissed just a few weeks before he disappeared.

(MULDER has been looking at a very large vat of disgusting organic material being slowly stirred by a machine.)

MULDER: Whats that?

JESS HAROLD: Oh, that... (leads them over to the machine) It's a feed grinder. Chops up bone and tissue. See, any part of the bird we can't package we process, use as feed.

MULDER: Chickens feed on chickens?

JESS HAROLD: (laughs) I know it doesn't sound too appetizing, but it is nutritious and it cuts down on costs. The meat is cooked and mixed with grain. No reason letting all that protein go to waste.

(Horn blows.)

JESS HAROLD: You'll have to excuse me. I got a shift change.

(JESS HAROLD leaves them alone, as does SHERIFF ARENS who crosses over to someone else.)

SHERIFF ARENS: Logan

SCULLY: So, Mulder, are you ready to admit they sent us on a fool's errand?

MULDER: If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise, Scully.

SCULLY: (impatient) Well, whether George Kearns skipped town or somebody killed him, this case could've been handled by any agent under the Kansas City office.

MULDER: Im not so sure about that.

(MULDER and SCULLY start to exit, but turn back when they hear a woman cry out. PAULA has her arm around JESS HAROLDs neck, a boning knife against the side of his face. MULDER pulls out his gun. SCULLY begins walking slowly toward PAULA, her hand stretched out.)

MULDER: : Let him go. Were federal agents

SCULLY. Everyone stay calm. Don't hurt him. Just tell us what you want. Dont get excited. Just calm down. Stay calm. We dont want anyone to get hurt. We can talk this thing out. Why dont you give me the knife?

(PAULA is listening to SCULLY, but then from across the room there is the sound of a gunshot as SHERIFF ARENS shoots and kills PAULA. She falls into the vat behind her. MULDER slowly lowers his gun looking at SHERIFF ARENS.)

SCULLY: (to JESS HAROLD) You okay?

(PAULAs body sinks into the dead chicken mush.)



SCENE 6

(Later PAULAs body has been removed from the vat. She is zipped up in a body bag and wheeled out. DR. RANDOLPH is treating the cut on JESS HAROLDs neck.)

SCULLY: Do you have any idea what might have prompted her attack?

JESS HAROLD: None at all.

SCULLY: No recent complaints or strange behavior?

JESS HAROLD: Paula has always been one of our best employees -- stable, well-liked... I can't even begin to imagine what brought this on.

MULDER: What about you, Dr. Randolph? Do you have any ideas?

JESS HAROLD: If you're done with me, I got work to do.

DR. RANDOLPH: Come by tomorrow. Let me make sure it's not infected.

JESS HAROLD: (tense, walks away) Sure.

DR. RANDOLPH: Uh, Paula came by last week complaining of persistent headaches. She'd suddenly started getting... irritable, unable to sleep.

SCULLY: Were you able to determine the cause?

DR. RANDOLPH: No. I'm just the staff physician. I don't usually treat anything more difficult than a hand injury. I'm out of my depth in psychiatric matters.

SCULLY: You didn't find anything physically wrong with her?

DR. RANDOLPH: I sent her to County for a brain scan and EEG. Both came back normal so I just assumed her condition was stress-related.

SCULLY: Could it have been line hypnosis?

DR. RANDOLPH: Like I said, I'm not qualified to make that diagnosis.

MULDER: But you can tell us whether George Kearns came to you with any similar complaints.

DR. RANDOLPH: They presented similar symptoms, yeah.

SCULLY: How did you treat them?

DR. RANDOLPH: I treated them both with pain medication-- codeine.

SCULLY: Well, I think an autopsy on Paula Gray would clarify things.

DR. RANDOLPH: I'm afraid I can't authorize that. You'd have to speak with Mr. Chaco.

SCULLY: Why? You're a physician.

DR. RANDOLPH: Yeah, but Mr. Chaco was Paula Gray's grandfather and her legal guardian.



SCENE 7
CHACO RESIDENCE

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up to elegant old southern home. They go to the door and ring the bell. The HOUSEKEEPER leads them out back to where CHACO, 60s, is hand feeding some pet chickens who are in a small outdoor pen.)

MULDER: Mr. Chaco?

CHACO: (not looking at them) Feeding these chickens helps me clear my mind. They're perfect creatures, you know. We eat their meat, their eggs. We sleep on pillows stuffed with their feathers. Not many people I know are as useful as these chickens.

(MULDER and SCULLY are uncomfortable.)

SCULLY: Were sorry to disturb you, sir. We realize this is a difficult time for you.

CHACO: You want to conduct an autopsy on my granddaughter. Why? You think Paula had some kind of disease that made her act that way?

SCULLY: That's what we're hoping a postmortem will determine.

CHACO: Thought your business here was George Kearns' disappearance.

MULDER: It is, but we suspect that might have something to do with what happened to your granddaughter.

CHACO: How?

MULDER: Were not sure yet, but it's possible they may have both suffered from the same neurological disorder.

CHACO: You know, when I came here after the war, Dudley was just a patch of dirt. I built that plant and put my whole family to work there. We made this town one of the biggest chicken processors in the nation. We couldn't have done that with troublemakers and layabouts.

SCULLY: I assume youre talking about George Kearns.

CHACO: Men like George Kearns don't build things. They tend to tear them down.

SCULLY: Then you're aware of his recommendation to close down your plant?

CHACO: You know, living a long life is a mixed blessing. You spend your youth trying to build something for yourself and your family and your community only to watch it all taken away from you at your old age. Still... I'm not ready to die just yet. (smiles) You go do your autopsy on Paula. I want to know what happened to my granddaughter.

(As CHACO enters his house alone, MULDER and SCULLY share a look.)



SCENE 8
SETH COUNT MORGUE

(SCULLY is looking at tissue in a microscope in autopsy lab. MULDER enters.)

SCULLY: I think weve got something here, Mulder. Take a look at this.

MULDER: (looking in microscope) What am I looking at?

SCULLY: It's a specimen from Paula Gray's brain. She suffered from a rare degenerative disorder called Creutzfeldt- Jacob disease. It's characterized by the formation of spongelike holes in the brain tissue.

MULDER: Why didn't this show up on any of her charts?

SCULLY: Short of an autopsy it's very difficult to diagnose. Outside of a textbook Ive only seen infected tissue once and that was back in medical school.

MULDER: Could this be the reason she attacked Jess Harold?

SCULLY: Absolutely. Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jacob suffer from progressive dementia, severe seizures...

MULDER: Is it fatal?

SCULLY: This girl would have been dead in months.

MULDER: Except that Paula Gray was no girl. This is her personnel file, Scully. Check it out. It says here that Paula Gray was born in 1948, which means that this woman-- Chacos granddaughter-- was 47 years old.

SCULLY: Theres got to be some kind of a mistake.

MULDER: Let's find out. Her birth certificate should be on file at the Seth County courthouse. Who knows, Scully? This could be *even* more interesting than foxfire.

(MULDER leaves. SCULLY stares at PAULAs body for a moment.)



SCENE 9

(Later. MULDER and SCULLY driving along two lane road.)

SCULLY: The odds that Paula Gray and George Kearns had the same disease are practically nonexistent. Creutzfeldt-Jacob can be hereditary but it's not communicable. That two unrelated people in the same small town would contract the same rare disease is...

MULDER:A lot more likely than Paula Gray being three years shy of her 50th birthday.

(The chicken truck in the oncoming lane suddenly swerves in front of them.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look out!

(MULDER steers the car off the road and out of the way of the truck which crashes into the creek next to the road. MULDER and SCULLY get out and run to the truck. Chickens are squawking as the truck begins to sink into the reddish brown water.)

MULDER: Call an ambulance. Ill try to get the driver out.

SCULLY: (on phone) This is Federal Agent Scully. Id like to report an accident on Count A7



SCENE 10

(Later, crash scene. Tow truck is pulling the truck out of the creek.)

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Dr. Randolph. He said this driver had the same symptoms as Paula Gray and George Kearns.

MULDER: You're saying this is a third victim of Creutzfeldt-Jacob? You just got through telling me that two cases would be statistically impossible.

SCULLY: Well, they would be. (pause) I just came up with a sick theory, Mulder.

(MULDER pauses, then puts his hand on her shoulder and leads her to the side to speak privately.)

MULDER: Ooh, Im listening.

SCULLY: You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What if somebody put George Kearnss body in there? Creutzfeldt-Jacob is a prion disease which means it could have been passed on to the chickens and in turn anyone who consumed them.

MULDER: So anyone eating chickens out of Dudley would be at risk?

SCULLY: It's possible. You know, sometimes in England they'll incinerate cattle to keep them from passing mad cow disease on to people.

MULDER: Yeah, but chickens from Dudley are shipped all over the country. If what youre saying were true, we'd be seeing an epidemic not just a few local cases.

(SCULLY shrugs. MULDER looks again at the red water in the creek.)

MULDER: Sheriff Arens? What's wrong with this water?

SHERIFF ARENS: Runoff from the plant. Chicken litter, mostly. Some blood and parts from the birds.

MULDER: Was this river searched after George Kearns disappeared?

SHERIFF ARENS: Talk about a needle in a haystack.

MULDER: Well, Id like it dragged as soon as possible.

SHERIFF ARENS: (surprised) Why would you want to do that?

MULDER: To see what's in there.

SHERIFF ARENS: Well, listen, that's a filthy job and I don't particularly want to do it unless I know what it is you're looking for.

MULDER: Hopefully nothing.

(SHERIFF ARENS says nothing.)

MULDER: Look, Sheriff Arens, if you don't want to do it I can get some of my men down here to do it.

SHERIFF ARENS: (big grin, all accommodating good old boy) I'll do it. (leaves)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Oh, it's just a hunch. If George Kearns didnt run off, if he was murdered for that inspection report then his body's got to be somewhere.



SCENE 11

(Later that evening, still by the bloody creek which is being dragged. SHERIFF ARENS quickly comes over to MULDER and SCULLY.)

SHERIFF ARENS: We closed the spillway, and the water level dropped. They came up with it almost immediately.

MULDER: Did you find Kearns?

SHERIFF ARENS: Maybe you better see for yourself.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at net filled with bones, then at each other.)



SCENE 12

(Next morning. SCULLY is sorting bones in a large room. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Sheriff Arens is outside. They're still pulling bones from the river.

SCULLY: Well, so far Ive been able to isolate nine distinct skeletons. This one belonged to the late George Kearns.

MULDER: How do you know?

SCULLY: The pin in his femur. According to his medical file, Kearns broke his right leg four years ago.

MULDER: What about the others?

SCULLY: Well. I'll need more sophisticated equipment to be certain, but I estimate that some of these bones are as much as 20 or 30 years old. All of them share one strange detail, though.

MULDER: Well, they seem to have lost their heads.

SCULLY: Well, besides that. The older bones show signs of decay and surface abrasion just like you'd expect but for some reason all of them, even Kearnss, are smooth and buffed at the ends.

MULDER: (looking) Its almost like theyve been polished.

SCULLY: It could be from erosion from the water, but...

MULDER: No. That water had hardly any current and this level of erosion wouldn't be confined to just the ends of the bones.

SCULLY: Any theories?

MULDER: Maybe.

(MULDER pulls out his phone and begins dialing.)



SCENE 13

(DORIS comes down the hall where the SHERIFF ARENS is getting some coffee.)

DORIS: Sheriff Arens?

SHERIFF ARENS: Doris.

DORIS: Is it true? Just tell me.

SHERIFF ARENS: Doris, I want you to listen to me.

DORIS: They found him, didn't they? (begins crying)

SHERIFF ARENS: Well, we brought up quite a few remains at the river this afternoon and Georges were among them. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

DORIS: No... No!

(DORIS runs crying hysterically down the hall.)

SHERIFF ARENS: (calling after her) Its gonna be all right. Dont worry, Doris. Well take care of you. Doris? Doris!



SCENE 14

(Chicken plant. JESS HAROLD takes clipboard from a WORKER.)

JESS HAROLD: That the new schedule?

(He sees DR. RANDOLPH across the room and goes to speak privately with him in a room with live chickens. DR. RANDOLPH is very nervous.)

JESS HAROLD: Why do I get the feeling you're not here to check up on my neck?

DR. RANDOLPH: They found bones in the river.

JESS HAROLD: I know. I heard.

DR. RANDOLPH: Did you also hear that Clayton Walsh came down with the symptoms? That's four. It's getting worse with every day that goes by.

JESS HAROLD: Someone has to tell Mr. Chaco.

DR. RANDOLPH: He knows whats happening. Hes just not doing anything about it.

JESS HAROLD: Maybe I should talk to him.

DR. RANDOLPH: You can try.

JESS HAROLD: I will talk to him. He'll listen to me.

DR. RANDOLPH: And if he doesn't?



SCENE 15

(MULDER in the room with the bones looking at some files. SCULLY enters holding a bucket of chicken.)

MULDER: I had Danny run a check on all missing persons last seen within a 200- mile radius of Dudley. In the last 50 years, 87 people have disappeared near here and, judging from the forensic evidence, Id say the same person or persons was responsible.

SCULLY: Then it may have been the work of some kind of a cult.

MULDER: Scully, I think the good people of Dudley have been eating more than just chicken.

SCULLY: You think these people were eaten?

MULDER: Look at these bones. They've been polished at both ends suggesting they were boiled in a pot. Anthropologists have used similar evidence to prove cannibalism among the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico.

SCULLY: Well, then Paula Gray may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jacob by eating George Kearns.

MULDER: That could begin to explain her youthful appearance.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: Some cannibalistic rituals are enacted with a belief that they can prolong life.

SCULLY: Cannibalism is one thing but increasing longevity by eating human flesh...

MULDER: Think about it, Scully. From vampirism to Catholicism, whether literally or symbolically, the reward for eating flesh is eternal life. I dont claim to know how it works, but we both saw Paula Gray.

SCULLY: We never confirmed the date of birth on her personnel file.

MULDER: The records at the courthouse should tell us how old she really is and if anybody else in Dudley is lying about their age. (at door) You coming?

(MULDER exits. SCULLY looks at the bones on the floor, then sets the bucket of chicken down and follows him.)



SCENE 16

(Chaco residence, night. JESS HAROLD is with CHACO.)

JESS HAROLD: Youve got to do something about whats happening, Mr. Chaco. People are getting scared. They don't know what to make of things.

CHACO: They're losing their faith is what it sounds like.

JESS HAROLD: It's getting hard to hold on to the way things are going. Three more have gotten sick since yesterday.

CHACO: I lost my granddaughter in this, Jess, so don't tell me what we're up against. Now, I said Ill handle it.

JESS HAROLD: I know you did ....

(Door bell rings. HOUSEKEEPER answers it. DORIS enters in tears.)

DORIS: I need to see Mr. Chaco.

CHACO: Doris?

DORIS: I... I can't do this anymore, Mr. Chaco. I can't keep lying.

CHACO: (comforting) It's all right. Jess told me what happened. You have nothing to worry about.

DORIS: They're gonna think I did it.

CHACO: No. They won't think any such thing.

DORIS: But I did. I helped!

CHACO: No. He was no good, Doris. He had no values. He didn't fit in here.

DORIS: But he was my husband.

CHACO: That was a price you had to pay. Now, you knew that from the beginning.

DORIS: But those FBI agents...

CHACO: Ah-ah. This town wasn't built in a day. It's not about to fall apart in a day. You're a part of us now and we're going to take good care of you. Now I want you to go home, get some rest. You've got a funeral to go to. This whole thing will blow over soon enough and you'll wonder what all the fuss is about.

DORIS: Im sorry.

CHACO: That's all right. We all understand, Doris. Good night.

(DORIS leaves not crying anymore, but still upset. Smiles weakly over her shoulder as she goes out the door.)

CHACO: She'll be fine.

JESS HAROLD: She's not stable.

CHACO: She's one of us now, part of our town.

JESS HAROLD: Unless we do something about her there won't be any town left to speak of.

CHACO: No! No. Once we start turning on ourselves we're no better than the animals. It's the FBI we should be worried about. They're the real problem.



SCENE 17
SETH COUNTY COURTHOUSE

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY pick the lock on the Birth Registry office and enter with flashlights. All the file cabinets are burned.)

MULDER: Someones been playing with matches.

SCULLY: Smells like a recent fire.

MULDER: I bet its no coincidence it only hit the birth records.

(Shadow of someone passes outside door window.)

SCULLY: You think someone was expecting us?

(MULDERs phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

DORIS: (on phone, in her dark house) Its Doris Kearns. Im in my house. I need to speak with you right away.

MULDER: (on phone) Are you all right?

DORIS: (on phone) I'm afraid for my life. Im afraid hell kill me.

MULDER: (on phone) Who?

DORIS: (on phone) Mr. Chaco.

MULDER: (on phone) All right, Mrs. Kearns, I want you to stay in the house and lock the door and dont answer the door until Agent Scully gets there. (hangs up)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To take Chaco into custody.

(Crying hysterically, DORIS walks through the dark house locking the doors. Lights go out. She comes face to face with the masked figure with the axe from the beginning. He raises the axe above her head and she screams.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY drives up to the KEARNS house and goes to the door and rings bell.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Kearns?! Mrs. Kearns?!

(No lights. She goes in the back door and begins walking through the house with her flashlight. No one responds.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Kearns?

(She gasps as door slams shut behind her, then keeps walking through house.)

CUT TO:

(CHACO residence. MULDER rings the bell and shows his badge as the HOUSEKEEPER answers.)

MULDER: Is Mr. Chaco in?

HOUSEKEEPER: (with attitude) I'll see if he's still awake.

(She goes upstairs. MULDER looks around at the primitive art, figurines, and masks decorating the Chaco house. Sees old picture of CHACO standing with some island natives. Caption "JALE TRIBE, NEW GUINEA 1944." Looks over to large locked cabinet. HOUSEKEEPER comes back downstairs.)

HOUSEKEEPER: (smugly happy that she cant help) Im sorry, but Mr. Chaco is unable to see you now.

MULDER: Do you know what's in here?

HOUSEKEEPER: I wouldn't know.

MULDER: Can you open it?

HOUSEKEEPER: I don't have the key.

(MULDER looks around, then picks up small heavy statue and breaks the padlock off the cabinet.)

HOUSEKEEPER: What do you think you're doing?

(MULDER opens the cabinet and sees four human heads, including GEORGEs. MULDER looks up the stairs where HOUSEKEEPER has left again.)

CUT TO:

(KEARNS house. SCULLYs phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, Chacos not here.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, Mrs. Kearns is missing too, Mulder. I think someones been here. (we see shape of someone, CHACO in the house with her) The power was cut and the back door was wide open when I got here. But her car is still out back.

MULDER: (on phone) Chaco must have taken her.

(Hears sound of SCULLYs phone hitting the floor.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Scully? Scully! Scully! What happened? Scully! Are you there?

(SCULLY lies on the floor, knocked out.)

MULDER: (on phone) Are you all right? Answer me! SCULLY!!

(MULDER looks up at the heads in the cabinet.)



SCENE 19

(Night. Middle of a field. Townspeople are milling around a large bonfire and getting soup from a large pot. CHACO, angry, walks into the group with SCULLY who has her hands tied in front and gaffers tape over her mouth. She looks frightened, is unresisting.)

CHACO: What have you done here? I warned you. I said not to touch her. Doris Kearns was one of us.! Who's behind this?

(JESS HAROLD walks up to CHACO wiping his lips.)

CHACO: Why didn't you listen to me? It's the outsiders we have to deal with, not one of our own.

JESS HAROLD: (calmly) We'll deal with them all.

CHACO: Look at yourselves. Look at what you've become. This isn't faith anymore it's just fear. They've turned us into an abomination.

JESS HAROLD: You brought in the outsider who made us sick.

CHACO: Once you turn on yourselves it's over. How long before it's any one of us? Any one of you?

JESS HAROLD: That's not your problem anymore, Mr. Chaco.

CHACO: (aims gun at JESS HAROLD) No.

(Someone grabs CHACO from behind. JESS HAROLD takes the gun away.)

CHACO: (quietly) Kill me... And you kill us all.

(CHACO is forced to kneel down and place his head in a metal harness which two other townspeople lock, then step back. SCULLY watches in horror as the MASKED MAN raises the axe over CHACOs head and swings.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER driving very fast.)

CUT TO:

(Bonfire.)

JESS HAROLD: Bring her over.

(They make SCULLY kneel down and lock her head into the harness.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER driving into the field.)

CUT TO:

(MASKED MAN raising his axe over SCULLY. SCULLYs eyes are wide and terrified.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER running out of the car toward the bonfire, his gun out.)

CUT TO:

(Bonfire. As MASKED MAN brings the axe down over SCULLY there are gunshots and he falls dead. Townspeople begin running and screaming. JESS HAROLD aims the gun, but then gets trampled by the other townspeople. MULDER runs to SCULLY and releases her from the harness.)

MULDER: (softly) Are you hurt?

SCULLY: Mm-Mm.

(He pulls the tape off her mouth and gently brushes her hair out of her face.)

MULDER: You all right?

(She nods. Hands still bound, she follows MULDER as he goes to the dead MASKED MAN and removes his mask. It is SHERIFF ARENS.)



SCENE 20

(Next day. Chicken plant. Business as usual, then state police come in and begin putting crime scene tape up and telling everyone to step away from their stations.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Pending further review, the Chaco processing plant has been closed by the USDA. So far, no evidence of contaminated chicken has been discovered. Though it remains unknown how many citizens participated in the ritual activity, 27 have become fatally ill with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. What is known is that a transport plane carrying Walter Chaco was shot down in 1944 over New Guinea. Chaco was the only survivor of that crash. According to naval records, he spent six months with the Jole -- a tribe whose cannibalistic practices have long been suspected but never proven. Naval records also show that Walter Chaco was born in 1902 making him 93 years old at the time of his death. As of this date, his remains still have not been found.

(Worker finds some grey hair in a bucket of the chicken feed and proceeds to feed the mix to some chickens who eagerly gobble it up.)

ITALIAN OFFICIAL: Who would do such a thing ( he picks up the phone )

ANTONIO: I don't know.

JAPANESE OFFICIAL: ( Answer a ringing phone ) from where did you hear this.? Has everyone been told.?

GERMAN OFFICIAL: ( On the phone ) yes, I understand. No this is their problem. They must take care of it promptly. ( He hangs up and calls Cancerman ).

CANCERMAN: ( He answers the phone ) yes.

GERMAN OFFICIAL: You are familiar with the MJ file.?

CANCERMAN: Ja. I have already taken care of it.

MULDER: What are you guys doing here.?

BYERS: Can we talk inside.?

MULDER: I'm not feeling well. I didn't sleep last night. I'm really not in the mood for the three stooges.

FROHIKE: I don't think we've been followed.

MULDER: Who would follow you.?

BYERS: Multinational black opps unit. Code name Garnett.

LANGLY: Trained killers. School of the American Alumni.

MULDER: Have you boys been defacing library books again.?

FROHIKE: They don't want us. They want him.

MULDER: Kennith Suna.

LANGLY: We think that's his real name.

BYERS: You've heard us refer to him as The Thinker.

MULDER: What did he do.?

BYRES: Hacked into the defense department computer system.

MULDER: ( Paying attention ) What.?

BYERS: The Thinker's an anarchist and a snoop. Whatever he got into has made him a very wanted man. Customs and immigration are on full alert. Every port of igress is closed.

MULDER: What are you coming to me for.?

BYERS: In his last communique, The Thinker named a meeting place and a three hour time window. He asked specifically for you.

LANGLY: The only problem is he may already be dead.

(A gun shot is heard. They all rush out of Mulders appartment to find people standing outside of another appartment)

MULDER: What happened.?

WOMAN: She just shot her husband. They'd been married for thirty years. It's like she went crazy.

(Mulder sits down until The Thinker walks toward him)

THE THINKER: I... I don't want you to know my real name. I... I just don't think it's that important that you know.

MULDER: Sounds like a line I used in a bar once.

THE THINKER: Look, I'm sorry about the wait but I kinda got this ninja party shaking my butt.

MULDER: Why.? What've you got.?

THE THINKER: Well if I'm correct I got the original defense departments UFO intelligence files. Everything from the 1940's and up.

MULDER: Everything.?

THE THINKER: Everything. Roswell, MJ12 and beyond.

MULDER: You've read them.?

THE THINKER: Not entirely. I downloaded all I could and then I split. I mean, I knew that these guys would be after me.

MULDER: What makes you think they know who you are.?

THE THINKER: I didn't take any procautions. I mean I... I did'nt even expect to get inside. ( He gives Mulder a package ).

MULDER: You know they always denied that these files even existed. What do you want from me.?

THE THINKER: I want the truth. And I want you to promise that those rat bastards answer to the people.

(Mulder looks at the tape and puts it in his computer. Scully walks in)

SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner's looking for you.

MULDER: Come in and lock the door.

SCULLY: Why, what's going on.?

MULDER: Are you familiar with the ten commandments Scully.?

SCULLY: You want me to recite them.?

MULDER: No. Just number 4, the one about obeying the sabbath, the part about where God made Heaven and Earth but didn't bother to tell anybody about his side projects.

SCULLY: What are you talking about.?

MULDER: The biggest lie of all.

(The screen shows Department Of Defense. Top Secret.)

SCULLY: What is this.?

MULDER: The Holy Grail. The original defense department files. Hard evidence that the government has known about the existance of extraterrestrials for over fifty years.

SCULLY: Where did you get this.?

MULDER: Your friendly neighborhood anarchist.

(The screen shows a strange code)

MULDER: I dont believe this. This is just gibberish.
( He stands up and hits a pencil holder ).
Damn it. I'm so sick of this crap, BS and double talk. I can't believe this.

SCULLY: Mulder, this may not be gibberish.

MULDER: It's a joke Scully, it's a bad joke.

SCULLY: I think it's just encrypted and I think I recognise it. It looks like Navajo. It was used in world war two. My father told me it was the only code the Japanese couldn't break, I... I remember the long strings of consonants.

MULDER: Well can you find out.?

SCULLY: Well only a handful of people can decipher it.

MULDER: Then find one of em. ( He goes to walk out )

SCULLY: Mulder. Are you okay.?

MULDER: Yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.

(Skinner is walking out of his office)

MULDER: Sir.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder. I need to speak with you.

MULDER: About.?

SKINNER: In my office.

MULDER: Why.? Is this another jerk off assignment where I end up doing the government's dirty work.?

SKINNER: It's about a rumor that you may be in reciept of some sensitive files.

MULDER: I don't know anything about that. ( He turns around ).

SKINNER: Agent Mulder listen... I'm talking to you...

(Skinner grabs Mulders shoulder and Mulder punches Skinner)

SKINNER: Are we done. We're done.



SCENE 7
APRIL 13

(Scully walks into a room with Skinner and other FBI directors)

DIRECTOR 1: Agent Scully, you heard about the incident here, in the hallway yesterday.

SCULLY: Yes sir.

DIRECTOR 1: Do you have any explanation as to agent Mulder's, bizarre behavior.?

SCULLY: No sir. Agent Mulder told me he was having trouble sleeping.

DIRECTOR 1: Do you think agent Mulder confides in you agent Scully?

SCULLY: Of course, he's my partner.

DIRECTOR 2: Your partner. Were'nt you originally assigned to agent Mulder to debunk his work.?

SCULLY: Yes sir. A year and a half ago. I've been writing regular reports stating the validity of agent Mulder's work on The X-Files.

DIRECTOR 2: Would you lie to protect him.?

SCULLY: Am I accused of lying.?

DIRECTOR 3: Agent Mulder has been advised of a disciplinary hearing. If there's something we learn at that meeting that you haven't stated today, you could be subject to the same summary action.

SCULLY: What action is that.?

SKINNER: Dismissal without chance of reinstatement.

SCULLY: Is that all sir.?

SKINNER: Yes agent Scully, thank you.



SCENE 8

MARTHA'S VINEYARD, MA

(The door bell rings. Bill Mulder answers the door - It's Cancerman)

CANCERMAN: Hello Bill.

BILL MULDER: What are you doing here.?

CANCERMAN: I've come on some pressing business.

BILL MULDER: We had agreed that you would never...

CANCERMAN: That was a long time ago Bill. There have been some unforseen events.

(Bill Mulder and Cancerman are sitting at a table)

BILL: No one was supposed to know.

CANCERMAN: Who could have predicted the future Bill? That the computers that you and I only dreamed of would someday be home appliances capable of the most technical espionage.

BILL MULDER: The files should have been destroyed.

CANCERMAN: They should have, but they were'nt. Regret is an inevitable consequence of life.

BILL MULDER: How do you know my son has them.?

CANCERMAN: The man who stole them has come forward.

BILL MULDER: Oh God.

CANCERMAN: As always we maintain plausible denial. The files are only as real as their possible authentication.

BILL MULDER: My name is in those files.

CANCERMAN: The files have been encrypted of course. We have a certain luxury of time. We endevored to prevent that fact from ever coming to light.

BILL MULDER: You wouldn't... harm him.?

CANCERMAN: I've protected him this long, haven't I.? Your son has been provident in the alliances that he's created. The last thing we need is a martyr in a crusade.

BILL MULDER: But if he should, learn of my involvement...

CANCERMAN: Your you're own man Bill. You always have been. But I strongly encourage you in that event, to deny everything. It's good to see you again Bill. You look well.

(Cancerman gets up and leaves)



SCENE 9
(Mulder is sleeping in his appartment - someone is walking toward him. He wakes up and reaches for his gun)

SCULLY: You didn't answer your door.

MULDER: Oh. I took a pill.

SCULLY: I couldn't find you at work. I was worried about you.

MULDER: I came home. I must be running a fever. Maybe it's the threat of being burnt at the stake.

SCULLY: They called me in today.

MULDER: What did you tell them.?

SCULLY: That nothing was wrong.

MULDER: Well you told them the truth then.

SCULLY: Mulder, you opened the door for them, they're just looking for a good reason now.

MULDER: Okay, I'll say I'm sorry.

SCULLY: Mulder, these files. Who knows you have them.?

MULDER: Why.?

SCULLY: Because I had to lie today. And I put my job in jeopardy in order to do so. If they find out about those files...

MULDER: How would they find out.?

SCULLY: Maybe they already know. The question is, is it worth it.? Is this cassette worth risking everything.?

MULDER: I'll tell you when I find out what's on it. Now just tell me who I can talk to about breaking that code.

SCULLY: I'm meeting with someone in an hour. I might know something later tonight, I just need some kind of assurance that they're not going to let us hang ourselves with this. That I'm doing the right thing.

MULDER: I'll try to find out.

(Mulder tapes an X to the window)

SCULLY: I need to know one more thing Mulder. Why did you attack Skinner.?

MULDER: I've thought of that Scully. I honestly can't say.

(Scully Leaves)



SCENE 10
OFFICES OF THE NAVAJO NATION
WASHINGTON, DC

NAVAJO WOMAN: This is all you have.?

SCULLY: Currently yes.

NAVAJO WOMAN: There are words I recognise but you'll need an actual code talker to make any sense of this. I know a man who might help. I could have him contact you.

SCULLY: Yeah, thank you... er... can you tell me which words you do recognise.?

NAVAJO WOMAN: This word, it means goods, merchandise. And this one means vaccination. They're both modern words which is why they stand out.

SCULLY: Thank you. You've been very helpful.

(The phone rings at Mulders appartment)

MULDER: Mulder.

BILL MULDER: Fox, this is your father, I need to see you right away.

MULDER: Where are you.

BILL MULDER: I'm at home. How soon can you be here.

(Mulder looks at the X on the window)

BILL MULDER: Fox, it's very important.

(Scully enters Mulders appartment)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(She walks to the window, a gun shot is fired and the bullet cuts Scully's head)



SCENE 11
BILL MULDER'S HOUSE

BILL MULDER: Fox.

MULDER: Dad. What is it.?

BILL MULDER: Come in. ( Locking the door ). It's... Its so clear now. Simple. It was so complicated then. The, the choices that needed to be made.

MULDER: What choices.? Dad.

BILL MULDER: You're a smart boy Fox. You're smarter than I ever was.

MULDER: About what.?

BILL MULDER: Your politics are yours, you've never thrown in. The minute you do that, their doctrines become yours and you can be held responsible.

MULDER: You're talking about your work in the state department.

BILL MULDER: You're going to learn of things... Fox, you're going to hear the words and they'll come to make sense to you.

MULDER: What words.?

BILL MULDER: The merchandise. Look I, I've been taking some medication. You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

(Bill goes to the bathroom and opens a medicine cabinet. From the reflection in the mirror, Krycek appears. A gun shot is heard and Mulder runs into the bathroom)

MULDER: Dad.? Dad. Dad ( He hears tires screech ). Oh dad.

BILL MULDER: Forgive me...

(Bill Mulder dies. Mulder carries him to the sofa and uses his cell phone)

SCULLY: Hello.

MULDER: My father's dead Scully.

SCULLY: Where are you.?

MULDER: They shot him and he's dead.

SCULLY: Mulder where are you.? Just tell me where you are.

MULDER: I'm on the Vineyard.

SCULLY: Who shot him Mulder.?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: Mulder, were you arguing.?

MULDER: I didn't do it Scully, he was trying to tell me something.

SCULLY: Mulder listen to me...

MULDER: You gotta believe me Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder I believe you, just listen to me, you've gotta get out of there, you have to leave immediately.

MULDER: I can't leave the crime scene, it'll look like I'm running, make me look guilty.

SCULLY: Mulder they're gonna suspect you anyway, you've got no ID on the shooter, you, your behavior has been irrational recently, Mulder can't you see that everything is pointing directly at you?

MULDER: He was shot with somebody else's weapon.

SCULLY: Damn it Mulder, you're an FBI agent, you have access to weapons other than your own.

MULDER: All right. Meet me back at my apartment.

SCULLY: No. No you can't come home. Someone shot through your window tonight, they almost killed me, they might be trying to kill you.



SCENE 12
(Scully opens the door to her apartment to a ragged looking Mulder, she helps him in)

SCULLY: Fox... My God. Look at you. You're sick.

MULDER: I'm okay.

SCULLY: No come on, I want you to lie down on, woah, come on I want you to lie down, let me take your coat off.

MULDER: You gotta find them Scully.

SCULLY: Right now you have to lie down. Come here.

MULDER: We gotta find out who killed my father.

SCULLY: Well right now you need to rest okay, rest. It's okay. Okay.

(A guy is firing bullets into a tank)

FBI GUY: I'll run a comparison as soon as they send me the bullet removed from the victim.

SCULLY: How long will it take to determine if there a match.?

FBI GUY: There both 9mm rounds. Run the specs compare the stray. We should know pretty much right away.

(Mulder phones Scully)

MULDER: You took my gun. You think I did it don't you.?

SCULLY: I took your gun to run it through ballistics to try and clear you Mulder.

MULDER: Well why didn't you ask me.?

SCULLY: You had a temperature of 102 last night I didn't want to wake you.

MULDER: What were you afraid that I was gonna shoot you too.?

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm being called into Skinners office this afternoon, they're gonna want answers and I'd like some good ones to give them.

MULDER: So you can clear your conscience and your name?! You've been making reports on me since the beginning Scully, taking your little notes!

SCULLY: Mulder you're sick, you're not thinking straight, I'm on your side. You know that.

MULDER: Look you have my files and you have my gun. Don't ask me for my trust.

SCULLY: Mul...



SCENE 15
(Mulder hangs up. Scully goes to Mulders apartment to get the bullet out of wall and sees an unmaked truck through the window. She goes into the basement and looks at the water supply units. On one of the tanks is a filter. She removes the filter. Outside, Mulder gets out of a cab and sees someone go around the side of the building. He runs through the building to the other side. Mulder grabs the person as he walks around the corner, and then punches him - it's Krycek)

MULDER: I'm gonna kill you anyway Krycek so you may as well tell me the truth. Did you kill my father.? Did you kill him... answer me. ( Mulder punches him ).

SCULLY: Mulder, don't shoot him. Just back away.

(Scully points a gun at Mulder)

MULDER: He killed my father Scully.

SCULLY: I have him Mulder.

MULDER: No Scully...

(Scully shoots Mulder, Krycek runs off)

WOMAN'S VOICE: Oh my God. Somebody call the police.



SCENE 16
APRIL 16

(Mulder is in a room)

ALBERT: He's awake.

SCULLY: Mulder, Mulder it's me. Here drink some of that, you haven't had any water in over 36 hours. Your shoulder's going to be fine. The round went through nice and clean.

MULDER: You shot me.

SCULLY: Yes, I did. You didn't give me much choice, you were going to shoot Krycek.

MULDER: Why'd you shoot me? He's the one.

SCULLY: If he is, then his weapon is probably the same one that killed your father.

MULDER: What are you talking about.?

SCULLY: If you killed Krycek with that weapon there would have been no way to prove that you didn't kill your father. I'm sorry about your father Mulder, I haven't been able to tell you.

MULDER: How'd you know it was Krycek.?

SCULLY: I didn't. I went back to your apartment to pull the slug from the wall, but I noticed an unmarked van delivering soft water and I found this in one of the tanks servicing your building.

MULDER: What is it.?

SCULLY: It's a dyalysis filter. It's a device used in the transmission of substance to solution, considering the level of psychosis you were experiencing, it was probably LSD, amphetamines of some kind of exotic dopamine agonist.

MULDER: Oh my God. There was a murder in my building.

SCULLY: Well it wasn't an excercise in subtlety. Mulder these men are quite possibly the same ones who killed your father and who systematically tried to destroy you by turning everyone you could trust against you. I don't think I have to tell you why.

MULDER: I'd gotten too close to the truth. Where are we.?

SCULLY: We're in Farmington New Mexico.

MULDER: New Mexico.?

SCULLY: We've just driven two days across country, I had to put you out to let the side effects of the psychosis abait. This is Albert Hosteen, he's been translating your files.

ALBERT: You're lucky she's a good shot.

MULDER: Or a bad one.

SCULLY: Albert was a Navajo code talker during world war two. He helped encode the original government documents.

MULDER: How'd you find him.?

SCULLY: Through a woman in Washington. But he claims he knew you were coming.

ALBERT: Last week we had an omen.

SCULLY: Most of these files are written in jargon but apparently there was an international conspiracy of silence dating back to the 1940's. Albert says that evidence of these secrets are buried on a Navajo reservation not far from here. He says that he'll take you as soon as you are able.

(Mulder gets up)

MULDER: What about you.?

SCULLY: I'm afraid you're on your own with this. I didn't show up for a meeting with Skinner the day before yesterday and I don't know what the repercussions will be.

MULDER: You've taken a big risk.

SCULLY: I was certain they would have killed you Mulder.

MULDER: Thank you. Thank you for taking care of me.

SCULLY: There's something else. My name is in those files. It appears in the latest entries with Duane Barry's.

MULDER: In what context.?

SCULLY: It's not clear, but it has something to do with a test. I want you to find out Mulder. I need you to.



SCENE 17
NAVAJO NATION
NATIONAL RESERVATION

(Mulder and Albert are in a car)

MULDER: You said you knew I was coming.

ALBERT: In the desert, things find a way to survive. Secrets are like this too. They push their way up through the sands of deception so that men can know them. Here, this is my house.

MULDER: But why me.?

ALBERT: You are prepared to accept the truth aren't you, to sacrifice yourself to it.

MULDER: I don't understand.

ALBERT: There was a tribe of indians who lived here more than 600 years ago. Their name was Anasazi, it means ancient aliens. No evidence of their fate exists. Historians say they disappeared without a trace. They say that because they will not sacrifice themselves to the truth.

MULDER: And what is the truth.?

ALBERT: Nothing disappears without a trace.

MULDER: You think they were abducted.

ALBERT: By visitors who come here still.

(Albert gets out of the car, Mulder follows him)

MULDER: What's buried out there.?

ALBERT: Lies. You will see for yourself.

(Mulder gets on the back of Eric's bike)

ERIC: It's through these rocks. It's down there.

(Mulder climbs down the rockface and his cell phone rings)

MULDER: Mulder.

CANCERMAN: You're a hard man to reach.

MULDER: Not hard enough apparently.

CANCERMAN: Where are you.?

MULDER: I'm at the Betty Ford center, where are you.?

CANCERMAN: I need to talk to you Mr Mulder, in person. There are some things to explain.

MULDER: I'll save the government the plane fare, I just need to know which government that is.

CANCERMAN: Your father may have told you things Mr Mulder. I should warn against taking those things at face value.

MULDER: Yeah, which things are those.?

CANCERMAN: He was never an opponent of the project. In fact he authorised it. That's what he couldn't live with.

MULDER: No, he couldn't live with it because you had him killed.

CANCERMAN: We weren't involved in that.

MULDER: Now listen to me you black lunged son of a bitch, I'm gonna expose you and your project, your time is over.

CANCERMAN: Expose anything and you only expose your father...

(Mulder hangs up - Cancerman gets out of a car and climbs into a helicopter)

BLACK OPPS GUY 1: Sir, we got a co-ordinate on F were ready to go.

CANCERMAN: Let's go.

BLACK OPPS GUT 2: Need a cigarette.?

(The helicopter takes off. Back at the reservation Mulder uncovers a plaque in the dirt which reads Sierra Pacific Railroad RTC - 567 480 >

ERIC: Over here.

MULDER: This is a boxcar.

(Mulder and Eric open the hatch into the boxcar)

ERIC: Refrigeration car.

(Scully's cell phone rings)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: Yeah, it's me.

SCULLY: Where are you.?

MULDER: Nowhere I ever expected.

SCULLY: What do you mean.?

MULDER: I'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry. There are bodies everywhere.

SCULLY: Bodies.?

MULDER: Stacked floor to ceiling.

SCULLY: What happened to them.?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: Mulder, in these files I found references to experiments that were conducted here in the US by Axis Power scientists who were given amnesty after the war.

MULDER: What kind of experiments.?

SCULLY: Some kind of tests, on humans. What they referred to as merchandise.

MULDER: But these aren't human Scully. From the look of it I'd say they were alien.

SCULLY: Are you sure.?

MULDER: I'm pretty damn sure. Wait a sec...

(Mulder looks at the arm of one of the 'merchandise')

MULDER: This one... has a smallpox vacination scar.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Oh my God Scully, what have they done.?

(The hatch closes. A helicpoter lands and black opps military rush out)

BLACK OPPS GUY 1:Move out, get away from there, keep him back. Cover us were going in. Go.

CANCERMAN: What's your name boy.?

BLACK OPPS GUY 1:He's not here.

CANCERMAN: Where's Mulder. He's here.

BLACK OPPS GUY 1: No sir, if he was, he's vanished without a trace.

CANCERMAN: Nothing vanishes without a trace. Burn it.

(An incendry device is thrown into the boxcar. It explodes and flames fly from the open hatch. Cancerman and the black opps militay climb back into the helicopter and leave)

                                           THE BLESSING WAY


SCENE 1
NAVAJO RESERVATION; TWO GREY HILLS, NEW MEXICO

(Flames pour out of the hole of the boxcar. Albert Hosteen speaks over the scene.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: There is an ancient Indian saying that something lives only as long as the last person who remembers it. My people have come to trust memory over history. Memory, like fire, is radiant and immutable while history serves only those who seek to control it, those who douse the flame of memory in order to put out the dangerous fire of truth. Beware these men for they are dangerous themselves and unwise. Their false history is written in the blood of those who might remember and of those who seek the truth.



SCENE 2
ALBERT HOSTEEN'S HOUSE

(Albert is on the phone standing next to his son when troops burst into his house carrying guns.)

SOLDIER #1: Go!

SOLDIER #2: Get down, get down!

SOLDIER #1: Come on!

(He smashes Albert's son in the face with the butt of his assault rifle. The son groans and falls.

On your knees. Hands behind your head.

(Albert kneels down. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks in, dragging Eric behind him.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I want to know where Mulder is!

ALBERT HOSTEEN: I don't know.

(He throws Eric back against the wall. Eric's face is bloodied and bruised.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: His car's parked outside! He was here! I want Mulder and I want those files!

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You will find nothing here.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man motions to an officer and starts out. Albert looks up to see the butt of the assault rifle crashing down on him. Later, Scully pulls up to the house. She runs inside to find the room in shambles. Albert's son is tending to a wound on Albert's face.)

SCULLY: What happened?

HOSTEEN: There were men.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: They were looking for your partner.

SCULLY: Where is he?

(Albert shakes his head. Eric walks out, his face looking horrible. Scully has a look of sadness on her face. She runs down to the boxcar to find smoke still pouring out of the opening. She looks around.)

Mulder!

(Seeing no one, she looks ready to cry.)

SCENE 3
NAVAJO RESERVATION; NORTHWEST OF LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO

(Scully is driving along when a bright light approaches from behind her. A helicopter circles in front of her and flies along beside her, shining the searchlight in her face. Scully stops the car, unable to see. The helicopter lands and three troopers get out. One points her gun at Scully while another opens the door and pulls her out.)

MALE TROOPER: Out of the car! Come on! Hands on top, spread your legs!

(He forces her to do so while a female trooper gets in the car. She looks back at him while he frisks her.)

SCULLY: Where's Agent Mulder?

MALE TROOPER: Turn and face away!

(He takes her gun.)

Where are the files?

SCULLY: In the trunk.

(He motions to the female trooper, who gets out of the car and goes to the trunk. She opens her bag and finds a file but no tape. She shakes her head and puts the file in her jacket.)

MALE TROOPER: We need the DAT copy.

SCULLY: I don't have it!

MALE TROOPER: Who has it?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder.

(He motions to the female and the troopers run back to the helicopter.)

MALE TROOPER: Let's go!

(The troops file back in and the helicopter takes off.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner sits at his desk. Scully is sitting in front of the desk, facing the other way. Two officials, a man and a woman, are seated on either side of her while another, the man who commonly asks questions to Mulder at such meetings, walks in front of her, reading from a file.)

MAN: It is the recommendation of the office of professional conduct that Special Agent Dana Scully be given a mandatory leave of absence until the full detail of her misconduct can be calculated. This summary action is justified under the O.P.C. articles of review and Agent Scully will complete her suspension of duty without pay or benefits, due to the nature of her insubordination and the direct disobedience of her superior agents. We will have to ask that you check your weapon and your badge before you leave the building, Agent Scully.

(She slowly gets up and puts her badge and gun down on the counter.)

SKINNER: We would also ask that you make yourself available to answer further questions in our investigation into Agent Mulder's whereabouts.

SCULLY: I've told you everything I know. To the best of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is dead.

SKINNER: Don't think this hasn't been difficult for everyone.

(She stares at him in anger then leaves. She passes the secretary and is about to open the door out when Skinner steps out of his office.)

Agent Scully?

(She walks back to him angrily.)

SCULLY: Who are these people?

(He looks at the slightly ajar door, then turns back to her.)

SKINNER: These people are doing their job.

SCULLY: What they're doing is putting an official stamp on the perpetuation of a lie.

SKINNER: These people have a protocol to follow, which is something you and Agent Mulder did not do.

SCULLY: What about the people who were poisoning Agent Mulder's water? Whose protocol was that?

SKINNER: The investigation will...

SCULLY: The investigation will be an exercise! The men who killed Agent Mulder, the people who killed his father, they aren't meant to be found.

SKINNER: We will find them.

SCULLY: With all due respect, sir, I think you overestimate your position in the chain of command.

(She walks out. She walks into the X-Files office, checking behind her, and opens up the drawer in Mulder's desk. She reaches up to the roof of it and pulls off a bag masking taped to the top with the DAT tape case in it. The case itself is empty.)



SCENE 5
46th STREET; NEW YORK CITY

(In a tall skyscraper, a dark meeting takes place.)

1ST ELDER: Where were the safeguards against this? These files were never meant to be seen.

2ND ELDER: Forty years of work... the damage could be incalculable.

3RD ELDER: The damage is done.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man steps out from behind the leader of this small organization, the Well-Manicured Man. He is smoking as usual.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Gentlemen... we have control. The files have been recovered and the men involved in their theft have been removed without incident. There is a small matter of concern with the F.B.I. but we'll handle that internally as usual. The media attention will amount to nothing more than a few, uh, scattered obituaries.

1ST ELDER: The Mulder problem...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man pauses, thinking, then looks at him.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Special Agent Mulder is dead. His body will not be recovered. He will officially be listed as missing until the matter can be resolved quietly.

1ST ELDER: And we've recovered the copy of the stolen computer files?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yes.

1ST ELDER: Then all the pertinent parties should be informed that we can continue with our work.

(The Well-Manicured Man sits in silence, thinking.)



SCENE 6
MARGARET SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Margaret opens the door to see her daughter standing there with no shoes.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana, wh...

SCULLY: Hi, mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: What did you do with your shoes?

SCULLY: They, uh, they started to give me blisters s, so...

MARGARET SCULLY: You walked here at this time of night?

(Dana starts to cry.)

SCULLY: Oh, mom...

(They hug.)

MARGARET SCULLY: What is it, Dana?

SCULLY: I've made a terrible mistake. Dad would be so ashamed of me.



SCENE 7
NAVAJO RESERVATION; TWO GREY HILLS, NEW MEXICO

(It is a bright and beautiful morning. Albert speaks over the various scenes.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: The men who had come and threatened us did not return to our house again but the following day...

(Eric opens the door to see two young boys standing there. They start talking. Albert and his son stand in the back.)

Some of the boys from the reservation came to tell us they had seen buzzards flying out near the quarry where Eric had first encountered the men.

(Buzzards fly high above the boxcar. Native Americans from the reservation, including the Hosteens, watch them circle.)

The buzzard is a large but cowardly bird. It does not work for its prey, letting others provide the kill. When I see them circling in the desert, this can only mean that something has died and they are going to pick its bones... or that death is close and they are waiting for it to do its work for them. We did not see what they saw but I remembered something I had seen as a younger man. Just as my grandson had done, I, too, had found a body at the quarry in a hole, half-buried under rocks, but the buzzards, who will eat anything, would not touch it. This spot is where we found what the buzzards had come for. We could not tell at first who or what it was but I knew what the buzzards knew... that the smell of death was upon it.

(Albert and his family walk over to a part of the quarry. They see a hand jutting out from between some rocks. They start to unbury the man. It is Mulder.)

The desert does not forgive man his weakness. Weak or strong, it takes no mercy and can kill a man in less than a day.

(Eric looks up at his grandfather, who says something in Navajo. Eric nods and he and his father start to take Mulder out.)

To survive, one must develop skin like leather, know where to find water and when to take shelter.

(Albert looks down into the hole and sees another hybrid jutting out from between the rocks. The Indians march back to camp, carrying Mulder with them. They walk into a small hut.)

The F.B.I. man would have surely died had he not stayed underground, protected like the jackrabbit or the fox. Even so, death was near. In accordance with our ancient traditions, we put for twigs on the beams of the hogan to summon the holy people and tell them that a ceremony will be held.

(Albert puts a twig on the beam and waves the others in. They carry Mulder with them. They lay him down on a bed of leaves.)

It is called "The Blessing Way" chant. Only the holy people can save the F.B.I. man's life now. He is in their hands.

(He says something in Navajo. Later, Albert lights a small bundle of twigs on fire, then starts lighting larger bundles. He waves the smoke around with beautiful feathers.)



SCENE 8
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully twists and turns in bed, unable to sleep. The doorbell rings twice. She turns on the lights and looks through the peephole. Perplexed, she unlocks her door and looks at Frohike.)

SCULLY: Frohike?

FROHIKE: I know it's late but I heard the news.

(She looks down at the bottle of wine in his hand.)

Maybe I should go. Pardon my presumptuousness.

SCULLY: How much have you had to drink?

(He holds up the near-empty bottle.)

FROHIKE: Do you recycle?

(She smiles. Afterwards, he sits at her table. She pours him a cup of coffee.)

He was a good friend. A redwood among sprouts.

(He takes a sip of his coffee as she pours herself a cup.)

I guess this means he's passing you the torch.

(She sits down and looks at him.)

SCULLY: Uh, I'm afraid not. I'm soon to be out of a job.

FROHIKE: Those sons of bitches. They're rigging the game.

SCULLY: And like rats, they just scatter back into the woodpile.

(She takes a sip as he pulls a newspaper article out of his jacket. He hands it to her. The headline reads: "Homicide Victim's Body Discovered at City Dump.")

FROHIKE: The rats that killed the cat.

SCULLY: What's this?

FROHIKE: A news item about Kenneth Soona, a.k.a. "The Thinker." The man who hacked the MJ files. The ones he gave to Mulder.

SCULLY: "Kenneth J. Soona was killed execution style in what appears to be a professional murder. His body found in the Trenton City landfill." What's the date on this?

(She scans down the page and comes across "The body was discovered April 16.")

This was the day before yesterday. This is after Mulder disappeared. Could they be so stupid?



SCENE 9
NAVAJO RESERVATION; TWO GREY HILLS, NEW MEXICO

ALBERT HOSTEEN: This healing ritual called "The Blessing Way" has been passed down by our ancient Navajo ancestors. Its songs and prayers must be followed just as they have been for centuries or the holy people will not be summoned.

(Lights shine out of the hogan. Inside, Albert, half-naked, traces a design on a cloth with sand.)

I watched my father perform the chants as a young boy and saw their healing magic.

(Men cover Mulder with branches.)

But my fear for the F.B.I. man was that his spirit did not want to be healed. That it wished to join the spirit of his own father who had died and did not want to return to the world of the living.

(Albert kneels over him with a feather and waves it in the air in a ritualistic manner. He then dips the end in a small black liquid and paints a small vertical dash above each of Mulder's eyebrows.)

His body has become tired and weak and it searches for rest.

(A drum starts beating. Albert begins chanting. The chanting fades away as Mulder floats on his makeshift bed between worlds, floating on the stars.)

If the struggle to continue is too hard or the wish to join his ancestors too strong, the body will give up but if the desire to resume life burns brightly enough, the holy people will be merciful.

(A congregation of people in shadows stand around Mulder and murmur.)

The days and nights now will be long and difficult for the F.B.I. man has the holy people come and help him to choose.

(One steps out towards him and stands over him. Deep Throat.)

DEEP THROAT: I was first struck by the absence of time, having depended on it so completely as a measure of myself and my life. Moving backwards into the perpetual night that consumes purpose and deed, all passion and will. I come to you, old friend, with the dull clarity of the dead not to beckon you but to feel the fire and intensity that still live in you... and the heavy weight of your burdens which I had once borne. There is truth here, old friend, if that's all you seek but there's no justice or judgment without which truth is a vast, dead hollow. Go back. Do not look into the abyss or let the abyss look into you. Awaken the sleep of reason and fight the monsters within and without.

(Some time ago. Aliens run inside the boxcar screaming as canisters of hydrogen cyanide are thrown in. They pound against the walls, desperately trying to find a way out of their damnation as the lid is closed and they are being slowly killed by the gas. One can make out small words.)

HYBRID: Help me, please! Let me out! Please, let me out!

(Between worlds. Mulder's father steps out to him.)

WILLIAM MULDER: Hello, son. I did not dare hope to see you so soon nor ever again hope to broker fate with a life to which I gave life.

(Mulder's eyes slowly open and his head turns as he looks at his newly departed father.)

The lies I told you were a pox and poison to my soul and now you are here because of them. Lies I thought might bury forever a truth I could not live with. I stand here, ashamed of the choices I made so long ago, when you were just a boy. You are the memory, Fox. It lives in you. If you were to die now, the truth will die. And only the lies survive us.

MULDER: My sister? Is she here?

WILLIAM MULDER: No. The thing that would destroy me, the truth I felt you must never learn is the truth you will find if you are to go forward.

(He steps back from his son. Mulder looks back up at the stars.)



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(A tour guide is leading a tour as Scully walks in.)

TOUR GUIDE: Okay, I just need everyone to step through the metal detector and we'll begin the tour. The facility you're in is called the J. Edgar Hoover Building. It was finished in 1974 and built on the site of the original F.B.I. building. We'll also see a display on the ten most wanted, you might see a few of your relatives there.

(They crowd and her laugh. Scully steps in line for the metal detector.)

Uh, if you have any questions, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them.

(Scully reaches the metal detector and puts her keys in the holder. The security guard smiles.)

SECURITY GUARD: Making you come in the front door these days, are they, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: For now.

(She smiles and walks through. There is a buzzing.)

SECURITY GUARD: Are you carrying your weapon?

SCULLY: No.

SECURITY GUARD: Sorry to have to you run you through this.

SCULLY: It's okay.

(He moves the handhold metal detector around in front of her and it does not react to anything.)

That was weird.

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah, well, I've had a straight pin left in a shirt collar set this machine off but, uh, you can go on through.

(He hands her a piece of paper.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(Scully waits outside Skinner's office, sitting on the couch. Skinner opens the door and his secretary looks at him.)

SKINNER: Scully, come in, please.

(She walks in and he closes the door behind them. He sits down at his desk.)

You said you needed to see me concerning the investigation?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. I came across a news article. A man's body was found in New Jersey and I have reason to believe that he was killed by the same man responsible for Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: Can I see it?

(She unfolds the article and hands it to him.)

SCULLY: The date of death postdates Agent Mulder's disappearance. Now, you already have the ballistics data from Agent Mulder's father on file. I would like you to run it against the ballistics from this man's case.

SKINNER: Trying to prove what?

SCULLY: Well, if both men were killed by the same weapon, we could prove that Agent Mulder didn't kill his father and it could also help us find the man who did.

SKINNER: You've been relieved of your investigative function.

SCULLY: Yes, I know that, sir. I just thought this might be helpful.

(Skinner tears up the article.)

SKINNER: I'm afraid not.

(She stares at him in disbelief and takes back the crumpled and torn article.)

This case would have been handled by the Trenton P.D. They're on our drugfire ballistics database. If there was a match in the two slugs, all the bells and whistles would have gone off by now.

SCULLY: You don't want to check?

SKINNER: Miss Scully, I think you underestimate the duties and responsibilities of my position as assistant director.

SCULLY: I was just trying to cooperate with your investigation, sir.

SKINNER: To mitigate your situation and then add to your chances of reinstatement, isn't that right?

SCULLY: No. I just want answers.

SKINNER: And so do I. I want to know why I was asked to execute a search warrant on your apartment to look for a digital cassette.

(He throws a paper down on the desk.)

SCULLY: I don't have it.

SKINNER: Is this tape what Agent Mulder died for?

SCULLY: I believe so.

SKINNER: You want to bring me a smoking gun, Scully? You bring me this tape. Otherwise, I would ask you to go home, sit tight and let us do our job.

(Scully looks to be wounded by Skinner's remarks.)

SCULLY: Is that all, sir?

SKINNER: Yes, that's all.

(She walks out, looking back at him first for a few seconds. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks in through the other door. He takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Did you ask her about the tape?

SKINNER: She says she doesn't have it.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Is that what she says?

(He lights the cigarette.)

SKINNER: Yes, that's what she says.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Well, that's unfortunate for everyone.

(Scully walks out of the elevator and takes off her clip-on badge, throwing it down on the security desk. She tentatively walks through the metal detector and looks at the guard.)

SECURITY GUARD: Back again?

SCULLY: I'm just curious about something, would you mind if I went through here again?

SECURITY GUARD: Come on through.

(She puts her keys down in the holder and walks through again. It goes off.)

This thing is more sensitive than a toothache.

SCULLY: Would you mind running the wand over me one more time?

SECURITY GUARD: Sure.

(He waves it around in front and she turns around. As he passes the back of her neck, it goes off. She turns around, surprised.)

You wearing a necklace or something?

SCULLY: No, not today.

SECURITY GUARD: Then what the hell is that?

(Later, in the medical wing, Scully and a doctor are looking at an x-ray of Scully's neck. There is a small piece of metal in the back of one of the vertebrate.)

SCULLY: What do you think it could be?

DOCTOR: I don't know. It's embedded in your soft tissue here. Looks like maybe a piece of buckshot or something.

(He points it out with his pen, then moves around her to check her neck.)

SCULLY: I don't know how it could have gotten there.

(She holds her hair away and he runs his fingers over the spot.)

DOCTOR: I can feel it just under the skin.

(There is a small scar where the metal is.)

And now that I'm looking at it closely, there's a tiny little scar over it. If you want, I could, uh, do a local and pull it out of there.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(He pulls out a tray and she sits down.)

Thanks for coming down here and doing this for me so late.

(She pulls her hair away again and he swabs the area.)

DOCTOR: No problem. You were probably wounded in the line of duty and you didn't even know it.



SCENE 11
NAVAJO RESERVATION; TWO GREY HILLS, NEW MEXICO

(Albert walks back into the hogan and looks down at Mulder. He walks over to a bucket of water next to him and kneels down, taking out the ladle.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: For three days, the Blessing Way chant was performed. The F.B.I. man suffered great fevers and his body burned like fire. There was doubt that he recover but the spirits were in attendance because on the night of the third day, he opened his eyes and asked for water.

(Mulder lifts his head up and drinks from the ladle. Later, Mulder sits outside and Hosteen starts to bathe him with a sponge.)

The ritual bath must be given outside the hogan before sunrise. The F.B.I. man was weak from his journey and did not wish to speak but like a rising sun, I sensed in him a rebirth.

(Hosteen offers Mulder some kind of spongy food, which Mulder takes and eats slowly. Mulder is draped in a blanket and his gunshot wound is highly evident.)

Still, it will take time to regain his strength.



SCENE 12
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Pomerantz places the small piece of metal under the microscope with tweezers and looks at it.)

DOCTOR: Well... it's definitely not buckshot. I, uh... I know what it looks like to me but, uh... I couldn't tell you how it got there. Take a look.

(He stands up and Scully looks through the microscope. The small piece of metal is a highly detailed and complex computer chip, much like the one that was implanted in Duane Barry.)

SCULLY: It looks like a computer chip.

DOCTOR: That's what it looks like.



SCENE 13
MELISSA SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Scully sits on the couch, holding up a small glass tubing with the microchip inside. Melissa looks at it.)

SCULLY: I don't even know how long its been in there. I have absolutely no recollection of it being put there.

(Melissa sits down.)

MELISSA SCULLY: That is frightening. Dana, this is very serious. You've got to find out what this is.

SCULLY: I don't have access to the F.B.I. labs.

MELISSA SCULLY: No, I'm, I'm talking about access to your own memory.

SCULLY: Hmmm...

(She looks away, not wanting to hear Melissa's philosophical talking.)

MELISSA SCULLY: I mean, obviously, you have buried this so deeply, you can't consciously recall it.

SCULLY: Melissa...

MELISSA SCULLY: I know someone, someone who can help you...

(Dana stands and slams her fist down on the table.)

SCULLY: No!

(She starts to walk away, pacing.)

MELISSA SCULLY: What are you so afraid of, Dana? You afraid you might actually learn something about yourself? I mean, you are so, you are so shut off to the possibility there could be any other explanation except for your rigid scientific view of the world. It's like you've lost all touch with your own intuition.

(She stands.)

You're carrying so much grief and fear that you can't see you, you've built up these walls around your true feelings and the memory of what really happened.

(She walks up to Dana.)

Just do this for me. As your sister. Please.



SCENE 14
DOCTOR POMERANTZ'S OFFICE

(The sign on the door reads:

"Dr. Mark Pomerantz
Psychotherapy
Regression Hypnosis
Energy Fields"

Scully waits at the door, thinking, then walks in. Soon after, Doctor Pomerantz is sitting across from her.)

MARK POMERANTZ: What I'm going to do is induce an non-ordinary state, a modified form of hypnosis which involves what is called holotropic breath work. This will quiet your interpretive mind so that we can cut through the interference with your memories and perceptions. Now, what I want you to do is to maintain a focus on your breath... relax your breathing.

(She does so.)

Now, I want you to close your eyes and think of a place where you've always felt completely comfortable and safe.

(She closes her eyes. Time passes.)

You told me of your experience of being taken away and losing time. Do you remember how you felt just before this happened?

(Scully slurs her words, in a trance.)

SCULLY: I was afraid...

MARK POMERANTZ: Do you remember what you were afraid of?

SCULLY: Um... that I would die...

MARK POMERANTZ: But you didn't die. Someone must have cared for you. Do you remember who that someone was?

SCULLY: There were men... um, a man took me and, uh... there was a light and... loud sounds, my, um... my ears were pounding.

MARK POMERANTZ: They performed a procedure on you. Do you remember any pain during this?

SCULLY: I'm trying. The, the sound is all screwed up. There was an alarm. Th, I remember, um... they wanted to know if I was all right.

MARK POMERANTZ: Maybe you trusted them not to hurt you. Could this be possible?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MARK POMERANTZ: At the F.B.I., you work with people you must entrust with your life. Could it have been one of these people?

SCULLY: I had to trust someone... I was powerless. I couldn't... I could not resist them.

MARK POMERANTZ: If this is too painful, I want you to go back to that comfortable place where we began and try again.

(He puts his hand on hers and she gasps, startled.)

SCULLY: No!

(She gathers her thoughts and realizes where she is.)

I'm sorry... I'm trying, I'm trying. I don't think this is working. I don't think we're getting anywhere.

(She stands.)

Thank you, but you'll have to excuse me.

(She leaves.)



SCENE 15
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully pulls up and looks back at Skinner leaving her house. Skinner gets in his car, which is a few cars back from Scully's. Skinner pulls out and drives by. Scully watches him.)



SCENE 16
NAVAJO RESERVATION; TWO GREY HILLS, NEW MEXICO

(Mulder sits in a congregation of the Navajo. He is still draped in the blanket. Albert walks over and sits down across from him.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You must be careful now to end the ceremony properly. If you leave, you must not do any work, change clothes or bathe for four days.

MULDER: That's really going to cut into my social life.

(Everyone laughs.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: The boys have a gift for you.

(The youngest boy walks up to Mulder and hands him a small pouch. Mulder opens it and pours out sunflower seeds. He smiles.)

You asked for them during your worst fevers.

MULDER: During my fever, I... I left here and traveled to a place.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: This place. You carry it with you. It is inside of you. It is the origin place.

MULDER: It wasn't a dream?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Yes.

(Mulder stares at him, perplexed. A man stands and wipes out the design on the board that had been drawn on before. Albert stands.)

We are done now.

(Everyone else stands and starts to leave, except Mulder, who remains seated as the morning sounds ring in.)



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner's phone rings and he presses a button and picks it up.)

SKINNER: Skinner.

SCULLY: You came to see me today.

SKINNER: Excuse me?

(Cut to Scully, who is standing by her window.)

SCULLY: You came to my apartment, I assumed you wanted to see me about something.

SKINNER: I don't know what you're talking about.

SCULLY: I saw you come out of my building.

(Cut back to Skinner.)

SKINNER: You've obviously made a mistake, I'm sorry.

(He hangs up. Cut to Scully, who keeps the phone to her air, deep in thought. Cut back to Skinner.)

I need some air. Excuse me.

(He stands and walks out, leaving the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who was sitting across from Skinner, to himself.)



SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder slowly fades in from the stars, talking to someone. Whether it is himself or to Scully is unclear.)

MULDER: I have been on the bridge that spans two worlds, the link between all souls by which we cross into our own true nature. You were here today, looking for truth that was taken from you, a truth that was never to be spoken but which now binds us together in dangerous purpose. I have returned from the dead to continue with you... but I fear that this danger is now close at hand... that I may be too late.

(Scully wakes up, startled. She sighs a few times.)



SCENE 19
GARDEN OF REFLECTION; PARKWAY CEMETERY; BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

(A congregation of mourners stands around William Mulder's coffin, which is about to be put in the ground. The priest and Mrs. Mulder are standing next to the coffin, while everyone else is at a further distance.)

PRIEST: So we are here to mourn the passing of William Mulder, to join in our grief for our loss but to share also the memories of a man whose life was rich and full and who made his family's and his friends' lives richer and fuller as well. Sadly, I've been informed today by the mother of William's children that his son, Fox, could not be here to join us in this time of sorrow.

(Mrs. Mulder puts a flower on the coffin and walks away from it. Scully walks over to her.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Mulder?

MRS. MULDER: Yes?

SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I work with your son.

(They shake hands and start walking.)

Um... I know what you may have heard from the F.B.I. but I have a very strong feeling that your son is going to be found.

(They stop and Mrs. Mulder looks at her in shock.)

MRS. MULDER: Oh, my goodness gracious.

SCULLY: I think he's still alive.

MRS. MULDER: How do you know?

SCULLY: I just have a very strong feeling.

(The Well-Manicured Man steps out from behind a large tombstone.)

I promise I'll let you know as soon as I do.

MRS. MULDER: Thank you. Thank you very much.

(They shake hands and Mrs. Mulder gets in her limousine. Scully walks towards the cemetery and sees the Well-Manicured Man standing there, staring at her.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Hello. I see you're a friend of the family. So am I. Do you think we might find a moment to speak?

SCULLY: About?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: A very serious matter. Please... can we find someplace away from the others?

(They start to walk away.)

I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. You think the son is still alive?

SCULLY: Who are you?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: I'm a member of a kind of consortium. We represent certain global interests.

SCULLY: What kind of interests?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Interests that would be extremely threatened by the digital tape that you are no longer in possession of.

(They stop.)

SCULLY: Threatened enough to murder?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Oh, my, yes.

SCULLY: What do you know about Mulder?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: That he is dead. Cui bono.

SCULLY: You're lying.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: I'm not here to tell you lies.

SCULLY: What are you here for?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: To tell you your life is in danger too.

(She stares at him, then starts off.)

SCULLY: Leave me alone.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: They'll kill you one of two ways.

(She turns back and looks at him. He walks back up to her.)

They'll send someone, possibly two men. They'll kill you in your home or in the garage with an unregistered weapon which will be left at the scene. Using false documents supplied by associates of mine, they'll be out of the country in less than two hours.

SCULLY: You said there were two ways.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes. He or she will be someone close to you. Someone you trust. They'll arrange a meeting or come to your house unexpectedly. Do you have someplace else you might stay?

SCULLY: Why, why kill me?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: You want something they don't. Justice. And because they are now quite certain you don't have the computer copy of the files they're looking for.

SCULLY: Why are you protecting me?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: I feel my colleagues are acting... impulsively and your death will draw unnecessary attention to our group.

SCULLY: You're not protecting me, you're protecting yourself.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Why should that surprise you? Motives are rarely unselfish.

SCULLY: What kind of business are you in?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: We predict the future and the best way to predict the future is to invent it.

(Scully stares at him, a look of both disdain and respect on her face.)

Good day, young lady.

(He walks away.)



SCENE 20
MARTHA'S VINEYARD; WEST TISBURY, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mrs. Mulder comes home and puts her things down on the counter. She looks at two pictures in front of her. The first is of her family, the second of her missing son when he was younger. She hears footsteps behind her and turns to see Mulder walking into the room.)

MULDER: Mom?

MRS. MULDER: Oh... my God!

(They hug, her crying into his shoulder.)

Oh, Fox. I can't believe it. I expected the worst.

MULDER: I need your help, Mom, but I don't have much time.

(They pull out of the hug.)

MRS. MULDER: They said something terrible has happened to you.

MULDER: I'm okay but I need your help. I need you to remember.

(They walk into the attic and turn on a light.)

MULDER: I need to know more about Dad.

(He opens up a small box and pulls out a few copies of the same photograph.)

Who these people are.

(Mrs. Mulder shakes her head.)

MRS. MULDER: It was all so long ago.

MULDER: I need you to try and remember, Mom. These pictures were taken in 1972. Where?

(They look at the picture. On the immediate left is the Cigarette-Smoking Man. To his right is William Mulder. A few men to the right stands the 1st Elder, as well as the 2nd.)

MRS. MULDER: I don't know.

MULDER: Dad was working for the state department, he'd go on the road. Where would he go?

MRS. MULDER: I don't remember, Fox. Please...

MULDER: Will you look at the pictures, Mom?

MRS. MULDER: Don't do this...

MULDER: Just look at them!

MRS. MULDER: Don't do this to me.

(In the immediate right of the picture is a much younger-looking Well Manicured Man. To his left is the 3rd Elder, and to his left is Deep Throat.)

MULDER: Now, he must have talked about his work, about the men he worked with. Did he ever bring them home? Were they ever here?

MRS. MULDER: Yes... but I don't remember their names anymore. What does this have to do with, Fox?

(He tosses the pictures away and starts rifling through the box.)

MULDER: I think it has to do with Samantha.

(He takes a gun out of the box and Mrs. Mulder gasps.)

I think it has to do with what happened to my sister.

(He takes the gun and walks out.)



SCENE 21
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully walks in. Her phone is ringing. She picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MELISSA SCULLY: Dana? It's your sister.

SCULLY: Hi.

MELISSA SCULLY: Hi, where've you been?

SCULLY: I, uh, I had to go to Boston... for a funeral.

MELISSA SCULLY: Oh, well, I was worried about you.

SCULLY: Why?

MELISSA SCULLY: Because I haven't heard from you since you saw Doctor Pomerantz.

SCULLY: Missy, something strange happened to me today. I'm... I'm a bit freaked out by it.

MELISSA SCULLY: Okay, well, I, I want to come over. I want to talk to you. Are you going to be there for a while?

SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, I will.

MELISSA SCULLY: Okay.

SCULLY: Bye.

MELISSA SCULLY: I'll see you in a bit.

(Scully hangs up and walks off. The phone rings and Scully walks back over and picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hi.

(The person on the other end hangs up. She hangs up and thinks. Scully realizes that her killers wanted to make sure she was in the apartment and frantically calls Melissa. The phone rings.)

Come on, come on, come on...

(Cut to Melissa's apartment, where her machine picks up.)

MELISSA SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi, this is Melissa. I'm very sorry that I missed your call. Please leave a message and I'll call you back, okay? Have a really nice day.

(It beeps.)

SCULLY: Missy, it's me. Please pick up.

(Cut back to Scully.)

Missy? Missy, pick up...

(She sighs.)

I'm coming over to your place instead. I'll, I'll, uh, I'll look for you on the way. Bye.

(She hangs up and is about to rush out the door when she thinks of something. Going to her drawer, she pulls out her gun and checks the clip. She pockets it, turns off the lamp and leaves. Outside, a car pulls up, nearly hitting her. Skinner swings the passenger side door open as Scully looks at him warily.)

SKINNER: Scully, get in the car. I need to talk to you, it's very important.

SCULLY: I was just going over to my sister's.

SKINNER: I'll drop you by there, right now, I need for you to come with me.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

SKINNER: To a place we can talk in private.

(Scully stares at him, not trusting him. She zippers her purse and gets in the car.)



SCENE 22
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Scully shuffles through her keys and comes to one labeled "Mulder." She opens the door, glancing at Skinner.)

SCULLY: After you.

(Skinner walks in and Scully cocks her gun. Skinner looks back slightly.)

Eyes forward. Put your hands where I can see them. Don't turn around or I'll blow your head off.

(She turns on the lights.)

Don't think I won't do it, you son of a bitch.

SKINNER: No, I believe you. Just stay cool, I'm with you.

SCULLY: Take two steps forward.

(They do, allowing Scully to step inside the apartment. She closes the door.)

Now move slowly towards the couch.

(Skinner, hands clearly visible extended at his sides, walks towards the couch. Scully follows him tightly and turns on the lights. She is breathing heavily. The masking taped "X" is on the window, as well as the bullethole under the center of it.)

Turn around and sit down on your hands.

(He does so very slowly. She throws down her purse and stands across from him.)

SKINNER: Are you going to let me tell you why I'm here?

SCULLY: I know why you're here. I want to know who sent you. Whose errand boy you are.

SKINNER: No one sent me.

(Scully glares at him and sits down slowly, gun still aimed.)

SCULLY: You got the rest of your life to give me answers.



SCENE 23
SCULLY'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Melissa runs up the front porch. A man brushes by the table, knocking over the small vial with the implant in it. Melissa opens the door and a gunshot goes off. Light covers the area as the Hispanic Man shoots her. She screams shortly and falls. Krycek runs out with the Hispanic Man. Krycek turns her over and looks at her, aghast.)

KRYCEK: Oh, no.

(He sighs.)

Oh, damn it.

HISPANIC MAN: What's wrong?

KRYCEK: Let's... let's get out of here.

(He walks out. The Hispanic Man places the gun down next to Melissa and quickly follows.)



SCENE 24
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Scully has Skinner in the same predicament as before.)

SCULLY: How high does it go, Skinner? Who's pulling the strings?

SKINNER: You can kill me, Scully, but you'll only be doing their work for them. Forget about your job and family. You'll spend the rest of your life behind bars, there isn't a federal judge that they couldn't persuade.

SCULLY: What's the alternative? Let you kill me now?

SKINNER: I didn't come here to kill you. I came here to give you something. I've got the digital tape.

SCULLY: You're lying.

SKINNER: I've got it in my pocket. I took it out of Mulder's desk.

(Scully hears footsteps approaching and turns to see a shadow covering the light shining under the door. Skinner looks back at her and pulls out his gun. She looks back at him quickly and they both have their guns fixed on one another. Neither member of the stand-off is willing to flinch.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                          PAPERCLIP



SCENE 1

(The desert heat blankets the rough surface. Albert Hosteen talks over it.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: To the Navajo, the earth and its creatures have great influence over our existence.

(A family of bears walks up a hill as a storm gathers.)

The stories passed from generation to generation help us to understand the reason for our tears of sadness and our tears of joy.

(Various scenes of desert.)

Animals like the bear, the spider and the coyote are powerful symbols to our people. When the F.B.I. man Mulder was cured by the holy people, we were reminded of the story of the Gila monster, who symbolizes the healing powers of the medicine man.

(A storm grows as thunder cracks.)

In this myth, the Gila monster restores a man by taking all his parts and putting them back together. His blood is gathered by ants, his eyes and ears by sun, his mind by Talking God and Pollen Boy. Then lightning and thunder bring the man back to life.

(Lightning blasts into the clouds from the ground, the air crackling with energy. Lightning rockets through the clouds, thunder echoing.)

At the end of the ceremony, when the F.B.I. man had been healed, we heard the news from other Native Americans in the northern plains that a great event had taken place.

(A truck drives up a dirt road to a barn. Men get out and run into the barn.)

Like the Navajo, these people have their own stories and myths. One of these stories tells of the white buffalo woman who came down from the heavens and taught the Indians how to lead virtuous lives and how to pray to the creator. She told the people she would return one day, then she turned into a white buffalo and ascended into the clouds, never to be seen again.

(Inside, people are taking care of a small white buffalo calf.)

But on this day, when the holy people had given the F.B.I. man a miracle, a white buffalo was born and every Native American knew, whether he believed the story or not, that this was a powerful omen and that great changes were coming.

SCENE 2
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Skinner is sitting on his hands on the couch. Scully sits across from him in a chair, gun aimed directly at her boss. The masking taped "X" is on the window, as well as the bullethole under the center of it.)

SKINNER: I've got the digital tape.

SCULLY: You're lying.

SKINNER: I've got it in my pocket. I took it out of Mulder's desk.

(Scully hears footsteps approaching and turns to see a shadow covering the light shining under the door. Skinner looks back at her and pulls out his gun. She looks back at him quickly and they both have their guns fixed on one another. Neither member of the stand-off is willing to flinch. They stand up. Skinner is very angry, Scully looks more frightened than anything else.)

Drop your weapon! Put it down, Scully!

SCULLY: No way.

SKINNER: I said put it down!

SCULLY: I said no! You're setting me up!

SKINNER: I'm trying to help you.

SCULLY: Then put your weapon down and sit down.

SKINNER: Not a chance.

SCULLY: You said you weren't here to kill me, Skinner, now prove it.

SKINNER: I didn't come here to have a gun shoved in my face either.

SCULLY: Damn it, Skinner!

(Mulder kicks down the door to his own apartment and aims his gun at Skinner. Skinner is shocked, Scully is even moreso. Skinner points his gun at Mulder.)

MULDER: Drop your weapon! I said...

SKINNER: Back off!

MULDER: I said put it down!

SKINNER: What the hell is this? What are you pulling here?

MULDER: You okay, Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Get his gun.

(She reaches out for his gun.)

Give her the gun. Give it to her!

SKINNER: All right.

(Faced with no other choice, he hands her the gun. Mulder lowers his weapon.)

MULDER: Now, I want an explanation.

(Scully keeps her gun trained on Skinner.)

SCULLY: I was warned that somebody would kill me... someone I trusted.

SKINNER: I'm going to reach into my coat pocket and end this charade... all right?

(Mulder nods. Skinner pulls out the DAT tape.)

I assume you both know what this is? Now, I want an explanation.

MULDER: Your cigarette-smoking friend killed my father for that tape, and then he killed me.

SKINNER: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I was a dead man. Now, I'm back.

SKINNER: What is on this tape?

MULDER: Defense department files that weren't supposed to exist. The truth about our government's involvement in a global conspiracy of silence about the existence of extraterrestrial life.

(Scully reaches out for the tape.)

SCULLY: Give me the tape.

SKINNER: Uh-uh, this tape stays with me.

(Mulder cocks his gun and aims it.)

MULDER: Give her the tape.

SKINNER: If what you say is true, the information on this tape is valuable enough to kill for. Then it's the only leverage we've got to bring these men to justice. It's not going to do us any good if it falls back into their hands!

MULDER: Then you better make sure it doesn't.

(He uncocks his gun and lowers it.)

Come on, Scully, let's go.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: There are truths out there that aren't on that tape.

(He walks out. She glares at Skinner, then puts his gun on the desk and walks out. Skinner looks at the tape and puts it in his pocket. Down the hall, Mulder presses the down button for the elevator and looks at Scully, who walks up to him. She stares at him for a second, then looks down, smiling.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I am...

MULDER: Scully, whatever you're going to say...

SCULLY: I went to your father's funeral. I told your mother that you were going to be okay.

MULDER: How did you know?

(The elevator dings.)

SCULLY: I just knew.

(The door opens and Scully walks past him into the elevator. He follows and presses a button. The door closes.)



SCENE 3
HOSPITAL

(Margaret Scully runs in and goes to the nearest doctor. People are talking and moving.)

MAN: If you'd wait there, sir...

MARGARET SCULLY: Uh, my daughter was brought here. I'm trying to find her.

DOCTOR: Okay, all right, what's her name?

MARGARET SCULLY: Scully. Dana Scully.

(He stops and looks back at her.)

DOCTOR: Melissa Scully?

MARGARET SCULLY: No, no... that's her sister.

DOCTOR: Well, we just had a Melissa Scully in surgery with a cranial gunshot wound.

(Margaret shakes her head slightly. She runs into her hospital room and sees her lying on the bed, her face taped up and hooked up to a respirator. Margaret's whole body tenses up. A nurse is checking over her charts. Margaret goes over to Melissa and takes her hand, crying.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Missy? It's Mom.

DOCTOR: We took drastic precautionary measures due to the nature of the head wound. We've induced coma to try and relieve the trauma on the brain.

MARGARET SCULLY: Is she going to be okay?

DOCTOR: We've done everything we can right now. We'll being monitoring her around the clock.

(He looks at her as she tries to stop crying.)

Nurse, why don't we get Mrs. Scully a comfortable chair?



SCENE 4
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Langly, Scully, Byers and Mulder are all looking at the consotorium photograph under a magnifying glass. From left to right, the men lined up are the Cigarette-Smoking Man, William Mulder, Victor Klemper, the 1st Elder, Deep Throat, the 3rd Elder, the 2nd Elder and the Well-Manicured Man.)

MULDER: That's my father on the left there.

BYERS: This was taken when?

MULDER: About 1973.

BYERS: Amazing. Langly, take a look.

(Byers walks around Mulder as Langly walks over to the magnifying glass.)

SCULLY: Do you recognize any of these men?

BYERS: Are you familiar with a post-World War II project known as Operation Paper Clip?

MULDER: Our deal with the devil. The U.S. government provided safe haven for certain Nazi war criminals in exchange for their scientific knowledge.

(Langly points out Klemper.)

LANGLY: I know who this man is. Victor Klemper.

(Mulder looks through the magnifying glass.)

BYERS: The man standing next to your father is one of those criminals, though not the most famous of the bunch. Wernher von Braun, designer of the V-2 rockets that leveled London, may be the most notorious, but Victor Klemper certainly takes the prize for the most... evil Nazi to escape the Nuremburg trials.

SCULLY: What did he do?

LANGLY: He experimented on the Jews... drowned them, suffocated them, put them in pressure chambers. All in the name of science.

BYERS: Together with Von Braun, Klemper helped us win the space race. Using his scientific data on the effects of high-altitude flying, we were able to put astronauts on the moon before the Soviets.

LANGLY: One giant step for mankind.

SCULLY: What would he be doing in a photo with your father?

MULDER: I don't know. Do you recognize anybody else in the photograph?

(Langly shakes his head.)

BYERS: No. Operation Paper Clip was supposed to have been scrapped in the 1950s but if this is 1973...

SCULLY: Whatever happened to Klemper?

LANGLY: He's still here, living very well at the expense of the American taxpayer.

(The door opens and they turn to see Frohike, who stands in the doorway and looks at Mulder.)

FROHIKE: Unbelieveable! We thought you were history.

(They hug.)

MULDER: You're going to have to wait a little longer for my video collection, Frohike.

LANGLY: Where were you? We were looking all over.

FROHIKE: Down at D.C. general, I was scanning the police frequency when I heard the report of a shooting.

(He takes off his hat and looks at Scully.)

Agent Scully...

SCULLY: What, what is it?

FROHIKE: Your sister's in critical condition.

(She looks at Mulder then walks out.)

MULDER: Scully...

(He follows her down the stairs.)

Scully, wait. Scully! Scully, wait! Scully!

(He grabs her shoulder and turns her around.)

SCULLY: I have to go there, Mulder.

MULDER: You can't go.

SCULLY: That bullet was meant for me.

MULDER: If they're trying to kill you, that's the first place they're going to look.

SCULLY: Those bastards...

MULDER: We're going to call someone I think can help. It's the only thing you can do for her right now is try to crucify them.



SCENE 5
46TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY; 7:09 AM

(Cars honk outside. Inside, there is another meeting. The five main members are seated except for the 2nd Elder.)

1ST ELDER: This is a serious mistake. An innocent woman has been shot.

2ND ELDER: Can this be traced?

3RD ELDER: This is your man.

(He looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who is smoking.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: There was a mistake. It will be rectified.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: By whom? By whom will this be rectified? Your ridiculously ineffectual assassins?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: These men are professionals.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: This is not a profession for men who make mistakes. My God, you presume to make us believe you can simply fix it with enough bullets?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stirs uncomfortably in his chair.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: This woman... Scully... I know she believes her partner is still alive.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Mulder's dead. I took care of it myself.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: And the computer tape containing the stolen files you tell us was recovered... you can show it to us?

(The 2nd Elder leans against the mantle, smoking a cigar.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I wasn't aware that my honesty was in question or doubt.

1ST ELDER: You have the tape?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Of course I have it.

2ND ELDER: I think I'd like to see it.

3RD ELDER: So would I.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I have vouchsafed it for reasons of security.

(He puts out his cigarette and stands.)

I'll have it here for you tomorrow... by which time this whole matter will have been cleared up.

(He walks out as the rest of the consotorium watches him go.

(Victor Klemper is working on his flowers. His greenhouse is full of beautiful and lavish flowers, all in bloom. The door opens and Mulder and Scully walk in and over to him.)

MULDER: Victor Klemper?

VICTOR KLEMPER: Yes?

MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully.

VICTOR KLEMPER: Your name is Mulder?

MULDER: Yes. I think you knew my father.

VICTOR KLEMPER: What's this about?

MULDER: When you came to this country, you did some work for our government.

VICTOR KLEMPER: I'm an old man now. History bores me.

SCULLY: Because it escaped you or because you escaped it?

VICTOR KLEMPER: Freud, Salk, Crick, Watson... these will be the names they celebrate at the end of the millenium. Great scientists. And Klemper? He will be remembered only as a butcher.

SCULLY: History may be the only justice you'll ever know.

VICTOR KLEMPER: Do you know my work? Do you know what we accomplished?

SCULLY: As a Nazi or for the blood money we paid you?

VICTOR KLEMPER: We were young men caught in a fervor but our experiments changed the world.

SCULLY: For a lot of innocent Jews.

VICTOR KLEMPER: Progress demands sacrifice, and I... I have confronted my demons. And soon I will die too.

MULDER: Like my father. They killed him and I believe you know why.

VICTOR KLEMPER: I believe they would kill anyone if it is in the best interest of the work.

MULDER: Well, what is this "work" that my father was involved in?

VICTOR KLEMPER: I have no answer for you.

MULDER: Well, you knew him! Was he a murderer too?

(He hands Klemper the photograph.)

VICTOR KLEMPER: There are some things you don't have to know.

MULDER: No, I need to know! I need to know the truth! Isn't that what you want? For the truth to be known?

VICTOR KLEMPER: Do you know the formula of Napier's constant?

SCULLY: Yes, why?

VICTOR KLEMPER: The photo was taken at the Strughold Mining Company in West Virginia and that is all I will tell you. The rest you can find out yourself.

MULDER: Let's go, Scully.

(He starts off. She glares at him for a long time, deep contempt in her eyes. He smiles and she feels a little remorse. The agents walk out.)



SCENE 6
46TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY

(An aide picks up the phone as it rings.)

AIDE: Hello?

(Klemper says something illegible.)

AIDE: Yes, one moment.

(He hands the phone to the Well-Manicured Man.)

It's for you, sir.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes?

VICTOR KLEMPER: It's Klemper.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Victor...

(Cut to Klemper, who is still in his greenhouse.)

VICTOR KLEMPER: How are you, old friend? It's been far too many years.

(Cut back to New York.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: What is it, Victor?

(Cut to the greenhouse.)

VICTOR KLEMPER: Oh, I was just paid a visit by the son of one of our old colleagues.

(Cut to the Well-Manicured Man, who is shocked.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: What did you tell him, Victor?

VICTOR KLEMPER: I told him that you were the most venal man I've ever met.

(Cut to Klemper.)

Beyond that, I told him nothing.

(Cut to the Well-Manicured Man, who hears a click. He turns off the phone, his face aghast.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Mulder is alive.

(The room grows quiet.)

1ST ELDER: Then I think it's time we call our friends who will handle this matter more satisfactorily.

(He puts his cup of coffee down on the mantle and walks away.)



SCENE 7
HOSPITAL

(Margaret watches her daughter lie on the bed with cold eyes full of sorrow. A man walks by outside, looking into the room as he goes. She turns and looks at him. A nurse walks in.)

NURSE: Are you expecting any visitors?

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, is it Dana? Is Dana here?

NURSE: No, it's a man. He says he was asked to come here.

(Albert Hosteen walks in behind her.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: My name is Albert Hosteen. I was asked to come here and help with your daughter.

MARGARET SCULLY: There must be some mistake.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Is your daughter the F.B.I. woman?

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Yes. She's very sorry she can't come here to comfort you.

MARGARET SCULLY: You know where she is? Is she okay?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Yes, I believe so.

(He puts his bag down and walks over to Melissa. Taking her hand, Margaret watches him.)

She is weak.

MARGARET SCULLY: She's getting better. She has the best doctors, they're watching her around the clock.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: If it's all right, I would like to pray over her here.

(Margaret nods slightly.)



SCENE 8
RURAL WEST VIRGINIA

(Mulder and Scully drive up a dirt road and come to the Strughold Mining Facility. They look at the huge complex built into the mountain. They open the old door and walk inside. Birds fly out of the rafters. The door slams behind them as they take in all of the massive complex. They start up the stairs.)

SCULLY: What do you think your father would have been doing here?

MULDER: I don't know. He never came home wearing a miner's cap.

SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.

(Mulder runs down a catwalk to a floor containing large black high-tech doors. Scully quickly follows.)

What do you think?

MULDER: I'd like to try door number one, Monty.

(He pushes a few numbers into a red keypad on the first keypad. Scully goes to the second door and tries it.)

I'm trying two-seven-eight-two-eight, it's not working.

(Fan and mathematician Rob Wade notes that the scriptwriters made an error here, omitting a digit. Napier's Constant, also known as e, is an irrational number beginning 2.71828...)

SCULLY: It's not working here either.

(He runs down to the fifth door and tries it, she goes to the fourth.)

MULDER: Sure that's the right number?

SCULLY: Positive. Napier's constant is the basis of all natural logarithms.

MULDER: I think with a crowbar and a small nuclear device, I might be able to get through one of these things.

(She pushes the access code and the red lights on the keypad turn to green. The door unlatches.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He runs over.)

No, wait, hang on a second. Whatever we find in here... I don't think you've had time to process everything that you've been through.

MULDER: I'm okay, Scully...

SCULLY: You weren't even able to go to your father's funeral and if something in here were to cast doubt on the kind of man he was... I, I just know how it would affect me.

(Mulder nods and Scully turns the handle.)



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man turns the door handle to Skinner's office and walks in. Skinner, sitting at his desk, looks up at him.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You called me.

SKINNER: Yes, I did.

(He gets up and walks over.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: About?

SKINNER: I may have located the digital tape that you're looking for.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You may have located it?

SKINNER: Yes, although there's a great chance it may fall into the hands of people who want to use it for purposes not your own.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You want to work a deal? Is that what this is? Let me tell you something. I don't work deals.

SKINNER: I just thought you should know of certain potentialities.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Do you have the tape?

SKINNER: As I said, I may have located it.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man literally screams in Skinner's face.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Do you have the damn tape?!

SKINNER: I'll know more when we next meet.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I do not negotiate. Do you understand?

SKINNER: Yes, sir.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I don't think you do. I don't think you understand at all.

SKINNER: No, I'm quite aware of your policies in those regards.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Then I hope your next course of action will be more... cautious and informed.

(He takes a drag from his cigarette and walks out.)



SCENE 10
RURAL WEST VIRGINIA

(Mulder and Scully walk down a long cavern, shining their flashlights as they go.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look at this.

(On the walls, she can make out various file cabinets.)

It looks like their storing records.

MULDER: Of what?

(Scully pulls open a drawer and looks at the various folders.)

SCULLY: Of medical files, by the look of it. Got names... alphabetized.

(Mulder goes to a switch in the wall and flips it. The hallway lights up, revealing thousands upon thousands of file cabinets lined up, ceiling to floor.)

MULDER: Lots of files.

SCULLY: Lots and lots of files.

(He runs back over to her.)

MULDER: What's in these files?

SCULLY: Standard medical forms. These are birth certificates, small pox vaccination certificate and then there's this.

(She points to a small container in a bag that is marked "Sterile, do not tamper." He looks at it.)

MULDER: What is this?

SCULLY: It's an old tissue collection cassette, the new ones are plastic.

MULDER: Do all these files contain the same materials?

SCULLY: Yes, exactly.

(She puts the file back.)

MULDER: What year was this person born?

SCULLY: 1955. All of these files are 1955.

MULDER: What year were you born?

SCULLY: 1964, why?

MULDER: Let's go find 1964.

(They run down the hallway and find 1964. Mulder pulls the drawer open.)

SCULLY: You're looking for a file on me?

(He finds it and pulls it out.)

MULDER: "Dana Katherine Scully."

SCULLY: What?

(Scully runs her fingers down the bag with the tissue collection box. The vaccination sheet on her reads:

"SMALL POX VACC.
No. 29510 Int.
Scully, Dana Katherine
3170 W. 53 Road
Indianapolis, Maryland")

That's a recent tissue sample. What the hell is going on here, Mulder?

MULDER: I don't know, Scully.

(He puts it back and runs down the hallway to another drawer. He pulls it open and pulls out another file.)

SCULLY: That's your sister's file.

MULDER: Yeah.

(He scans down the page.)

SCULLY: What are you looking for?

MULDER: I don't know.

(He looks at the file name, which reads:

"SUBJECT NAME: MULDER, Samantha Ann
BIRTH DATE: 11/21/65 ID 378671")

Take a look at this, Scully.

(He pulls it back to reveal another sticker which reads:

"SUBJECT NAME: MULDER, Fox William
BIRTH DATE: 10/13/61 ID 292544")

This file was originally mine.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

(The lights turn off and a loud rumbling emanates from outside. Mulder turns on his flashlight.)

MULDER: Wait here, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?

(Mulder starts off, running quickly past the file cabinets. He opens the door to the main room and a bright light shines through the bottom windows.)

Mulder?

(She continues to search the area. A hissing sound comes from behind her.)

Mulder!

(Suddenly, a number of small of alien-shaped organisms run past Scully. The flashlight swings around wildly, the light catching small parts of the alien hybrids. Scully drops her flashlight. She picks it up and starts after them. The light through the windows in front of Mulder rises up to the higher windows as he stands in awe. It keeps gaining height until it is directly in front of Mulder. He runs up the stairs and outside to see a large unidentified flying object moving over him. The light is intense, almost blinding, but Mulder's eyes do not move from the spaceship. It disappears over a ridge. Scully continues down the hallway until she comes to a mining cart rail. At the end of the tunnel, the bright light from the UFO shines through. She sees a small hybrid-shaped silhouette standing at the end of the tunnel. The silhouette grows larger and taller as the light grows stronger. The silhouette is incredibly defined and looks human before the light disappears. A number of black fleet sedans pull up and Mulder spins around to look at them. He quickly runs back inside as men file out of the cars, cocking shotguns.)

MAN #1: Come on, let's go!

(The men runs inside as Mulder runs down stairs. They see each other at the same time and Mulder begins running down the catwalk.)

MAN #2: There!

(Sparks fly off of the metal bars behind Mulder as they fire at him. The bullets richochet off as Mulder runs down more stairs and keeps going. The men stop firing as Mulder is gone from their field of vision. A few run off in that direction.)

MAN #3: Find the woman too.

(Mulder speeds across the catwalk and down more stairs. A man fires at him and he crouches on the steps to avoid the fire. He then jumps over the railing and falls to the ground. Grunting, he obtains cover by hiding behind a box. He makes a break for the door and runs inside as gunfire rattles off behind him. He slams the door shut and the red keypad flashes back on. The men run over and one of them enters the access code. The lights turn green and they fling open the door. Mulder shines his flashlight down the dark tunnel. His voice echoes.)

MULDER: Scully!

SCULLY: Mulder!

(He follows the sound of her voice.)

MULDER: Scully!

(The hit squad are gaining on him but begin to get lost in the system of tunnels.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm down here!

(She shines her flashlight around wildly and Mulder heads towards it. They meet each other halfway.)

MULDER: You okay, Scully?

SCULLY: I heard gunshots.

MULDER: I've been looking for you.

SCULLY: What happened to you?

MULDER: They got a small army outside. I think they got us trapped.

SCULLY: I think there's a way out, down here.

(They run in the direction Scully was coming from. Running past more filing cabinets, they find a back door and Mulder slams the door behind them as they run off.)



SCENE 11
ROUTE 320A; CRAIGER, MARYLAND

(Morning. Skinner pulls up to a local diner and walks in, putting his keys in his pocket. The room is bright and relatively quiet. He sits down at a table against the wall where Mulder and Scully are seated. The two agents have food in front of them.)

SKINNER: This place isn't even on the map. How'd you get here?

MULDER: You'd be surprised what's not on the map in this country and what our government will do to keep it that way.

SKINNER: How's that?

MULDER: Last night, we were chased by some kind of hit squad driving what looked an awful lot like C.I.A. fleet sedans.

(Skinner stays silent for a few seconds.)

SKINNER: Well, I may be able to negotiate a deal that would guarantee your safety.

SCULLY: What kind of deal?

SKINNER: I'll turn over the digital tape in return for your reinstatement...

MULDER: No, sir. I need that tape. I need those files.

SKINNER: I'm talking about a way to save your lives.

MULDER: And I'm talking about an elaborate conspiracy against the American public. Do you know what we found last night?

SKINNER: What?

SCULLY: An extremely elaborate filing system of medical records.

MULDER: Locked inside a mountain vault.

SKINNER: For the purpose of?

MULDER: I don't know. But the answer's got to be on that tape, in those files.

SKINNER: Is that answer worth your lives?

MULDER: It's obviously worth killing us for.

SKINNER: In your wildest dreams, what do you possibly hope to find, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Why they killed my father... and what happened to my sister... and what they did to Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I think we should let him make the deal, Mulder.

(He looks at her in shock.)

Look... those answers mean nothing if we're going to be hunted down like animals. We are operating so far outside of the law right now, we've given up on the very notion of justice. We've turned ourselves into outsiders. We have lost our access and our protection.

MULDER: What makes you think there's any such thing as justice, Scully?

SCULLY: Then what good are those answers to anybody but you, Mulder?

MULDER: What we found last night...

SCULLY: Look, I want exactly what you want. But I need to see my sister.

(They stare at each other for a few seconds until Scully looks away. Mulder looks at Skinner.)

MULDER: I suppose you already tried to make a backup of the tape.

SKINNER: Whoever downloaded those files put a copy protector on them. I couldn't get a hard copy to print either.

MULDER: What makes you think they'll even honor this deal?

SKINNER: Because, if they don't... I'll go state's evidence and testify... or they'll have to kill me too.

(Mulder looks back at Scully and stares at her for a second.)

MULDER: It's up to you, Scully.

(He gets up and leaves. A short time later, Scully and Skinner walk out. Mulder is standing near the doorway and Scully goes to him. Skinner gets in his car.)

SCULLY: I told Skinner to make the deal. But not to hand over the tape until you agree to it.

MULDER: I'm sorry about your sister, Scully.

SCULLY: I just need to know if she's going to be okay.

(The car engine starts. Scully gets in the back seat and Mulder gets in the front. They drive off.)

(Melissa lays in her hospital bed, machines beeping. Albert talks over the scene as Margaret sleeps in an adjacent chair.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: For two days, I had prayed for the F.B.I. woman's sister. Her doctor said she was getting better and her mother, who would not leave her bedside, was able to sleep.

(Albert walks in and takes Melissa's hand.)

But word had come from my brothers in the north that did not give me hope.

(Cut to the ranch where the white buffalo was born. The white buffalo is sleeping under a bench. Some men walk over, one carrying a bottle, and the calf stands.)

The white buffalo calf had survived, but after a day, it would no longer drink its mother's milk.

(The calf refuses to drink from the bottle, despite the man's efforts. The man says something in Navajo. In the back, men are tending to the mother buffalo, who is on the ground.)

On the third day, the mother buffalo laid down in her stall and would not get up. They said the men could do nothing for her. That night, she died.

(Cut back to the hospital, where Albert is sitting and holding Melissa's hand. He continues to talk over the scene.)

My father taught me when I was a boy that this is how life is. That for something to live, another thing must often be sacrificed. This was my fear now for the young woman.

(Skinner walks in and looks at Hosteen, then at Margaret Scully, who is sleeping while sitting in a seat with sheets draped over her lap.)

SKINNER: I'm here to see Melissa Scully.

(Margaret stirs and looks at him. Albert stands and Skinner takes out his badge.)

My name is Walter Skinner. I'm an assistant director at the F.B.I.

(Margaret folds up the magazine that was on her lap. Skinner walks over, staring at Albert for a little while, then looking at Margaret.)

I'm very sorry about your daughter. Dana asked me to come here to deliver a message.

MARGARET SCULLY: You've been in contact with her?

SKINNER: Yes.

(She stands.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Well, I want to know where she is and if she's okay.

SKINNER: She's okay, but she's in a very serious situation which prevents her from being here.

MARGARET SCULLY: What kind of situation?

SKINNER: One that we hope to reverse so that Dana can come back to work.

(The strange man from before walks by the room again, glancing in. They all turn and look at him.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: That man you just saw, he's been very curious about this room.

(Skinner walks out into the hallway and watches the man go. He walks back over to Albert.)

SKINNER: Who are you?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: My name is Albert Hosteen. I was asked to come here.

SKINNER: All right, Albert. Do not leave this room. Do you understand?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Yes.

(Skinner looks at Margaret then walks out. He walks quickly down the hallway and hears a door open to his left. He goes in and finds himself in a stairwell. He runs up the stairs and checks the next door. The door opens in his face, knocking him backwards. The strange man comes in and points a gun at him, but Skinner grabs his wrist and turns it quickly, then elbows him twice in the face. A second man runs up behind Skinner and starts choking him with a wire. He pulls him back to the wall as Krycek jumps down the stairs and punches Skinner with a hard right cross. He does it again, then punches him in the gut. Skinner groans with each blow. Krycek seems to be thoroughly enjoying it. He reaches into Skinner's coat pocket and takes out the digital tape. He puts it in his pocket and then reaches back, preparing to hit him one last time. He smashes Skinner across the face and Skinner slumps down to the ground. Krycek tries to shake the feeling back into his hand and Skinner's attackers all split off in different directions. Skinner lays on the floor, unconscious.)



SCENE 12
SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Krycek and his band of cohorts drive down the road and pull up to the Greenwich Inn. The Hispanic Man gets out of the driver's seat and walks into the store. The second man is sitting in the back seat.)

2ND MAN: I could use a beer. Do you want anything?

KRYCEK: No.

2ND MAN: You sure?

KRYCEK: Yeah.

(The second man gets out and walks to the store, looking back over his shoulder at the car briefly. Krycek watches him and grows tense. He looks AT THE CAR CLOCK AS IT BLINKS 12:00. His face goes blank in realization and he runs out of the car as fast as he can. The car literally shoots a fireball into the air as it explodes, knocking Krycek off his feet from twenty yards. He looks back briefly and keeps running as the car continues to burn. Krycek's ex-cohorts watch him run, knowing that they failed their mission.)

(Mulder and Scully run into the greenhouse, searching around. Thunder rumbles outside.)

MULDER: Mister Klemper? Mister Klemper?

(He looks down another aisle and goes back to the one he came through. The Well-Manicured Man walks towards them.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Hello again, young lady.

SCULLY: Where's Victor Klemper?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Oh, poor Klemper. They found him yesterday, here among his flowers. Apparently, his heart had given out.

MULDER: You killed him, didn't you?

(The Well-Manicured Man offers no response. Mulder holds up the photograph.)

You're one of the men in this photo. You knew my father.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes. Since we were young men.

MULDER: You were involved in this project. You know why the medical data was being collected.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes, I do, indeed. In 1947, a spacecraft was reportedly recovered in New Mexico. No doubt you know of this and of the reported recovery of a body at the site. These incidents not only coincided with the end of World War II, but an ignominious project which brought Nazi scientists and war criminals to this country to exploit their knowledge.

SCULLY: Operation Paper Clip.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Yes, you know of it already. And you must also know the work of Doctor Joseph Mengele, the Nazi angel of death.

SCULLY: Mengele thought that he could produce a super-race through genetic engineering.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: As did many of his colleagues at the Institute of Hereditary Biology and Racial Hygiene.

SCULLY: Like Victor Klemper?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Poor Victor. He loved his orchids. Did you know that he was able to create some of the most beautiful hybrids?

MULDER: Klemper was trying to create an alien-human hybrid. That's what I saw in the boxcar. He was using human test subjects.

SCULLY: Mulder, wait.

MULDER: My father was involved in this?

SCULLY: The technology wasn't there, Mulder. DNA wasn't even identified until 1944. This is all a lie.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: When your father realized what the medical data was being used for, he objected strenuously.

MULDER: He collected those files?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: With the threat of nuclear holocaust in the 1950s, the government instructed men like your father to gather genetic data on the general populous for the purpose of post-apocalyptic identification.

MULDER: The vaccination records. They took tissue from everyone who received a small pox inoculation.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Hundreds of millions of Americans.

MULDER: So that Victor Klemper had access to a DNA database of nearly everyone who was born since 1950.

SCULLY: Mulder, this man is telling you everything that you want to hear but it's a fabrication, it is pure science fiction. There were no experiments with aliens.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Why would I lie to you?

SCULLY: Like you said before, to protect yourself and the continuation of the Nazi agenda... human tests.

MULDER: Why was your file there, Scully?

(She looks back at him in shock that Mulder is going against her on this issue.)

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: There were current records on file.

SCULLY: Yes, but records of what, Mulder?

MULDER: Of abductions! Of abductees.

(She glares at him and storms off.)

They took my sister. Why?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: They took her as insurance because your father threatened to expose the project.

MULDER: Why her? Why not me?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: It's not for me to say but your life in danger now too. You also threaten to expose the project. You have become your father.

MULDER: Why are you telling me this?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: It's what you want to know... isn't it?

(He starts off.)

MULDER: Is there more?

(The Well-Manicured Man looks back at him.)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: More than you'll ever know.

(He walks off.)



SCENE 13
46th STREET; NEW YORK CITY

(The phone rings and the aide picks it up.)

AIDE: Yes?

KRYCEK: Can I talk to him?

AIDE: Yes, he's just arrived. One moment, please.

(He extends the phone to the Cigarette-Smoking Man.)

You have a call, sir.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Thank you.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes the phone. Cut to Krycek, who is standing at a payphone.)

Hello?

KRYCEK: I'm alive.

(Cut back to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who tries to hide his shock in front of his peers and superiors. Cut back to Krycek.)

Isn't that a surprise?

(Cut back to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who smiles, pretending to be holding a conversation with good news.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yes, good, good, good. Uh, where are you?

(Cut to Krycek, who is very angry.)

KRYCEK: Somewhere that you will never find me, you double-crossing son of a bitch.

(Cut to the Cigarette-Smoking Man. All eyes are upon him in the room.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Are you sure?

(Cut to Krycek.)

KRYCEK: I'm sure of this... if I so much as feel your presence, I'm going to make you a very, very famous man. You understand?

(Cut to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who smiles and nods as if everything is fine.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yes, thank you. I'm going to report that to the group.

(Cut to Krycek, who slams down the receiver. Cut back to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who hangs up slowly and hands the phone back to the aide.)

I've just received confirmation that the digital tape containing the stolen files was destroyed in the carbomb explosion, which killed Agent Scully's would-be assassin.

1ST ELDER: What about Mulder and Scully?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I have a meeting with the F.B.I., they, uh... they want to make a deal.

1ST ELDER: For what?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: For nothing. There'll be no deal. There's no deal to make.

(He walks out.)



SCENE 14
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT

(Mulder turns on Mrs. Mulder's bedside lamp and sits down on her bed.)

MRS. MULDER: Fox?

MULDER: Yeah.

MRS. MULDER: What time is it?

MULDER: It's after two.

MRS. MULDER: What, did you drive up here? Why didn't you call?

MULDER: I needed to see you in person. I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about something that happened a long time ago.

MRS. MULDER: Oh, Fox...

(She sits up.)

I don't remember anything, I told you before.

MULDER: Mom, listen to me. When Samantha... before she was gone, did Dad ever ask you if you had a favorite? Did he ever ask you that?

MRS. MULDER: Fox, please...

MULDER: Mom, did he ever ask you to make a choice?

MRS. MULDER: Don't do this...

(She starts to get up but he puts his hands on her cheeks.)

MULDER: Mom, listen to me! I need to know! Did he make you make a choice?

(She starts to cry.)

MRS. MULDER: No. I couldn't choose. It was your father's choice and I hated him for it. Even in his grave, I hate him still.

(They hug and she cries into his shoulder.)



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks into Skinner's office. He closes the file he was reading and looks up at Cigarette-Smoking Man, who puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Now, you wanted to see me?

(Skinner puts the file down and stands up.)

SKINNER: I have the tape you've been looking for.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Really?

SKINNER: I'm prepared to hand it over or destroy it in exchange for Mulder and Scully's safety and for their reinstatement here.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What did I tell you, Mister Skinner? I don't negotiate. Especially not with punks like you who think they can bluff me.

SKINNER: Bluff you?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You haven't got any tape. You haven't got any deal. You can't play poker if you don't have any cards, Mister Skinner. You ever wonder what it would be like to, uh... die in a plane crash? Of botulism? Even a heart attack's not uncommon for a man your age. You think I'm bluffing?

(He takes a drag and turns to walk away.)

SKINNER: I'm not finished yet.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man turns back. Skinner walks to the back door and opens it, revealing Albert Hosteen, sitting down.)

Albert?

(Albert walks in as the Cigarette-Smoking Man looks on in shock.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Yat a valgala.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What is this?

(Skinner walks up to the Cigarette-Smoking Man in front of Hosteen.)

SKINNER: This is where you pucker up and kiss my ass.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Now, listen, you...

SKINNER: Now, you listen to me, you son of a bitch! This man's name is Albert Hosteen. You should remember that. Because if Agents Mulder and Scully come down with so much as a case of the flu, Albert is prepared to recite, chapter and verse, file for file, everything on your precious tape.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It's a nice try, Skinner.

SKINNER: I'm sure you're thinking Albert is an old man and there are plenty of ways you might kill him too. Which is why, in the ancient oral tradition of his people, he's told twenty other men the information on those files. So unless you kill every Navajo living in four states... that information is available with a simple phone call. Welcome to the wonderful world of high technology.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares at Skinner in disbelief.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You're bluffing.

SKINNER: Am I?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man turns and walks out. Skinner looks at Albert, who nods in pride.)

(Mulder walks in to Melissa Scully's hospital room to find Scully sitting in a chair looking at an empty hospital bed. She looks back at him.)

SCULLY: It happened three hours ago. She went into surgery and, uh... the damage to her brain was worse than they had hoped.

(She kneels down next to her.)

Her blood pressure started to rise and, uh... she slipped away. She died for me and I tried to tell her I was sorry but I don't think she'll ever really know.

(Tears well up in her eyes and her voice weakens towards the end.)

MULDER: Oh, she knows. Melissa knows.

(Scully takes a deep breath.)

SCULLY: You were right. There is no justice.

MULDER: I don't think this is about justice, Scully.

SCULLY: Then what is it about?

MULDER: I think it's about something we have no personal choice in. I think it's about fate.

(They sit in silence for a little while.)

Skinner told me that he talked to you, that you were insistent about coming back to work. Now, if Melissa's death is...

SCULLY: I need something to put my back up against.

MULDER: I feel the same way. We've both lost so much... but I believe that what we're looking for is in the X-Files. I'm more certain than ever that the truth is in there.

SCULLY: I've heard the truth, Mulder. Now what I want are the answers.

(He kneels up next to her and puts his arm around her. She leans her head against his chest as they look at the empty bed.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
NIGHT

(Night outside an almost deserted video game parlor in a strip mall. Camera goes from car to inside the parlor where a guy, JACK HAMMOND, about 20, is playing a Mortal Kombat type game. VIRTUA FIGHTER 2. DARREN PETER OSWOLD, a shy nerdy looking teenager, approaches him, hesitantly.)

DARREN: Hey, I, uh. I was playing that.

(JACK gives no response.)

DARREN: Ah, I just went to go take a whiz and now Im back.

(YOU LOSE appears on the video screen.)

FEMALE GAME VOICE: Even good guys blow it!

JACK: Damn! (slaps machine, then turns to DARREN) You got a problem?

DARREN: Uh, uh. this was my game. I was playing here.

JACK: Were you, pinhead? Now youre not.

DARREN: Oh (chuckles) Maybe you didnt hear me right. I, uh  I said it was my game.

(ZERO, the teenage counter guy at the parlor comes over to them.)

ZERO: (to JACK) Its his game. Man, Id step aside if I were you.

JACK: All right. You guys want to play a game. Well play a game. (grabs DARREN by the collar) Well play a game. I go first.

(JACK pushes DARREN down. All power in the building suddenly goes out.)

ZERO: Oh, man. You shouldnt have done that.

JACK: Why. Whats he gonna do?

(Jukebox starts up on its own playing "Ring the Bells," by James - slow pretty song. ZERO is apprehensive. JACK looks freaked out. DARREN just stands, adjusts his hat and stares at JACK.)

DARREN: So, is it my turn now?

JACK: (nervous, but trying not to show it) Im not wasting my time.

(JACK runs out to his car with AB pizza sign on it. He turns on the radio. It is playing the same song, "Ring the Bells." He cant turn it off or change the station. DARREN watches from inside the parlor. JACK tries to drive away, but car skids and stops. AB Pizza sign bursts into flame, then JACK begins shaking as if electricity is pouring through him. He is flailing so hard he knocks a window out. Finally, he falls to the side, dead, smoke pouring out of his mouth. Inside, ZERO smiles and holds up a quarter for DARREN.)

DARREN: (inside, starting the video game) Feel a new record coming on, man.

(ZERO watches silently, not upset.)

SCENE 2
LOUIS P. WHARTON COUNTY BUILDING
CONNERVILLE, OKLAHOMA

(SCULLY is doing an autopsy on JACK. MULDER and STAN THE CORONER observe.)

SCULLY: Both eardrums are ruptured. Cataracts over both eyes. Probably heat-induced.

MULDER: Probably? (holding up plastic wrapped black heart) It looks like his heart was cooked right in his chest.

STAN THE CORONER: I have to admit, I have never seen that kind of localized tissue damage.

SCULLY: Well, there is extensive charring along the sternum with concomitant rib fractures consistent with electrocution or exposure to high voltage direct current. But I see no point of contact.

STAN THE CORONER: Best I could figure the lightning struck the car and killed the kid on contact.

(SHERIFF TELLER stands quietly in the doorway.)

SCULLY: Did you find contact wounds on any of the other five victims?

STAN THE CORONER: Id have to look at my notes. I mean its pretty clear to me what killed these kids.

MULDER: Lightning.

STAN THE CORONER: Well, yeah.

SCULLY: Are you aware that something like 60 people die from lightning strikes across the country each year and five of those happened right here in Connerville?

STAN THE CORONER: I know its statistically improbable, but

(SHERIFF TELLER enters the examination room on the defensive.)

SHERIFF TELLER: There were only four deaths. Its okay, Stan. You dont have to defend your work. (pats him on the back) Give us a minute, would you, please?

STAN THE CORONER: (glad for an excuse to leave) Yeah, sure, Ill be in my office. (he leaves)

SHERIFF TELLER: (to MULDER and SCULLY) My name is Teller. Im with the Johnston County Sheriffs office. I heard there was an FBI investigation.

SCULLY: Yes, Im Agent Scully.

SHERIFF TELLER: I know who you are. I just wonder what the hell youre doing here.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. MULDER shrugs and steps aside leaving SCULLY to do all the talking while he wanders around the examination room.)

SCULLY: (not thrilled to be talking to this hostile Sheriff) These deaths match other cases of multiple fatalities attributed to lightning with the same inconclusive forensic evidence.

SHERIFF TELLER: Do you know anything about lightening, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes, I know a little.

SHERIFF TELLER: (condescending) Did you know lightning kills several people at home in the shower or on the phone? That people have seen it dancing on the ground like balls? Scientists will tell you, push come to shove that they really dont know what makes lightning work at all.

SCULLY: No, I didnt know that.

SHERIFF TELLER: Well, I know that because I have breakfast with those scientists every morning down at the local diner.

SCULLY: I dont understand.

SHERIFF TELLER: (nasty) Thats as clear as glass. Do you know what we manufacture in Connerville? What one of our little local commodities is? We make lightning. (MULDER looks up) Down at the Astadourian Lightning Observatory out on Route 4. 100 ionized rods pointing up into the sky designed to stimulate lightning.

SCULLY: I didnt know that either.

SHERIFF TELLER: Thats because you didnt do your homework, did you. (MULDER comes closer to them) You came here to do work thats already been done.

SCULLY: With all due respect, sir, these autopsies dont quite add up.

SHERIFF TELLER: Based on what?

SCULLY: Based on my opinion as a medical doctor.

SHERIFF TELLER: (smiles) Then based on your medical opinion, if you had to give one, what do you think this boy died of?

(SCULLY looks to MULDER. He nods imperceptibly, then backs away again.)

SCULLY: Well, since there is no other explanation right now, Id have to concur with the coroner that lightning is the most probable cause of death.

SHERIFF TELLER: And I wont have you or anyone else suggesting otherwise to this boys family.

(SHERIFF TELLER exits.)

SCULLY: (to MULDER, accusingly) Feel free to jump in anytime.

MULDER: (smiles) Why? You were doing just fine.

SCULLY: (sighs) Do you have a theory on whats going on here?

MULDER: I just dont think its lightning.

(He goes into the hall, she follows.)

SCULLY: Mulder, wait. What are you expecting to find here?

MULDER: I dont know yet.

SCULLY: (trying to keep up) Could you stop for a second, please? (MULDER stops and faces her) Look, after everything that weve just been through, after all that weve just seen, I hope youre not thinking this has anything to do with government conspiracies or UFOs.

MULDER: (smiling again) None of the evidence so far indicates either of those possibilities.

SCULLY: Well, what are you looking for? I mean, just because a forensic profile isnt cut and dried doesnt mean its not true.

MULDER: So Tellers explanation works for you?

SCULLY: The only possible scientific conclusion is that Jack Hammond was killed by lightning.

MULDER: Well, then this local lightening is a lot more predictable than Teller realizes. It seems to have a definite preference for the type of person it strikes.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: Well, look at the files, look at all the other victims, theyre all male age 17 to 21, just like Jack Hammond. At least lets go see where Jack Hammond was killed. Maybe well find something we both can agree on.



SCENE 3

(Day. Outside the video game parlor. SCULLY looks at JACKs burned car, MULDER at skid marks on the ground nearby.)

SCULLY: Police found Hammond in his car at 17 minutes past midnight. The entire electrical system was shorted out. All the circuitry and wiring had melted.

MULDER: Looks like he was trying to get away in a big hurry.

SCULLY: Get away from what?

MULDER: What time was Jack Hammonds last pizza delivery?

SCULLY: (Checks notes) Sometime between 11:00 and 11:30. Why?

MULDER: All these stores would have been closed by 11:00 except maybe this one.

(They go into the game parlor. Sound of Sonic the Hedgehog. MULDER and SCULLY go to talk to ZERO. ZERO is counting and rolling quarters)

ZERO: 78.9

SCULLY: Excuse me.

ZERO: Oh uh  101.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a little smile and goes off to look at the games leaving SCULLY to interview by herself.)

SCULLY: Whats your name?

ZERO: Uh, Zero.

SCULLY: Zero, do you mind if we talk for a minute?

ZERO: What for?

SCULLY: Im with the FBI.

ZERO: (trying to stay cool) All right.

SCULLY: Were you working here last night?

ZERO: Sure. Every night.

SCULLY: Do you recognize this person? (holds up picture of JACK HAMMOND)

ZERO: (quickly) Nah, never seen him.

SCULLY: Why dont you take a closer look. He was here between 11:00 and 11:30. He was killed in the parking lot. That was his car. So, if you were standing here at this counter you must have seen it happen.

ZERO: (fake revelation) Oh, that was him.

(SCULLY gives ZERO an "Im on to you" look. MULDER, going through games, looks at machine DARREN and the JACK played on last night. High scores list is full of DPO.)

ZERO: Last I saw, dude fed a bunch of quarters into this one. (leads SCULLY to the game machine where MULDER is standing) Then the ambulance shows up.

SCULLY: Before the ambulance showed up did you notice anything unusual outside?

ZERO: Its hard to tell. The place gets pretty loud and all. Kind of hard to hear much of anything.

SCULLY: Did you notice anyone else around who might have seen something?

ZERO: (playing dumb) I cant .. uh I dont really remember.

MULDER: Look, Scully, take a look at this.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: What were the names of the other victims?

SCULLY: (looking at her notes) Uh Corey Huffard, Darren Oswald, Burke Roberts and Billy ---

MULDER: (interrupting) Darren Oswald. Whats his middle name?

SCULLY: Darren Peter. Why?

MULDER: (indicating highscores) DPO. Darren Peter Oswald. Of the five victims wasnt he the only one to survive?

SCULLY: Yes.

MULDER: Well, he was here last night.



SCENE 4

(Kiveats Garage. POV is from under a car. The song, "Hey Man, Nice Shot" by Filter is heard as womans legs approach. They belong to SHARON KIVEAT, attractive, late twenties. DARREN is watching from a rolling work bed under a car.)

DARREN: (rolling out from under car, getting view up her skirt) Hey, Mrs. Kiveat.

SHARON: (startled) God, Darren, you scared me.

DARREN: What?

SHARON: Wheres Frank?

DARREN: Oh, hes out on a tow. Is there anything I can help you with?

SHARON: No. No, were supposed to go to dinner.

DARREN: Are you hungry? I can get you something to eat. You want something? I got jelly doughnuts.

SHARON: No. Thank you.

DARREN: Are you sure? Theyre from yesterday, but theyre still good. I had one. (she is very uncomfortable around him) Hey. Mrs. Kiveat? Uh about those things that I said yesterday, I

(FRANK KIVEAT, SHARONs husband and DARRENs boss drives up in tow truck. Early thirties, nice looking.)

KIVEAT: Sorry Im late, hon. I had to tow that poor pizza delivery kids car. Nice to see you. (kisses her hello) Oh, hey Darren. I got a call on the radio. Some people are coming to see you. They say theyre with the FBI.

(DARREN looks casual watching SHARON and KIVEAT leave.)



SCENE 5

(Garage, later. MULDER and SCULLY interviewing DARREN. They show him the picture of JACK HAMMOND.)

DARREN: This is the dude that died, right? Its pretty harsh, man. So howd it happen?

MULDER: They say he was struck by lightning.

DARREN: (chuckling) Yeah, that happens.

MULDER: Right outside the video arcade. Not a cloud in the sky from what we can tell. You were there last night, werent you? Broke your own record too.

DARREN: (modest) Yeah.

MULDER: You must have seen something.

DARREN: Oh, no, man, when Im into my game, man, Im there, you know? Its like a nuclear explosion could go off, right, and I wouldnt even notice.

MULDER: Can I ask you a personal question?

DARREN: Yeah.

MULDER: Do you consider yourself a lucky person?

DARREN: Me?

MULDER: Yeah.

DARREN: I dont think so.

MULDER: Im just thinking about all the people that got hit by lightning, youre the only one to survive. Dont you think youre lucky?

DARREN: Yeah, I guess if you look at it like that you could be right. I could be considered lucky.

(SCULLY notices smoke coming from MULDERs breast pocket.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Whats in your pocket?

(MULDER quickly pulls his smoking cell phone out of his pocket.)

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: I dont know. (drops it as it burns his fingers) It just got hot all of a sudden.

DARREN: (not surprised) Bummer. Im going to go now.

MULDER: (sarcastically, nursing his hand) Thanks for your help.

DARREN: Yep. Ill see you. (he leaves)

(MULDER and SCULLY look down at the cell phone, then at each other.)



SCENE 6

(Night. OSWOLD house. DARRENs mother, MRS OSWALD is watching TV. DARREN enters and watches her from the doorway.)

TV TALK SHOW: And, um, and I've always been, ever since I was a teenager I've been into piercing and sadomasochism and, um, rebellion, extremism. That's something I think that's skipped over.

(Channel suddenly changes to a rock music video.)

MRS OSWALD: (speaking over her shoulder, irritated) Quit fooling with the remote.

(She finds the remote under her hip, and changes the channel.)

TV TALK SHOW: I used to sleep in a belt at night

DARREN: Why do you watch that stuff, anyway? Theyre a bunch of losers.

MRS OSWALD: At least theyre on TV. I dont see you on TV.

(DARREN belches loudly.)

MRS OSWALD: Manners dont cost, Darren. Theyre FREE! What girls going to want a belching fool like you?

(Knock at the door.)

ZERO: (voice, outside) Hey, Darren?

DARREN: Maybe youd be surprised.

ZERO: (voice, outside) Dude?

(DARREN changes Channel again. MRS OSWALD, exasperated, tries to change it back, but only gets static. DARREN goes outside to ZERO. They walk up into a field.)

ZERO: You wont believe it, man. You wont believe who came by today.

DARREN: Let me guess. The FBI?

ZERO: How did you know?

DARREN: They came by the garage.

ZERO: They did!? How did they find you?

DARREN: You tell me. You must have said something.

ZERO: No, man, I didnt say squat. Wait up. (tosses beer can over his shoulder) Come on, man. You know I wouldnt do that to you.

DARREN: I think you want to be someplace else right now. Cause Im in the mood for a little barbecue.

ZERO: No. Man. Not the cows, again. Come on, dont. Dont do this. Not now.

DARREN: (shouting up to the sky in middle of field near some cows) All right, Im listening! Im ready.

ZERO: Dont do it man.

DARREN: Im ready, so come on down!

ZERO: Im outta here! (runs down the hill)

DARREN: Im right here. Come and get me! Come on man! Im waiting. Come on, man, talk to me! Come ON!!!!!!

(Lightening flashes down into DARREN. He shakes with it for a minute, then falls to the ground. ZERO comes to check on him.)

ZERO: Dude? Are you okay, man?

DARREN: (sits up and smiles) Excellent.



SCENE 7

(Next day, same field. SHERIFF TELLER and team are investigating dead cows. MULDER and SCULLY drive up.)

SHERIFF TELLER: (on phone) Well, have that faxed to my office. Yeah, right away if you can. Thank you, Dean. I appreciate it.

SCULLY: What happened here, Sheriff?

SHERIFF TELLER: Three dead cows. How do you think they died?

MULDER: Lightning.

SHERIFF TELLER: Thats right. I just got off with Dean Greiner at the observatory, which by the way is just about a mile through those trees.

SCULLY: Did they report lightning last night?

SHERIFF TELLER: They can detect every flash of lightning on this planet. Did you know that? Each one emits radio waves at the same exact frequency.

MULDER: The Schuman Resonance. Eight cycles per second. You can pick it up on any transistor radio. (needling SHERIFF TELLER) You see that, Sheriff? I did my homework.

SHERIFF TELLER: Not much question that lightning killed these cows last night. Just like it killed Jack Hammond the night before last.

MULDER: (looking at dead cow) Oh, thats certainly the way it looks.

SHERIFF TELLER: Let me show you something else. Its right over here. You see this? Do you know what this is?

MULDER: Looks like a fulgurite. That only happens with lightning when sandy soil fuses into glass from the heat of a discharge.

SHERIFF TELLER: How much more proof do you need? Id say your business here is finished. (he leaves)

SCULLY: Mulder, Id have to say I think hes right.

MULDER: That were wasting our time chasing lightning?

SCULLY: Well, look at the evidence. What else could it be?

MULDER: I dont know yet. (strains a little as he pulls the fulgurite out of the ground) This is the first lightning strike Ive ever seen that left behind a footprint.

(MULDER holds up the glass fulgurite. A partial footprint is clearly visible.)



SCENE 8
FORENSIC LAB
JOHNSTON COUNTY SHERIFFS OFFICE

(Crime Lab. Ceramic!SCULLY is making a plaster mold of the footprint.)

SCULLY: Here we go. Well, considering its a partial imprint theres a lot of information here.

MULDER: Thats great. Now can you make me a little cherub that squirts water?

SCULLY: (ignoring his joke, but with a smile) The tread looks like a standard military boot mens  size 8½.

MULDER: (really impressed) 8½? Thats pretty impressive, Scully.

SCULLY: Well, it says it right here on the bottom.

MULDER: (taking it from her) Oooo.

SCULLY: But I may have something even better. When I was cleaning the imprint to take the mold I found trace amounts of a viscous substance actually imbedded in the fulgurite.

MULDER: (looks at vial she hands him) What is it?

SCULLY: Id have to conduct a chemical analysis to be sure, but, uh it looks like antifreeze.

MULDER: Darren Oswald.

SCULLY: But why? And how?

MULDER: I dont know, Scully, but lets go see if the shoe fits.



SCENE 9

(Highway intersection with traffic light. Suddenly both directions are green. Near car crash in intersection. Drivers yell at each other. DARREN is sitting on nearby billboard laughing to himself. ZERO climbs up and sits beside DARREN.)

ZERO: Dude! Whats happening? Whats going on?

DARREN: Ah, I dont know. Nothin.

ZERO: You know, I been thinking

DARREN: First time for everything.

(Both lights turn green again. Two cars narrowly miss each other, but dont skid around like the previous near miss.)

DARREN: Ah, damn. ABS brakes.

ZERO: Im thinking we should go somewhere.get out of this hole. Maybe check out Las Vegas. *You* could do some serious damage someplace like that.

DARREN: Im not going to Las Vegas. Im not going anywhere, not without Mrs. Kiveat.

ZERO: What makes you think shes going to want to go anywhere with you? She failed you, remember? She thinks youre a retard.

DARREN: Forget school, man. Im talking about proving my love.

ZERO: How you going to do that?

DARREN: By letting her know how I feel how all I ever think about is being with her.

ZERO: Wake up, dude. Theres another slight problem. Shes married to your boss.

DARREN: Maybe I could fry him.

ZERO: Dude, hes your boss.

DARREN: Not if hes dead he wont be. (laughs)

ZERO: Are you high? With the FBI hanging around? Forget about it, okay? You cant compete with Frank. Hes good-looking, hes got his own shop plus, he fixes things instead of just smashing stuff up. A woman like that wants someone special.

DARREN: Im special.

ZERO: Yeah, right.

DARREN: No, Im gonna show her just how special I am.

(Light go both green again. Bad car crash.)

DARREN: (laughing) Whoa! That was a good one. Come on, man. Lets go check it out!

(DARREN climbs down off the billboard to go check out the damage. ZERO slowly follows.)



SCENE 10

(OSWALD house. MULDER and SCULLY interviewing MRS. OSWALD. They are at door of DARRENs messy room.)

MRS OSWALD: Darren aint worth much. Im the first one to say it, but he wouldnt hurt a soul. What kind of troubles he in, anyway?

MULDER: Can we have a few minutes, Mrs. Oswald? (She lets them into the bedroom and leaves.) Thank you.

(MULDER and SCULLY look around the room. SCULLY looks through the closet, and finds a shoe. MULDER sits on bed and looks through a porn magazine.)

SCULLY: Mulder

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Weve got a size match.

MULDER: (looking at centerfold) Eight ½?

SCULLY: Yeah, but it still doesnt prove that he killed Jack Hammond.

(SCULLY looks down at the magazine in MULDERs hands.)

SCULLY: Im surprised you havent already read that issue.

MULDER: (unashamed) Oh, I have. April is the cruelest month. But mine didnt come with this. I found that between Miss April and "Women of the Ivy League." (hands her cut out picture of SHARON KIVEAT.)

SCULLY: Who is she?

MULDER: I dont know, but it looks like its from some kind of yearbook photo, see?

("Gravenhurst Eagles" is on the back of the picture.)

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. theres a yearbook in Darrens closet.

(They thumb through yearbook.)

SCULLY: Her name is Sharon Kiveat.

MULDER: Kiveat the garage where Darren works is called Kiveat Auto Body.

(SCULLY gives him a "nice catch" look.)



SCENE 11

(Crash scene. Ambulance arrives. KIVEAT arrives in his tow truck.)

KIVEAT: What happened?

TRAFFIC COP: Some kid got center-punched. Just got his license too. Hes pretty bad off.

KIVEAT: Geez. Thats rough. (in pain holding his left arm) You guys ready for me to start clearing the road?

TRAFFIC COP: Im just directing traffic. Youd better check with the deputy. Hey, pal, are you okay?

KIVEAT: Yeah.

TRAFFIC COP: You dont look so good.

(KIVEAT sees DARREN at the side of the road watching him then collapses in great pain.)

TRAFFIC COP: Hey, somebody get the EMS guys! Take take it easy. Youre gonna be okay.

(EMS guys run over.)

EMS 1: What happened?

TRAFFIC COP: He just collapsed.

EMS 1: Pulse is thready.

EST 2: Ill get the kit.

EMS 1: Yeah. Its all right, buddy. Here we go.

(DARREN approaches KIVEAT.)

ZERO: (to DARREN) Where you going? What are you doing? Lets get out of here.

(EMS 2 gets back to EMS one with the defibrillator.)

EMS 1: Lets have it. I got one, two, three. All right. Give me 300 Joules.

EMS 2: Its already charged.

EMS 1: No, its not. Somethings not working here. Get the backup. Come on.

(EMS 2 runs back to the ambulance.)

DARREN: (leaning over KIVEAT, slow motion from KIVEATs POV) Dont worry, Mr. Kiveat. Ive seen how they do it on TV.

(DARREN places his hands on KIVEAT and jolts him with electricity. Machine begins beeping.)

EMS 1: Wait. we got a rhythm. How the hell..? (looks at DARREN)

DARREN: (grinning) Rescue 911.



SCENE 12

(Hospital. MULDER is looking through a file at a nurses station and sees SHARON KIVEAT drop a glass of water at the cooler. He goes and fills another cup for her.)

MULDER: Let me give you a hand with that.

SHARON: Thank you.

MULDER: Mrs. Kiveat? My name is Fox Mulder. Im with the FBI. I know this is a hard time but Id like to ask you some questions.

SHARON: You were in my husbands garage yesterday.

MULDER: Yes.

(Pause. SHARON struggles to keep composure.)

SHARON: Im sorry, I cant.

MULDER: Id like to ask you about Darren Oswald. He was at the scene of the accident, wasnt he?

SHARON: Please, I need to see my husband. (she leaves and goes into KIVEATs room)

(SCULLY approaches MULDER.)

SCULLY: I just talked to one of the EMS workers. He was pretty rattled.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: Frank Kiveats electrocardiogram. (shows him) See that spike there? That indicates that some kind of electrical intervention started his heart. Except according to the EMS worker, the defibrillator wouldnt charge. The paddles were dead.

MULDER: How did he explain this?

SCULLY: He didnt. All he saw was Darren Oswald touching Kiveats chest.

MULDER: Ive been going over Oswalds chart. Theres something I want you to take a look at.

SCULLY: (reading) He was admitted to the ER five months ago in cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure. Class three burns on the back of his skull resuscitated after Hang on, this is odd. His blood test showed acute hypokalemia.

MULDER: Yeah. What is that?

SCULLY: A severe chemical imbalance characterized by high sodium and low potassium levels.

MULDER: Electrolytes, right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: And what do electrolytes do?

SCULLY: Well, among other things they generate the electrical impulses in our bodies. Like every time our heart beats or a neuron fires.

MULDER: Okay, its a leap, Scully, but what if Oswalds electrolyte imbalance is somehow enabling him to generate electricity at levels much higher than normal?

SCULLY: Our body doesnt work like that

MULDER: Unless his body is abnormally conductive. Because if that heel print is Oswalds, that means he conducted millions of volts of electricity into the ground and then just walked away.

SCULLY: Youre saying hes some kind of lightning rod?

MULDER: No, Im saying that he *is* lightning and weve got to get to him before he strikes again.

(SCULLY looks at the printout then at MULDER.)



SCENE 13

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the OSWOLD house. DARREN is walking across the field. Tries to get away from MULDER and SCULLY. They follow him.)

MULDER: Darren. Darren! Darren(grabs his shoulder)

DARREN: Dont you touch me, man!

MULDER: (hand up) Relax, Darren.

DARREN: Dont you touch me!

SCULLY: (hands up) We just want to talk to you, thats all. Just ask you a few more questions.

DARREN: I didnt do anything.

(They go to the car.)



SCENE 14

(Police Station. Interrogation room. SCULLY in the middle of interview with DARREN.)

DARREN: How many times do I have to say it? I dont know how all those people died.

SCULLY: Why did you run when you saw us?

DARREN: I was taking a walk. Now, thats not against the law, is it? Anyway, you guys should be giving me a medal. I mean, I saved my bosss life.

SCULLY: Were not so sure.

DARREN: Why? Who told you that? Who have you been talking to? You been talking to Zero? He the one who told you that?

(SCULLY sighs, leaves the room. MULDER is waiting for her in the hallway.)

MULDER: What did he say?

SCULLY: Not much. Except that hes a hero.

MULDER: How did he say he revived Kiveat?

SCULLY: CPR. He claims he paid attention in health class.

MULDER: (quietly, just to SCULLY) I dont think he just resuscitated Frank Kiveat, Scully. I think he set the whole thing up.

SCULLY: How? By causing Kiveats heart attack?

MULDER: Did you see what he did to my phone?

SCULLY: So what? Are we supposed to charge him with assaulting a cellular phone?

MULDER: I think we should run a full set of lab tests on this kid, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, look where we are. We dont have the capability or time to perform those tests. And without a confession we can only keep him in custody for 72 hours.

MULDER: I can think of only one other person that might be able to help us.



SCENE 15

(KIVEAT house. MULDER and SCULLY knock. SHARON KIVEAT opens the door.)

MULDER: Mrs. Kiveat.

SHARON: Please, I I cant do this now. Im, Im just leaving for the hospital.

MULDER: Darren Oswalds in custody, Mrs. Kiveat. We arrested him this afternoon. But we cant press criminal charges without your help.

SCULLY: Is it okay if we come in?

(Later, they sit in SHARONs living room.)

SHARON: I teach remedial reading at the high school. Darren was my student.

SCULLY: How would you describe your relationship with him?

SHARON: Well, Im not blind. I knew he had a crush on me, but, uh I felt sorry for him. I thought he was just  I, I, it just seemed he had more than his share of bad luck.

SCULLY: Did you get him the job at your husbands garage?

SHARON: Yeah, and then, about six months ago, I started getting these phone calls. Someone would call and then hang up.

SCULLY: How did you know it was Darren?

SHARON: The way he looked at me in the garage -- the phone calls made me feel the same way. I just knew.

MULDER: When did you first suspect that Darren was involved in something more than prank calls?

SHARON: He told me.

MULDER: He actually confessed to killing those people?

SHARON: No, but he told me that he had powers. (MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.) Dangerous powers.

MULDER: When was this?

SHARON: Right after the last boy was killed.

MULDER: Jack Hammond?

SHARON: See, at first, I didnt believe him. I thought he was just mouthing off. But after what happened today

MULDER: Did you tell anyone?

SHARON: Who would have believed me? (MULDER and SCULLY share another look.) And I was afraid. I was afraid of what he might do to me and what he would. do to my husband.

SCULLY: Well, you dont have to be afraid any more. You and your husband are safe as long as we can count on your testimony.



SCENE 16

(Prison. MULDER and SCULLY enter the interrogation room. Only a Deputy is there.)

MULDER: Wheres Oswald?

SHERIFF TELLER: (behind them) I sent him home.

(MULDER and SCULLY turn, surprised.)

MULDER: You released him? When?

SHERIFF TELLER: After I read your arrest report.

MULDER: Ill go call Sharon Kiveat. (leaves quickly)

SHERIFF TELLER: (to SCULLY) "Suspicion of homicide by emission of direct electric current?" You dont really believe this.

SCULLY: I believe that Darren Oswald was involved somehow in the deaths of those four people. And I believe it was irresponsible for you to let him go.

SHERIFF TELLER: Let me get this straight, now. Youre telling me this kids throwing lightning bolts.

SCULLY: In effect.

SHERIFF TELLER: In effect? Theres no scientific basis for that claim. This is speculation based on nothing. You have no hard evidence, no proof

SCULLY: You said yourself, Sheriff, not even science can explain how lightning works.

(MULDER returns, concerned.)

MULDER: Mrs. Kiveats not home.

SCULLY: Shes on her way to the hospital.

(MULDER and SCULLY run out. SHERIFF TELLER looks a little worried.)



SCENE 17

(Night. Video game parlor. Power goes out except for DARRENs favorite game. ZERO, alone, looks around nervously.)

ZERO: Dude? (Jukebox starts up.) Come on, man, where are you? What are you doing, man?! I said I didnt tell them! (Frantically unlocks door and goes outside.) God! I didnt say nothing, man! I swear! Why are you doing this, man! Were buddies!

(Lightning hits him, and he falls dead to the ground, quarters spilling from his hands and pockets. DARREN, from the roof looks down at ZEROs body.)



SCENE 18
FELTON COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
FELTON, OKLAHOMA

(Hospital. MULDER and SCULLY exit elevator and approach nurses station.)

MULDER: (showing badge to a nurse) Excuse me, miss? Call security. Have them deny entry to the hospital to everyone except emergency personnel.

(They arrive at KIVEATs room. SHARON is with her unconscious husband.)

SCULLY: Sharon?

SHARON: What is it?

SCULLY: We need you to come with us right away.

SHARON: Why? Whats wrong?

MULDER: Darren Oswald. He was released from custody.

SHARON: But how? How - how could that happen? You said that we didnt have to worry, that we were safe.

SCULLY: Look, we dont have much time. Come with us and well tell you everything.

SHARON: The doctor said my husband cannot leave this room. I am not going to leave him here.

MULDER: Ill stay with him. Go with Agent Scully.

SHARON: No.

SCULLY: Sharon, please.

(Lights go out.)

MULDER: Hes here.

(Elevator dings. MULDER and SCULLY run to the elevator and pull out their guns. Elevator opens. ZEROs body is in elevator. SCULLY checks for pulse.)

SCULLY: Hes dead.

NURSE: Oh my God.

SCULLY: How many other access points to this floor?

NURSE: Other than the elevator, just the stairway.

MULDER: (to SCULLY as he runs off) Stay with them.

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Im going after Oswald.

(Gun drawn, MULDER walks through red lit stairway. Sees electric door panel sparking. DARREN walks through dark halls then pushes back curtain in KIVEATs room.)

DARREN: Mrs. Kiveat?

SCULLY: (from behind, holding gun) Darren, dont move.

DARREN: Where is she?

(SHARON appears behind SCULLY. DARREN advances on them.)

SCULLY: I said dont move. Darren.

DARREN: Mrs. Kiveat?

SCULLY: Stop. Im warning you.

DARREN: (holding out his hand to SHARON) All right, come with me. Please, Mrs. Kiveat because theres some things theres stuff that I need to tell you.

SCULLY: I want you step back inside that room.

DARREN: Are you coming with me, Mrs. Kiveat?

SCULLY: Shes not going anywhere with you, Darren.

DARREN: (threatening) I can hurt you.

SCULLY: I can hurt you too. Im going to give you three seconds. One

DARREN: Now, Im done fooling around now!

(SHARON steps between them. SCULLY give her a "What the *bleep* are you doing!" look.)

MRS. KIVEAT: Stop it! (to DARREN) Ill go with you. Okay? If thats what you want, Ill go. Just stop it.

SCULLY: Sharon, we can work this all out, right here.

SHARON: No, we cant.

DARREN: (mesmerized by SHARON) All right. All right, then.

(SHARON goes with DARREN. SCULLY watches them, frustrated.)



SCENE 19

(Night. DARREN and MRS. KIVEAT walking outside the hospital hand in hand.)

DARREN: You were the only person that was ever nice to me. You know that? I mean .. Hey, you remember that first day in class when you wore that green dress with the yellow flowers on it? And when you stood in front of the window you could almost see through it?

SHARON: (nervous, trying to get information) Where - where are we going? Where are you taking me?

DARREN: I dont know. Anywhere you want to go. I got money from a cash machine, you know. Plus, you know, we can take any car you want. You know, you just take your pick, you know. I mean, we can take an Accord or a Maxima. Do you like any of those? Or hey, you know, if you dont want to go Japanese, you know, how about a Taurus?

(Looks over at and starts [probably] MULDER and SCULLYs car with a grin.)

DARREN: Nah, youre right. You know, all these cars suck. Well just boost one of them for right now and then, well trade it later.

(SHERIFF TELLER drives up and gets out of the car.)

DARREN: Just take it easy, Mrs. Kiveat, all right?

(SHARON takes off running. DARREN watches her go, disbelieving.)

DARREN: No. Mrs. Kiveat?

SHERIFF TELLER: Hey! Come over here. Come on over here!

(DARREN runs after SHARON. MULDER grabs SHARON as she runs past him and puts his hand over her mouth.)

DARREN: (looking for her) Mrs. Kiveat? Mrs. Kiveat, where are you? (upset) Ah, come on now. I said Id take care of you! What else did you want? Id have given you anything. (crying) Anything you wanted! Mrs. Kiveat!

SHERIFF TELLER: (coming up to DARREN) Ok, son. Turn around. Lets go. Look, I dont know what trouble youre up to but I want some answers.

DARREN: NO!! I WANT SOME ANSWERS!! (storm begins building) Where is she? Come on, now, youre PISSING ME OFF!!!

(MULDER leaves SHARON and holds gun on DARREN.)

MULDER: (yelling) Teller, get out of there!

DARREN: TELLL MEEE WHERE SHE IS!!!!!!!!!

(Violent lightening strike hits tree, then arcs through SHERIFF TELLERs flashlight killing him. Bolt hits DARREN. He staggers, then falls as MULDER watches. SCULLY joins MULDER and they look at the bodies.)



SCENE 20
OKLAHOMA STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(SCULLY walks down the hall and joins MULDER where he is looking in DARRENs room.)

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with the coroner. Hes ruling Tellers death accidental.

MULDER: (sarcastic) Lightning? What about the scientists at the observatory? What do they have to say?

SCULLY: They also reported lightning last night. I talked to the DA. He has no idea how to begin building a case.

MULDER: What about the tests I asked for?

SCULLY: They came in five minutes ago.

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: Nothing unusual was detected, Mulder. The electrolytes, the blood gas levels, brain wave activity. Based on the science of all the data thats been gathered

MULDER: Darren Oswald is a perfectly normal, perfectly healthy kid. You believe that, Scully? (she looks at him) Neither do I.

(They watch DARREN watching TV. Heavy metal music. Name of song - "Diarrhea!" His face is deadpan as he stares not quite at the screen then right at MULDER and SCULLY. Camera pans over to show the screen, channels changing. Weather channel, a game show, a cooking show where someone is pouring a brown sauce that looks, well, like the name of the song in DARRENs head. Last shot of DARREN, then static out and into credits.)

[THE END]
                                    CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S FINAL REPOSE



SCENE 1
ST. PAUL; SEPTEMBER 16

(Clyde Bruckman, an elderly insurance salesman, is reading from a tabloid newspaper called "The Midnight Inquisitor" with The Stupendous Yappi, a psychic, on the cover. Over his picture, it says "The Stupendous Yappi's Foreseeable Future. There is also a picture of J.D. Salinger in the left column.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: "I foresee a rock affair between superstar Madonna and super-witness Kato Kaelin." Well, that's a gimme, that's not really going out on a limb, is it? "I foresee Author J.D. Salinger finally publishing a new novel and hitting the talk show circuit to promote it." Hmmm... that's just playing the odds. "I foresee the revelation that not Elvis, but rather Buddy Holly is still alive, having faked his own death so many years ago. Holly will not only reemerge but also regroup with the Crickets and they will headline in next year's Lalapalaza..." Lalapaz... pazoola?

(He looks at the clerk.)

What the hell is Lalapalazo?

CLERK: Who's Buddy Holly?

(Bruckman glares at him and walks over.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Just give me my lotto ticket and, uh, a pint of malt scotch whiskey.

CLERK: Anything else?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Yeah.

(He reaches over and throws the magazine on the desk.)

One of these.

(He walks out of the store singing to himself, looking at his lotto ticket.)

"That'll be the day when I die... that'll be the day..."

(He walks into the street and nearly collides with a young man. They try to get around each other but always end up walking in the same direction to. Bruckman sighs and stops.)

Sorry.

(He walks around the young man.)

PUPPET: Don't apologize. You're a better dancer than my last date.

(Puppet continues on his way and walks into a palm reader shop. Police sirens wail in the background. Inside, Madame Zelma is reading Puppet's palm. She talks with a fake Russian accent.)

MADAME ZELMA: So, what has brought you to Madame Zelma?

PUPPET: Well... can you really know everything about me just by looking at my hands?

MADAME ZELMA: Mm-hmm. The palms tell me all.

PUPPET: I would just like for you to be able to tell me why I am going to be doing the things I'm going to be doing?

MADAME ZELMA: Madame Zelma, she is a palm reader, not a psychologist.

PUPPET: I know, I know, it's just... I think I've somehow caught a glimpse of my own future, myself. And I see me doing things that... that just seem so out of character for me. I mean, these are things that not only do I not want to be doing, but I can't even imagine myself capable of doing and yet, there I am. I'm doing them.

(Zelma tries to pull her hands away but Puppet grabs onto her wrists. Her fake accent goes away.)

MADAME ZELMA: Mister... please, you're hurting me.

PUPPET: I know, I know... and I'm sorry. But you're a fortune teller.

MADAME ZELMA: No...

PUPPET: You should've seen this coming.

MADAME ZELMA: Please...

(Puppet jumps onto her, knocking over things, and starts to choke her. As they are reflected in the crystal ball, she gags and struggles to no avail.)

SCENE 2
NORTH MINNEAPOLIS; 3 DAYS LATER

(The police photographer takes pictures of the eyeballs and intestines laying on the ground in a bloody splotch. Havez walks up to him.)

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: Unit seven, unit seven...

PHOTOGRAPHER: They say the eyes capture the last image the murder victim sees before they're killed.

(Cline starts past them.)

CLINE: So what do they say about the entrails?

PHOTOGRAPHER: Yuck.

(Havez and Cline walk away from the photographer.)

HAVEZ: Is it true you asked for some help in this case?

CLINE: This guy's supposed to be an expert at this sort of thing.

(They stop at a long row of dolls on a shelf.)

HAVEZ: I heard he was a bit... unorthodox.

CLINE: He comes highly recommended.

HAVEZ: Yeah. I saw him on TV.

(The photographer walks over.)

CLINE: Hey, so he's a publicity hound. As long as he gets results.

PHOTOGRAPHER: I once worked on a case he did. Very spooky.

CLINE: As long as he gives us leads, I don't care how big a kook.

POLICEMAN: Sir, right in here, please.

(Mulder walks in and the three officers stare at him for a second.)

CLINE: Who the hell are you?

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder.

(Scully walks in behind him.)

This is Agent Scully.

(She flashes her badge.)

CLINE: Oh, I forgot you were coming aboard. I'm, uh, Cline, this is Havez.

(They both shake hands with Mulder. They start back towards where the murder took place. Mulder starts to put on rubber gloves.)

HAVEZ: We're thinking this guy might be a satanist, what with the eyeballs.

MULDER: Satanists take the eyeballs and leave the body, not vice-versa. Not in anything but modern myths.

CLINE: He's gouging eyes for no reason?

SCULLY: No, nobody does anything without a reason. We've already composed a profile of the killer.

(She hands Cline a folder.)

We offer possible explanations for the nature of his attacks and also his choice of victims.

CLINE: Does it explain the entrails?

MULDER: Anthropomancy. It was once believed that you could divine your future by vivisecting a human being and studying the entrails.

(He walks around Scully and looks at the entrails closely.)

HAVEZ: So this guy is hacking up people in order to see his future?

SCULLY: Well, there's a possible connection with all of his victims being professional prognosticators.

CLINE: Till this one. She was a professional doll collector.

MULDER: And an amateur tasseographer. She read tea leaves.

(He picks up the empty cup.)

After drinking the tea, you can gain insight into your future by examining the pattern of the leaves on the bottom of the cup.

CLINE: You believe in this stuff?

MULDER: I'm not convinced of its accuracy but I'm pretty sure the victim was.

CLINE: Why?

MULDER: Her leaves were telling her she was about to be murdered.

(He shows Cline the bottom of the cup.)

POLICEMAN: Right this way, sir...

(Woman are screaming and talking loudly in the hallway. The agents and police officers turn around to see the Stupendous Yappi, dressed in black, wearing sunglasses, followed by a supermodel. He finishes signing an autograph and walks in. The police officers hold the crowd back. Cline and Havez walk to Yappi, smiling.)

You're going to have to stand back, all right? This is official police business.

(Yappi whips off his sunglasses, his left eyebrow arched. His lady friend takes off his trenchcoat. The photographer takes a picture and Yappi looks at him, eyebrows still arched.)

CLINE: Mister Yappi, I appreciate you coming all the way down here...

YAPPI: Quiet! Yes, I'm seeing visions.

(The crowd in the hallway dissipates. He starts towards the bloody splotch on the floor, now arching his right eyebrow.)

Visions of the killer. He does not feel like he is in control of his own life. Very important. That's why he kills, yes!

CLINE: Can you see what he looks like?

(Yappi starts back around the table towards Cline.)

YAPPI: He looks like... A white man with facial hair. Or not. But he has... yes! A tattoo! Somewhere on his body. Maybe the tattoo has the facial hair. I think.

(Mulder rolls his eyes and, laughing to himself, he and Scully look at each other. Yappi looks down at a spot on the carpet and dives on it.)

Hmm! I see him here! Forcing himself, yes! On the girl! But he cannot perform... so he's taking out his rage.

(He looks up at Mulder, then slams his palm down and stands up. His eyebrows fluctuate rapidly.)

It's gone. I lost the vision. Someone is blocking me. I am picking up negative energy.

(He walks over to Cline and stares at him, then snaps his head around and looks at Scully, left eyebrow arched. Yappi walks over to her, eyebrows arched and stares at her closely, then quickly looks at Mulder, right eyebrow arched. He walks over to him.)

Please leave this room.

MULDER: I'm part of this investigation.

YAPPI: You give off negative energy.

MULDER: I can assure you, Mister Yappi, I'm a believer in psychic ability.

YAPPI: So you say with your mouth but your thoughts tell me the truth.

(He arches an eyebrow and walks away.)

CLINE: Agent Mulder, please.

(Mulder sighs as Scully leans over to him.)

SCULLY: I can't take you anywhere.

(Mulder waits outside until applause starts inside. Yappi walks out, followed by his supermodel.)

YAPPI: Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an interview to give.

(He walks over to Mulder.)

Skeptics like you make me sick.

MULDER: Mister Yappi, read this thought.

(Yappi stares at him a second, then lunges back slightly as if being hit, an eyebrow arched.)

YAPPI: So's your old man!

(The two celebrities walk away as Mulder walks back into the room.)

SCULLY: It's too bad about your "negative energy," Mulder, you missed quite a performance.

(Cline holds up a bent pen.)

CLINE: Look what he did to my pen.

MULDER: Well, let me impress you with my psychic ability. Mister Yappi proclaimed the victim's body would be found near water, he saw a church or a school in the vicinity, he got a flash of the letter "S" and/or the number "seven."

CLINE: So what's your point?

MULDER: Well, his leads are so vague as to be practically useless yet easily interpreted to be correct after the fact.

(Scully walks over to Mulder as Havez walks over to stand beside Cline.)

SCULLY: He said the killer doesn't feel in control of his own life but that's true of everyone at times.

CLINE: He said a lot of things.

MULDER: Yeah, and some are bound by percentages to be right but most will turn out wrong. Now, which is which?

CLINE: Look, all I know is that so far, Yappi has provided more solid, concrete leads on this case than you have. Now, if you don't mind, I have to get an A.P.B. out on a white male, age seventeen to thirty-four, with or without a beard, maybe a tattoo... who's impotent. Let's go.

(He and Havez walk out.)

SCULLY: Might as well go home, Mulder, this case is as good as solved.

(Mulder smiles.)



SCENE 3
THE GORDON'S HOUSE

(Bruckman sits at a table with a young couple, trying to sell insurance.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: So General Mutual has a very comprehensive two-hundred thousand dollar life policy at a net annual cost of twenty-four hundred dollars.

(The wife and husband smile at each other.)

YOUNG HUSBAND: You see, the thing is... we were really hoping to buy a boat.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Mister Gordon, uh, as a young husband, I think you're going to find that your new responsibilities to your family take precedent over your recreational needs.

YOUNG HUSBAND: But this is a really good boat.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: You don't get it, do you, kid?

(Mister Gordon looks embarrassed a little. Bruckman's eyes half-roll back into his head, his eyelids almost shut as he starts to channel.)

Two years from now, while driving down Route 91... coming home to your wife and baby daughter... you're going to be hit head-on by a drunk... driving a blue '87 mustang. You'll end up looking worse than sixty feet of bad road your body slides across... after flying out your front windshield.

(The couple are naturally horrified.)

YOUNG HUSBAND: Mister... you really need to work on your closing technique.



SCENE 4
CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S APARTMENT

(Bruckman walks in, sighing. He pours himself a glass of J.P. malt scotch whiskey with ice. He takes a bag of lettuce out of his refrigerator and goes to throw it out. In the lettuce, he sees a face before dumping it into the garbage can.)



SCENE 5
MRS. LOWE'S APARTMENT

(Bruckman stands outside Lowe's door, her dog sitting in the doorway. Mrs. Lowe comes out and hands Bruckman her lighter.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, no, no, no, no. Not your lighter, Mrs. Lowe. I wa, I want your garbage.

(Mrs. Lowe, who looks to be half off-her-rocker, walks back in. Bruckman looks down at the dog and gets a vision of the dog eating a human body.)

Get out of here, you monster.

(He lightly kicks at the dog. Mrs. Lowe comes back and hands him the garbage.)

Is everything all right, Mrs. Lowe? Do you have enough supplies? You have enough dog food?

(The door slams shut. Downstairs, Bruckman opens the first dumpster and sees it's empty. He opens up the second dumpster, throws the garbage in and slams the lid shut. He starts to walk away but stops and looks back at the dumpster.)

Oh, God.

(Later, the police have arrived and the dead body of Madame Zelma is laying on top of the dumpster. It's fingers are mangled. The photographer takes a picture as Cline looks at the body, talking to Mulder.)

CLINE: It's kind of creepy, isn't it? The Stupendous Yappi said the first victim's body would be dumped somewhere, then we find it in a dumpster.

MULDER: Oooh, I just got a chill down my spine.

(Scully rolls her eyes and looks off into the crowd. The people murmur and talk to one another. Amongst the crowd is Puppet.)

SCULLY: Who found the body?



SCENE 6
CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S APARTMENT

(Bruckman sits in his chair. He takes a bite out of a piece of chocolate as Scully stands, reading off a clipboard. Mulder sits across from Bruckman.)

SCULLY: According to the police report, Mister Bruckman, you didn't touch the body after you found her.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Why would I want to?

SCULLY: But you reported that you found a body with its eyes cut out. The body was face down. If you didn't move it, how did you know the eyes had been removed?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Well, they had been, hadn't they?

(Scully nods, still waiting for an answer.)

Then what are you complaining about?

MULDER: How had the eyes been cut out?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: By a piece of crystal ball, of all cockamamie things.

MULDER: We did find some crystal shards on the body, how do you know it was from a crystal ball?

(Bruckman shrugs.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Well, well, it just, it just figures, I mean, uh... if a guy goes to kill a fortune teller, uh, he's obviously going to assault her with her own crystal ball and, uh, use the shattered piece as a sort of lance. Isn't he?

(Scully looks back at Mulder, who shrugs.)

SCULLY: Mister Bruckman, how much have you heard about the recent slayings in town?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Just that some nut is going around killing fortune tellers and ripping their eyes and entrails out.

SCULLY: How did you know about the entrails? That information hasn't been released to the press.

(Bruckman stands.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I never read the papers. Too depressing.

(Mulder stands up.)

MULDER: Mister Bruckman? Sorry, Mister Bruckman, but I'm going to have to ask you to come with us.

(Bruckman looks back at them.)



SCENE 7
NORTH MINNEAPOLIS

(Mulder opens the door to the room with the last murder. Clyde stands in the doorway.)

MULDER: Step inside, Mister Bruckman.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Why, what, what is this all about?

MULDER: A murder occurred here earlier this evening and we have reason to believe that it was committed by the same person who murdered the woman that you found.

(Mulder walks in and flicks on the lights. Bruckman walks in, followed by Scully.)

Is there anything you can tell us about it?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I didn't do it.

MULDER: You're not under suspicion... but I do harbor a suspicion that you can see things about this crime... things that we can't see.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'm, I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

MULDER: I think you do.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Yeah, yeah, right. I'd, uh, like to see both your badges again, right now.

(Mulder and Scully take out their badges and hold them out for Bruckman.)

SCULLY: I don't blame you, Mister Bruckman.

(Bruckman reads Scully's, then looks at Mulder's. He scoffs.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'm supposed to believe that's a real name?

(Mulder goes to say something as they put their badges away.)

What is this all about? I found a dead body in my dumpster. I, I, I reported it to the police. And now suddenly, I'm accused of doing things? Or, or being able to do things that I couldn't poss...

(Bruckman is distracted by a vision of the something happening on the blood-stained carpet. He walks over, sighing in grief and disgust. Mulder and Scully watch him intently. He looks back at the agents, gasping, then runs past them into the bathroom to throw up. Mulder is smiling ear-to-ear. We hear Bruckman vomiting and then flushing.)

MULDER: Pinch me.

SCULLY: This guy's performing the same routine as the Stupendous Yappi, he's just doing it in a different style.

MULDER: No, something told me, Scully, something is telling me this guy's for real.

SCULLY: Oh, so now you're psychic?

(Bruckman walks out.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: The killer... he doesn't feel like he's in control of his own life.

(Scully smiles slightly, thinking she's right. Bruckman walks over to them.)

I mean, like... who is, am I right? But this guy... he truly believes it. He sees himself as some kind of a... a puppet.

MULDER: Can you describe him? Do you get a visual impression of him?

(Bruckman shakes his head.)

SCULLY: So you can see into him but not at him.

(They both glare at her.)

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to give any negative energy.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Negative energy, what is this...

(He walks over to the same spot on the carpet where Yappi picked out the victim and the killer having sex.)

MULDER: What is it? What do you see?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: He's having sex with her. There.

SCULLY: Is he raping her?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, no, no, no, not at all. In fact, she's instigating the whole thing.

MULDER: Then what's wrong?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh... sometimes, it... it just seems that everyone's having sex except for me.

(He walks over to the dolls.)

MULDER: Mister Bruckman, can you tell us why the killer is murdering people in the way that he is?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Why does anyone do the things they do? Why do I sell insurance? I wish I knew. Why did this woman collect dolls?

(Mulder looks back at Scully, a little tired and annoyed at Bruckman's philosophy.)

What was it about her life? Was it one specific moment where she suddenly said, "I know... dolls." Or was it a whole series of things? Starting when her parents first met that somehow combined in such a way that in the end, she had no choice but to be a doll colle...

(He comes to a horribly disfigured doll. He picks it up and stares at it.)

You'll find the woman tomorrow morning... by the fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper. Glenview Lake. Her body's floating in Glenview Lake.

(Mulder looks back at Scully. Bruckman sighs and looks down at the doll, which is no longer disfigured but a very pretty doll of a princess. He starts out.)

Now, if you'll excuse me... I think I've seen enough death for one night.

(He walks out, giving the doll to Mulder.)



SCENE 8
GLENVIEW LAKE

(As Mulder and Scully watch, divers pull the body out of the water.)

DIVER: One more... here we go...

(Scully looks out at the crowd of people. Puppet is there as well. A woman is talking to a police officer.)

WOMAN: From around here, you say?

MULDER: Be honest, Scully. Doesn't that propane tank bear more than just a slight resemblance to a fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper?

(He points to a small white propane tank with a black top on it. They start towards it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, the human mind naturally seeks meaningful patterns and configurations in things that don't inherently have any. Given the suggestion of a particular image, you can't help but see that shape somewhere. If that tank weren't there, you'd see it in a, in a rock or in a tree...

MULDER: Did you answer my question?

(They stop walking and stare at it.)

SCULLY: Yes, it looks like a fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper but that only proves my point.

MULDER: He named the specific body of water the victim would be found in.

SCULLY: Mulder, that only implies that he was the one who put her in there.

MULDER: I don't believe he's the killer.

SCULLY: I don't believe he's psychic.

MULDER: Well, if he's not, then how did he know where the body would be found?

SCULLY: Maybe he's just lucky.



SCENE 9
CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S APARTMENT

(The numbers on Bruckman's lotto ticket are "9, 13, 37, 39, 41, 45." He is listening to the radio.

WOMAN ON RADIO: Thirty-eight, forty and forty-four. Once again, the winning lotto numbers are...

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Why?

WOMAN ON RADIO: ...eight, twelve...

(Bruckman turns it off.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Why do I do this to myself?

(He covers his eyes with his hands. There is a knock at the door.)

Come in.

(Mulder slowly walks in.)

I knew it was you. I know why you're here. You're here because you found that woman's body where I told you it would be. And now you're convinced I have some kind of psychic power. So while your skeptical lady partner is off performing an autopsy, you came here to ask my help catching this serial murderer.

MULDER: Everything you said is correct.

(Bruckman looks up at him.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, it's you.

(Mulder looks perplexed.)

I won't help you. Please leave.

(He stands.)

MULDER: But you do admit to having this gift.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, I got it, all right. The only problem is, it's non-returnable.

MULDER: Mister Bruckman, you possess an ability that not only has staggering implications upon physics and human consciousness, but it's one which most people, myself included, would be envious of. Yet you seem to treat it with disdain.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Do you want to know how you're going to die?

(Mulder stares at him.)

MULDER: Y, yes, I would.

(Bruckman laughs a little and smirks.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: No, you don't. Of course, not knowing has its own drawbacks which is why a good insurance policy is so important. I, I don't know what kind of coverage the F.B.I. has, but, uh, General Mutual has...

MULDER: Mister Bruckman, this murderer has already committed four homicides.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: And he'll commit more whether I help you or not.

MULDER: How can you be so sure?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: How can I see the future if it didn't already exist?

MULDER: Then if the future is written, then why bother to do anything?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Now you're catching on.

(He sits down.)

MULDER: Mister Bruckman, I believe in your ability but not your attitude.

(He sits down.)

I can't stand by and watch people die without doing everything in my, albeit unsupernatural, power to interfere with that fate.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Well, you see, that's another reason I can't help you catch this guy. I might adversely affect the fate of the future. I mean, his next victim might be the mother of the daughter whose son invents the time machine. Then the son goes back in time and changes world history and then Columbus never discovers America, man never lands on the moon, the U.S. never invades Grenada...

(Mulder is staring down at the floor.)

Or something less significant... resulting in the fact that my father never meets my mother and consequently, I'm never born.

(Mulder looks up at him.)

So when do we start?



SCENE 10
INTERROGATION ROOM; POLICE STATION

(Mulder unwraps a small gold statue of three frogs all holding hands in a circle and hands it to Bruckman.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I don't know what it is but it belonged to one of the victims.

MULDER: That's a hit. In psychical research parlance, a correct answer's a "hit," an incorrect answer's a "miss."

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: The guy who cast the mold for this will die of prostate cancer at the age of eighty-two. Hit or miss?

MULDER: I have no way of verifying that information.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Then why'd you ask me?

MULDER: Do you receive any other impressions from it?

(He holds it up and studies it.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: It's ugly. Next.

(He puts it down. Scully walks over to the door and looks in through the door window. Mulder has his head on the desk, annoyed. Bruckman holds a piece of blue cloth to his head. Scully taps on the window and gives Mulder a look as if to say "come on." Mulder walks out.)

SCULLY: I was told you were interrogating a suspect but something tells me...

MULDER: I'm now convinced of our psychic's abilities, Scully, or rather, his one ability. He is able to divine how people are going to die but that's all. He can't provide any practical information on our case.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I got it! This is yours. This is from your New York Knicks t-shirt!

MULDER: Miss.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: This is worse than playing the lotto.

(Scully walks in and hands Bruckman a bag with a keychain. Mulder follows.)

SCULLY: Try reading this.

MULDER: Save me the headache, Scully, what is it?

SCULLY: It was found on the woman that was pulled from the lake. Identical keychains were found on two of the other victims. I managed to trace the insignia to an investment firm called Uranus Unlimited. They provide market strategies based on astrological forecasts. And the company is owned by a man named...

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Claude Dukenfield. Age forty-three. 316 Roundview Lane. Divorced with two children. Makes about eighty-seven thousand a year. Non-smoker.

MULDER: Is that a hit or a miss?

SCULLY: As far as I know, that's correct.

MULDER: You got all that information just by handling that keychain?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, no. I sold him a policy a couple of months ago. Just a coincidence.

(He shrugs, smiling. Mulder looks disappointed.)

SCULLY: In any case, we're trying to get a hold of him.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, you won't be able to do that. He's been murdered.



SCENE 11
CAR

(Scully's driving, Bruckman's in the front seat, Mulder's in the back. Mulder leans forward to talk to Bruckman.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: We're almost there.

MULDER: How are you receiving this information about the body's location?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: How should I know?

MULDER: I mean, are you seeing it in a vision or is it a... sensation? How do you know where to go?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I just know.

MULDER: But how do you know?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I don't know!

(Mulder slinks back in his seat. Bruckman half-looks at him.)

Look, it's just up ahead. You know, there are worse ways to go, but I can't think of a more undignified way than autoerotic asphyxiation.

(Mulder leans forward.)

MULDER: Why are you telling me that?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Look, forget I mentioned it. It's none of my business.

(He looks ahead, smirking.)

Oops, pull over here.

(Scully stops the car.)

Stop.

(Bruckman gets out and looks around.)

This is the spot.

(They start walking through the forest, looking for the body.)

I guess you run into a lot of dead bodies in your line of work.

SCULLY: You get used to it.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I never have. I'm not sure you're supposed to.

MULDER: Do you remember the first time you foresaw someone's death?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: 1959.

MULDER: What happened in 1959?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Buddy Holly's plane crashed.

SCULLY: You prognosticated Buddy Holly's death?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, God, no. Why would I want to do that? But I did have a ticket to see him perform the next night. Actually, I was a bigger fan of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly. "Chantilly Lace," that was the song.

MULDER: I'm not following.

(Bruckman sighs. They stop walking.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: There's... the Big Bopper was not supposed to be on the plane with Buddy Holly. He won the seat from somebody else by flipping a coin for it.

MULDER: I'm still not following.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Imagine all the things that had to occur, not only in his life, but in everybody else's, to arrange it so on that particular night, the Big Bopper would be in a position to live or die depending on a flipping coin. I became so obsessed with that idea that I gradually became capable of seeing the specifics of everybody's death.

SCULLY: Well, Mister Bruckman, I'm not one who readily believes in that kind of thing and if I was, I still wouldn't believe that story.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true. I was a bigger fan of the Big Bopper than Buddy Holly.

(She looks at him, annoyed.)

SCULLY: Where's the body?

MULDER: Yeah, Mister Bruckman, I don't understand how you can know that this is the exact area, but you can't pinpoint the exact spot.

(Bruckman looks around.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I guess I can't see the forest for the trees.

(Back at their car, Bruckman and Mulder prepare to push the car out of the mud when Scully pushes the gas.)

MULDER: Okay, now.

(The wheels spin, splattering Mulder's pants with mud. Bruckman looks down at the tire in front of him, apparently smiling.)

I'm glad I could bring a little smile into your life, Mister Bruckman.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'm not smiling, I'm wincing.

(Mulder looks down at his tire to see a hand sticking out of the mud under the tire.)



SCENE 12
CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S APARTMENT

(Bruckman sits in his chair. Mulder gives him a piece of lace in a small evidence bag.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: What's this?

MULDER: The only evidence recovered from Claude Dukenfield's body. That fiber may have come from something the killer was wearing at the time of the crime.

(He sits down behind Scully on the couch.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Don't you have crime labs that analyze these things for you?

SCULLY: Yes, yes, we do.

(She looks back at Mulder.)

MULDER: But it'll take them time to provide any information. A similar fiber was found on one of the earlier victims and we're still waiting for the lab to determine it's source. You'd be saving us a great deal of work.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Look, I've got my own work to do. I'm not a crime fighter by trade.

(He goes over to his table and sits down. Mulder stands and walks over to him.)

MULDER: Mister Bruckman... I can't speak for my partner but I'm desperate... for some insurance.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: General Mutual has some very comprehensive coverage...

(Mulder waves the small baggie. Bruckman sighs and takes it. He smells the fiber.)

No... I, I can't tell you where this is from, but, but... the killer's going to kill more people before you catch him.

SCULLY: Can you see him physically yet?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: No, no, just more insight into his character, which I know you hate.

(She looks down at the floor, a little embarrassed.)

He thinks he's psychic.

MULDER: Is he?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I hope not. I've seen some of the things he's "seen."

MULDER: Like what? What does he see?

(Bruckman sees Mulder bursting through a double door, holding his gun.)

MULDER IN VISION: Hey!

(Cut back to Bruckman.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: You. He sees you. Trying to catch him.

MULDER: Where does this take place?

(Bruckman half-closes his eyes, channeling.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: In a kitchen.

(In Bruckman's vision, from the point of view of the killer, he sees Mulder slowly walking through the dark kitchen, pointing his gun.)

You're looking around for someone. He's behind you now, but you don't know it and he's stalking towards you and... and...

(Cut to Bruckman.)

Oh, God!

(Scully runs up to them, entranced by the story.)

SCULLY: What? What do you see?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: He's got a knife. It's got blood on it.

MULDER: Well, why don't I see him, what am I doing?

(In Bruckman's vision, Mulder is looking down at a pie he stepped in. The killer moves closer.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: You're looking down. You stepped in a pie that's fallen to the floor. The killer comes up to you and...

(Cut to Bruckman.)

Coconut cream.

MULDER: What?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: The pie... eh, coconut cream or, or is it lemon merengue? I don't know, it's... not sure, it's, it's hazy.

(Scully sits back against the couch, crossing her arms, her interest having left. Mulder kneels down.)

MULDER: Whatever, please continue.

(Bruckman makes like he's holding up a knife.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: As you're looking down, he comes up with the knife and...

(A quick flash into the killer holding up the knife behind Mulder.)

Banana cream! Definitely banana cream.

MULDER: All right, I'm looking down at this banana cream pie and then what...

(Cut to Bruckman's vision. The killer raises the knife, poised.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: He sees himself coming up to you from behind...

(Puppet slashes Mulder's throat. Mulder turns around, holding his neck as blood gushes out. Cut to Bruckman. Scully and Mulder both have their interest back.)

MULDER: And? And, what does he see?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh...

(Bruckman looks at his hand and unclenches the fist.)

Nothing. They're visions of a madman.

(Mulder stands and holds up the tiny bag.)

MULDER: You got all that from this?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: How am I supposed to get anything from this tiny little thing? This came in the mail today.

(He hands Mulder a letter.)

SCULLY: Who's it from?

(Bruckman takes the letter and holds it to his head, doing his best Johnny Carson/Karnak impression.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: The killer!

(He goes to water his plants. Mulder opens the envelope and starts to read.)

MULDER: "To whom it may concern. Like our lives, this is a mere formality to let you know I know that you know. Can't wait till our first meeting when I kill you. Not before you explain some things to me. First on the list, why in the world did I send you this letter? Sincerely, you know who. P.S., say 'hi' to the F.B.I. agents."

(Bruckman waves hi to the agents.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Hi.

SCULLY: He must've been at the crime scenes, seeing you with us.

MULDER: No, no, this letter is postmarked the day before Mister Bruckman joined our investigation. You're going to have to come with us, Mister Bruckman. We're got to get you out of here.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Look... I'll be dead before you catch this guy, no matter what you do.



SCENE
TAROT SHOP

(The tarot dealer is reading to Puppet. He flips over the first card, which is of "The Hermit.")

TAROT DEALER: You've come to me because you're searching for someone. But don't worry, this person will find you. It's a relative or a close friend.

PUPPET: Actually, a guy I'm going to kill.

(The tarot dealer laughs uncomfortably and flips the next card, "The Magician.")

TAROT DEALER: Ah, yes, it's clearer now. You seek answers from a special man who possesses a special wisdom.



SCENE 13
LE DAMPINO HOTEL; SEPTEMBER 21

(Bruckman takes another scoop of the cake with whipped cream on top.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: This is real cream. Not the phony stuff. I know the difference. And the chocolate, very rich. Look at these cute little doilies they put everything on. You sure you don't want to join me?

(He takes another portion and eats it. Scully smiles at him in a certain way as if to say "no.")

So what are you doing?

(She sits down and looks through a folder.)

SCULLY: Studying background checks. This is what detective work is really like. We can't come up with suspects by having visions.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Jealous?



SCENE 14
TAROT SHOP

(More cards have been flipped. He flips the next one.)

TAROT DEALER: You're very confused right now. Nothing seems to make sense to you.

(He flips the next card, "The Lovers.")

You don't know why you do the things that you do. But your confusion is soon to come to an abrupt end with the arrival of a woman. A blonde or a brunette. Maybe a redhead.



SCENE
LE DAMPINO HOTEL

(Clyde is laying down on one bed. Scully sits on the opposite one and positions herself into a comfortable sitting position.)

SCULLY: It's something you haven't explained. Can you see your own end?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I see our end.

(Scully tilts her head forward a little in confusion.)

We end up in bed together.

(Scully tilts her head forward more in utter disbelief.)

I'm, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that, I, I, I don't mean to offend you or scare you, but, uh, not here, not this bed. I, I just mean I, I see us quite clearly in bed together. You're holding me hand, uh... very tenderly and then... you're looking at me with such compassion and I feel... tears are streaming down my face. I feel so grateful. It's just a... very special moment neither of us will ever forget.

SCULLY: Mister Bruckman... there are hits and there are misses. And then there are misses.

(She says the final word with a lot of emphasis. He just smiles.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I just call 'em as I see 'em.

(She smiles.)



SCENE 15
TAROT SHOP

(All the cards are overturned except for the last one.)

PUPPET: Wow, I'm really impressed. I've been to a lot of fortune tellers, but, by far, you're the best.

(The tarot dealer smiles.)

TAROT DEALER: There's still one more card left.

(He goes to turn it but Puppet stops him. The dealer gasps.)

PUPPET: This card's not meant for me. It's yours.

(The dealer overturns the card. It is the death card.)



SCENE 16
LE DAMPINO HOTEL

(Bruckman and Scully are playing poker. Bruckman has three Aces and two eights, constituting a full house known as a "Dead Man's Hand.")

SCULLY: So, Ahab mistakes the prophecy and as a result, dies. A similar fate happens to MacBeth.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Still, you're not the least bit curious?

(There is a knock on the door.)

SCULLY: That must be Mulder. Time for the midnight shift.

(She puts her cards down and stands up. She goes towards the door, but then walks back up to Bruckman.)

All right. So how do I die?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: You don't.

(He smiles as she stares at him. There is more knocking. She looks through the peephole and opens the door. Mulder holds up a folder.)

MULDER: Get this, Scully. The lab analysis from the first bit of fiber that was found just came back. It's lace.

SCULLY: Chantilly lace?

MULDER: You know what I like.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's not likely that the killer was wearing anything made out of chantilly lace at the time of the murders.

MULDER: But what are the odds of the Big Bopper, "Chantilly lace..."

SCULLY: It's a coincidence.

MULDER: If coincidences are just coincidences, why do they feel so contrived?

SCULLY: That's one to pose to the psychic philosopher. Good night, Mulder.

(She puts the folder down in Mulder's hand, smiles and walks out. Mulder locks the door and looks at Bruckman, who is shuffling the deck. Later, Mulder and Bruckman are in separate beds. The light is on because Mulder is reading. Bruckman is wide awake.)

MULDER: Am I keeping you awake?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'm waiting for you to ask me another one of those psychic ability questions.

(Mulder puts the book down.)

MULDER: Well, I've had dreams in my life where I had a vision and then later on, I've seen that vision in reality and then... and as a psychic, have you ever had prophetic dreams like that?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I have only one dream. I dream it ever night. You're not one of those people who turns everything into a sexual symbol, are you?

MULDER: No, no, I'm not a Freudian, no.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'm lying naked in a field of red tulips.

(In Bruckman's dream, his body slowly wastes away into nothing. He speaks over it, describing it.)

I'm not concerned with where I am or how I got there. I'm at peace and it's then that I realize I'm dead. My body begins to turn a greenish-white with spots of purple. Next, the insects arrive. The inevitable follows, putridity and liquescence. Before I know it, I'm nothing but bones. When I start fading to dust, I lose whatever care I still might have had about where my clothes are and as I begin to feel myself slipping away towards I know not what...

(Cut back to Bruckman.)

I wake up. Well, good night.

(He turns off the light. Later, Scully knocks on the door. Mulder opens it and looks at her and Havez, who is smoking a cigarette.)

SCULLY: Mulder, there's... are you okay?

MULDER: Oh, yeah. I just didn't sleep well. What's up?

SCULLY: Havez is going to stay with Bruckman while we go over to a tarot card reader around the corner. There's been another murder.

(A few minutes later, Mulder, now dressed for business, walks out with Scully.)

MULDER: I'm beginning to lose patience with our psychic, Scully. What good are his prophecies if they're not preventive?

SCULLY: Actually, I'm starting to feel more sympathetic towards him.

MULDER: So, you're convinced he's a psychic now?

SCULLY: Well, no, not really.

(She nearly collides with the bellhop. They try to get around each other but always end up walking in the same direction to.)

PUPPET: Sorry, ma'am.

(He walks past her.)

SCULLY: But I am convinced that by thinking he can see the future, he's taken all the joy out of his life.

(Bruckman is still in bed. Havez is sitting on the other one, telling a joke.)

HAVEZ: So then the priest says to the rabbi...

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: "I had it set for quail."

HAVEZ: Yeah!

(He laughs for a second, then stops.)

Hey, I thought you said you hadn't heard that one before.

(Bruckman looks at him.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I hadn't.

(Havez laughs a little uncomfortably.)

HAVEZ: Hey... is it true that you can see how people are going to die? I mean, can you see how I'm going to die?

(Bruckman nods.)

Lung cancer?

(Bruckman shakes his head. Havez sighs in relief.)

Thank God.

(Bruckman sits up. Havez stands and checks his pockets for a match or a lighter. Bruckman lights Mrs. Lowe's lighter and Havez lights the cigarette. Havez exhales and starts coughing as Bruckman studies the lighter.)

Hey, I got to go visit your restroom for a second. Don't open that door for anybody.

(Havez goes into the bathroom as Bruckman's face becomes that of horror as he stares at the lighter.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Oh, God.

(There is a knock on the door. Bruckman opens the door and the bellhop walks in and puts the tray down on the desk. Bruckman gives him a bill and goes over to the tray. The bellhop looks at the bill and looks back at Bruckman. Bruckman and Puppet, though having never met each other, instantly recognize one another. Puppet smiles and walks towards him, then picks up the knife off of the tray.)

Was that not enough of a tip?

PUPPET: They brought you right to me, right to where I work.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: What are the chances of that happening?

PUPPET: They're astronomical! It's beyond believability.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: But not impossibility. I mean, after all, here we are.

PUPPET: It's funny how things work out sometimes, isn't it?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: I'll say.

(He sits down on the bed. Puppet takes off his hat.)

PUPPET: So there's something I've been wanting to ask you for some time now. You've seen the things I do in the past as well as in the future.

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: They're terrible things.

PUPPET: I know they are. So, tell me, please, why have I done them?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: Don't you understand yet, son? Don't you get it?

(Puppet shakes his head and shrugs.)

You do the things you do because you're a homicidal maniac.

(Puppet thinks about it for a moment and smiles.)

PUPPET: That... that does explain a lot, doesn't it?

(He sits down next to Bruckman.)

It's all starting to make sense now.

(He laughs and looks at Bruckman. His smile disappears as he stands, ready to kill Bruckman.)

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: No. You don't kill me now.

PUPPET: I don't? Why not?

CLYDE BRUCKMAN: How should I know?

(Havez comes out of the bathroom, coughing. Puppet looks at him and lunges as Havez tries to get his gun. Bruckman looks on in horror.)

HAVEZ: No!



SCENE 17
TAROT SHOP

(Scully, wearing rubber gloves, looks at the card "The Page of Cups." Mulder walk around to the body, where Cline is kneeling down.)

MULDER: Now, we've either got a copycat killer or our guy's getting extremely lackadaisical.

CLINE: Not only did he leave the body, but he didn't even bother to remove the eyes.

(Scully looks out the window, hearing a commotion. She looks outside to see a crowd congregated around an ambulance. She thinks about something.)

MAN OUTSIDE: What happened?

MULDER: If my Miss Manners serves me right, that protrusion from his left cornea is a salad fork.

CLINE: Something tells me we're going to get prints off it.

(Scully looks at a piece of lace on the tip of her finger that she found.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I found another strand of that silk.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Ah, we've got more than that this time, Scully. We've got fingerprints, probably a footprint even.

(Cline stands.)

CLINE: Yeah, this is more like it. No more psychics and their vague visions and predictions. Hell, we don't even need our own hunches. This case is just now about good old-fashioned forensic police work.

SCULLY: It's the bellhop.

(They look at her.)

He's the killer, the bellhop at the hotel!

(She runs out.)

CLINE: How the hell does she know that?

MULDER: Woman's intuition.

(He runs after her.)



SCENE 18
LE DAMPINO HOTEL

(Puppet hurries out of Bruckman's hotel room and walks down the stairs with a sign over it marked "exit." The elevator opens on the other side and Scully walks in too late to see him. She goes into Bruckman's hotel room.)

SCULLY: Havez?

(She takes out her gun and walks slowly towards the bathroom.)

Mister Bruckman?

(She walks into the bathroom to find Havez, his cigarette still lit. Mulder hits the button on the elevator. Through the double doors next to him, Puppet is visibly seen through the window. They look at each other, then Puppet turns around, glancing back. Mulder, realizing who he is, makes chase as Puppet runs away. Mulder bursts through the double doors, gun in hand.)

MULDER: Hey!

(Puppet runs into the kitchen and turns the lights out. Mulder runs in and starts one way when he hears a clatter. Mulder slowly walks through the dark kitchen, pointing his gun. He feels something under his foot as Puppet stalks him. He looks down to see a pie. Remember Bruckman's vision, he turns around to see no one. Puppet comes at him from behind but Mulder blocks his hand with his wrist, struggling to keep the knife away. Mulder drops the gun and Puppet throws him into the steel locker, then punches him in the gut. Mulder goes down and Puppet kneels over him. Scully comes out of the service elevator and aims her gun.)

SCULLY: Drop it!

(Puppet looks at her, then goes to carve Mulder up anyway. Scully shoots him in the chest, much to Puppet's surprise and chagrin.)

PUPPET: Hey... that's not the way it's supposed to happen.

(He falls back. Mulder slowly tries to get up as Scully runs to him and kneels down. She tries to help him up.)

MULDER: How'd you know where to find us?

SCULLY: I didn't. I got on the service elevator by mistake.

(She checks the cut marks on Mulder's wrists.)

MULDER: Thank heaven for happenstance.

SCULLY: You know, none of Bruckman's prophecy came true. The killer didn't get to him first, but he did kill Havez.

MULDER: Then Bruckman is all right?

SCULLY: Actually, I don't know. I couldn't find him.

MULDER: Well, then where is he?



SCENE 19
MRS. LOWE'S APARTMENT

(Mrs. Lowe's dog sits outside the apartment, whimpering. There is a note taped onto the door. Mulder and Scully walk over and Mulder takes the note off.)

MULDER: "Miss Scully."

(Scully takes the letter out of the envelope and starts to read.)

SCULLY: "My neighbor, Mrs. Lowe, passed away last night. Please see that the remains of her remains are taken care of. Would you like a dog? He's paper-trained and well-behaved, regardless of his actions last night, which you can't really blame him for."

(Scully looks at Mulder.)



SCENE 20
CLYDE BRUCKMAN'S APARTMENT

(Mulder and Scully walk into the dark apartment with the dog leading the way. They walk over to the bed where the deceased Clyde Bruckman is laying. He has a plastic bag over his head tightly. She picks up his hand and an empty bottle of pills rolls off. She holds his hand and looks at his face. A drop of the moisture in the bag rolls off a certain way to give the impression that Bruckman is crying. Scully starts to tear up as well. She looks at Mulder, half-realizing that the prophecy he had made about them had come true.)



SCENE 21
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully is curled up on the couch with her new dog, Queemqueg. They are watching Laurel and Hardy. The two comedians' bodies are replaced with skeletons.)

OLIVER HARDY ON TV: Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into.

(Laurel, as usual, is blubbering.)

STAN LAUREL ON TV: Well, I couldn't help it.

OLIVER HARDY ON TV: Come on. Let's get back to Peoria where we belong.

(The two skeletons walk towards the camera as it fades to black, replaced by a drawing of a bull with the words "The End" and a copyright by Twentieth Century Fox. Scully reaches over to get the changer when she hears a familiar voice on the TV.)

YAPPI ON TV: Do you want to know the future? Do you want to know what lies ahead?

(She looks at the screen. There is a commercial for the Stupendous Yappi's hotline. He is standing there, and the caption reads:

" The Stupendous Yappi
Personal Forecast
1-900-555-YAPP
$3.99 Per Minute/For Adults & Entertainment Only")

Then call me, the Stupendous Yappi.

(He sits down.)

For years, I have entertained audiences with my psychic abilities. I have been consulted by Hollywood stars, police departments... even presidents.

(The camera zooms in on him as he leans forward, his right eyebrow arched up.)

Now, I can be your personal psychic consultant.

(Cut to a plain man sitting behind a desk on the phone.)

Do you want to know if you will get that promotion?

(Cut to a very beautiful woman on the phone next to her very handsome boyfriend.)

Do you want to know if your marriage will be successful?

(Cut to a man on a payphone as a woman walks by. They stop and look at each other.)

Do you want to know where you will meet your one true love?

(The woman looks at the screen and smiles, arching an eyebrow briefly. Cut back to Yappi.)

Then call me at 1-900-555-Yapp. Remember, the future is close at hand and so is your phone.

(Scully picks up her phone and raises it to her ear.)

So to hear tomorrow's secrets today, just pick it up.

(The camera zooms in on Yappi's eyes.)

I know you will. I can see your future.

(Scully throws the phone at the TV.)

[THE END]

                                         THE LIST



SCENE 1

(On a dark, damp and foggy night, a car stops for a man waiting alongside a road. The man opens the passenger door.)

DRIVER: Mr. Simon? Are you ready?

MAN: Yeah.

(The man gets in the car and it drives on.)



SCENE 2
EASTPOINT STATE PENITENTIARY, LEON COUNTY, FLORIDA

(A guard knocks and enters the Warden's office. The Warden is meeting with another man.)

GUARD: Excuse me, Warden. It's 5:00, sir.

WARDEN: How's Neech?

GUARD: He's still in with his wife.

WARDEN: No, I mean how is he? How's he doing?

GUARD: Well, he won't eat his meal and he won't see the chaplain. Told him to get the hell out.

WARDEN: (sighs) What about the hired man?

GUARD: He's traveling.

WARDEN: All right. Let's get Neech prepped.

GUARD: Yes, sir.

WARDEN: If God can't save his sorry ass, neither can I.

(The guard enters the cellblock. As he passes the first cell, a prisoner, Roque, stands at the door and yells.)

ROQUE: Time's up, Neech! 2,000 volts, man. You ain't never coming back, you freak. (he laughs)

(Farther down the cellblock, several men are standing outside Neech Manley's cell. Manley is with his wife, Danielle. The guard approaches the cell.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: It's just like I've always told you. I swear on my life, Neech.

GUARD: Time to go.

DANIELLE MANLEY: I ain't ever going to love another man. You hear me? I won't. I won't betray our love - ever.

GUARD: Time, Neech. Time to go.

DANIELLE MANLEY: That phone call's gonna come, and the governor is gonna come through.

NEECH MANLEY: Got to go now.

(Manley is being led to the execution chamber by another guard, Parmelly. He exhales sharply as he enters the chamber. He is strapped to the chair and the electrode is attached to his head. The blinds on the witness chamber are opened and raised. The warden and a priest enter the chamber.)

WARDEN: We've got a hood if you want it. It's your option.

NEECH MANLEY: No.

WARDEN: Is there anything you want to say, Neech? Last words?

NEECH MANLEY: Yeah. I've been here 11 years, 56 days and now you're gonna murder me. The Lord says thou shall be merciful and just. I know no mercy. Allah says the spirit shall rise again and be reborn into this life ...

WARDEN: You should begin, Father.

NEECH MANLEY: ... The soul shall be recast born unto new flesh ...

FATHER: "The Lord is my shepherd ..."

(The Father continues to recite the 23rd Psalm as Neech continues without interruption.)

NEECH MANLEY: ... I will return to avenge all the petty tyranny and the cruelty I have suffered. I will be recast, reincarnated, reunion of spirit and flesh.

(The warden motions to the hooded executioner to take his station.)

NEECH MANLEY: ... Mark my words. Five men will die. Five men will go down! This will be my justice! This will be my law! This will be my capital punishment, and no stay of execution will be granted ...

(The warden and priest leave and the door to the execution chamber is closed.)

NEECH MANLEY: ... for there is no prejudice, no evidence to be admitted ... no lawyer ...

WARDEN: (to executioner) Fry him.

NEECH MANLEY: ... who did not perform his job. These men will die righteous deaths!

(The executioner throws the switch. Manley shakes as the voltage surges through him.)

SCENE 3

(In the X-Files office, Mulder is projecting a police photo of Manley on a screen.)

MULDER: Napoleon "Neech" Manley. He was convicted in 1984 for double murder in the holdup of a Florida liquor store. The actual gunman was killed in the pursuit. Manley was driving the getaway car and got sentenced to death.

SCULLY: He was put to death in the electric chair three days ago.

MULDER: Yeah, he'd been to the chair twice before but the governor had granted him last-minute stays.

SCULLY: Third time's a charm. What's your interest in this?

MULDER: Well, Manley was interesting. He was well-read, charismatic. He became a writer, a kind of prison philosopher. A week before his execution, word went through the prison that Neech said he was gonna be reincarnated. He was gonna come back from the dead.

SCULLY: Well, reincarnation has always been popular on death row for obvious reasons.

MULDER: Apparently, this was more than just a dying man's hope against hope.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Manley didn't just claim that he was gonna come back but that he was gonna take vengeance on five men who had mistreated him.

(He changes the slide to one showing a dead prison guard lying on a bed in a cell.)

MULDER: Yesterday, a death row guard was found dead inside the cell that Manley had occupied those 11 years. His death cannot be explained.

(He shows a third slide. The guard is the same one seen earlier.)



SCENE 4

(At the prison, the warden is leading Scully and Mulder through the prison.)

SCULLY: Has a cause of death been determined?

WARDEN: Suffocation, near as we can tell. Somebody must have snuffed him with a pillow.

MULDER: Any idea how one of your guards could get murdered in an empty cell like this?

WARDEN: No. It's not supposed to happen, not with all the precautions that we're taking.

SCULLY: I see the guards here wear panic devices. Was the victim's activated?

WARDEN: No. Apparently he never touched it.

(As they walk, Scully notices some prisoners staring at her and appears uncomfortable.)

MULDER: According to our reports, there were threats this might happen.

WARDEN: There's always threats of violence in here. Prison's nothing but a police state, basically.

MULDER: Do you give any credence to Neech Manley's claims that he was gonna come back and take revenge?

WARDEN: Neech Manley ... a smart man, very smart man. In fact, if he'd stayed outside I would have figured him for a Nobel Prize. But he made a mistake and paid for it with his life. Now, you take a man of that intelligence, you put him inside for 10 or 11 years - you're gonna have to pay for it.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

WARDEN: Well, there's nothing but bitterness and resentment in here seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It gets honed to a real fine point.

MULDER: So you're saying that Manley planned this and is carrying it out with the help of someone else.

WARDEN: Elaborate as Shakespeare. Now, if you want to see the victim's body ...

(A guard, Fornier, opens the door to another block and they enter.)

FOURNIER: Visitors coming through. Woman on the block.

(They are now in the prison infirmary. A covered body is lying on a table in an adjoining room. Scully walks toward it.)

WARDEN: We're holding the corpse until the state pathologist comes down this afternoon and conducts the official autopsy. That information should help us solve the murder.

MULDER: Did Manley have many friends among the prisoners?

WARDEN: A man has to have friends in prison to keep an eye on his enemies. Mostly, people were just afraid of him.

SCULLY: Warden?

WARDEN: What is it?

SCULLY: The body. I think you should take a look. I suggest you get it into refrigeration or you're not gonna have anything left to autopsy.

(Scully has lifted the sheet over the body. There are maggots all over it.)

WARDEN: Oh, God.

(Mulder is talking to John Speranza, an inmate in the same cellblock as Manley. Scully and Fornier stand outside the cell.)

MULDER: I've been told you believe Neech Manley's claims.

SPERANZA: It's not a matter of how or if he's coming back. The question is, when ... is he coming back again?

MULDER: What are you saying, Speranza? You believe Manley killed that guard?

SPERANZA: Well how else would you explain it?

MULDER: A prisoner waits for an opportunity ...

SPERANZA: Hey, look around. We ain't got but an opportunity to itchy-scratchy outside our cells.

MULDER: Yeah, but you've got prisoners on work detail. Trustees - a man slips away.

SPERANZA: Oh, this is "Q" block, death row. Don't nobody come in and out here without a guard watching and lately, you got double that.

MULDER: Why?

SPERANZA: 'Cause everybody's afraid of what they say can't be true. Neech is back.

MULDER: Reincarnated.

SPERANZA: Well, he would have called it "transmigration of the soul."

MULDER: Into what form?

SPERANZA: You, me, this mattress - I don't know. He didn't specify, but he's back. I can feel it. The man was electric, you know what I'm saying? Pure energy.

SCULLY: Would it be possible to see the cell where the guard was murdered?

FORNIER: I'll open it up for you.

(Fornier and Scully walk down the block, leaving Mulder with Speranza.)

MULDER: Any idea how he did it?

SPERANZA: Like I said, the man ...

(Several prisoners come to the doors of their cells as Scully and Fornier passes. There are several whistles and catcalls directed at her as she passes. Fornier opens the door to Manley's old cell and she enters.)

FORNIER: Nothing's been touched. It's pretty much the way Neech left it.

(Scully notices a pair of large flies on a stain on the pillow.)

SCULLY: Did you know Neech Manley?

FORNIER: Oh, yeah. I knew him.

SCULLY: What was he like?

FORNIER: Neech? Neech was so full of b.s., he couldn't stand it.

SCULLY: How is that?

FORNIER: He actually started to believe that crap he'd been preaching all those years, as if knowing all them religions made him some kind of god.

SCULLY: Who do you think killed the guard?

FORNIER: I don't know who killed him, but I damn well know who didn't kill him.

SCULLY: Are you afraid at all?

FORNIER: Me? I just keep my ass covered and my eyes peeled. Same as always.

INMATE: (from back up the cellblock) Fornier! Hey, down here!

FORNIER: I'm gonna check back on your partner.

(Scully steps back into the hallway. Fornier walks to Speranza's cell.)

FORNIER: Everything okay in there?

MULDER: Yeah, fine.

(Scully looks toward the other end of the block and walks slowly in that direction, entering the empty showers at the end of the cellblock. From the shadows behind her, a hand comes out and goes across her mouth and pulls her back. It is Parmelly, another guard.)

PARMELLY: (whispering) Shh! I'm not gonna hurt you. I only want to talk to you, okay? I know who he's going to kill. There's a list. One of the cons has it. A man named Roque.

(He releases her, and Scully steps away and turns to the man.)

SCULLY: Who are you?

PARMELLY: My name's Parmelly. I want to help you.

FORNIER: (from a distance) Agent Scully?

(Parmelly steps back into the shadows. Fornier is at the entrance to the showers. Scully walks toward him.)

SCULLY: I was just looking around.

FORNIER: Not a place for a woman to be doing that alone.

(Scully walks back up the block to Speranza's cell.)

SCULLY: Mulder. I'm ready to go now.

MULDER: Okay. I'll be right there.

(He notices that she seems nervous. She steps to the entrance of the block and pounds on the door as he catches up with her.)

SCULLY: Guard!

MULDER: What's wrong, Scully?

SCULLY: I'm just ready to get out of here.

(She looks back and the prisoner in the first cell, Roque, smiles at her. As the door opens, she hurriedly exits.)



SCENE 5
7:03 AM

(A guard leads a group of prisoners on a work detail into an area that is being painted.)

GUARD: I want every paint brush and putty knife to be accounted for, understand? Come on, gentlemen, move it.

(The first prisoner kneels in front of a paint bucket and opens the lid. He gasps and steps back, pointing at it, and then running to the other end of the room. The other prisoners step forward to look. Inside the bucket is Fornier's bloody head, covered with maggots.)

INMATE: It's the guard. It's Fornier.

GUARD: Come on you guys. Break it up. Get back. I said get back.



SCENE 6

(Scully and the state pathologist are in the prison infirmary. The pathologist removes Fornier's head, wrapped in plastic, from storage and places it on a table.)

PATHOLOGIST: I guess they haven't recovered the body yet so it's going to be difficult to establish an exact cause of death.

SCULLY: What did your preliminary exam turn up?

PATHOLOGIST: Well, it looks like the head was severed just below the jawline with repeated stabbing blows from a putty knife. There were no other indications of trauma to the head.

SCULLY: From the eyewitness reports, there were already fly larvae infesting the flesh. That seems unusual considering the short time-of-death window.

PATHOLOGIST: Not altogether. Here, let me show you this. (he shows her a jar half-filled with larvae) Lucilia cuprina - better known as the green bottle fly. They can lay their eggs within a minute after death occurs, and they breed more rapidly in a hot, humid environment.

SCULLY: In the anaerobic environment inside the paint can?

PATHOLOGIST: On my autopsy on the first victim, the lungs were absolutely alive with infestation.

SCULLY: Hmmm. What was determined to be the cause of that death?

PATHOLOGIST: Best I can figure, given the lack of indicators, he was suffocated to death. Either that ... or he drowned.



SCENE 7

(Mulder stands outside Roque's cell as the door slides open.)

GUARD: You've got a visitor, Roque.

MULDER: I hear you have a list.

ROQUE: I prefer not to talk about it here. Not on the block.

(Mulder notices that Speranza, in the next cell, is listening to them.)

MULDER: Guard?

(The guard leads Roche out of his cell and toward an interview room. Speranza yells at him as he leaves.)

SPERANZA: You's a dead man, Roque! You hear me?! I'm gonna peel that head like an onion! I'm gonna to break you off a big chunk! You hear me?! He ain't gonna tell you nothing but a bunch of lies! You talk, punk, I will make you my Maytag! He's alive!

(Mulder and Roque are now in an interview room.)

MULDER: How did you come by this list you claim to have?

ROQUE: I heard Neech on the bars one night telling Speranza.

MULDER: How many names are on the list?

ROQUE: Five. Just like Neech said.

MULDER: So you knew those two guards were gonna be murdered?

ROQUE: I knew they were on the list, yeah.

MULDER: Who do you think killed them?

ROQUE: I don't know. I just know who's on the list.

MULDER: You want to make some kind of deal, huh?

ROQUE: That's right. I want a transfer out of this hole.

MULDER: Why? Are you on the list?

ROQUE: I ain't saying nothing. Not until I get my deal.

MULDER: Well, what if they don't give you what you want?

ROQUE: Then they're gonna to see the other three die.

(The warden, Mulder and Scully are walking through the prison.)



SCENE 8

WARDEN: I can't do it. I can't make that deal.

MULDER: You don't have the authority?

WARDEN: No, it's not that. If I make that deal I might as well go into the deal-making business. Every con with half a brain would come up with a scheme like that.

SCULLY: Well, what if it saves three lives? Isn't that a deal worth making?

WARDEN: Look, my job is about controlling anarchy. I don't run this prison, I just patrol it. Basically, it's war in here. We have freedom. They don't. Anything these men want, somehow it finds its way in here. They want another prisoner dead somebody's gonna find a way to put a shiv in.

SCULLY: These aren't prisoners. These are guards you've got being murdered.

WARDEN: Yes, and if I back down now, all I'll be doing is sending a message about the benefits of killing prison guards. There's a conspiracy at work here. I don't know who's behind it. But I am gonna crack it. That's my job.

(They have reached the warden's office. He opens the door to find the rest of Fornier's body - that is, minus the head - sitting in his chair.)

WARDEN: What the hell? Guard! Guard! Get in here.

SCULLY: I guess you'll be able to finish up that autopsy now, Scully.



SCENE 9
3:45 PM

(Scully and Mulder are examining the books in Neech Manley's library, which are stored on a shelf at the prison.)

SCULLY: He had quite a library.

MULDER: Yeah.

(She pulls a Bible off the shelf. It has dozens of paper markers in it.)

SCULLY: Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible.

MULDER: Listen to this. "I come in return to the beginning of the end to begin again the journey of souls ... the godhead universal for whom there is no death only life eternal."

SCULLY: What's that from?

MULDER: Neech Manley, 1994. This stuff goes on for hundreds of pages. There's references to the Hindu Atman, Prarabdha, the Rosicrucians, Zoroastrianism. The man was obsessed with reincarnation.

SCULLY: Being obsessed with it doesn't mean you can do it.

MULDER: Unless he knew something we don't.

SCULLY: Like what? The secret password?

MULDER: Every major world religion encompasses the idea of life after death. That means millions, even billions of people believe in some kind of transmigration or rebirth of the soul.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder, that's not what I learned in catechism.

MULDER: Well, even Christianity teaches about the resurrection and ascendancy of the heavenly body.

SCULLY: Do you honestly believe that Neech Manley came back from the dead to kill those two men?

MULDER: Is there another competing theory?

SCULLY: A very good one, and one much more believable.

MULDER: That this is a complex scheme, that the headless man planted behind the warden's desk is the work of a conspiracy of inmates.

SCULLY: Or guards.

MULDER: (he nods) Yeah, but imagine if it were true, Scully. Imagine if you could come back and take out five people who had caused you to suffer. Who would they be?

SCULLY: I only get five?

MULDER: I remembered your birthday this year, didn't I, Scully? (she smiles) Well, here's somebody we haven't talked to yet. (he pulls a letter from Danielle Manley out of the file) She should know better than anybody else.



SCENE 10

(Mulder and Scully are at Danielle Manley's house. He knocks and she answers the door.)

MULDER: Mrs. Manley?

DANIELLE MANLEY: Yes?

MULDER: We're from the FBI. (he flashes his badge) We'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.

(They are sitting in Danielle's living room. Danielle smokes a cigarette.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: I had this dream ... had it many times. That they put Neech in that chair and they flipped the switch, but that he wouldn't die. They couldn't kill him. He's a powerful man. Very powerful man.

MULDER: Did he ever share his thoughts about dying with you?

DANIELLE MANLEY: Neech wasn't afraid to die.

SCULLY: Because of his beliefs?

(Scully notices that Danielle's hands are trembling as she smokes and holds an ashtray in the other hand.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: (nods) Sometimes ... see, I only got to have personal visiting days right before the execution dates. There was three in the last 11 years. But sometimes ... I could feel the power of his beliefs right through that visiting glass.

MULDER: You think he's come back, don't you?

DANIELLE MANLEY: You know ... I think that if anyone could ... it'd be Neech.



SCENE 11

(At the prison, a guard opens the door to Roque's cell. He is doing pushups on the floor.)

GUARD: Get up, Roque. Putting on the chains.

ROQUE: Hey, man ... for what?

GUARD: The warden wants to talk to you.

(He puts the chains on Roque and steps back into the corridor. Roque comes out and starts left, toward the warden's office.)

GUARD: Other way.

ROQUE: Where are we going?

GUARD: (motioning in the other direction) This way.

(The guard gives Roque a push.)

ROQUE: Let go of my arm, I'm going! What you want with me, anyway? Stop pushing!

(The guard leads him into the showers at the end of the block. The warden comes down the stairs at the other end. The guard leaves them alone.)

WARDEN: Hey, Roque. I want to talk to you about this list.

ROQUE: I ain't saying nothing.

WARDEN: Come on, Roque, you got a big mouth. What are you shutting up now for? Huh?

(The warden punches him in the face. Roque sinks to his knees.)

WARDEN: Who's on the list? (he jerks Roque to his feet by his shirt) Am I on the list, Roque? Am I on that list?! (shouts) Is my name on that list?!

(Roque has blood in his mouth from the punch.)

ROQUE: You're number five. How's it feel to be on death row, Warden?



SCENE 12

(Scully and Mulder are outside, leaving Danielle Manley's house.)

SCULLY: Did you catch her body language?

MULDER: She was nervous, or scared.

SCULLY: Of what? That her husband's gonna keep his word?

MULDER: A lot could have happened in her life in those 11 years Neech was in prison. A lot probably did.

SCULLY: You mean she thinks she's on the list?

MULDER: I don't know, but I've been thinking a lot about that list, Scully.

(Scully's cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Scully. We're on our way. (hangs up) (to Mulder) That was the warden. There's been another death.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Roque. They found him beaten to death in the showers on death row.

(As they get into the car to leave, Danielle watches from a window. A man comes up behind her.)

PARMELLY: Gotta go now.

(She jumps and spins around nervously.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: God. You scare me when you do that.

PARMELLY: Why? You think it's him?

DANIELLE MANLEY: Wh-where are you going?

PARMELLY: I'm going to work.

DANIELLE MANLEY: Parm, I'm scared. You feel me? I'm shaking like a little kitten.

PARMELLY: Hey. (kisses her) Now what are you scared of?

DANIELLE MANLEY: What if somebody finds out? I-I mean, what if ...

PARMELLY: Will you stop your worrying? Everything's gonna be all right. Hmm? (walks away and puts on his shirt) He ain't coming back, Danielle. He ain't. (he leaves)



SCENE 13

(Scully and Mulder walk down the cellblock toward the showers. Several inmates taunt Scully as she passes. In the shower, Parmelly and another guard are putting Roque's body on a stretcher. The warden approaches Scully and Mulder.)

SCULLY: Who found the body?

WARDEN: One of my guards.

MULDER: No one heard anything?

WARDEN: Nobody who should have. I'm ordering a lockdown of this facility until the situation is brought back under control. As far as I'm concerned, anyone who had contact with Neech Manley is a suspect.

(The warden walks away, as Scully examines Roque's body. Mulder turns and pursues the warden.)

MULDER: Warden?

(Scully puts the sheet back over Roque's head. Parmelly is beside her. They are alone.)

PARMELLY: (quietly) I warned you. That's three.

(Mulder catches up with the warden.)

MULDER: Warden? Why Roque?

WARDEN: Neech hated Roque. They pretty near tried to kill each other once.

MULDER: Well then, why the other victims?

WARDEN: Neech probably hated them too.

MULDER: Did Neech have a history with the guards who died?

WARDEN: Neech had a small behavioral problem, about a year, a year and a half ago. Fornier and the other men had to, uh, discipline him.

MULDER: How badly was he beaten?

WARDEN: He took his licks.

MULDER: So there's a pattern here, a logic. All these men had a violent history with Neech. They all caused him to suffer physical pain.

WARDEN: What are you getting at?

MULDER: A lockdown may not solve your problem, warden.

WARDEN: Sure as hell'll put a lid on it.

MULDER: If it's a conspiracy among the inmates, but how many inmates could have put that body in your office? How many could have gotten access?

WARDEN: You're saying the guards are involved?

MULDER: I'm saying that Roque may not be victim number three. Now, I need a name from you. I need the name of Neech's executioner.

WARDEN: (shaking his head) It's confidential.

MULDER: How many men know it?

WARDEN: Three men, including me. We place an ad, pay him in cash. There's no written record.

MULDER: Well, his life may be in danger.

WARDEN: There is no chance ...

MULDER: Well look at it this way, warden. If I'm right, it'll reduce your list of suspects to four.

WARDEN: I said three men knew that name.

MULDER: I'm counting Neech Manley.



SCENE 14

(Mulder and Scully approach the home of Perry Simon, the executioner of Neech Manley. The door is unlocked, and there is a pile of mail inside the door.)

MULDER: Mr. Simon? Perry Simon? Couple of days' worth of mail.

(No one answers, so they look through the house. Scully finds a picture of Simon holding a large fish. [Simon is the man who was waiting by the side of the road in the teaser.] She notices several maggots on the floor nearby and looks up toward the ceiling.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: What is it?

(He joins her and looks up as well. There is another maggot in a light fixture in the ceiling. It drops and Mulder catches it.)

(They open a door upstairs and see Simon's body in a chair. Many maggots are on the floor around the chair. They approach and find his body badly eaten by the maggots. Mulder puts his hand over his mouth and steps back.)

SCULLY: Oh, God. (she steps away as well)



SCENE 15

(Speranza is led, in chains, to the interview room at the prison where Mulder waits. The guard leaves them alone.)

SPERANZA: I told you, didn't I?

MULDER: You told me everything but what I need to know. Who else is on that list, John?

SPERANZA: I can't tell you that.

MULDER: How's he doing it, John?

SPERANZA: I really can't tell you.

MULDER: And you're just gonna let those men die?

SPERANZA: Ain't my call!

MULDER: Well, they're going to pin it on somebody! They're gonna pin it on you ...

SPERANZA: They're gonna what? What are they going to do to me?

MULDER: Put you in solitary, one hour a week outside your cell, no contact with anyone. They say it can break a man.

SPERANZA: I can't tell you, man.

MULDER: You're afraid of Neech?

SPERANZA: I saw him.

MULDER: You saw Neech.

SPERANZA: Standing outside my cell, big as life.

MULDER: Tell me who else is on the list, John. Who's next?

SPERANZA: I can't tell you who's on the list. But I can tell you, Roque wasn't on it.

MULDER: Roque's not on it?

(The guard lets Scully into the room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, can I have a minute?

(He steps over to her and they converse quietly.)

SCULLY: I've just been going over Neech's phone calls over the last two months. Over 30 of them were made to a man named Danny Charez - twice as many as to his own wife.

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: Charez has been here three times to see Speranza since the first murder. He could be working with him on the outside.



SCENE 16

(Scully and Mulder are in the living room of Danny Charez.)

CHAREZ: Look, I've got nothing to hide.

SCULLY: Okay then, what's your business with John Speranza?

CHAREZ: I was trying to get Speranza a deal.

SCULLY: What kind of deal?

CHAREZ: Retrial maybe. Reopen the case. I got some connections with the government.

MULDER: What kind of connections?

CHAREZ: I used to be an attorney. Actually, I represented Neech Manley.

SCULLY: You were Neech Manley's defense lawyer?

CHAREZ: I was 26. I was court-appointed. I had no business on a death penalty case.

MULDER: Why help Speranza now?

CHAREZ: I heard about Neech's death list. Word gets around. And I know he blames me for him getting fried so I figured I got to try something.

MULDER: You think Speranza's got some sway with Neech?

CHAREZ: I'm just trying to save my ass. I've been to the Governor, Speranza, Neech's wife ...

SCULLY: Why Neech's wife?

CHAREZ: Maybe she's got some mojo with him too. I don't know. Anyway, I got run out of there by her crazy boyfriend.

SCULLY: She has a boyfriend?

CHAREZ: Works at the prison. Waving a freakin' gun in my face.

(At the prison, the door to Speranza's cell opens and the warden steps in.)

WARDEN: Hello, John.

SPERANZA: (stands) What do you want?

WARDEN: Oh, no, sit down, sit. I'm here to do you good.

SPERANZA: (remains standing) What you talking about?

WARDEN: I want to be your advocate. I'm gonna get them to look at your case again, pull a few strings in Tallahassee.

SPERANZA: And what do you want from me?

WARDEN: Just call off the dogs. That's all. What do you say? Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

SPERANZA: All right.

(The warden nods at him and steps back. The guard closes the cell door.)

WARDEN: I'll have somebody from the Governor's office down here to see you by this weekend.

(That evening, Charez pounds on the air conditioner at his house. He opens a window and takes a drink, then unbuttons his shirt and lies on his sofa, putting the cold glass against his forehead. A fly suddenly appears on his face and he wipes it away. He opens his eyes to see a man pressing a pillow against his face. He struggles.)



SCENE 17

(It is dark and Parmelly pulls up in front of the house he shares with Danielle. He enters the house.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: Where have you been?

PARMELLY: Out.

DANIELLE MANLEY: Out. What do you mean, out?

PARMELLY: What's with you?

DANIELLE MANLEY: You see who's sitting outside watching this house? You see that car out there? You know who that is? (he looks out the window, seeing the car) Huh? The stupid FBI. They came here tonight asking about you.

PARMELLY: About me?

DANIELLE MANLEY: Said they saw you waving a gun in some lawyer's face in my front yard.

PARMELLY: That's crazy!

DANIELLE MANLEY: I thought you said nobody knew about us. Now lookit, just lookit.



SCENE 18

(Scully and Mulder are sitting in the car.)

SCULLY: A woman gets lonely ... sometimes she can't wait around for a man to be reincarnated. I think we should notify the warden.

(Mulder starts the car and they drive off.)

(At the prison, the warden is showing Scully and Mulder pictures of the prison staff. He points to the photo of Parmelly.)

WARDEN: Is that the man?

SCULLY: That's him. (reads the name) Parmelly.

(The warden picks up his phone.)

WARDEN: (to phone) Yeah, give me, uh, Vincent Parmelly's work sheet for the last week, will you please? Thank you. (hangs up) (to Scully and Mulder) Now, you say you saw him with Neech's wife?

SCULLY: Yes. I hadn't reported it but that same guard also cornered me and made an overture for prisoner Roque.

WARDEN: He's tied in with Roque?

SCULLY: Well, does it make sense to you that Parmelly is Neech's assassin?

WARDEN: I don't know Parmelly that well. He's a transfer in from out of state. He's only been here six months.

SCULLY: Well, according to an attorney we spoke to, he had brandished a gun at the residence.

WARDEN: What attorney?

SCULLY: A man named Charez. (the warden reacts) You know him?

WARDEN: Everybody knows Danny Charez. He was found dead earlier this evening at his apartment.

MULDER: Murdered?

WARDEN: Suffocated to death, or so it seems.

SCULLY: Well, he could be the fifth victim.

WARDEN: I think somebody ought to go out and arrest Vincent Parmelly.

(Scully and Mulder leave. Mulder looks a bit undecided.)



SCENE 19

(Later, Danielle Manley is lying in her bed. She sees a man standing in the bedroom doorway.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: Oh, my God. No ...

(It is Neech Manley in the doorway.)



SCENE 20

(Neech steps away from the door. Danielle comes out of the darkened bedroom and walks slowly through the house. She sees a man looking out the window.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: Neech?

(It's Parmelly instead.)

PARMELLY: What the hell you doing?

DANIELLE MANLEY: He's here.

PARMELLY: What are you talking about?

DANIELLE MANLEY: Neech - I saw him.

PARMELLY: Somebody's here, but it ain't Neech.

(He looks out the window again and sees Mulder, Scully and several policemen pull up in front.)

PARMELLY: They're coming here.

(He turns to Danielle and sees that she is pointing a gun at him.)

DANIELLE MANLEY: It's you, isn't it?

PARMELLY: What?

DANIELLE MANLEY: You're him.

PARMELLY: You're crazy, baby.

(Mulder, Scully and the policemen approach the front door. Mulder knocks while they take positions.)

PARMELLY: (whispering) Put that gun away, Danielle. That's the police out there.

MULDER: This is Agent Mulder. Please open the door.

DANIELLE MANLEY: I should have known. I should have opened my eyes.

MULDER: Mrs. Manley, we're federal agents. Open the door.

DANIELLE MANLEY: The way you touched me ...

MULDER: (knocking again) Danielle?

DANIELLE MANLEY: ... and the sound of your voice.

PARMELLY: Point that gun away, Danielle. I'm telling you - they're gonna put you away just like your old man.

DANIELLE MANLEY: Don't you come near me.

PARMELLY: You're seeing ghosts.

MULDER: (knocking again) Mrs. Manley, open the door.

(Scully steps aside and looks through the window, seeing Danielle and Parmelly as Mulder knocks again.)

SCULLY: She's got a gun on Parmelly. Center room, facing away.

MULDER: (drawing his gun) (to the others) On a count ...

(They hear a gunshot before they can enter. They storm in, finding Danielle holding a gun and Parmelly on the floor.)

MULDER: Drop your weapon!

SCULLY: Put it down! Put it down!

MULDER: Drop your weapon, Danielle. (she does) Let's get a paramedic in here.

DANIELLE MANLEY: (whispering) It was him. He came back.

(Mulder checks Parmelly's pulse. Parmelly has a gunshot wound in the chest.)

MULDER: Forget it.

DANIELLE MANLEY: (still whispering) I swear it was him. It was Neech.

(She puts her hand over her mouth.)



SCENE 21

(At the prison, Speranza's cell door opens. A guard stands there with chains. Shortly after, the guard steps back into the corridor and Speranza follows in chains, starting to the left.)

GUARD: No, go this ...

SPERANZA: What you talking about?

GUARD: We're going this way. Somebody wants to talk to you.

SPERANZA: (loudly) What kind of crap is this? Who wants to talk to me?

(The warden is pacing in the showers. He hears Speranza and the guard approaching.)

SPERANZA: Well, the warden's office is that way.

GUARD: We're going down here.

SPERANZA: Uh-uh. No.

GUARD: Why not.

SPERANZA: Man, this is bull! I ain't going for it! What the hell is this, man? Why do you want to talk to me in the shower for anyway, huh? What the ...

(The guard shoves Speranza into the shower.)

WARDEN: John. (chuckling) Hear about your friend Parmelly tonight?

SPERANZA: He's not my friend.

WARDEN: Oh, he's not your friend. Well, it doesn't matter any more anyway, does it, huh?

SPERANZA: You promised me a deal.

WARDEN: Yeah, well, that was when there was a deal to be made.

(The warden punches Speranza in the midsection and he doubles over. The warden motions for the guard to leave.)

WARDEN: Who else was in on it, John?

SPERANZA: I can tell you.

WARDEN: Tell me what?

SPERANZA: I can tell you what I know.

WARDEN: Well, tell me what you know.

SPERANZA: Neech's list ... got one man left to die.

(The warden stares at him for a moment, then pushes him back against the wall. He steps forward and starts punching him.)

(On the block, other inmates yell out. The guard stands silently at the entrance to the showers.)

INMATES' VOICES: What's going on up there? Something's going on. Hey, leave him alone!



SCENE 22

(The next day, Mulder and Scully are driving along a road when Mulder pulls over.)

SCULLY: Why are we stopping?

MULDER: You know, it just doesn't make sense.

(He gets out of the car and walks a short way down the road. Scully follows.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Laying it all on Parmelly.

SCULLY: I thought we already went through this.

MULDER: It doesn't bother you that he was only on duty for one of the guards' murders or that he wasn't among the three men that knew the name of Neech's executioner?

SCULLY: Then he was working with someone. They just haven't found out who.

MULDER: Well, why would he come to you and try to get you the list?

SCULLY: To use fear as leverage for Roque's deal with the warden.

MULDER: But Neech hated Roque. If Parmelly was working with Neech, he wouldn't have done that, would he?

SCULLY: I don't know. Maybe Parmelly wasn't sticking with the original plan. I'm sure this shacking up with Neech's wife wasn't part of it either, or maybe Neech's wife killing Parmelly was part of the plan from the beginning so that he'd take the truth to the grave with him.

MULDER: I just don't see the motives. Do you? I don't think Parmelly killed anybody.

SCULLY: Well then, who did? Neech Manley?

MULDER: Speranza and Neech's wife both said they saw him.

SCULLY: It's over, Mulder. Let's just go home.

(Scully walks back toward the car. Mulder pauses for a few moments, then follows.)

(As Mulder gets into their car, the warden passes in the other direction. The warden adjusts his rearview mirror. A fly appears on his face and he swats it away. In his rearview mirror, he suddenly sees Neech Manley in the back seat. Manley grabs the warden around the neck with one arm and reaches for the steering wheel with the other. The car runs off the side of the road, headlong into a tree. The horn sounds continuously. Blood is all over the windshield. Inside, the back seat is empty. The warden lies across the front seat, blood across his face. A fly is on his face.)

[THE END]
                                   2SHY



SCENE 1

(Night. Exterior of an old car *Dodge Dart?* parked in a deserted area. We hear a man, INCANTO, and a woman, LAUREN, talking inside the car.)

(Inside the car. INCANTO, nice looking man, mid thirties, is obviously putting the moves on LAUREN, also mid thirties, about 40 pounds overweight. She is flattered, but shy.)

LAUREN: Thats a little hard to believe.

INCANTO: Just from your words  the way you saw things  I knew I wanted to meet you.

LAUREN: Well, I hope youre not too disappointed.

INCANTO: Lauren, we have a real connection which is rare.

LAUREN: Most men dont feel that way.

INCANTO: Most men dont know what theyre missing. (LAUREN giggles) What?

LAUREN: I cant believe this. I mean, I cant believe that after three months we finally meet in person, and youre (giggles) I dont know. I just really enjoyed myself tonight.

(She has been playing with her necklace which has a charm shaped like a clover, and it suddenly breaks.)

LAUREN: Oh, no. Oh

INCANTO: Here. Let me help you. (reclasps the necklace around her neck)

LAUREN: My sister gave it to me. For good luck, I guess. (laughs) Kind of dopey, huh? I mean a clover leaf. How blatant can you get?

(INCANTO fingers the clover charm.)

INCANTO: (looking at her) Its beautiful.

LAUREN: Thank you.

(INCANTO leans forward and they begin to kiss. After a few seconds, LAUREN realizes something is wrong and begins to struggle, trying to cry out against INCANTOs lips. Horrible sucking sound from INCANTO. He pulls back. LAUREN opens her mouth in horror. It is filled with a yellow jelly-like substance. INCANTO opens his mouth wide and comes at her again quickly. Exterior shot of car rocking, sound of heavy breathing.)



SCENE 2
WAREHOUSE

(Next morning. Outside a warehouse. Police car drives up beside the car from last night. COP gets out and knocks on the window which is covered on the inside with yellowish slime. The window is fogged on the outside making it difficult to see in.)

COP: Cock-a-doodle-doo. Rise and shine in there.

(No answer. He rubs the fog off a section of window and looks inside.)

COP: (shocked) Mother of God.

(He runs back to his patrol car. Camera shows her charm resting on her chest, the skin is mottled.)

COP: (voice) Dispatch, this is Car 73. Ive got a ? out on the lake front at Gary and Campbell



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
WAREHOUSE

(Warehouse. Later that day. Crime scene. DETECTIVE CROSS, mid fifties, in charge of the investigation gives instructions to some officers.)

CROSS: Drivers license. Lauren MacKalvey? Okay, I saw that. I want you to get on it.

(CROSS goes to MULDER, in his cool sunglasses, and SCULLY as they arrive. Speaks to MULDER only.)

CROSS: Agent Mulder? Alan Cross, Cleveland PD. Thanks a lot for coming out so quickly.

MULDER: This is my partner, Dana Scully.

(CROSS ignores her presence, keeps talking to MULDER. They cross to the car)

CROSS: We found a purse in the front seat of that car. According to the license, her name is Lauren MacKalvey but were not sure yet that this is her body.

SCULLY: Youre not sure?

CROSS: We couldnt make a positive ID, considering. ( He uncovers the body which is rapidly decaying - mass of pink and yellow slime) Wendy Sparks  shes our Bureau liaison --- she thought this would be closer to your area of expertise.

SCULLY: Any indication what would have been the cause of death?

CROSS: We were just lucky to get her into the bag without her body falling apart.

MULDER: (picking at the slime with a spoon thingy) This substance --- Did you find it anywhere else in the car? On the carpet or the upholstery? (spoons it into a vial)

CROSS: As a matter of fact, no.

MULDER: So it was only on the victims body?

CROSS: Thats what it looks like.

(MULDER steps away looking at the vial. CROSS follows.)

CROSS: Why? You have an idea what happened here?

MULDER: No. Not yet. (walks away)

SCULLY: (covering for MULDER as usual) Well call you when we find anything else concrete.

(CROSS doesnt answer her.)

SCULLY: Detective?

CROSS: Yeah. Sure. Call me.

(CROSS watches uncomfortably as SCULLY follows MULDER under the crime scene tape back to their car.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what do you think it is?

MULDER: A couple of months ago a case came across my desk from the Mississippi office. Four women from Aberdeen had disappeared in less than a month.

SCULLY: Disappeared?

MULDER: Only one of the victims was found, but her body was too decomposed to perform a viable autopsy.

SCULLY: Mulder, what we just saw was not decomposition.

MULDER: I know. Thats why I want you to find out what this is while youre at the coroners office. (hands her the vial)

SCULLY: What about you? Where are you going?

MULDER: Im going to try to find out if Lauren MacKelvey was a Lonely Heart. Each of the Aberdeen victims had answered personal ads in the local papers. If this is the same killer, hes just getting started.

(MULDER gets into the car, SCULLY processes this info.)



SCENE 4
APARTMENT

INCANTO is on computer typing in a chat room. He is TIMID.)

HUGGS: IM NOT SURE ITS SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO MEET.

TIMID: WHY. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

(Shot of HUGGS, ELLEN typing in her apartment.)

HUGGS: DISAPPOINTMENT. REJECTION. THE USUAL ROUND OF SUSPECTS.

TIMID: BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. IVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD ONCE OR TWICE. BUT YOU CANT HIDE BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER FOREVER.

(Pause as ELLEN thinks.)

TIMID: CAN YOU?

(Knock at the INCANTOS door. He definitely didnt want to be disturbed. He opens the door. His landlady, slim, mid-thirties smiles at him.)

INCANTO: (cracking the door only a few inches) Yes. What is it?

LANDLADY: The handyman replaced the locks on the storage closets and I wanted to bring by your new key. (she hands it to him) I know what you do, Mr. Incanto.

INCANTO: (startled.) What is it you think that I do?

LANDLADY:(smiling) With all your typing and those packages from publishers in New York  youre a novelist, right? Or an editor? You see, Im a writer, too.

INCANTO: (not thrilled) What a coincidence. Shouldnt you be off writing, or something?

LANDLADY: I dont mean to impose or anything, but would you mind reading something of mine? It wont take much time. Theyre poems.

INCANTO: Certainly. Good-bye.

(He shuts the door. LAND LADY walks away.)



SCENE 5
AUTOPSY BAY

(Autopsy bay. CROSS is waiting. SCULLY enters in scrubs. CROSS is unpleasantly surprised to see her.)

CROSS: Oh, its you.

SCULLY: Its not a problem, is it?

CROSS: No. Just that Dr. Kramer didnt tell me that you were observing the autopsy.

SCULLY: (businesslike, getting ready for work, snapping on the latex) Im not observing. Im performing it myself.

CROSS: Youre a medical doctor?

SCULLY: You sound surprised.

CROSS: I dont know. I, uh, I guess maybe I am.

SCULLY: Why?

CROSS: Its nothing personal, Agent Scully. Im just old-fashioned in certain regards.

SCULLY: Old-fashioned?

CROSS: The truth is, I question the wisdom of assigning female law enforcement officers to certain types of cases.

SCULLY: (organizing instruments) Like this one?

CROSS: Whoever killed Lauren MacKalvey has a definite attitude toward women. So this has to be affecting your judgement.

SCULLY: I appreciate your concern, Detective, but its not necessary. All I want to do is solve this case just like you.

CROSS: Look, Im not being sexist here. Im just being honest.

SCULLY: Where would you like the autopsy report sent?

CROSS: You can fax it to my office.

(CROSS leaves. SCULLY sighs, then starts her tape recorder.)

SCULLY: The date is august 29th. The time is 4:15 pm. The subjects name is Lauren MacKalvey. Caucasian. Female. Approximate time of death uncertain. Cause of death unknown.

(She sees blood dripping from the closed drawer then opens the drawer showing that all tissue has melted off the bones and spills off the tray in a red pool. Very disgusting, even for SCULLY.)



SCENE 6

(MULDER interviewing LAURENS roommate at her apartment. Pretty thin blonde woman. There is a dreamy quality to her voice.)

ROOMMATE: It just doesnt make sense. He seemed so nice.

MULDER: I thought you said you never met the man Lauren was with last night.

ROOMMATE: I never did. He just seemed nice on the computer.

MULDER: They met through an online service?

ROOMMATE: In one of those chat rooms. You know, here people get together to talk about whatever theyre into.

MULDER: Right. Do you remember what room Lauren was in when she met him?

ROOMMATE: Big and Beautiful. She had kind of a weight problem. But "2 Shy" didnt seem to care. It wasnt about sex with him.

MULDER: "Too Shy?"

ROOMMATE: That was his online name. Lauren used to read me his letters. They were amazing. He knew exactly what to say. He sure as hell fooled me.

MULDER: She read you his letters? Do you think that she kept any hard copies of them?

ROOMMATE: Actually, I saved them myself. If you want, I can get them for you.

MULDER: Yes. Can I use your phone?

ROOMMATE: Yeah. Its right over there.

(MULDER dials the phone.)

CUT TO: (Autopsy Bay.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Listen, Scully. Our killer may have moved out of the personal columns and onto the internet. Im gonna send out a localized online warning.

SCULLY: (on phone) How do you know its the same guy?

MULDER: (on phone) Because he opened the account with one of the Aberdeen victims credit cards. I just called the online service.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Id like you to meet me at the coroners office as soon as you can.

MULDER: (on phone) Did you find anything in the autopsy?

SCULLY: (on phone) Theres not going to be an autopsy.



SCENE 7
AUTOPSY BAY

MULDER and SCULLY looking at nasty remains of the body.)

SCULLY: Its a metacarpal from Lauren MacKalveys hand. In life, bones have the tensile strength of forged iron. Even in death, they remain strong. But look at this. (she squishes the finger with a clamp)

MULDER: (referring to the vial of slime) What did this turn out to be?

SCULLY: Its organic. Mostly hydrochloric acid similar to what is secreted by the gastric mugosa.

MULDER: Its similar to stomach acid?

SCULLY: Almost identical only twice as acidic. I also found trace amounts of pepsin which is a digestive enzyme.

MULDER: So youre saying that this did that?

SCULLY: I dont know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis.

MULDER: (pointing at the remains in the drawer) Whats in here, Scully? Theoretically it should contain the same cellular components as her various tissuesskin, muscle, blood

SCULLY: In some broken-down form, yes.

MULDER: In the results of your chemical analysis did you find anything missing?

SCULLY: (looks at him strangely) Missing?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I dont think so. (looks at chart) All the body tissues were accounted for. except there were extremely low almost trace amounts of adipose.

MULDER: Fatty tissue. That could explain the weight discrepancy.

SCULLY: What weight discrepancy?

MULDER: The ME recorded Laurens weight at 122 but her drivers license had her at 165.

SCULLY: She probably lost weight since the license was issued.

MULDER: No, actually Laurens roommate said she was quite nervous about meeting this guy because she put on some weight recently.

SCULLY: (stumped) What possible motivation could the killer have for removing his victims fatty tissue? I mean, who do you think were dealing with here?

MULDER: I dont know.



SCENE 8
ELLEN'S APARTMENT

(ELLENS apartment. ELLEN, overweight, is looking in the mirror. Her roommate, JO, watches with concern.)

ELLEN: God. I look awful. Please tell me its the mirror.

JO: Ellen, this wasnt some public service announcement. It was an on-line warning by the FBI aimed specifically at women in Cleveland.

ELLEN: Give me some credit, will you, Jo? I happen to be a pretty good judge of character.

JO: Im not trying to freak you out.

ELLEN: No? Youre doing a pretty good job of it.

JO: I just think you should be careful, thats all.

ELLEN: Do you think this is easy for me? I finally connect with someone I like who seems to like me. Im scared enough to meet him for the first time without you telling me hes Charles Manson.

JO: I didnt say that.

ELLEN: Besides, its not like hes some stranger. Ive been chatting with him everyday for over a month.

JO: I know, and hes probably as great as he sounds. But what if he isnt?

(ELLEN sighs)



SCENE 9

(Front of a nice restaurant. Night. INCANTO stands outside holding bouquet of flowers. He impatiently checks his watch, then throws the bouquet down in disgust and walks off.)

(Later, INCANTO passes row of street hookers calling out to men passing by on foot and in cars.)

HOOKER1: Looking good, baby.

HOOKER 2: Hey, baby.

HOOKER 3: Hi, baby.

HOOKER 4: (older, slightly overweight) Over here, babe. Down here.

HOOKERS: I got what you need over here. Ooh, yeah. Uh-huh. See something you like? Come on, do you want some? I think he has the hots for you, baby. I think so. You know you want it. Mm-hmm.

(HOOKER 4 and INCANTO go into a deserted alley.)

HOOKER 4: What do you like, baby?

(INCANTO goes as if to kiss her. She stops him.)

HOOKER 4: Uh-uh. No kissing. Anything else you want is fine, but no kissing. (He grabs her roughly) What are you doing?

(She scratches him, then looks in disgust at the slime dirpping from her broken nails. HOOKER 4 begins screaming as INCANTO begins liposuction with his mouth.)

(Later, HOOKER 5 and her john pass by the alley.)

HOOKER 5: Theres a place we can go near here. Nice and cozy.

JOHN: Okay.

(They see INCANTO run from HOOKER 4s body. They see her mutilated face.)

JOHN: (running off) Un uh. Forget this!

HOOKER 5: Oh, my God.



SCENE 10

(Next morning. HOOKER death crime scene. SCULLY is looking at the body. CROSS giving instuctions to officers.)

CROSS: Make sure you get statements from all of them.

(Crosses to SCULLY.)

CROSS: Her name was Holly McClain. Shes worked in this area for a couple of years now, but she wasnt most johns first pick, if you know what I mean.

MULDER: (arriving on the scene) What happened?

CROSS: It looks like our guy again. One of the other girls found her last night. (Flips sheet to reveal slimy body)

SCULLY: (to MULDER) All of the air passages are blocked with what appears to be the same viscous hydrochloric acid we found on Lauren MacKalvey.

CROSS: Do you know what this stuff is?

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. SCULLY covers the body.)

CROSS: Hey, this is still my case.

MULDER: Were dealing with a serial murderer whos using an online service to attract his victims  all single women looking for Mr. Right.

CROSS: That doesnt jibe with a $20 hooker.

MULDER: No, it doesnt. Something must have gone wrong last night. He was forced to improvise.

CROSS: Were still talking about a guy without a consistent MO.

MULDER: Not necessarily. (pulls out papers) These are letters he e-mailed to Lauren MacKalvey. They contain lines from a handful 16th century Italian poems.

CROSS: So he has a copy of Barletts Quotations. So what?

MULDER: You wont find any of these in Bartletts.

CROSS: Im not sure I follow you.

MULDER: Look at this. Guinezelles "Lavitanova," Casteonas "Il Courtagiano," and others I wont even try to pronounce. These are from obscure texts from privately owned libraries that only lend to academic affiliates.

CROSS: Youre saying our our suspects a college professor?

MULDER: Or a graduate student, a visiting Fellow, maybe a translator. What we need is to compile a list of everybody in Cleveland who has these credentials. Can you do that?

CROSS: Yeah. Ill get right on that.

SCULLY: (crosses back to body) Heres something else that might help. The killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this. (Shows HOOKERs broken and bloody fingernails.)

MULDER: It looks like she took her pound of flesh, huh?



SCENE 11
INCANTOS APARTMENT

INCANTO is bandaging his scratched hand. Intercom buzzes.)

INCANTO: (into intercom) Yes?

DELIVERY GUY: (voice) I got a package for Incanto from Strautcher Publishing.

INCANTO: (into intercom) Leave it.

DELIVERY GUY: (voice) Sorry. I gotta get a signature.

(As INCANTO comes down the stairs he passes young JESSE, about 12. She is blind, feeling along wall for a painting dropcloth.)

JESSE: (sensing him) Hello, Mr. Incanto.

INCANTO: Good afternoon, Jesse.

LANDLADY: (coming out of another apartment) Jesse did you find those drop cloths yet? (pleasantly surprised to see INCANTO) Mr. Incanto, I didnt know you were out here.

INCANTO: Im just picking up a package.

LANDLADY: Jesse, did you know that Mr. Incantos a writer?

JESSE: I know, Mom. You told me a thousand times.

LANDLADY: Im putting those poems together. If you dont mind, Id like to drop them by sometime.

INCANTO: Just slip it under my door.

LANDLADY: After youve read them can I take you to dinner somewhere?

JESSE: (embarrassed, under her breath) Give me a break.

INCANTO: Actually, Im busy. I have a deadline. (Delivery guy raps at the door)

(He walks away and turns to her daughter, JESSE.)

LANDLADY: I wish you werent always so rude to him.

JESSE: I dont care. He creeps me out. Plus he smells gross --- like he uses dish soap for aftershave.

(JESSE focuses on INCANTOs location.)



SCENE 12
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT
1ST DISTRICT
10:13 AM

(Police office. SCULLY at computer with a tech.)

CROSS: Okay. Lane just gave me the list from the University. Hows it going over here?

SCULLY: Good. We are expanding the search to include the faculty rosters from the local community colleges. We. oh . (sees MULDER enter) Excuse me.

CROSS: Sure. Ill let you know what we turn up.

(SCULLY crosses to MULDER.)

MULDER: Did you find anything?

SCULLY: Im almost done with the list.

MULDER: That skin you found under the prostitutes fingernails -- I had the crime lab check the DNA results against the known offenders database.

SCULLY: And? (MULDER hands her a folder) Well, it says here they didnt find a match.

MULDER: No, but they did find something else. Check the next page where Ive circled. (puts his hand on her back leading her to a more private part of the busy room)

SCULLY: (reading) "The second sample contains no oils or essential fatty acid." Well, Mulder, there are any number of factors which could have caused that result. Where are you going with this?

MULDER: (leaning close to her) Okay, its not yet the finely detailed insanity that youve come to expect from me. Its just a theory, but what if hes not doing this out of a psychotic impulse but rather out of physical hunger? Maybe he needs to replenish this chemical deficiency in order to survive

SCULLY: From a dry skin sample youre concluding what? That hes some kind of fat-sucking vampire?

MULDER: I dont know how else to explain MacKalveys missing adipose. And I bet if you checked the Aberdeen victims youd find exactly the same thing. This killer secretes a digestive substance which renders the victims fat

SCULLY:.which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves entirely.

MULDER: There are examples of this in nature, arent there?

SCULLY: Yes, scorpions predigest their food outside of their body by regurgitating onto their prey but I dont know too many scorpions who surf the internet.

MULDER: Okay, but if Im right, were not just looking for a serial murderer. Were looking for some kind of genetically different human being  a creature who may be responsible for who knows how many missing person cases throughout the United States.

CROSS: (coming to them) Ive combed every faculty list and academic journal in Cleveland. Came up with 38 names. I figured wed divy up the list and Id get the Captain to put some more people on it.

SCULLY: Id like to brief them, if thats okay with you.

CROSS: (uncomfortable, but smiles tightly) Sure.



SCENE 13
INCANTOS APARTMENT

He looks at book of Italian poems from package.)

COMPUTER: (voice) You have mail.

(He logs on to his computer. Mail is from Huggs.)

HUGGS: IM SO SORRY. CAN WE PLEASE TRY AGAIN? ILL EXPLAIN WHEN I SEE YOU. I PROMISE NOT TO FLAKE OUT. APOLOGETICALLY YOURS, ELLEN.

(INCANTO smiles. Knock at the door. INCANTO goes to answer it. It is SCULLY, but then we see that the scene has actually jumped to another apartment and SCULLY is not with INCANTO, but with someone else on the list.)

SCULLY: Mr. Brenman? Im Special Agent Scully from the FBI. Would you mind if I asked you some questions? Thanks.

(Back at INCANTOs apartment, it is actually CROSS who knocked and is checking on INCANTO.)

CROSS: Thanks, sorry to bother you. Id like to ask you a few questions.

INCANTO: Sure.

(CROSS sees his bandaged hand, realizes. INCANTO looks at CROSS with hunger.)



SCENE 14
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

(Police office. Later.)

SCULLY: (to tech) These are all University addresses. Chances are, he spent most of the morning on campus.

MULDER comes over to SCULLY.)

MULDER: Scully. I wouldnt have made a good Amway salesman. I knocked on more doors.

SCULLY: Cross hasnt checked in yet. Weve been trying his cell phone but theres no answer.



SCENE 15
RESTAURANT

Check lands on table. ELLEN puts her hand on it.)

ELLEN: Im treating you.

INCANTO: No, I insist.

ELLEN: After the way I stood you up? I should insist.

INCANTO: Please.

(He takes the bill. She sees his hand. Mottled skin.)

ELLEN: Im sorry. I shouldnt have.

INCANTO: (explaining the marks) Its a kind of eczema. Ive had it since I was a kid.

ELLEN: (smiles) You know, I still feel so stupid about the other night.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to make any excuses. Whatever reasons you had, Im sure they were good ones.

ELLEN: You were right though --- About me being afraid? Its a pretty hard habit to break.

INCANTO: Youre not still afraid, are you?

ELLEN: No, Im not.

INCANTO: Good. Unfortunately, I have to get going. The last crosstown bus leaves in 15 minutes.

ELLEN: Youre taking the bus home?

INCANTO: My cars in the shop but Ill call you.

ELLEN: Dont be silly. Ill drive you.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to do that.

ELLEN: Im driving you home.



SCENE 16

(Hallway outside INCANTOS apartment. LANDLADY knocks at door. She has her poems.)

LANDLADY: Mr. Incanto?

(She begins to slide them under the door, then changes her mind and pulls out her key ring.)

(Exterior building. ELLEN and INCANTO drive up. Theres that uncomfortable end of date tension as they sit in the car.)

ELLEN: So, how long have you lived here?

INCANTO: Mmm not very long.

ELLEN: You know, I only live a few blocks away --- near St. Marks --- until some developer decided to turn it into condos. You can still see the steeple.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to be nervous.

ELLEN: Im not very good at this. Its been a long time since Ive been in this type of situation.

INCANTO: (whispering) Its okay.

(Inside LANDLADY is walking through INCANTOs apartment. She sets her poems by the bookshelf and a couple of flies land on the package. LANDLADY sniffs the air curiously.)

(In car, INCANTO gazes at ELLEN, then takes the keys out of the ignition.)

INCANTO: Why dont you come up with me? Ill read you that poem I told you about, " E Cazzone."

ELLEN: I dont know. Its kind of late.

INCANTO: I dont want to say good night just yet. Do you? (moving to her, but then sees light come on in his apartment) You know what? Youre absolutely right. Its late. I have a lot of work I have to do. Excuse me.

(He tosses keys back to her, gets out of the car. ELLEN wistfully watches him go.)

(Inside apartment. LANDLADY finds CROSS fat sucked body in the tub. As she reacts, we see INCANTO standing behind her.)



SCENE 17

(Later, apartment. JESSE feels the number 27, then pushes at INCANTOS door. It opens.)

JESSE: Mr. Incanto? Mr. Incanto?

INCANTO: What is it, Jesse?

JESSE: Do you know where my mom is?

INCANTO: Your mother? No.

JESSE: She takes a class down at St. Franks tonight --- a poetry class and she was supposed to be home over an hour ago.

INCANTO: Im sure shell be home soon. (advances on her)

JESSE: She didnt stop by to say hi or anything?

INCANTO: No. Not tonight.

JESSE: (scared, not believing him) Okay. Thanks. Shell probably be home soon.

(As Jesse slowly makes her way out of the unfamiliar room, she bumps into a suitcase by the door. INCANTO grabs her roughly.)

INCANTO: Im going to New York for a few days, on business. Dont worry about your mother. Im sure shell be fine.

(He closes the door.)



SCENE 18
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

MULDER: (on phone) Hes a police detective . His names Cross.. Thats right. He would have been by sometime this afternoon.

SCULLY: (on phone) He would have been by sometime this morning. Do you remember what time specifically? Could you describe him to me for verification? Excuse me a minute. (to MULDER) Did you find him?

MULDER: We just got a 911 reporting a possible homicide from a young girl at one of the addresses on Crosss list.



SCENE 19

(Police kick in INCANTOS door.)

COP: Police!

(They search the apartment.)

SCULLY: Mulder the landladys body --- We found her in the bathroom.

MULDER: What about Cross?

(SCULLY nods to where they are wheeling CROSSs body out.)

(Later, SCULLY gently interviewing JESSE in the hall as the coroners remove the bodies.)

SCULLY: I know this is hard to talk about right now, but I need you to tell me exactly what happened.

JESSE: I smelled her perfume.

SCULLY: Your mothers perfume?

JESSE: Thats when I knew he was lying. She was wearing her perfume when she left for her class.

SCULLY: And you smelled it in his apartment?

JESSE: I was scared that hed hurt me. I could tell he wanted to when he grabbed me.

SCULLY: He grabbed you?

JESSE: After I bumped into the suitcase he grabbed me pretty hard.

SCULLY: What suitcase?

JESSE: It was next to the door. He said he was going away on business or something.

SCULLY: Did he say where?

JESSE: (bravely not crying) New York.

SCULLY: Okay, Jesse. That helps us. Im going to take a couple of minutes and go talk to Agent Mulder. Mrs. Sheperd is right here. Ill be right back. (starts to go)

JESSE: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah?

JESSE: Why would someone do this?

SCULLY: I dont know, Jesse.

(SCULLY goes to MULDER.)

MULDER: Composite artist came up with this sketch from a neighbors description. His name is Virgil Incanto. At least thats what it says on his rental agreement. Theres no record that the guy even exists  no DMV, no birth certificate, no Social Security, not even a bank account.

SCULLY: What about employment records?

MULDER: Hes a translator of Italian literature. Freelance, but his publisher pays him in cashiers checks

SCULLY: He told the girl he was on his way to New York.

COP: Ill check flight schedules and have the airport issue an APB. (leaves)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: Hes not going to New York, Scully. Not now. Hes smarter than that. He knows how to survive, you know?

SCULLY: Well, how are we going to track him?

MULDER: He made contact with each one of his victims, right? (goes to computer)

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: That means theyre all in here somewhere. Each one of them. Past, present and future.



SCENE 20
FBI REGIONAL OFFICE
COMPUTER CRIME SECTION

(MULDER and SCULLY watching TECH work on INCANTOS computer.)

TECH: All the files have been deleted.

MULDER: Any chance of resurrecting them?

TECH: Its hard to say. He deliberately reformatted his hard drive. This guy didnt want anyone looking at his stuff.

(TECH puts in a 3.5 disc, and looks at the results.)

TECH: Good news is, I can restore the erased files.

SCULLY: And the bad news?

TECH: These files are all password protected and encrypted. It could take some time.

MULDER: We dont have much time.

TECH: Itll take as long as it takes.

(MULDER steps away frustrated.)



SCENE 21

(ELLENS apartment. Doorbell.)

ELLEN: Joanne? Is that you? Joanne? Who is it?

INCANTO: (outside in hall, voice rough) Ellen, its me.

ELLEN: Its late.

INCANTO: I know, and Id like not to wake your neighbors.

(ELLEN opens door with chain)

INCANTO: Can we talk about what happened tonight?

ELLEN: (still hurt) Theres nothing to talk about. You made it pretty clear what you wanted.

INCANTO: You dont understand.

ELLEN: I think I do.

INCANTO: I gave you a second chance after you kept me waiting in that restaurant for two hours. Give me the same courtesy, please, and then if you want me to go, Ill go. Only lets not do it out here.

(She lets him in.)

INCANTO: Thank you.

ELLEN: You want some coffee? I can make some?

INCANTO: Yeah. Id like that.

(ELLEN relocks the door.)



SCENE 22
CLEVELAND POLICE OFFICE

SCULLY: You were right, Mulder. Theyre coming up empty at the airport. So Im releasing the sketch to the media. We still have time to make the morning papers.

MULDER: That may not be necessary.

SCULLY: (pointing to computer readout) "Friend?"

MULDER: That was Lauren MacKalveys online name. These are all his victims. A regular grocery list.

SCULLY: (Handing tech sketch of INCANTO) We need this scanned and sent to everyone on that list.

TECH: Done. (goes to do it)

SCULLY: Im going to call the online service and have them fax us the telephone numbers of all those women.



SCENE 23

(ELLENS apartment. She pours coffee. Phone is ringing.)

ELLEN: The machine will pick up. Milk? I only have nonfat.

INCANTO: No, no, no. This is fine.

ELLEN: Give me a minute, will you? Id like to put on some clothes.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to do that.

ELLEN: I want to. Ill be right back.

(She goes into another room with her computer. Answering machine is blinking. She ignores it, logs on to the computer and sends message to her friend JOANNE.)

ELLEN: YOU WONT BELIEVE WHOS HERE RIGHT NOW, I DONT KNOW



SCENE 24
FBI OFFICE

SCULLY: (on phone) Just lock your doors until we contact you again. Youll be fine, Miss Iniss. He doesnt tend towards forcible entry. (hangs up)

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, thanks. (hangs up) That was Cleveland TV. Theyve already reported three of the women on the list as missing.

SCULLY: Well, weve already contacted everyone on this list directly except for these two. (ELLEN is one of them) I left messages on their machines.

MULDER: We better go check on them anyway.

(They go.)



SCENE 25

(ELLENS apartment. She is finishing her letter.)

ELLEN: YOU WONT BELIEVE WHOS HERE RIGHT NOW, I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD TELL YOU OR NOT. I HAVE TO GO. DETAILS IN THE MORNING. ELLEN

(ELLEN is about to log off. )

COMPUTER: (voice) You have mail.

MESSAGE: THIS MAN IS WANTED BY THE FBI AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT 800-555-0132.

(ELLEN opens the mail. Picture begins to download. It is the composite sketch of INCANTO.)

INCANTO: Ellen? I hope youre not online with some other guy.

ELLEN: (frightened) I was just e-mailing my girlfriend.

INCANTO: (entering the room) Your girlfriend?

ELLEN: Yes.

INCANTO: What about?

ELLEN: Us.

INCANTO: What were you telling her?

ELLEN: (almost crying she is so scared) Just how happy I am, that youre still interested in me. And that you hadnt rejected me like I thought you had.

(INCANTO sees reflection of his face on the computer screen in a mirror.)

INCANTO: Im glad you feel that way, Ellen. I know I do.

ELLEN: (terrified) Look, I still havent changed my clothes. Why dont you go wait outside, and Ill be right out.

INCANTO: You look beautiful. You dont need to change for me .

ELLEN: (almost crying now) Please. leave me alone, please! What do you want?

(She cries out as he comes toward her.)

(Outside, MULDER and SCULLY arrive. They come down the hall. Knock at ELLENs door.)

JO: (opening her door) Can I help you?

MULDER: (showing badge) Were with the FBI. Were looking for Ellen Kaminsky.

JO: Shes in her condo. She just e-mailed me a few minutes ago. Why? Whats wrong? Is something the matter?

MULDER: Get back in.

(MULDER kicks in the door, impressively. They enter, guns drawn.)

MULDER: Ellen?

(Guns out, they search the apartment. Computer monitor with INCANTOs face is on the floor sideways. MULDER looks out window, sees someone running down the street. Sound of ELLEN whimpering.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(SCULLY begins pulling slime out of ELLENs mouth.)

SCULLY: You go ahead. Ill stay here. Go.

(MULDER jumps out the window and down to the street)

SCULLY: (dials phone) This is Federal Agent Dana Scully. I need an ambulance right away to 658 South Hudson Avenue, Apartment number 23. Request special chemical burn unit.

(MULDER catches up with running figure.)

MULDER: Freeze! Federal Agent! Now put your hands up and step out where I can see you.

(Its a YOUNG BLACK MAN.)

YOUNG BLACK MAN: (scared) Just just dont shoot me, man.

(Mulder lowers his gun in disgust.)

(Inside. SCULLYs gun is on the floor next to ELLEN. She leaves ELLEN to go to the bathroom to look for medical supplies, including a Vaseline, bandage, and a small pair of scissors. Stands up to see INCANTO coming up behind her in the mirror. He smashes her head into the mirror, shattering the glass. She gets in a couple of good kicks before he pushes her to the floor, and begins going for her mouth. SCULLY grabs and uses the nail scissors and stabs INCANTO in the chest. GUNSHOT hits INCANTO. He falls on SCULLY. SCULLY looks up to see ELLEN, face mutilated by INCANTOs acid, holding the gun, staring down with hatred at the unconscious INCANTO.)



SCENE 26

(Prison interrogation room. INCANTO is in prison jumpsuit looking at list of names. His skin is falling apart. MULDER and SCULLY watch him.)

MULDER: Jennifer Flackett. Kathy Miller. Hillary Turk. 47 women reported missing in five states. At least give their families some peace of mind and tell us how many are on that list because of you.

INCANTO: (almost proudly, creepy) Theyre all mine.

MULDER: (disgusted) Come on, Scully. (to guard) Open the door.

(MULDER leaves. SCULLY stares at INCANTO.)

SCULLY: Why?

INCANTO: When you look at me, you see a monster But I was just feeding the hunger.

SCULLY: Youre more than a monster. You didnt just feed on their bodies. You fed on their minds.

INCANTO: My weakness was no greater than theirs. I gave them what they wanted. They gave me what I needed.

SCULLY: Not anymore. (starts to go)

INCANTO: (speaks Italian, then translates for SCULLY) "The dead are no longer lonely."

(SCULLY glares at him then turns to the door.)

SCULLY: Let me out.

(Door opens and she leaves. Last shot of INCANTOs nasty face, staring straight ahead.)

[THE END]

                                 THE WALK



SCENE 1

(Night. Exterior of an old car *Dodge Dart?* parked in a deserted area. We hear a man, INCANTO, and a woman, LAUREN, talking inside the car.)

(Inside the car. INCANTO, nice looking man, mid thirties, is obviously putting the moves on LAUREN, also mid thirties, about 40 pounds overweight. She is flattered, but shy.)

LAUREN: Thats a little hard to believe.

INCANTO: Just from your words  the way you saw things  I knew I wanted to meet you.

LAUREN: Well, I hope youre not too disappointed.

INCANTO: Lauren, we have a real connection which is rare.

LAUREN: Most men dont feel that way.

INCANTO: Most men dont know what theyre missing. (LAUREN giggles) What?

LAUREN: I cant believe this. I mean, I cant believe that after three months we finally meet in person, and youre (giggles) I dont know. I just really enjoyed myself tonight.

(She has been playing with her necklace which has a charm shaped like a clover, and it suddenly breaks.)

LAUREN: Oh, no. Oh

INCANTO: Here. Let me help you. (reclasps the necklace around her neck)

LAUREN: My sister gave it to me. For good luck, I guess. (laughs) Kind of dopey, huh? I mean a clover leaf. How blatant can you get?

(INCANTO fingers the clover charm.)

INCANTO: (looking at her) Its beautiful.

LAUREN: Thank you.

(INCANTO leans forward and they begin to kiss. After a few seconds, LAUREN realizes something is wrong and begins to struggle, trying to cry out against INCANTOs lips. Horrible sucking sound from INCANTO. He pulls back. LAUREN opens her mouth in horror. It is filled with a yellow jelly-like substance. INCANTO opens his mouth wide and comes at her again quickly. Exterior shot of car rocking, sound of heavy breathing.)



SCENE 2
WAREHOUSE

(Next morning. Outside a warehouse. Police car drives up beside the car from last night. COP gets out and knocks on the window which is covered on the inside with yellowish slime. The window is fogged on the outside making it difficult to see in.)

COP: Cock-a-doodle-doo. Rise and shine in there.

(No answer. He rubs the fog off a section of window and looks inside.)

COP: (shocked) Mother of God.

(He runs back to his patrol car. Camera shows her charm resting on her chest, the skin is mottled.)

COP: (voice) Dispatch, this is Car 73. Ive got a ? out on the lake front at Gary and Campbell



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
WAREHOUSE

(Warehouse. Later that day. Crime scene. DETECTIVE CROSS, mid fifties, in charge of the investigation gives instructions to some officers.)

CROSS: Drivers license. Lauren MacKalvey? Okay, I saw that. I want you to get on it.

(CROSS goes to MULDER, in his cool sunglasses, and SCULLY as they arrive. Speaks to MULDER only.)

CROSS: Agent Mulder? Alan Cross, Cleveland PD. Thanks a lot for coming out so quickly.

MULDER: This is my partner, Dana Scully.

(CROSS ignores her presence, keeps talking to MULDER. They cross to the car)

CROSS: We found a purse in the front seat of that car. According to the license, her name is Lauren MacKalvey but were not sure yet that this is her body.

SCULLY: Youre not sure?

CROSS: We couldnt make a positive ID, considering. ( He uncovers the body which is rapidly decaying - mass of pink and yellow slime) Wendy Sparks  shes our Bureau liaison --- she thought this would be closer to your area of expertise.

SCULLY: Any indication what would have been the cause of death?

CROSS: We were just lucky to get her into the bag without her body falling apart.

MULDER: (picking at the slime with a spoon thingy) This substance --- Did you find it anywhere else in the car? On the carpet or the upholstery? (spoons it into a vial)

CROSS: As a matter of fact, no.

MULDER: So it was only on the victims body?

CROSS: Thats what it looks like.

(MULDER steps away looking at the vial. CROSS follows.)

CROSS: Why? You have an idea what happened here?

MULDER: No. Not yet. (walks away)

SCULLY: (covering for MULDER as usual) Well call you when we find anything else concrete.

(CROSS doesnt answer her.)

SCULLY: Detective?

CROSS: Yeah. Sure. Call me.

(CROSS watches uncomfortably as SCULLY follows MULDER under the crime scene tape back to their car.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what do you think it is?

MULDER: A couple of months ago a case came across my desk from the Mississippi office. Four women from Aberdeen had disappeared in less than a month.

SCULLY: Disappeared?

MULDER: Only one of the victims was found, but her body was too decomposed to perform a viable autopsy.

SCULLY: Mulder, what we just saw was not decomposition.

MULDER: I know. Thats why I want you to find out what this is while youre at the coroners office. (hands her the vial)

SCULLY: What about you? Where are you going?

MULDER: Im going to try to find out if Lauren MacKelvey was a Lonely Heart. Each of the Aberdeen victims had answered personal ads in the local papers. If this is the same killer, hes just getting started.

(MULDER gets into the car, SCULLY processes this info.)



SCENE 4
APARTMENT

INCANTO is on computer typing in a chat room. He is TIMID.)

HUGGS: IM NOT SURE ITS SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO MEET.

TIMID: WHY. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?

(Shot of HUGGS, ELLEN typing in her apartment.)

HUGGS: DISAPPOINTMENT. REJECTION. THE USUAL ROUND OF SUSPECTS.

TIMID: BELIEVE ME, I KNOW. IVE BEEN DOWN THAT ROAD ONCE OR TWICE. BUT YOU CANT HIDE BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER FOREVER.

(Pause as ELLEN thinks.)

TIMID: CAN YOU?

(Knock at the INCANTOS door. He definitely didnt want to be disturbed. He opens the door. His landlady, slim, mid-thirties smiles at him.)

INCANTO: (cracking the door only a few inches) Yes. What is it?

LANDLADY: The handyman replaced the locks on the storage closets and I wanted to bring by your new key. (she hands it to him) I know what you do, Mr. Incanto.

INCANTO: (startled.) What is it you think that I do?

LANDLADY:(smiling) With all your typing and those packages from publishers in New York  youre a novelist, right? Or an editor? You see, Im a writer, too.

INCANTO: (not thrilled) What a coincidence. Shouldnt you be off writing, or something?

LANDLADY: I dont mean to impose or anything, but would you mind reading something of mine? It wont take much time. Theyre poems.

INCANTO: Certainly. Good-bye.

(He shuts the door. LAND LADY walks away.)



SCENE 5
AUTOPSY BAY

(Autopsy bay. CROSS is waiting. SCULLY enters in scrubs. CROSS is unpleasantly surprised to see her.)

CROSS: Oh, its you.

SCULLY: Its not a problem, is it?

CROSS: No. Just that Dr. Kramer didnt tell me that you were observing the autopsy.

SCULLY: (businesslike, getting ready for work, snapping on the latex) Im not observing. Im performing it myself.

CROSS: Youre a medical doctor?

SCULLY: You sound surprised.

CROSS: I dont know. I, uh, I guess maybe I am.

SCULLY: Why?

CROSS: Its nothing personal, Agent Scully. Im just old-fashioned in certain regards.

SCULLY: Old-fashioned?

CROSS: The truth is, I question the wisdom of assigning female law enforcement officers to certain types of cases.

SCULLY: (organizing instruments) Like this one?

CROSS: Whoever killed Lauren MacKalvey has a definite attitude toward women. So this has to be affecting your judgement.

SCULLY: I appreciate your concern, Detective, but its not necessary. All I want to do is solve this case just like you.

CROSS: Look, Im not being sexist here. Im just being honest.

SCULLY: Where would you like the autopsy report sent?

CROSS: You can fax it to my office.

(CROSS leaves. SCULLY sighs, then starts her tape recorder.)

SCULLY: The date is august 29th. The time is 4:15 pm. The subjects name is Lauren MacKalvey. Caucasian. Female. Approximate time of death uncertain. Cause of death unknown.

(She sees blood dripping from the closed drawer then opens the drawer showing that all tissue has melted off the bones and spills off the tray in a red pool. Very disgusting, even for SCULLY.)



SCENE 6

(MULDER interviewing LAURENS roommate at her apartment. Pretty thin blonde woman. There is a dreamy quality to her voice.)

ROOMMATE: It just doesnt make sense. He seemed so nice.

MULDER: I thought you said you never met the man Lauren was with last night.

ROOMMATE: I never did. He just seemed nice on the computer.

MULDER: They met through an online service?

ROOMMATE: In one of those chat rooms. You know, here people get together to talk about whatever theyre into.

MULDER: Right. Do you remember what room Lauren was in when she met him?

ROOMMATE: Big and Beautiful. She had kind of a weight problem. But "2 Shy" didnt seem to care. It wasnt about sex with him.

MULDER: "Too Shy?"

ROOMMATE: That was his online name. Lauren used to read me his letters. They were amazing. He knew exactly what to say. He sure as hell fooled me.

MULDER: She read you his letters? Do you think that she kept any hard copies of them?

ROOMMATE: Actually, I saved them myself. If you want, I can get them for you.

MULDER: Yes. Can I use your phone?

ROOMMATE: Yeah. Its right over there.

(MULDER dials the phone.)

CUT TO: (Autopsy Bay.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Listen, Scully. Our killer may have moved out of the personal columns and onto the internet. Im gonna send out a localized online warning.

SCULLY: (on phone) How do you know its the same guy?

MULDER: (on phone) Because he opened the account with one of the Aberdeen victims credit cards. I just called the online service.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Id like you to meet me at the coroners office as soon as you can.

MULDER: (on phone) Did you find anything in the autopsy?

SCULLY: (on phone) Theres not going to be an autopsy.



SCENE 7
AUTOPSY BAY

MULDER and SCULLY looking at nasty remains of the body.)

SCULLY: Its a metacarpal from Lauren MacKalveys hand. In life, bones have the tensile strength of forged iron. Even in death, they remain strong. But look at this. (she squishes the finger with a clamp)

MULDER: (referring to the vial of slime) What did this turn out to be?

SCULLY: Its organic. Mostly hydrochloric acid similar to what is secreted by the gastric mugosa.

MULDER: Its similar to stomach acid?

SCULLY: Almost identical only twice as acidic. I also found trace amounts of pepsin which is a digestive enzyme.

MULDER: So youre saying that this did that?

SCULLY: I dont know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis.

MULDER: (pointing at the remains in the drawer) Whats in here, Scully? Theoretically it should contain the same cellular components as her various tissuesskin, muscle, blood

SCULLY: In some broken-down form, yes.

MULDER: In the results of your chemical analysis did you find anything missing?

SCULLY: (looks at him strangely) Missing?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I dont think so. (looks at chart) All the body tissues were accounted for. except there were extremely low almost trace amounts of adipose.

MULDER: Fatty tissue. That could explain the weight discrepancy.

SCULLY: What weight discrepancy?

MULDER: The ME recorded Laurens weight at 122 but her drivers license had her at 165.

SCULLY: She probably lost weight since the license was issued.

MULDER: No, actually Laurens roommate said she was quite nervous about meeting this guy because she put on some weight recently.

SCULLY: (stumped) What possible motivation could the killer have for removing his victims fatty tissue? I mean, who do you think were dealing with here?

MULDER: I dont know.



SCENE 8
ELLEN'S APARTMENT

(ELLENS apartment. ELLEN, overweight, is looking in the mirror. Her roommate, JO, watches with concern.)

ELLEN: God. I look awful. Please tell me its the mirror.

JO: Ellen, this wasnt some public service announcement. It was an on-line warning by the FBI aimed specifically at women in Cleveland.

ELLEN: Give me some credit, will you, Jo? I happen to be a pretty good judge of character.

JO: Im not trying to freak you out.

ELLEN: No? Youre doing a pretty good job of it.

JO: I just think you should be careful, thats all.

ELLEN: Do you think this is easy for me? I finally connect with someone I like who seems to like me. Im scared enough to meet him for the first time without you telling me hes Charles Manson.

JO: I didnt say that.

ELLEN: Besides, its not like hes some stranger. Ive been chatting with him everyday for over a month.

JO: I know, and hes probably as great as he sounds. But what if he isnt?

(ELLEN sighs)



SCENE 9

(Front of a nice restaurant. Night. INCANTO stands outside holding bouquet of flowers. He impatiently checks his watch, then throws the bouquet down in disgust and walks off.)

(Later, INCANTO passes row of street hookers calling out to men passing by on foot and in cars.)

HOOKER1: Looking good, baby.

HOOKER 2: Hey, baby.

HOOKER 3: Hi, baby.

HOOKER 4: (older, slightly overweight) Over here, babe. Down here.

HOOKERS: I got what you need over here. Ooh, yeah. Uh-huh. See something you like? Come on, do you want some? I think he has the hots for you, baby. I think so. You know you want it. Mm-hmm.

(HOOKER 4 and INCANTO go into a deserted alley.)

HOOKER 4: What do you like, baby?

(INCANTO goes as if to kiss her. She stops him.)

HOOKER 4: Uh-uh. No kissing. Anything else you want is fine, but no kissing. (He grabs her roughly) What are you doing?

(She scratches him, then looks in disgust at the slime dirpping from her broken nails. HOOKER 4 begins screaming as INCANTO begins liposuction with his mouth.)

(Later, HOOKER 5 and her john pass by the alley.)

HOOKER 5: Theres a place we can go near here. Nice and cozy.

JOHN: Okay.

(They see INCANTO run from HOOKER 4s body. They see her mutilated face.)

JOHN: (running off) Un uh. Forget this!

HOOKER 5: Oh, my God.



SCENE 10

(Next morning. HOOKER death crime scene. SCULLY is looking at the body. CROSS giving instuctions to officers.)

CROSS: Make sure you get statements from all of them.

(Crosses to SCULLY.)

CROSS: Her name was Holly McClain. Shes worked in this area for a couple of years now, but she wasnt most johns first pick, if you know what I mean.

MULDER: (arriving on the scene) What happened?

CROSS: It looks like our guy again. One of the other girls found her last night. (Flips sheet to reveal slimy body)

SCULLY: (to MULDER) All of the air passages are blocked with what appears to be the same viscous hydrochloric acid we found on Lauren MacKalvey.

CROSS: Do you know what this stuff is?

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. SCULLY covers the body.)

CROSS: Hey, this is still my case.

MULDER: Were dealing with a serial murderer whos using an online service to attract his victims  all single women looking for Mr. Right.

CROSS: That doesnt jibe with a $20 hooker.

MULDER: No, it doesnt. Something must have gone wrong last night. He was forced to improvise.

CROSS: Were still talking about a guy without a consistent MO.

MULDER: Not necessarily. (pulls out papers) These are letters he e-mailed to Lauren MacKalvey. They contain lines from a handful 16th century Italian poems.

CROSS: So he has a copy of Barletts Quotations. So what?

MULDER: You wont find any of these in Bartletts.

CROSS: Im not sure I follow you.

MULDER: Look at this. Guinezelles "Lavitanova," Casteonas "Il Courtagiano," and others I wont even try to pronounce. These are from obscure texts from privately owned libraries that only lend to academic affiliates.

CROSS: Youre saying our our suspects a college professor?

MULDER: Or a graduate student, a visiting Fellow, maybe a translator. What we need is to compile a list of everybody in Cleveland who has these credentials. Can you do that?

CROSS: Yeah. Ill get right on that.

SCULLY: (crosses back to body) Heres something else that might help. The killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this. (Shows HOOKERs broken and bloody fingernails.)

MULDER: It looks like she took her pound of flesh, huh?



SCENE 11
INCANTOS APARTMENT

INCANTO is bandaging his scratched hand. Intercom buzzes.)

INCANTO: (into intercom) Yes?

DELIVERY GUY: (voice) I got a package for Incanto from Strautcher Publishing.

INCANTO: (into intercom) Leave it.

DELIVERY GUY: (voice) Sorry. I gotta get a signature.

(As INCANTO comes down the stairs he passes young JESSE, about 12. She is blind, feeling along wall for a painting dropcloth.)

JESSE: (sensing him) Hello, Mr. Incanto.

INCANTO: Good afternoon, Jesse.

LANDLADY: (coming out of another apartment) Jesse did you find those drop cloths yet? (pleasantly surprised to see INCANTO) Mr. Incanto, I didnt know you were out here.

INCANTO: Im just picking up a package.

LANDLADY: Jesse, did you know that Mr. Incantos a writer?

JESSE: I know, Mom. You told me a thousand times.

LANDLADY: Im putting those poems together. If you dont mind, Id like to drop them by sometime.

INCANTO: Just slip it under my door.

LANDLADY: After youve read them can I take you to dinner somewhere?

JESSE: (embarrassed, under her breath) Give me a break.

INCANTO: Actually, Im busy. I have a deadline. (Delivery guy raps at the door)

(He walks away and turns to her daughter, JESSE.)

LANDLADY: I wish you werent always so rude to him.

JESSE: I dont care. He creeps me out. Plus he smells gross --- like he uses dish soap for aftershave.

(JESSE focuses on INCANTOs location.)



SCENE 12
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT
1ST DISTRICT
10:13 AM

(Police office. SCULLY at computer with a tech.)

CROSS: Okay. Lane just gave me the list from the University. Hows it going over here?

SCULLY: Good. We are expanding the search to include the faculty rosters from the local community colleges. We. oh . (sees MULDER enter) Excuse me.

CROSS: Sure. Ill let you know what we turn up.

(SCULLY crosses to MULDER.)

MULDER: Did you find anything?

SCULLY: Im almost done with the list.

MULDER: That skin you found under the prostitutes fingernails -- I had the crime lab check the DNA results against the known offenders database.

SCULLY: And? (MULDER hands her a folder) Well, it says here they didnt find a match.

MULDER: No, but they did find something else. Check the next page where Ive circled. (puts his hand on her back leading her to a more private part of the busy room)

SCULLY: (reading) "The second sample contains no oils or essential fatty acid." Well, Mulder, there are any number of factors which could have caused that result. Where are you going with this?

MULDER: (leaning close to her) Okay, its not yet the finely detailed insanity that youve come to expect from me. Its just a theory, but what if hes not doing this out of a psychotic impulse but rather out of physical hunger? Maybe he needs to replenish this chemical deficiency in order to survive

SCULLY: From a dry skin sample youre concluding what? That hes some kind of fat-sucking vampire?

MULDER: I dont know how else to explain MacKalveys missing adipose. And I bet if you checked the Aberdeen victims youd find exactly the same thing. This killer secretes a digestive substance which renders the victims fat

SCULLY:.which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves entirely.

MULDER: There are examples of this in nature, arent there?

SCULLY: Yes, scorpions predigest their food outside of their body by regurgitating onto their prey but I dont know too many scorpions who surf the internet.

MULDER: Okay, but if Im right, were not just looking for a serial murderer. Were looking for some kind of genetically different human being  a creature who may be responsible for who knows how many missing person cases throughout the United States.

CROSS: (coming to them) Ive combed every faculty list and academic journal in Cleveland. Came up with 38 names. I figured wed divy up the list and Id get the Captain to put some more people on it.

SCULLY: Id like to brief them, if thats okay with you.

CROSS: (uncomfortable, but smiles tightly) Sure.



SCENE 13
INCANTOS APARTMENT

He looks at book of Italian poems from package.)

COMPUTER: (voice) You have mail.

(He logs on to his computer. Mail is from Huggs.)

HUGGS: IM SO SORRY. CAN WE PLEASE TRY AGAIN? ILL EXPLAIN WHEN I SEE YOU. I PROMISE NOT TO FLAKE OUT. APOLOGETICALLY YOURS, ELLEN.

(INCANTO smiles. Knock at the door. INCANTO goes to answer it. It is SCULLY, but then we see that the scene has actually jumped to another apartment and SCULLY is not with INCANTO, but with someone else on the list.)

SCULLY: Mr. Brenman? Im Special Agent Scully from the FBI. Would you mind if I asked you some questions? Thanks.

(Back at INCANTOs apartment, it is actually CROSS who knocked and is checking on INCANTO.)

CROSS: Thanks, sorry to bother you. Id like to ask you a few questions.

INCANTO: Sure.

(CROSS sees his bandaged hand, realizes. INCANTO looks at CROSS with hunger.)



SCENE 14
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

(Police office. Later.)

SCULLY: (to tech) These are all University addresses. Chances are, he spent most of the morning on campus.

MULDER comes over to SCULLY.)

MULDER: Scully. I wouldnt have made a good Amway salesman. I knocked on more doors.

SCULLY: Cross hasnt checked in yet. Weve been trying his cell phone but theres no answer.



SCENE 15
RESTAURANT

Check lands on table. ELLEN puts her hand on it.)

ELLEN: Im treating you.

INCANTO: No, I insist.

ELLEN: After the way I stood you up? I should insist.

INCANTO: Please.

(He takes the bill. She sees his hand. Mottled skin.)

ELLEN: Im sorry. I shouldnt have.

INCANTO: (explaining the marks) Its a kind of eczema. Ive had it since I was a kid.

ELLEN: (smiles) You know, I still feel so stupid about the other night.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to make any excuses. Whatever reasons you had, Im sure they were good ones.

ELLEN: You were right though --- About me being afraid? Its a pretty hard habit to break.

INCANTO: Youre not still afraid, are you?

ELLEN: No, Im not.

INCANTO: Good. Unfortunately, I have to get going. The last crosstown bus leaves in 15 minutes.

ELLEN: Youre taking the bus home?

INCANTO: My cars in the shop but Ill call you.

ELLEN: Dont be silly. Ill drive you.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to do that.

ELLEN: Im driving you home.



SCENE 16

(Hallway outside INCANTOS apartment. LANDLADY knocks at door. She has her poems.)

LANDLADY: Mr. Incanto?

(She begins to slide them under the door, then changes her mind and pulls out her key ring.)

(Exterior building. ELLEN and INCANTO drive up. Theres that uncomfortable end of date tension as they sit in the car.)

ELLEN: So, how long have you lived here?

INCANTO: Mmm not very long.

ELLEN: You know, I only live a few blocks away --- near St. Marks --- until some developer decided to turn it into condos. You can still see the steeple.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to be nervous.

ELLEN: Im not very good at this. Its been a long time since Ive been in this type of situation.

INCANTO: (whispering) Its okay.

(Inside LANDLADY is walking through INCANTOs apartment. She sets her poems by the bookshelf and a couple of flies land on the package. LANDLADY sniffs the air curiously.)

(In car, INCANTO gazes at ELLEN, then takes the keys out of the ignition.)

INCANTO: Why dont you come up with me? Ill read you that poem I told you about, " E Cazzone."

ELLEN: I dont know. Its kind of late.

INCANTO: I dont want to say good night just yet. Do you? (moving to her, but then sees light come on in his apartment) You know what? Youre absolutely right. Its late. I have a lot of work I have to do. Excuse me.

(He tosses keys back to her, gets out of the car. ELLEN wistfully watches him go.)

(Inside apartment. LANDLADY finds CROSS fat sucked body in the tub. As she reacts, we see INCANTO standing behind her.)



SCENE 17

(Later, apartment. JESSE feels the number 27, then pushes at INCANTOS door. It opens.)

JESSE: Mr. Incanto? Mr. Incanto?

INCANTO: What is it, Jesse?

JESSE: Do you know where my mom is?

INCANTO: Your mother? No.

JESSE: She takes a class down at St. Franks tonight --- a poetry class and she was supposed to be home over an hour ago.

INCANTO: Im sure shell be home soon. (advances on her)

JESSE: She didnt stop by to say hi or anything?

INCANTO: No. Not tonight.

JESSE: (scared, not believing him) Okay. Thanks. Shell probably be home soon.

(As Jesse slowly makes her way out of the unfamiliar room, she bumps into a suitcase by the door. INCANTO grabs her roughly.)

INCANTO: Im going to New York for a few days, on business. Dont worry about your mother. Im sure shell be fine.

(He closes the door.)



SCENE 18
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT

MULDER: (on phone) Hes a police detective . His names Cross.. Thats right. He would have been by sometime this afternoon.

SCULLY: (on phone) He would have been by sometime this morning. Do you remember what time specifically? Could you describe him to me for verification? Excuse me a minute. (to MULDER) Did you find him?

MULDER: We just got a 911 reporting a possible homicide from a young girl at one of the addresses on Crosss list.



SCENE 19

(Police kick in INCANTOS door.)

COP: Police!

(They search the apartment.)

SCULLY: Mulder the landladys body --- We found her in the bathroom.

MULDER: What about Cross?

(SCULLY nods to where they are wheeling CROSSs body out.)

(Later, SCULLY gently interviewing JESSE in the hall as the coroners remove the bodies.)

SCULLY: I know this is hard to talk about right now, but I need you to tell me exactly what happened.

JESSE: I smelled her perfume.

SCULLY: Your mothers perfume?

JESSE: Thats when I knew he was lying. She was wearing her perfume when she left for her class.

SCULLY: And you smelled it in his apartment?

JESSE: I was scared that hed hurt me. I could tell he wanted to when he grabbed me.

SCULLY: He grabbed you?

JESSE: After I bumped into the suitcase he grabbed me pretty hard.

SCULLY: What suitcase?

JESSE: It was next to the door. He said he was going away on business or something.

SCULLY: Did he say where?

JESSE: (bravely not crying) New York.

SCULLY: Okay, Jesse. That helps us. Im going to take a couple of minutes and go talk to Agent Mulder. Mrs. Sheperd is right here. Ill be right back. (starts to go)

JESSE: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah?

JESSE: Why would someone do this?

SCULLY: I dont know, Jesse.

(SCULLY goes to MULDER.)

MULDER: Composite artist came up with this sketch from a neighbors description. His name is Virgil Incanto. At least thats what it says on his rental agreement. Theres no record that the guy even exists  no DMV, no birth certificate, no Social Security, not even a bank account.

SCULLY: What about employment records?

MULDER: Hes a translator of Italian literature. Freelance, but his publisher pays him in cashiers checks

SCULLY: He told the girl he was on his way to New York.

COP: Ill check flight schedules and have the airport issue an APB. (leaves)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: Hes not going to New York, Scully. Not now. Hes smarter than that. He knows how to survive, you know?

SCULLY: Well, how are we going to track him?

MULDER: He made contact with each one of his victims, right? (goes to computer)

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: That means theyre all in here somewhere. Each one of them. Past, present and future.



SCENE 20
FBI REGIONAL OFFICE
COMPUTER CRIME SECTION

(MULDER and SCULLY watching TECH work on INCANTOS computer.)

TECH: All the files have been deleted.

MULDER: Any chance of resurrecting them?

TECH: Its hard to say. He deliberately reformatted his hard drive. This guy didnt want anyone looking at his stuff.

(TECH puts in a 3.5 disc, and looks at the results.)

TECH: Good news is, I can restore the erased files.

SCULLY: And the bad news?

TECH: These files are all password protected and encrypted. It could take some time.

MULDER: We dont have much time.

TECH: Itll take as long as it takes.

(MULDER steps away frustrated.)



SCENE 21

(ELLENS apartment. Doorbell.)

ELLEN: Joanne? Is that you? Joanne? Who is it?

INCANTO: (outside in hall, voice rough) Ellen, its me.

ELLEN: Its late.

INCANTO: I know, and Id like not to wake your neighbors.

(ELLEN opens door with chain)

INCANTO: Can we talk about what happened tonight?

ELLEN: (still hurt) Theres nothing to talk about. You made it pretty clear what you wanted.

INCANTO: You dont understand.

ELLEN: I think I do.

INCANTO: I gave you a second chance after you kept me waiting in that restaurant for two hours. Give me the same courtesy, please, and then if you want me to go, Ill go. Only lets not do it out here.

(She lets him in.)

INCANTO: Thank you.

ELLEN: You want some coffee? I can make some?

INCANTO: Yeah. Id like that.

(ELLEN relocks the door.)



SCENE 22
CLEVELAND POLICE OFFICE

SCULLY: You were right, Mulder. Theyre coming up empty at the airport. So Im releasing the sketch to the media. We still have time to make the morning papers.

MULDER: That may not be necessary.

SCULLY: (pointing to computer readout) "Friend?"

MULDER: That was Lauren MacKalveys online name. These are all his victims. A regular grocery list.

SCULLY: (Handing tech sketch of INCANTO) We need this scanned and sent to everyone on that list.

TECH: Done. (goes to do it)

SCULLY: Im going to call the online service and have them fax us the telephone numbers of all those women.



SCENE 23

(ELLENS apartment. She pours coffee. Phone is ringing.)

ELLEN: The machine will pick up. Milk? I only have nonfat.

INCANTO: No, no, no. This is fine.

ELLEN: Give me a minute, will you? Id like to put on some clothes.

INCANTO: Ellen, you dont have to do that.

ELLEN: I want to. Ill be right back.

(She goes into another room with her computer. Answering machine is blinking. She ignores it, logs on to the computer and sends message to her friend JOANNE.)

ELLEN: YOU WONT BELIEVE WHOS HERE RIGHT NOW, I DONT KNOW



SCENE 24
FBI OFFICE

SCULLY: (on phone) Just lock your doors until we contact you again. Youll be fine, Miss Iniss. He doesnt tend towards forcible entry. (hangs up)

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, thanks. (hangs up) That was Cleveland TV. Theyve already reported three of the women on the list as missing.

SCULLY: Well, weve already contacted everyone on this list directly except for these two. (ELLEN is one of them) I left messages on their machines.

MULDER: We better go check on them anyway.

(They go.)



SCENE 25

(ELLENS apartment. She is finishing her letter.)

ELLEN: YOU WONT BELIEVE WHOS HERE RIGHT NOW, I DONT KNOW IF I SHOULD TELL YOU OR NOT. I HAVE TO GO. DETAILS IN THE MORNING. ELLEN

(ELLEN is about to log off. )

COMPUTER: (voice) You have mail.

MESSAGE: THIS MAN IS WANTED BY THE FBI AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION, IMMEDIATELY CONTACT 800-555-0132.

(ELLEN opens the mail. Picture begins to download. It is the composite sketch of INCANTO.)

INCANTO: Ellen? I hope youre not online with some other guy.

ELLEN: (frightened) I was just e-mailing my girlfriend.

INCANTO: (entering the room) Your girlfriend?

ELLEN: Yes.

INCANTO: What about?

ELLEN: Us.

INCANTO: What were you telling her?

ELLEN: (almost crying she is so scared) Just how happy I am, that youre still interested in me. And that you hadnt rejected me like I thought you had.

(INCANTO sees reflection of his face on the computer screen in a mirror.)

INCANTO: Im glad you feel that way, Ellen. I know I do.

ELLEN: (terrified) Look, I still havent changed my clothes. Why dont you go wait outside, and Ill be right out.

INCANTO: You look beautiful. You dont need to change for me .

ELLEN: (almost crying now) Please. leave me alone, please! What do you want?

(She cries out as he comes toward her.)

(Outside, MULDER and SCULLY arrive. They come down the hall. Knock at ELLENs door.)

JO: (opening her door) Can I help you?

MULDER: (showing badge) Were with the FBI. Were looking for Ellen Kaminsky.

JO: Shes in her condo. She just e-mailed me a few minutes ago. Why? Whats wrong? Is something the matter?

MULDER: Get back in.

(MULDER kicks in the door, impressively. They enter, guns drawn.)

MULDER: Ellen?

(Guns out, they search the apartment. Computer monitor with INCANTOs face is on the floor sideways. MULDER looks out window, sees someone running down the street. Sound of ELLEN whimpering.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(SCULLY begins pulling slime out of ELLENs mouth.)

SCULLY: You go ahead. Ill stay here. Go.

(MULDER jumps out the window and down to the street)

SCULLY: (dials phone) This is Federal Agent Dana Scully. I need an ambulance right away to 658 South Hudson Avenue, Apartment number 23. Request special chemical burn unit.

(MULDER catches up with running figure.)

MULDER: Freeze! Federal Agent! Now put your hands up and step out where I can see you.

(Its a YOUNG BLACK MAN.)

YOUNG BLACK MAN: (scared) Just just dont shoot me, man.

(Mulder lowers his gun in disgust.)

(Inside. SCULLYs gun is on the floor next to ELLEN. She leaves ELLEN to go to the bathroom to look for medical supplies, including a Vaseline, bandage, and a small pair of scissors. Stands up to see INCANTO coming up behind her in the mirror. He smashes her head into the mirror, shattering the glass. She gets in a couple of good kicks before he pushes her to the floor, and begins going for her mouth. SCULLY grabs and uses the nail scissors and stabs INCANTO in the chest. GUNSHOT hits INCANTO. He falls on SCULLY. SCULLY looks up to see ELLEN, face mutilated by INCANTOs acid, holding the gun, staring down with hatred at the unconscious INCANTO.)



SCENE 26

(Prison interrogation room. INCANTO is in prison jumpsuit looking at list of names. His skin is falling apart. MULDER and SCULLY watch him.)

MULDER: Jennifer Flackett. Kathy Miller. Hillary Turk. 47 women reported missing in five states. At least give their families some peace of mind and tell us how many are on that list because of you.

INCANTO: (almost proudly, creepy) Theyre all mine.

MULDER: (disgusted) Come on, Scully. (to guard) Open the door.

(MULDER leaves. SCULLY stares at INCANTO.)

SCULLY: Why?

INCANTO: When you look at me, you see a monster But I was just feeding the hunger.

SCULLY: Youre more than a monster. You didnt just feed on their bodies. You fed on their minds.

INCANTO: My weakness was no greater than theirs. I gave them what they wanted. They gave me what I needed.

SCULLY: Not anymore. (starts to go)

INCANTO: (speaks Italian, then translates for SCULLY) "The dead are no longer lonely."

(SCULLY glares at him then turns to the door.)

SCULLY: Let me out.

(Door opens and she leaves. Last shot of INCANTOs nasty face, staring straight ahead.)

SCENE 1
VALLEY WOODS HIGH SCHOOL
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON

(School gym. Picture day. High school student, AMY JACOBS, pretty, about 15, against blue screen. LARKEN is the photographer. She smiles, picture is snapped.)

LARKEN: Name please?

AMY: Amy Jacobs.

LARKEN: Fill out your address card. May I have the next on in line?

(AMY crosses to the table where her friends laughingly tease her about how she looked for the picture.)

LARKEN: Carl, I need a reload.

(The assistant, CARL WADE, early 40s, stares at AMY as she fills out her address card.)

LARKEN: (trying to get WADEs attention) Hey, Carl. Hey! I need more film.

WADE: I havent loaded it yet.

LARKEN: Why you even bother coming in if youre not going to do your job?

(LARKEN goes to load the film himself. WADE keeps staring at AMY.)

(Later, alone in a darkroom, in an almost sexual experience, WADE caresses then cuts out AMYs picture and puts it with his and takes another series of pictures as if they were together. Camera pans back and we see the flashes coming out of a trapdoor to a basement in a dark house.)



SCENE 2

(AMYs bedroom, Night. 10:05 PM. She and her sister are asleep. WADE crawls in the window, places his hand over her mouth and pulls her out of bed.)

WADE: (whispering to AMY) Nobodys going to spoil us.

(He pulls her out the window. AMYs little sister wakes up in time to see them.)

SISTER: Amy? Amy! Mom!



SCENE 3

(Busy fast food restaurant. Same night. WAITRESS looks over to where LUCY HOUSEHOLDER, another waitress, THIN, early thirties, unkempt blonde hair, is pulling drinks.)

WAITRESS: Hurry up with those drinks, Lucy. Were backing up. (Grabs the drinks LUCY has poured.) What are you doing? These are regular. They all ordered large. What?

(WAITRESS notices blood pouring out of LUCYs nose and down the front of her uniform. LUCY is in shock.)

WAITRESS: What happened?

(LUCY falls to the floor muttering over and over as if in a trance.)

LUCY: Nobodys going to spoil us Nobodys going to spoil us  NobodyNobodys going .Nobodys going to spoil us Nbodys going to spoil  oodys going to spoil  Nbdys going to spoil us 

(Camera pans to her watch. 10:05 PM.)

SCENE 4

(JACOBs house. Next day. Crime scene. MULDER arrives and enters the house, finds a police officer.)

MULDER: Im looking for the agent in charge.

OFFICER: And you are?

MULDER: (showing badge) Special Agent Mulder.

OFFICER: Ill let him know youre here.

(MULDER walks through the house, ending up in the girls bedroom. MYRA JACOBS stands staring out a window.)

MULDER: Mrs. Jacobs? Im Fox Mulder. Im with the FBI. Im sorry about your daughter.

MRS. JACOBS: Its her birthday on Tuesday.

MULDER: Were going to do everything we can to find her.

MRS. JACOBS: Who could do such a thing? Who could take somebody who wasnt theirs?

MULDER: I know you must be feeling

MRS. JACOBS: Im sorry but how could you really know how I feel?

(MULDER stares off into space as she leaves. Then goes to look at blood drops on the carpet. AGENT EUBANKS, early fifties, no-nonsense guy, enters the room)

AGENT EUBANKS: Its blood. Amy had a nosebleed. Her little sister said it happened when the kidnapper put his hand over her mouth. Were running it anyway. Walt Eubanks, Special Agent in Charge.

MULDER: Fox Mulder. Any leads on a suspect?

AGENT EUBANKS: A vague description from the sister. Hair and fiber pulled some promising bits but he didnt leave any prints here or in the flower beds out front.

MULDER: The neighbors?

AGENT EUBANKS: Nobody saw anything. Not a car  nothing. It was someone who knew her  that much we can figure. He knew right where he was going.

MULDER: No, I bet that he didnt know her so well or else he wouldnt have been so bold.

AGENT EUBANKS: Either way, were pretty much chasing our tails until something or someone turns on this.

MULDER: What about this woman at the restaurant?

AGENT EUBANKS: You heard?

MULDER: Yeah, thats why I came down here.

AGENT EUBANKS: Seems like a pretty thin lead.

MULDER: Mind if I talk to her?

AGENT EUBANKS: Hey, save me the time.

MULDER: Great. Thanks.



SCENE 5
UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
10:31 AM

(Hospital. SCULLY, out of breath, comes up to MULDER who is reading a chart.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: (surprised to see her) I thought you missed your flight.

SCULLY: We were delayed in DC. I tried you on your cell phone.

MULDER: I forgot it. I left in kind of a hurry.

SCULLY: Your message said something about a kidnapping?

MULDER: Yeah, 15 year old girl, Amy Jacobs was taken from her bedroom last night, 10:00.

SCULLY: Is she here?

MULDER: No. They havent found her.

SCULLY: What are we doing here?

MULDER: A 30-year-old woman named Lucy Householder was admitted here shortly after 10:00. She collapsed at work suffering from some kind of seizure and what her doctors are calling glossolalia.

SCULLY: Incoherent speech.

MULDER: (hitting elevator button) Technically, but whether she knew it or not, she was repeating the exact words spoken by Amys abductor the exact same time 20 miles across town.

SCULLY: Well, thats spooky.

MULDER: Thats my name, isnt it? Turns out, Lucy Householder knows a little something about kidnapping herself. When she was eight years old she was taken from her bedroom while her parents were asleep. She was missing for five years until she escaped and someone found her by the side of the road. Apparently, her abductor had kept her locked in a basement the entire time. They never caught him.

(They get in elevator. Later, LUCYs room. LUCY is staring out the window. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

MULDER: Lucy? Im Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. Were with the FBI. Wed like to ask you a few questions.

LUCY: Id like a cigarette. They wont let me smoke in here.

SCULLY: Are you feeling any better?

LUCY: Yeah, Im fine. Id just like a cigarette.

MULDER: A young girl was kidnapped last night. Have you heard anything about that?

LUCY: What are you asking me for?

MULDER: Do you remember what you were saying last night when you collapsed at work?

LUCY: What?

MULDER: You were saying "Nobodys going to spoil us."

SCULLY: Does that mean anything to you?

LUCY: No.

SCULLY: Can you think of any reason why you might have said it?

LUCY: What did I just say?

MULDER: Those were the exact words spoken by the kidnapper to the little girl when he took her last night. So you can see, that under the circumstances, it might seem strange that you

LUCY: So whats your point? All of us kidnap victims gotta stick together?

MULDER: No. We just want to find the little girl any way we can, and if you know anything

LUCY: Look, what Ive been through all my life I wouldnt wish on anybody. It doesnt mean I can make it any better for me or anyone else.

MULDER: All right, well thanks for talking to us, Lucy.

LUCY: Yeah.

(MULDER and SCULLY start to leave.)

LUCY: Hey! When do I get out of here?

SCULLY: Im sure as soon as your doctors feel its okay for you to go.

LUCY: No. They say its up to you.

MULDER: No, we cant hold you here. Youre free to go.

(LUCY runs into the bathroom.)

SCULLY: (to MULDER) I guess shes not too big on confined spaces.

MULDER: Yeah.

(MULDER and SCULLY exit. In bathroom, LUCY holds her hand under steaming hot water from the sink. She looks up slowly at herself in the mirror. Scene cuts to:)



SCENE 6

(POV from the trunk of a car, WADE looking down into the trunk. TOW TRUCK DRIVER pulls up behind him. WADE looks at the truck, then back to the trunk. Trunk POV as he closes the lid.)

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: You the one that called for a tow?

WADE: No. Not me.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Gary Mosier?

WADE: No. Wrong guy.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: (friendly) While Im out here I might as well give you a hand.

WADE: Its okay. Well be fine.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: (looking at WADEs blown out tire) Hey, it looks like youre in a world of hurt. Blown sidewall. Youre going to need a new tire.

WADE: Yeah. Looks that way.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Got a spare in the trunk?

WADE: Yeah.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Twenty bucks cash. My boss dont gotta know about it. Have you on the road in five minutes.

WADE: I cant pay you.

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Make it ten. Pop the trunk. Take me five minutes, max.

(WADE picks up the tire iron and threatens the DRIVER.)

WADE: (yelling) Leave me alone!

(TOW TRUCK DRIVER runs and gets in his truck and begins to drive away.)

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Hey, man, what the hells your problem?

WADE: Leave me alone! Get out of here!

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Lunatic! Freak! (drives off)



SCENE 7
FBI REGIONAL FIELD OFFICE
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON
1:53 PM

(Police office. AGENT EUBANKS stops MULDER.)

AGENT EUBANKS: Hold on a second. Agent Mulder. Lucy Householder --- you get anywhere on that?

MULDER: Im working on it.

AGENT EUBANKS: One of my guys says shes got a criminal record --- prostitution, narcotics convictions. Shes done some time.

MULDER: It doesnt surprise me given her history.

AGENT EUBANKS: Shes also got a boyfriend doing time for assault and child endangerment. Used to live with him up in the hills. Pretty sketchy characters.

MULDER: I dont think shes involved.

AGENT EUBANKS: Closest thing I got right now to a lead. I can tell them to shift some men

MULDER: (walking away) No. Let me follow up on that, okay? Thanks.

(SCULLY enters and goes to MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder I got something  something weird.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: I was going over Lucy Householders medical work-up and something hit me. Her blood type is O-positive.

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes -- O-positive and B -positive. Two guesses as to what Amy Jacobs blood type is.

MULDER: How could it be Amy Jacobs blood? Lucy was all the way across town.

SCULLY: I dont know, Mulder, but it begs the question.

MULDER: Why? Because it matches the victims blood type? How many people have B -positive blood, Scully? One in five? Thats got to be hundreds of thousands of people in the local population alone.

SCULLY: Were not talking about the local population. Were talking about a woman who is tied to this case who had somebody elses blood on her uniform.

MULDER: (leans down close to SCULLY) Lucy is a victim, Scully, just like Amy Jacobs. If shes got any connection to this case thats the extent of it.

SCULLY: Well, well know soon enough.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Im running a PCR on her blood to see if theres a DNA match.

MULDER: (looks to see if anyone overheard) Will you do me a favor? Will you keep that under your hat?

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: Cause I dont want Lucy Householder treated like a suspect in this case until its absolutely certain she is one, okay?

(SCULLY sighs as she watches MULDER leave.)



SCENE 8
BRIGHT ANGEL HALFWAY HOUSE
7:10 PM

(Halfway house where LUCY lives. HENRY, another resident, goes into LUCYs room with a blanket, worried. LUCY is shivering in bed.)

HENRY: Lucy?

LUCY: Im cold.

HENRY: (covering her tenderly) I brought you another blanket. We should call the doctor.

LUCY: No!

HENRY: Let me see your face. (LUCYs face is covered with scratches) What did you do to yourself?

LUCY: Its dark. Why is it dark? I cant see.

HENRY: (really worried) You hold on now.

LUCY: I cant see.

(Quick cut to AMY trembling in a dark basement. Her face is also cut and bleeding. There is a banging noise above. She sees WADEs eyes watching her through a peephole. He slams it shut, leaving her in the dark. She cries softly, shaking from cold.)



SCENE 9
BRIGHT ANGEL HALFWAY HOUSE
8:03 PM

(Halfway house, later. MULDER drives up. Ambulance outside. EMS team is checking LUCY. MULDER enters LUCYs room.)

MULDER: Hows she doing?

EMS: Fine. Blood pressures back to normal. Temperatures back up. She must have gone down the rabbit hole for a while. (to LUCY) You should get something to eat soon. Get your blood sugar back up.

MULDER: Thanks.

(EMS leaves.)

MULDER: What do you say, Lucy? Can I take you to dinner?

(Later, at the restaurant, MULDER watches Lucy eat a bowl of soup.)

MULDER: You feeling better?

LUCY: Better than what?

MULDER: Better than Amy Jacobs?

LUCY: Wouldnt know.

MULDER: If anybody knows, Id say you do.

LUCY: Ive got my own set of problems now, thank you.

MULDER: Howd you scratch your face?

LUCY: Mustve done it in my sleep.

MULDER: (quietly) Are you using again, Lucy?

LUCY: Im clean. Passed my test last week. You can ask Henry.

HENRY: (from the kitchen) With flying colors.

MULDER: Have you ever experienced temporary blindness before?

LUCY: Ive probably experienced just about everything once or twice. Its all been pretty temporary.

MULDER: That girls in trouble, Lucy.

LUCY: And theres not a damn thing I can do about it. You understand? I cant help you.

(LUCY gets up, takes her bowl to the sink, and pours the remainder of the soup down the drain. MULDER follows her.)

MULDER: I think you can, Lucy.

LUCY: How?

MULDER: Well, thats something you have to tell me.

LUCY: What can I possibly do?

MULDER: Lead us to her.

LUCY: I dont know where she is. I dont care. Im not interested.

MULDER: Well, thats too bad, Lucy, because right now I think youre her best hope.

LUCY: If Im her best hope then that little girls in a hell of a lot more trouble than you think.

(LUCY leaves. MULDER sighs and leans back against the sink.)



SCENE 10

(Basement, AMY cowering in a corner. Red point of light focuses on her, then a flash. She runs to another part of the basement. Red light finds her again and flashes continue. She cries as picture after picture blinds her.)

AMY: (sobbing) Who are you? What do you want? Why are you doing this? Please I want to go home. (cries)

(Flashes continue.)



SCENE 11

(Police office. MULDER is watching video of pitiful young girl writhing and crying and screaming on the floor. Woman in video is trying to get the girl to come to her. " You dont want to talk to me, Lucy? You dont want to come sit by me?" SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Mulder, Ive got a ----

MULDER: Scully, take a look at this.

(SCULLY looks at the video.)

SCULLY: Is that Lucy?

MULDER: Yeah. Taken in 1978, the week she was found. Shed been held in the dark so long her eyes were hypersensitive to the light. Whoever held her captive wasnt very big on conversation, either. Shes 13 years old and can barely string two words together. Its amazing shes gotten anywhere in life.

SCULLY: Well, by most yardsticks, she hasnt, Mulder. (MULDER mutes the TV) Look, I think weve got a break in the case. A big one.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone in Amys class except Amy. One of Eubankss men discovered it.

MULDER: Whos the photographer?

SCULLY: Its an outfit called Larken Scholastic. Now, the photographer checked out but his assistant was fired the day after the shoot  a man named Carl Wade.

MULDER: What have you got on him?

SCULLY: DMVs, and old address, but he spent the good part of the past 15 years institutionalized for a bipolar condition. The only thing current we have on him is this photo taken by his employer trying out a new camera.

MULDER: Have you shown this picture to Amys little sister?

SCULLY: Theyre doing it right now.

MULDER: Im going to take it and show it to Lucy.



SCENE 12

(WADEs house. WADE enters, checks the trapdoor to the basement, then goes out, gets in his car and leaves. In the basement, AMY fearfully listens to the car leave, then goes to a boarded up window and begins struggling to pull the boards free.)



SCENE 13

(Restaurant. LUCY is washing dishes at a sink. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Lucy?

(LUCY quickly moves away from him.)

MULDER: Lucy, wait.

LUCY: No. Im done with you.

MULDER: I just want to ask you a question. Lucy, wait a second. (reaches for her)

LUCY: Dont touch me. I dont like to be touched.

MULDER: Im sorry.

LUCY: I was doing okay until this, you know? (short laugh) Figures.

MULDER: I just want to show you a photograph, okay?

(LUCY looks at the picture of WADE. It upsets her.)

MULDER: You recognize him dont you?

(LUCY runs out of the restaurant as if she were being chased. MULDER follows.)

MULDER: Lucy.

(CUT TO: Back at WADEs house, AMY almost finished tearing boards off the window. WADE drives up and enters the house with a bag from a photography store, Biltons Photo. Downstairs, AMY pulls herself through the window and begins running through the woods. WADE hears a noise, checks the trap door, and runs after her.)

(CUT TO: LUCY running down the street.)

(CUT TO: AMY running through the woods followed by WADE.)

(CUT TO: LUCY running down the street.)

(CUT TO: AMY running through the woods followed by WADE.)

(CUT TO: Lucy running, terrified. Then falling and holding her arm.)

(CUT TO: AMY running through the woods. She falls and holds her arm, sobbing in pain as WADE catches up with her. Breathing heavily he stares angrily at her.)

(CUT TO: LUCY, sobbing in pain. MULDER comes running up to her and holds her.)

MULDER: Lucy?

LUCY: (sobbing) Whats happening to me?

(MULDER holds her.)



SCENE 14

(Halfway house, later. MULDER and LUCY in LUCYs room looking at the picture.)

MULDER: Hes probably changed a lot over the last 17 years. Did you even know his name? Carl Wade. He worked as a photographers assistant. School pictures mostly. Thats where he saw Amy Jacobs.

LUCY: So what do you want from me?

MULDER: I want you to tell me what youre going through. It might feel good to tell somebody.

LUCY: I feel like its happening all over again.

MULDER: You can actually feel what shes going through, cant you?

LUCY: I dont want to go through this again.

MULDER: Lucy, she needs your help.

LUCY: Theres nothing I can do.

MULDER: Lucy.

(Car drives up. AGENT EUBANKS and SCULLY and another agent get out and approach the house. MULDER sees them out the window.)

MULDER: (to LUCY) Wait here a second, okay?

(MULDER meets SCULLY and AGENT EUBANKS downstairs.)

MULDER: Whats going on?

AGENT EUBANKS: Were here to arrest Lucy Householder.

MULDER: Why?

AGENT EUBANKS: I think you know why, Agent Mulder. (goes to LUCYs room)

MULDER: What the hell is happening?

SCULLY: Mulder, the blood on Lucys uniform was an exact DNA match. Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs blood.

MULDER: She didnt do it, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, its incontrovertible evidence.

AGENT EUBANKS: (coming out of LUCYs empty room) Agent Mulder. Where is she?

MULDER: She was just here.

AGENT EUBANKS: Well, shes gone now.



SCENE 15

(WADEs basement. AMY again crying in the corner, WADE pacing in front of her.)

AMY: Please. Im  Im thirsty.

WADE: (barely containing his anger) You shouldnt have run. I was taking care of you.. I thought you understood that. Why did you run away?

AMY: (crying) Please, Mister. I need some water.

WADE: You shouldnt have run!

AMY: Please. Im so thirsty.

(WADE fills a cheap 70s looking glass with flowers on it with water from the sink and hold it to AMYs mouths. She gulps it eagerly, then pulls away as she begins to choke.)

AMY: (coughing and crying) I want my mom. I dont want to die here. Please. Please, Mister! Dont let me die!

(Above the trap door slams as WADE angrily leaves the basement.)



SCENE 16

(Police station. MULDER, SCULLY, and AGENT EUBANKS watch as Wanted Posters of LUCY come off of the printer. MULDER is not happy.)

MULDER: Youre going to drive her away with this.

AGENT EUBANKS: Shes been driven away, Agent Mulder. Im trying to find her.

MULDER: A half a dozen witnesses placed her across town at the time of the kidnapping.

AGENT EUBANKS: Im well aware of the facts.

MULDER: Well, then trust me on this. Shes not working with Wade.

AGENT EUBANKS: How did she get the blood on her?

(MULDER looks to SCULLY, then back to AGENT EUBANKS.)

MULDER: She may have bled it.

AGENT EUBANKS: She bled Amy Jacobs blood?

MULDER: Yes. It may explain why there was so little of it on the carpet in Amys bedroom.

AGENT KRESGE: (holding up a phone) Agent Eubanks, line three.

AGENT EUBANKS: I dont have time for this nonsense, Agent Mulder. Weve got a young girls life at stake. (he goes to answer phone)

SCULLY: (quietly, to MUDLER) I hate to say this, Mulder, but I think you just ran out of credibility.

MULDER: (crumpling the poster and walking away) Hes wrong, Scully.

SCULLY: (following) You are protecting her beyond the point of reason.

MULDER: Im protecting her because I think shes connected to Amy Jacobs, just not the way everybody else thinks she is.

SCULLY: Did you consider for one minute that the person shes connected to is Carl Wade?

MULDER: (stops and faces her) Carl Wade? Why would she be connected with Carl Wade?

SCULLY: For the same twisted reason that abused children crave their parents love or hostages develop sympathy for their captors. I mean, maybe Lucy developed some kind of emotional dependency.

MULDER: After five years in a dark pit, Im sure she developed some kind of connection with Wade, just not the kind that youre suggesting.

SCULLY: It makes a lot more sense than the notion that shes bleeding Amy Jacobs blood.

MULDER: I dont know how to explain it, but I think that Wades abduction of Amy triggered some kind of physical response in Lucy  some kind of empathic transference.

SCULLY: Mulder, you cant ----

MULDER: Thats how I account for what Lucys going through. Thats how I account for the identical words that corresponded to Amy, and the spontaneous wounds and blood, as well.

SCULLY: Then why did she run? If shes innocent, what was she running from?

MULDER: Because shes afraid. (steps away from her and leans against a file cabinet.)

SCULLY: You dont see what youre doing, do you, Mulder? You are so close to this that you just dont see it.

MULDER: (getting irritated) What dont I see?

SCULLY: The extreme rationalization thats going on. Your personal identification with the victim, or in this case, the suspect. Youre becoming an empath yourself, Mulder. You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim like *your sister* that you cant see her as a person whos capable of committing this crime.

MULDER: (hurt and angry) You dont think Ive thought of that? I have. And not everything I do, say, think, and feel goes back to my sister. You, of all people should realize that sometimes motivations for behavior can be more complex and mysterious than tracing them back to one single childhood experience.

AGENT EUBANKS: Agent Mulder. (MULDER and SCULLY look up) Weve got a man on the way in whos spotted Wade.

(Later. TOW TRUCK DRIVER is being questioned. They show him picture of WADE.)

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Yeah, thats the guy. I offered to fix his flat. Tried to do the guy a favor and he went wacko on me. Started freaking the minute I got out of my truck.

MULDER: What about the girl? Was she with him?

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: I didnt see anyone else. Guess she could have been in the trunk.

AGENT EUBANKS: Can you give us an exact spot?

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: Yeah.

(TOW TRUCK DRIVER crosses to a map and points to a spot.)

AGENT EUBANKS: Right in the middle of nowhere.

MULDER: Which way was the car headed?

TOW TRUCK DRIVER: West.

MULDER: (looking at map) Okay, Interstate 12 county 15 north 903. look at this. Right off the 903.

AGENT EUBANKS: Easton?

MULDER: Thats where Lucy was found 17 years ago.



SCENE 17
EASTON, WASHINGTON

(Easton, small town. Bureau cars come squealing into town. WADE, in his car, sees them and drives away. MULDER and SCULLY are driving along Main Street behind the others. MULDER stops the car. SCULLY looks surprised.)

MULDER: Its a small town, Scully. Somebodys bound to know Wades face. Know where he lives.

SCULLY: But we already stick out like a sore thumb, Mulder. If we start canvassing Main Street somebodys going to pick up the phone to him.

MULDER: (pointing to photography store) But hes a photographer, right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: He should have an account here.



SCENE 18

(Later, Bureau cars pull up to WADEs house. Armed agents get out and head for the house. MULDER and SCULLY are first to arrive. The house is empty. MULDER goes into basement. Hears sobbing.)

MULDER: Amy? (he goes out of sight)

SCULLY: (from trapdoor) Mulder!

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Whats happening? Did you find her?

(MULDER comes into the light under the trapdoor holding a shaking LUCY, MULDER looks up at SCULLY.)



SCENE 19

(Later, interviewing LUCY. AGENT EUBANKS is harsh.)

AGENT EUBANKS: Where are they, Lucy? Tell us where Wade took Amy.

LUCY: (dead voice) I dont know.

AGENT EUBANKS: Anything happens to that girl and youll be tried as an accomplice. Were they here when you arrived?

LUCY: No.

AGENT EUBANKS: You havent seen them? You havent spoken with them?

LUCY: I said no.

AGENT EUBANKS: Then why are you here?

LUCY: I dont know.

AGENT EUBANKS: Just showed up for no reason in particular? Thats what you ask us to believe?

LUCY: Ive been here before. A long time ago. That was where he kept me.

AGENT EUBANKS: So why are you here now? (no answer) Take her outside and place her in custody.

MULDER: No. Ill take her. Come on, Lucy.

AGENT EUBANKS: Agent ---

SCULLY: (to AGENT EUBANKS) Its all right.

(MULDER takes LUCYs arm and leads her out and down the front steps. MULDER is about to put her in the car, but she stops.)

LUCY: He hasnt touched her. Not yet. He wants to, but he cant. Thats why he takes the pictures.

MULDER: What else, Lucy? Tell me what else?

LUCY: If he cant have her all to himself thats when hes dangerous. Thats when hell start hurting her.

MULDER: Lucy, you came here to help her.

LUCY: No.

MULDER: Why else would you come back here if not for Amy? Youre sharing her pain.

LUCY: I cant

MULDER: Youre the survivor. Youre the strong one. Now Amy needs some of your strength.

LUCY: Shes not going to make it.

MULDER: She has to make it and you have to help her.

LUCY: (shaking) Shes cold. Shes cold and, and wet. (begins coughing)

MULDER: Lucy, Lucy, sit down. Sit down. (puts her in backseat of car)

SCULLY: (coming out of the house with other agents who get in cars) Mulder. They found Wades car north of here.

MULDER: Theyre in the water.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Theres a river near here. I think thats where they are.

SCULLY: But the rivers east and they found Wades car a mile north.

MULDER: Wade lives here. He knows these woods. He could be doubling back.

SCULLY: Did she tell you that?

MULDER: No, but I think thats what shes trying to do. (begins running)

SCULLY: Mulder, wait!

(MULDER is gone. AGENT KRESGE comes out of the house.)

SCULLY: (to AGENT KRESGE) Stay with her and get word to Eubanks that Wade may be heading towards the river.

(SCULLY runs after MULDER. Immediately, LUCY begins coughing again.)

(CUT TO: WADE and AMY. He is dragging her across the river. AMY is coughing, trying to get her breath.)

AMY: Please! Stop! I cant!

(They hear sirens approaching.)

WADE: (desperate) Come on! Theyre coming!

AMY: I cant! Please!

WADE: (pauses, looks at her) Nobody. Nobodys going to spoil us.

AMY: (screams) No!

(WADE pushes her head below the surface of the water.)

(CUT TO: Back outside WADEs house in the backseat, LUCY suddenly gasps for air and begins spitting out water. AGENT KRESGE, comes to her.)

AGENT KRESGE: Can you sit up? Can you breathe? Are you able to breathe?

(No response.)

AGENT KRESGE: (into radio) This is Agent Kresge. Ive got what looks like an emergency situation. Requesting EMS, over.

(CUT TO: MULDER running through woods. SCULLY is behind him. MULDER reaches the river. WADE is holding AMY under the water. MULDER runs along the bank and aims his gun at WADE. SCULLY joins him.)

MULDER: Wade! Federal Officer! Hold it right there!

(WADE looks up in desperation at MULDER, then back to AMY trying to make her drown faster. MULDER shoots WADE. WADE falls, and AMY floats to the surface. MULDER and SCULLY run into the river and MULDER carries AMY to the shore.)

MULDER: Shes not breathing. No pulse either.

(SCULLY begins chest compressions while MULDER gives mouth-to-mouth.)

SCULLY: One two three. four.

(As MULDER breathes into AMYs mouth, CUT TO: LUCY lying in car, wet, staring blankly. Her chest suddenly rises. AGENT KRESGE is with her, also performing CPR, but LUCY is in sync with MULDER.)

SCULLY: One two three. four.

MULDER: Come on, Amy, breathe. (breathes again)

(CUT TO: LUCY again, chest rising. Her lips are blue.)

SCULLY:two three. fourfive.

(After a moment, SCULLY stops and checks vitals again. MULDER continues, doing both compressions and breathing.)

SCULLY: Theres nothing. Mulder, its no good. Im sorry.

MULDER: Damn it, Amy, come on!

SCULLY: Mulder, stop. You cant help her. Mulder. Its no use. Mulder. (puts her hands on his shoulders) Mulder, stop it. Stop it. Mulder, stop!

(MULDER violently smacks her arms away from him. They stare at each other for a moment, then MULDER softly touches AMYs scratched cheek and walks a few steps away, on the verge of tears.)

(CUT TO: Outside WADEs house. LUCY opens her eyes, relaxes and turns her head away.)

(CUT TO: River. Suddenly, SCULLY, turns to see AMY turning her head and coughing up water.)

SCULLY: Mulder. Shes breathing.

(Other AGENTS arrive.)

AGENT EUBANKS: Have you got her? Is that her?

SCULLY: Yeah, we got her. We have to get an EMS unit here right away with some heat and some oxygen.

AGENT EUBANKS: Theyre close. Weve got them up at Wades place right now. Theyre working on Lucy Householder.

(MULDER begins running back to the house.)

AMY: Im cold. I want to go home.

SCULLY: Its getting dark. We have to get her off the river.

(AMY coughs as two agents help her stand and begin leading her back to the house. Another agent gets WADEs body out of the river.)

(CUT TO: WADEs house, night. Ambulances. MULDER runs over to a stretcher.)

AGENT KRESGE: I dont know what happened. She just started coughing, then she couldnt breathe. By the time the EMS guys got here she was already gone.

(MULDER slowly walks over to the gurney with LUCYs sheet covered body. He pulls the sheet back and caresses her cheek. He kneels down beside her and cries. Camera pans up and over them.)



SCENE 20
BRIGHT ANGEL HALFWAY HOUSE

(Halfway house. Day. SCULLY walks down the hall and into LUCYs room. MULDER sits on the bed looking at old school pictures of LUCY.)

MULDER: Hows Amy?

SCULLY: Shes exhausted, but it looks like shes going to be fine. The doctors want to keep her for a day or two just to be sure.

MULDER: How serious were her injuries?

SCULLY: Wade must have left her alone. There were no injuries.

MULDER: He must have dragged her through the woods for at least a mile.

SCULLY: I know, Mulder. I cant explain it. She didnt have a cut on her and nobody wants to talk about that right now. Everyones just relieved to have her back again  to have her safe.

MULDER: Did they finish up on Lucy?

SCULLY: Yes. They, uh they brought in the State Pathologist last night so I stopped by to get the autopsy reports on my way.

MULDER: She drowned, didnt she?

SCULLY: They found five liters of water in her lungs.

MULDER: She saved Amys life.

SCULLY: Mulder(sits beside him on the bed) Whatever there was between them, you were part of that connection. Did you think about that? Lucy may have died for Amy, but without you, they never would have found her.

MULDER: I think she died for more than Amy. (rises and crosses to window)

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: I think finally, it was the only way she could escape. The only way she could forget what happened 17 years ago. Finally, the only way she could outrun Carl Wade.

(They look at each other. Camera pulls back showing SCULLY sitting quietly on the bed, MULDER standing behind her looking out the window through which the sunlight streams.)

[THE END]

                                        NISEI



SCENE 1
KNOXVILLE, TENNESSEE

(A railroad train horn blares as it pulls down it's tracks, passing a number of cars at an intersection. A group of kids ride up to the barrier on their bicycles.)

GIRL: Hurry up!

(As they watch the train go by, they gasp in awe. At the back of the train, a man waves to them. They all happily wave back.)

CHILDREN: Hi!

(The man stands in the doorway to the train as it makes its way to a train station. He then steps out, unhooks a boxcar and motions to the conductor.)

MAN: All clear!

(Getting back on the train, they pull out. After an undetermined amount of time, the boxcar, leaking smoke from the top, sits in nightfall. Also on top is a satellite dish hooked to the ceiling. The number of the boxcar is "eight-two-five-nine-four." A number of blue cars pull up to the boxcar and various Japanese men get out. A Japanese doctor named Takeo Ishimaru steps out of the boxcar and greets his fellow scientists, speaking Japanese. They all bow to one another. Ishimaru then walks to one of the cars and drives off as the four other Japanese men board the boxcar. Inside a boxcar is a glass sliding door barrier, cutting it off from the entrance. Sitting on shelves are containers and various other equipment. The four men, dressed in medical garb and wearing gas masks, begin to dissect something as they talk in Japanese to one another. One of the men goes over to an IV unit, where a green liquid, fed through a tube, goes into the being's arm. As a camera watches the entire process, the autopsy is cut short when the door to the outside of the boxcar bursts open and heavily armed men wearing gas masks run in and fire upon the doctors, shattering the glass. The other soldiers make a formation and fire into the room, shattering the rest of the glass and riddling the doctors with bullets. The doctors cry out in pain as they are gunned down in cold blood. The men make their way into the room and package up the dead being having been dissected in a bodybag. The dead alien being.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON D.C.

(Mulder puts his feet on the desk, watching a video, as Scully opens the door and looks in at him.)

MULDER: Come on in.

(He motions to her. Scully walks in and closes the door. She walks over to him.)

SCULLY: What are you watching?

MULDER: Something that just came in the mail.

(Scully nods to the screen.)

SCULLY: That's not your usual brand of entertainment.

(Mulder, picking at his nails, smiles, laughing slightly.)

What is it?

MULDER: According to the magazine ad I answered, it's an alien autopsy. Guaranteed authentic.

(Scully looks at the screen. It is the alien autopsy that was being conducted before. The view of the camera obstructs the view of the body, the doctors standing in the way.)

SCULLY: You spent money for this?

MULDER: Twenty-nine ninety-five, plus shipping.

SCULLY: Mulder, this is even hokier than the one they aired on the Fox network.

(She walks over to the screen.)

You can't even see what they're operating on!

MULDER: But it, it does look authentic.

(He walks over to the television and stands next to her, carrying a remote control.)

I mean, the setting and the procedures. I mean, it does look as if an actual autopsy is being performed, doesn't it?

SCULLY: Well, technically, I don't know why they would be wearing gas masks.

MULDER: Well, maybe it's this green substance they seem to be extracting from the subject.

(He points to it.)

Can you identify that?

SCULLY: Olive oil? Snake oil? I suppose you think it's alien blood.

MULDER: It's widely held that aliens don't have blood, Scully.

SCULLY: I guess that begs the question, if this is an alien autopsy...

MULDER: Where's the alien.

(Scully nods.)

But what, what's so intriguing to me is the striking lack of detail here.

SCULLY: Well, What do you want for twenty-nine ninety-five?

MULDER: No, that, that autopsy you saw on TV was so fake precisely because it tried to show too much.

SCULLY: And this is real because it doesn't?

MULDER: Yes, and because, uh...

(He presses fast-forward and the footage speeds up.)

Because of this.

(The autopsy continues at a quickened pace until Mulder presses play. The camera shows the back door bursting open and the men running, commencing firing. The footage turns to static. Scully seems a bit taken aback by that.)

SCULLY: Who's selling these tapes?

MULDER: Some guy in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Claims he pulled it off the satellite dish at two in the morning.

(He walks to his desk. Scully is puzzled.)



SCENE 3
ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder and Scully pull into a driveway of a house and get out. The street is relatively quiet, save for a dog barking. As Scully walks around to the door, Mulder walks around back and up the back steps and notices two stickers on the front steps reading "Rat Tail Productions" and "Leave Packages Here." He continues up the stairs and knocks on the ajar door, swinging it open. Scully walks back over to him.)

SCULLY: Front door's been boarded up.

MULDER: Back door's been busted open.

(Mulder undoes his holster and takes out his gun, pointing to the sticker.)

Hope nobody left the rat out.

(Making their way inside, Scully draws her gun as they walk through the kitchen. Splitting up, Scully looks inside a production lab as Mulder checks the other end of the hallway. Scully walks into the bedroom to find a man with a pillowcase tied around his head.)

SCULLY: Mulder, in here.

(Mulder and Scully approach the body. The man is laying on his stomach, his hands tied around his back.)

He's still warm.

(They hear a door slam and Mulder looks down the stairs to see a man run by. Mulder quickly follows him and opens the back door to see a man running away.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

(The Japanese man hops the fence to the adjoining yard as Mulder gives chase, hopping the fence as well. The man, carrying a brown leather satchel, hops the next fence and runs after him. Ducking under a porch to another house, the man kicks over something as he turns, the bloodhound barking at him. As he tries to scale another fence, Mulder grabs him and pulls him down.)

Come on down.

(The Japanese man kicks the gun out of Mulder's hand with a traditional karate noise, then kicks Mulder three times in the chest, each time shouting. Mulder falls back into the doghouse, and the man tries to jump the fence again. Mulder pulls his gun out of his ankle holster and shoots a glass bottle in the recycling bin next to the man, startling him. The man looks back at Mulder as he stands.)

I got tired of losing my gun.

(The man jumps down, faced with no alternative. Mulder picks up his first gun and holsters it, still having his second gun trained on his attacker.)

Okay, now face the fence.

(The man does not move.)

Face the fence!

(The man continues to glare as if not understanding.)

What's your name?

(The man speaks some Japanese.)

You speak english?

(The Japanese man utters some more Japanese.)

Great.

(Mulder motions for the bag.)

Give me the bag.

(After a second of no response, he motions again.)

Give me the bag.

(The man growls and Mulder takes the satchel.)

Okay, let's go.

(The man remains obstinate. Mulder cocks the handle.)

Let's go!

(The Japanese man utters another Japanese word and raises his hands, walking slowly past Mulder. Mulder follows closely behind him.)



SCENE 4
SUBSTATION C; ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(As police officers and clerks scuffle around and talk, phones ringing and voices all at once, Scully walks down the hallway over to Mulder, who is standing by a window looking into the interrogation room where the Japanese man sits.)

SCULLY: Either they can't locate an interpreter, or the interpreter they located didn't interpret the instructions and got lost somewhere. I don't know which.

MULDER: Did you try the F.B.I. field office?

SCULLY: Somehow, this is a tall request in Allentown this time of night.

MULDER: Well, look at this... a beacon in the night.

(Scully turns and looks at what Mulder is looking at, Skinner walking towards them.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, Scully.

SCULLY: This is a surprise, sir.

MULDER: You don't, uh, speak Japanese by any chance, do you?

SKINNER: I wish I could, it might save us all some embarrassment.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

SKINNER: I'm up here with a federal attorney trying to sort out a little international mess. He said you made an arrest tonight.

MULDER: A murder suspect, yeah.

SKINNER: Yeah, I'm afraid you're gonna have to release him.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SKINNER: According to the Japanese Diplomatic Corps, the man you arrested is a high-ranking diplomat.

(Mulder points to the window.)

MULDER: This man, sitting in here?

(Skinner walks over and looks into the window.)

SKINNER: That's Kazuo Sakurai.

MULDER: Oh, I didn't get his name. I was too busy getting my ass kicked.

SCULLY: What about the murder victim or the paperwork?

SKINNER: It's all gonna be handled by some other agency. What are you two doing out here, anyway?

(Scully sighs, throwing her hands up in the air slightly.)

MULDER: Tracking down a video piracy thing.

SKINNER: I suggest you keep your nose clean and head back to Washington, Agent Mulder... before someone takes another swipe at it.

(Skinner walks past them, brushing past Mulder. Mulder scoffs a little and looks through the window with Scully at Sakurai. Sakurai looks back. Outside, they walk out, talking.)

SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder, it just doesn't track. What would a Japanese diplomat be doing in that house with a dead man with his head stuffed in a pillowcase?

MULDER: Obviously not strengthening the international relations.

SCULLY: Well, what do you want to do now, drop it?

MULDER: No, I paid my twenty-nine ninety-five, Scully. I think I'm entitled to a few more answers, don't you think?

(Mulder opens the trunk to the car and digs through the contents.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I just remembered a piece of evidence from the crime scene that I forgot to turn in.

(He pulls out the brown leather satchel and closes the trunk. Opening it up, he pulls out a folder. Handing a paper to Scully, he looks at a picture of a ship making it's way along a coastline. Closing the folder, he looks at the picture.)

SCULLY: What are those?

MULDER: They look like satellite photos.

(He flips to the next one, of the ship at various positions going through a canal.)

What would he be doing with these?

SCULLY: What would he be doing with a list of Mutual UFO Network members in the greater Allentown area with the name Betsy Hagopian circled?

(She looks at the paper, which has the names :Steven Zinnzser, Betsy Hagopian, Edna Cooper and their addresses down. Hagopian's name is circled. Mulder looks around, then the two agents look at each other.)

MULDER: Maybe he was going to fit her for a pillowcase too. Why don't you stick around, get a motel room and check it out in the morning?

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

(He folds up the papers and stuffs them into the satchel.)

MULDER: I'm going to go back to D.C. like a good boy, like Skinner told me to do, and show these to a few friends of ours.)

(He walks around the car as Scully watches.)



SCENE 5
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Langly looks at the picture under a high-powered magnifying glass as his compatriots watch on.)

LANGLY: The name of the boat is the Talapus. Just got to love those German optics.

MULDER: So you're saying that's from a German satellite?

BYERS: No, the optics are German. The technology is probably ours, but the satellite is most likely Japanese.

FROHIKE: Launched from South America.

MULDER: Got to love that global economy, huh?

LANGLY: Where'd you get this, Mulder?

MULDER: Japanese diplomat.

(Langly, holding the picture, and Byers walk away from the table.)

FROHIKE: I'm surprised. The Japanese are very secretive about their espionage capabilities, and extremely careful with their intelligence data.

(Langly turns on a lamp and Mulder walks over.)

MULDER: What exactly are they spying on there?

BYERS: The Talapus was a salvage ship out of San Diego.

(He and Frohike walk over. Langly starts looking at the picture under a regular magnifying glass.)

They spent months looking for a Japanese sub that went down in World War II. It was rumored to be carrying a load of gold bullion.

MULDER: Did they find it?

LANGLY: Not according to all the reports, but looking at this photo here, the ship never returned to San Diego.

MULDER: Why do you say that?

(Byers shows him the picture of the ship in various locations along a canal.)

BYERS: In the rest of these satellite photos, they track the ship through the Panama canal.

(He flips to the next picture of the ship docking at a naval base.)

All the way to Newport News, Virginia.

MULDER: The naval shipyard.

(Byers nods.)

FROHIKE: But why would they go there?

(Mulder thinks about it.)

MULDER: Well, maybe what they found wasn't a Japanese sub.



SCENE
JAPANESE EMBASSY; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Kazuro Sakurai walks out of the embassy building and over to a waiting limo. The driver opens the door for him.)

DRIVER: Good evening, Mister Sakurai.

(Sakurai gets in and the driver closes the door. The doors suddenly lock and Sakurai looks across the dark cabin to see a Red-Haired Man lean over towards him. The driver gets into the car and adjusts the front rear view mirror, seeing Sakurai gagging, being choked to death by piano wire. The driver makes no attempts to help at all as the grunting from the back grows louder.)



SCENE 6
BETSY HAGOPIAN'S HOUSE; ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Scully pulls up to Betsy Hagopian's house and looks at a sheet. Getting out, she sees a MUFON sticker on the door window. She knocks on the door window and a woman opens the door.)

SCULLY: Hi, Betsy Hagopian?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: No, I'm sorry, Betsy's not here right now.

SCULLY: Is there some way that I can get in touch with her?

(Lottie looks at her strangely.)

I'm sorry, um...

(She starts digging through her pockets.)

My name is Dana Scully.

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: I know you.

(Scully looks at her strangely.)

SCULLY: No, I think you must be mistaken.

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: We saw you. Penny? Penny, come here.

(A woman walks up besides Lottie and looks at Scully, immediately recognizing her.)

SCULLY: I'm, I'm afraid I'm not who you think I am.

PENNY NORTHERN: Oh, my God. She's one.

(Lottie nods slightly.)

SCULLY: One what?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: One of us.

(Scully walks inside. Penny makes a call on the phone.)

SCULLY: There must be some kind of mistake, I, I work for the F.B.I., and I'm here conducting a murder investigation.

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: A murder?

PENNY NORTHERN: Cathy? I'm here at Betsy's. Can you call the group and get everyone over here right away?

(She hangs up and looks at Scully.)

SCULLY: A man named Steven Zinnzser was murdered about two miles from here.

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: Penny, do you hear that?

PENNY NORTHERN: Steve Zinnzser was murdered?

SCULLY: Did you know him?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: He was a member of our chapter.

SCULLY: But you understand, I'm, I'm not a member, I'm an F.B.I. agent.

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: That's what you said.

SCULLY: But at the door, you said that I was one of you.

(Lottie and Penny look at each other, then look back.)

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: Did you have an unexplained event in your life last year? Were you missing for a period of time that can't be accounted for?

(Scully stares at them in shock.)

SCULLY: Why did you ask me that?

PENNY NORTHERN: I think you better sit down, Miss Scully. I think there are some people you're going to want to meet.

(Cars start to pull up outside.)



SCENE 7
U.S. COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS; NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA

(Mulder is walking with an officer down a hallway.)

COAST GUARD OFFICER: The Talapus.

MULDER: It's a salvage ship registered in San Diego. According to the harbor master, you went out to meet the boat when customs wouldn't allow it into port.

COAST GUARD OFFICER: Oh, yeah, that's right. But it wasn't customs preventing her landing, it was the D.E.A.

MULDER: The D.E.A.? Why, what was the problem?

COAST GUARD OFFICER: They were searching for contraband if I remember correctly. The boat came through Panama. There was some concern that her crew might have picked up a shipment.

MULDER: Did they find anything?

COAST GUARD OFFICER: We were never aboard. I think there was a question of confiscating the boat if the crew were to be arrested.

MULDER: Were they?

COAST GUARD OFFICER: Apparently not. We were called off and the, uh, boat put out to sea the following morning.

(Mulder stops and looks out the window.)

MULDER: Well, that doesn't make any sense.

(The officer stops and looks at him.)

COAST GUARD OFFICER: Excuse me?

MULDER: The Talapus came nonstop from Panama. She would have had to stop to refuel, wouldn't she?

COAST GUARD OFFICER: I don't have all the details in my head.

MULDER: Would you do me a favor? Would you see if there's any paperwork on this? See if there's a heading or a destination for the Talapus.

COAST GUARD OFFICER: That might take some time.

MULDER: That's all right. I'm happy to wait.

(The officer looks away, clears his throat and walks away.)



SCENE 8
BETSY HAGOPIAN'S HOUSE; ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(The room is filled with women now. Scully is at the center. They are all seated.)

SCULLY: But I've never met any of you. I, I've never seen any of you before in my life.

(Lottie walks in, carrying a cup of coffee, and sits down next to Penny on the couch.)

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: You may not remember. You've only had one experience.

PENNY NORTHERN: Most of us here have been taken many times.

(Scully looks around at the various women staring at her.)

SCULLY: Taken? Uh, taken where?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: The bright white place.

(Scully stares at her. Suddenly, her memory flashes out to her lying unconscious in a bright white room. But the flash is brief. A woman named Diane leans forward in her chair.)

DIANE: You remember it, don't you?

(Scully closes her eyes.)

SCULLY: I don't know.

DIANE: There are men there performing tests.

(Scully opens her eyes and looks at her. A memory flash juts out, one of a drill barreling down towards her. Scully stares at her interrogator.)

SCULLY: What men?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: They don't reveal themselves. They take our memories away, but somehow, they start to seep back.

PENNY NORTHERN: Some may have come back to you, but they didn't make sense.

(Scully starts to tear up.)

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: Do you know about regression hypnosis?

SCULLY: Yes, I'm...

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: Have you ever considered it?

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I don't think I'm ready to discuss this.

(Diane stands.)

DIANE: You're afraid to remember, aren't you?

(She sits down in front of Scully.)

It's okay. We were all afraid at first.

(Scully's eyes wander around the room.)



SCENE 9
U.S. COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS; NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA

(The coast guard officer comes back with a clipboard but Mulder is nowhere to be found.)

COAST GUARD OFFICER: Agent Mulder?

(Perplexed, he walks away. Meanwhile, outside, Mulder walks along the loading docks, past foremen and forklifts.)

MAN: We're gonna need about five more pilots here, Greg...

(Mulder runs past service elevators and such and over a yellow bridge connecting the various buildings to each other over the large tankers and boats. Stopping and looking down from his view, he sees various things, including a ship marked the "Ocean Wrestler." Continuing along, he makes his way around and sees a long, white ship. After making his way over there, he jumps over the railing and onto the ship. Breaking the glass pane to the door to the cabin with his forearm, balled up in his sleeve, he turns the doorknob on the inside and walks in. Looking around, he checks the drawers to a desk and rifles through the papers. Finding nothing, he opens a door to an adjoining cabin and finds a blue raincoat marked "Talapus." Mulder makes his way to the lower cabins and tries various doors before moving through the boiler room and over to the bathroom before hearing cars approaching. Running to the nearest window, he sees various cars pull up and armed SWAT team members pull up, loaded for bear and scouring the ship. They open every door in sight and down every stairwell, searching for Mulder who is nowhere to be found. As a number of them run by, Mulder runs up a stairwell to the bridge and hides behind a lifeboat. Despite one of his attackers searching, he manages to go by unhidden and jumps into the icy water as a steamboat whistle blares.)



SCENE 10
BETSY HAGOPIAN'S HOUSE; ALLENTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Scully continues to listen to the MUFON members. Penny is now standing.)

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: I don't know, when I opened that door and saw you standing there? It was like a revelation. The image of your face was so clear to me.

SCULLY: But why is it that I don't remember you?

PENNY NORTHERN: All you remember in the beginning is the light, and then sometimes the faces of the men who perform the tests.

(She sits. Scully stares at her until her memory returns briefly and she sees some kind of tube attached to her belly button during the tests, exactly like Mulder had imagined when Scully was abducted. Her stomach is inflated, being filled with air. It grows very large as two figures, presumably aliens, watch in the background. Scully looks away from Penny and Lottie.)

SCULLY: How do you know that you're not mistaking me for somebody else?

(Lottie looks over to Diane.)

DIANE: You have the mark, don't you?

(Scully looks over at her.)

SCULLY: What mark?

DIANE: Here.

(She sits down backwards in front of Scully and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing a small scar on the back of her neck.)

On the back of your neck.

(Scully looks at it, then closes her eyes.)

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: We all have them. It's where they put the implants.

(Lottie nods to the other women, who all take out various capsules, medicine bottles and containers, each holding an implant inside. Scully looks at them, her feelings building inside her.)

SCULLY: I really have to go.

(She stands and heads for the door.)

I just came...

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: To see Betsy.

(She stands next to Penny. Scully turns around.)

SCULLY: Yes. To see Betsy Hagopian. Why are you all at her house, where is she?

(Penny looks at Lottie nervously.)



SCENE 11
DEPT. OF ONCOLOGY; ALLENTOWN MEDICAL CENTER

(Penny, Lottie and Scully look through a window to an adjoining room where Betsy Hagopian is lying on a table connecting to a machine, undergoing treatment. A female doctor stands over her.)

SCULLY: What's wrong with her?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: Betsy's in the advanced stages of an undiagnosed cancer ailment. Her body's full of tumors that won't respond to any kind of treatment.

SCULLY: And you think this is the result of her abduction experiences?

PENNY NORTHERN: They've been taking Betsy since she was in her teens. This is what's going to happen to all of us.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

LOTTIE HOLLOWAY: I don't know if you understand this or not, Dana... but we're all going to end up like Betsy.

PENNY NORTHERN: We're all dying... because of what they do to us.

(Scully watches as the doctor adjusts Betsy on the table.)



SCENE 12
U.S. COAST GUARD HEADQUARTERS; NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA

(A ship is hard at work out at sea, scouring the waters for Mulder with searchlights. Inside of a warehouse, lights appear. Mulder climbs out of the water and up a flight of stairs. He then runs, checking behind him often, over the bridge and sees the warehouse being heavily guarded, lights shining brightly from inside. Another car pulls up and more SWAT team members get out and start talking to the others. As they talk, Mulder sneaks behind them and over to the side of the warehouse. Skulking carefully, he runs up a ramp and climbs up the side of the building to a window. Rubbing off the fog, he looks in to see a number of scientists and technicians working on a giant craft of some sort under a large plastic sheet. As the technicians, draped in containment suits, work on the machine, Mulder looks away, trying to comprehend what he has just seen.)



SCENE 13
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(A disheveled Mulder walks to his door and is about to put the key in the hole when he finds the door swings open, ajar. He carefully draws his gun, peeks inside and shoves it open quietly. The room is dark and messy, in total disarray. He tries the light switch a few times, but it does not work. Slowly making his way to the doorway to the main room, his eyes search rapidly.)

SKINNER: Think they found what they were looking for?

(Mulder turns around and aims at Skinner, sitting on his chair.)

MULDER: I don't remember giving you a key.

SKINNER: I came to see you. Obviously, I was late for the party.

(He stands and slowly approaches Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, I guess I should really fire my maid, shouldn't I?

SKINNER: Put the gun down, Mulder. Somebody else might get hurt.

(Mulder sighs and lowers the gun.)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SKINNER: Kazuro Sakurai, the diplomat that you detained yesterday?

MULDER: Our murder suspect.

(Skinner closes the door.)

SKINNER: He didn't make his flight last night. This morning, his body was found floating face-down in the C and O canal.

(Mulder looks away.)

I think we can assume he wasn't diving for pearls.

(Mulder laughs.)

The Japanese government believes that he was murdered for the contents of a briefcase that he was carrying... a piece of evidence that wasn't logged in the time of his arrest.

MULDER: What do they think was in it?

SKINNER: I've got the state department breathing down my neck, Mulder. The Japanese are set to prosecute this outside of diplomatic channels, so let's cut the crap.

MULDER: Am I being accused of murder?

SKINNER: Where's the briefcase?

MULDER: Agent Scully has it.

(He walks into the main room, followed by Skinner.)

She has it in the trunk of her rental car.

SKINNER: And where is she?

MULDER: I don't know, I haven't spoken to her since I left her in Allentown.

SKINNER: Then you better find her, because whatever you stepped in on this case is being tracked into my office and I don't like the smell of it.

MULDER: Mind if I tidy up a bit in here first?

(He sits. Skinner steps towards him.)

SKINNER: This is bigger than me, you, or the F.B.I., Agent Mulder.

(Mulder looks up at him. Skinner walks to the doorway, exhales loudly and turns around.)

I hope you've got other names in your phone book because I'm taking myself off the hook on this one. You're on your own.

(They stare at each other, then Skinner walks out. Mulder leans back, looking out the window.)



SCENE 14
OFFICE OF SENATOR RICHARD MATHESON; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(A woman opens the door to Matheson's office and nods to Matheson, who is sitting at his desk, writing. Mulder walks in and the woman closes the door.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Hello, Fox.

MULDER: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

(Matheson stands, walks over to him slowly and shakes his hand.)

RICHARD MATHESON: I understand you're in a difficult position.

(Mulder looks at him strangely.)

Don't look so stunned. I'm on the intelligence committee. Secrets are the only real currency we deal in.

MULDER: Then you already know what I'm up against.

RICHARD MATHESON: Perhaps better than you do, which I assume is why you've come here.

(He steps behind his desk.)

MULDER: I need your advice on how to proceed.

RICHARD MATHESON: Return the satellite photos.

MULDER: I'd be implicating myself.

RICHARD MATHESON: A good chess player knows which pieces to sacrifice... and when.

(He sits.)

MULDER: But I can't afford to become entangled in a murder investigation. Not now.

RICHARD MATHESON: Why?

MULDER: Because of what I've seen. Because it would give them time to bury it all where I might not find it again.

RICHARD MATHESON: Do you trust me, Fox?

(Mulder stares at him and sighs.)

Then let me earn your trust with the truth.

(He motions for Mulder to sit.)

MULDER: I'm listening.

(Mulder sits. Matheson walks around the desk and sits down in the chair next to him. They lean in as Matheson takes out a piece of paper.)

RICHARD MATHESON: Several weeks ago in Knoxville, Tennessee, four Japanese nationals were murdered. All prominent doctors apparently engaged in a highly classified project.

MULDER: What kind of project?

(Matheson stares at him.)

The autopsy of an extraterrestrial lifeform, was that part of it?

RICHARD MATHESON: I can't tell you. Some secrets do remain secret, Fox, even to me. I was only just now given the names of the murdered scientists.

(He hands him the paper. The names are "Naofumi Sakaguchi, Shigow Takguchi, Masomaru Shimizu, and Daisuke Nishibaba.")

Their credentials, however, are a matter of public record. Past deeds which may illuminate present treacheries. Your time is limited... before you become, as you say...

(He starts around the desk.)

Entangled in this past the point of being about to fully understand or expose it.

MULDER: What am I onto here?

RICHARD MATHESON: Monsters begetting monsters.

(Mulder stares at him, then down at the paper.)



SCENE 15
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON D.C.

(Mulder sits at his desk, flipping through papers, wearing his glasses. He sighs and there is a knock on the door. He takes off his glasses and stands. He opens the door and peeks out, then opens it, allowing Scully to step in.)

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: Why is the door locked?

MULDER: I got something to show you.

(He closes the door.)

SCULLY: Do you have any idea where I've been?

MULDER: Allentown?

SCULLY: I went to go see those MUFON members to find out about that woman, Betsy Hagopian.

(Mulder sits.)

MULDER: Oh, what'd you find?

SCULLY: I found out that she's dying along with a lot of other women who claim to be dying too.

(She takes out a small glass capsule containing an implant.)

All of them who say that they have these implanted in them.

(Mulder takes the jar and looks at it.)

It's the same thing I had removed from my own neck.

MULDER: But you're fine, aren't you, Scully?

SCULLY: Am I? I don't know, Mulder. They, they, they said that they know me, that they've seen me before. It was freaky. They know things about me, about my disappearance.

MULDER: That is disturbing. But I don't think you should freak out until we find out what this thing is.

(The phone rings. Mulder picks it up.)

Mulder.

(He listens and hangs up as Scully picks up the capsule.)

I got a fax coming through.

(Scully picks up a picture of a number of Japanese doctors.)

SCULLY: What is this?

MULDER: That's a group of Japanese medical officers taken during World War II.

(Scully points to the man in the far bottom left of the picture.)

SCULLY: I've seen this man before.

MULDER: No, I don't think so. Not unless you were in Japan in the last fifty years.

SCULLY: No, I... I've seen him before.

MULDER: His name is Doctor Takeo Ishimaru, he's been dead since 1965. He was the commander of an elite section of the Japanese medical corps known as "seven thirty-one," a unit now known to have experimented on human subjects. They performed vivisections without anesthesia...

(He shows her a picture of a man whose face was cut off and whose chest had been sliced open and was sewn shut.)

Tested frostbite tolerance levels on infants...

(He flips down another picture of two nurses handling two children.)

Exposed innocent prisoners of war to diseases, the plague.

(He flips down yet another picture of a stack of bodies.)

Like their Nazi counterparts, they were never brought to justice.

SCULLY: What are you doing with this?

MULDER: Four of the doctors you see in this photo were on that videotape I showed you, performing that autopsy.

SCULLY: Yeah, but they were in full surgical dress, you couldn't tell one from the other.

MULDER: Somebody could, because those same four men were murdered yesterday, found here right on U.S. soil.

(The fax machine beeps and Mulder walks over to it. Scully follows.)

SCULLY: Murdered for what?

MULDER: That's what I'd like to know.

SCULLY: Well, murdered by whom?

MULDER: Possibly our government.

SCULLY: Our government? For what possible reason?

MULDER: For continuing their work. The work the Nazis were doing, trying to create an alien-human hybrid.

SCULLY: Mulder, that is still a fantasy.

MULDER: Scully, after all you've seen... after all you've told me you've seen. The tunnel with medical files, the, the beings moving past you, the... the implant in your neck, why do you refuse to believe?

SCULLY: Believing's the easy part, Mulder. I just need more than you, I need proof.

MULDER: You think that believing is easy?

(They stare at each other. She sighs. The fax machine beeps.)

Well, we have proof.

(He takes the sheet out.)

I identified what those five photos were tracking. A ship that pulled a UFO off the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. A UFO that's in a warehouse right now being guarded by military US personnel...

(She looks at the picture of an overhead picture of numerous boxcars.)

A UFO that was probably carrying that E.B.E. we saw in that autopsy tape.

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

MULDER: Part of our government's secret railroad. Train cars used to carry test subjects.

(He takes his coat and puts it on.)

Used to conduct that autopsy we saw being performed.

SCULLY: Where did you get this?

MULDER: From someone like you who wants proof...

(He takes the picture and puts it in his coat pocket.)

Who's also willing to believe.



SCENE 16
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Agent Pendrell, head of the Sci-Crime Lab, looks through a microscope at the implant. Scully stands next to him.)

PENDRELL: Hmmph. Amazing.

SCULLY: Do you know what it is?

PENDRELL: Looks like some kind of microprocessor.

SCULLY: So you're saying that this is manmade?

PENDRELL: What else would it be? I mean, it's definitely state of the art.

(He smirks and types in a few commands on a keyboard. The screen on the monitor switches to that of a microscopic layout of the implant.)

The microlithology's extremely complex. I've never seen anything even close to this density.

SCULLY: Any way of finding out who manufactures it?

PENDRELL: Uh, there are a few companies out in San Jose, couple in Boston. Could be any one of them.

SCULLY: What are these chips used for?

PENDRELL: Video games, brake systems... they're finding new apps everyday. I just read about one being designed to help the severely disabled operate computers using brainwaves.

SCULLY: How?

PENDRELL: Through direct electrochemical interface with the cerebral cortex. Pretty incredible, huh?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(Scully speaks quietly and stares blankly at the computer screen, deep in thought.)



SCENE 17
QUINNIMONT, WEST VIRGINIA

(A train whistle blares far off as the courtyard with the boxcars is relatively peaceful. Mulder climbs up a ladder heading to the roof and makes his way down the building where he sees a number of boxcars. Taking out a pair of binoculars, Mulder watches for signs of life when he sees a single man walking. Still looking, he sees a boxcar with the number "eight-two-five-one-seven" written on top. Mulder recognizes the boxcar and looks to his right to see a white van pull up. He ducks down as two other limousines pull up next to it. As Mulder watches through his binoculars, Japanese men run to the white van and open the back doors, talking Japanese. A being steps out in a white containment suit, being led to the boxcar by the Japanese escorts. The being's face is clearly not human, but has more alien features than anything else. Mulder looks on, stunned. He then runs under a system of large pipes, possibly above-ground water mains, and then up a flight of stairs. He then runs over to the side and sees the congregation. A Japanese escort walks over to the first limousine and talks to the man waiting, who opens the door. He gets in and the cars start to pull out as the boxcar starts off. Mulder runs and hides from view behind a column, then runs after the boxcar, to no avail. He pants and starts running the other way.)



SCENE 18
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON D.C.

(Scully watches the mail-order tape in fast-forward mode as the Doctor Ishimaru plugs in numbers on a keypad on the tape. As Scully watches curiously, the man takes off his mask. Scully pauses it when she gets a clear view of his face. She then rewinds it to get a clearer, close-up view. Her eyes widen as memory returns to her. The past. A bright light. Three doctors stand over an unconscious Scully, who starts to open her eyes. They are talking Japanese. Another doctor, with mask off, leans down to her. He is Ishimaru. She tilts her head and looks at him blankly as he ties his mask on. The phone ringing startles her back out of memory. She picks it up.)

SCULLY: Scully.

(Cut to Mulder, walking at the trainyard.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me.

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: A trainyard in Quinnimont, West Virginia. A group of Japanese men just put someone in one of those boxcars we saw in the satellite photos.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: I thought you said that it was our government's railroad.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Something serious is going down here, Scully.

(He stops at his car.)

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: The thing they put in the train? It was alive.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I got to get on that train. It's hooking up with a Canadian passenger train outside Cincinnati.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He gets in the car. Cut to Scully as she looks over to the monitor.)

...I was right about Doctor Ishimaru. He's not dead. In fact, he's on your videotape.

(Cut to Mulder. He buckles his seatbelt.)

MULDER: Well, that's where you know him from, then.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: No, that's not where I know him from at all.

(Cut to Mulder. He turns his head, wondering what she meant.)



SCENE 19
EDWARDS TERMINAL; QUEENSGATE, OHIO

(The Japanese escort walks in and heads for the bathroom, passing a man with glasses as he enters. At a vending machine, a certain Red-Haired Man watches him intently.)

ANNOUNCER: Your attention, please. All passengers on Canadian Northwest Express for Vancouver, prepare for boarding on Track Four.

(Doctor Ishimaru looks at his ticket and starts walking.)

All passengers on Canadian Northwest...

(In the bathroom, the Red-Haired Man drags the escort's lifeless body into a stall, then locks the door, straightens his tie and fixes his hair, and leaves the bathroom. He nonchalantly walks towards the track, looking back briefly at the bathroom. Mulder pulls up in front of the terminal and runs in and over to the desk.)

MULDER: Express train to Vancouver, what track is it on?

TRAIN STATION CLERK: It just left.

(Mulder groans.)

MULDER: When, when did it leave?

TRAIN STATION CLERK: You just missed it. It just pulled out of the station.

MULDER: Thanks.

(He starts off.)



SCENE 20
MULDER'S APARTMENT COMPLEX

(Scully, shuffling through her keys, walks down the hallway.)

X: Agent Scully.

(She turns around in shock to see X standing a little down the hallway. He walks towards her.)

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

X: Have you spoken to Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: No, why?

X: He's in danger.

SCULLY: How do you know?

(He walks to her.)

X: He's tracking a train. You can't let him get on it.

SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.

(She opens the door and steps inside. Before she can close the door, he slams it open.)

X: You've got to get word to him.

SCULLY: Why should I trust you? You've lied to us before.

X: You're wasting time. Do you understand?

(She stares at him.)



SCENE 21
OVERPASS

(Mulder pulls up to the overpass and runs onto it as the train slowly approaches him. His phone rings and he answers it.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, don't get on the train.

(She looks at X. Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: Because they know where you are...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...and they know what you're doing.

(She stares at X while she talks. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Who told you that?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, it's just too dangerous.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Who told you, Scully?

(Cut to Scully. X stares back at her, eyes full of power. Cut back to Mulder as he turns and looks at the train.)

It's coming, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully. She turns away from X.)

SCULLY: Let it go.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I can't.

(He turns and climbs over the railing, waiting for the train to pass under him. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, don't get on the train.

(Cut to Mulder. The phone is away from his ear, but we still hear Scully over the sound of the train speeding under Mulder.)

Mulder. Mulder!

(Mulder jumps down and lands harshly on the roof of the boxcar, dropping his phone. He reaches for it as it slides off the side of the train. Cut to Scully, who hears static.)

Mul...

(She looks at X. Cut to Mulder, who struggles to maintain his balance atop the train.)

                                            731



SCENE 1
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(A barbed wire gate with barbed wire on top is locked with a chainlock. That does not stop the massive army trucks, who drive through the gate and continue into the Hansen's Disease Research Facility. The trucks stop and troops unload.)

SOLDIER: Come on, let's go. Move, move!

(Under a small trap door in the floor, someone watches as the troops make certain strange-looking men file outside.)

Move! Let's go. Outside.

MAN #1: Move it, move it, move it.

SOLDIER: Go! Let's go.

(Babies start to cry as dozens of these poor men come out of the dark recesses of the room.)

Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go!

MAN #1: Let's go! You, move it, come on!

SOLDIER: Outside, everybody outside. Hurry, hurry! Let's go!

(As they leave, the head soldiers closes the curtain and the sounds fade to a din. A man runs out of the trap door and looks out the windows as the soldiers move the hybrids into the trucks.)

Come on, get in, get in.

MAN #1: Hurry up!

SOLDIER: Let's go, let's go.

MAN #1: You, hold it, get up, get up!

MAN #2: Get them moving. Fast, fast, fast, come on.

MAN #1: All the way in the back! It's clear!

(The driver starts the truck and they drive off. The strange man, Escalante, runs after them, trying to see what is going on.)

MAN #2: Fan out!

SOLDIER: All right, let's get everyone.

(The strange creatures form a line in front of a giant trench as Escalante watches. He has Hansen's disease, commonly known as leprosy.)

MAN #1: Turn around, face forward! Turn around and face the other way! Now!

SOLDIER: Fire!

(The soldiers, lined up, fire into the line of people. Escalante averts his eyes from the mayhem. Ceasing fire, the troops walk up to the trench, look in, and go back to their trucks.)



SCENE 2
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is talking to Mulder on the phone, her manner urgent. X watches her.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Answer me!

(Cut to Mulder, who lands harshly on the roof of the boxcar, dropping his phone. He reaches for it as it slides off the side of the train.)

MULDER: Aw, damn it.

(Looking around as the train moves, he slowly stands and, balancing himself, makes his way along the top of the train. Cut back to Scully, who hangs up and looks at X.)

SCULLY: I want to know what's on that train.

X: It doesn't matter now.

SCULLY: Our government is operating a secret railroad. They put something on that train in West Virginia, something living.

X: What more is there to know?

SCULLY: What the Japanese have to do with it. How a man named Ishimaru is involved.

X: That I don't know.

(He turns to leave. Scully pulls out her gun.)

SCULLY: Don't tell me you don't know, you smug son of a b...

(He grabs the gun from her, too fast for her to react. She looks at him in shock.)

X: There are limits to my knowledge.

SCULLY: I don't have time for your convenient ignorance.

X: What were you going to do? Shoot me? Just like the men that shot your sister?

SCULLY: You know them too?

X: You want to know what's on that train? Who killed your sister? You find out what they put in your neck.

SCULLY: The implant.

X: It holds more than I could ever tell you. Maybe everything you need to know.

(She looks away, thinking. He holds her gun handle out to her and she takes the gun back. He then walks out.)

SCENE 3
TRAIN

(Darkness has fallen. Mulder climbs down a ladder on the side of one of the cars and in through a door. As he walks in, he notices a door marked "quarantine" with a keypad with red glowing buttons. He tries the door, but it is locked. Looking at the keypad, he then looks back through the window and walks into the main hallway. He spots a conductor making his way down the hall and goes over to him.)

MULDER: Excuse me. I need your assistance. I'm a federal agent, my name is Mulder.

(He shows him the badge.)

CONDUCTOR: You need my assistance?

MULDER: I need access to that quarantine car you picked up in West Virginia.

CONDUCTOR: Sorry, can't help you.

MULDER: I'm a federal agent, sir. I need you to open that car.

CONDUCTOR: I would if I could, but I don't have access myself. We pick these cars up from time to time. Whatever they're carrying, they never let us know.

MULDER: Well, somebody's got to be able to get in that car.

CONDUCTOR: We've got a doctor on board, came on back at Queensgate. He might have something to do with that, I saw him back there, checking the door.

MULDER: What's his name?

(The conductor looks at a list of passengers.)

CONDUCTOR: Japanese fellow, Doctor... Shiro Zama. Traveling with another party, it says, but I got the impression he was alone.

MULDER: Can you take me to his compartment?

CONDUCTOR: Certainly. Right this way.

(Mulder follows the conductor to a hallway with many doors. He points to one as Mulder draws his gun.)

MULDER: Stay here. Knock on the door but stay away from it.

(They stand on either side of the door. The conductor knocks.)

CONDUCTOR: Doctor Zama?

(They wait for a second, but receive no answer.)

MULDER: Knock again.

(The conductor does so.)

CONDUCTOR: It's the conductor, Doctor Zama.

(A bell sounds in the back. No answer is given again.)

MULDER: Open it. Just unlock it and step away.

(The conductor takes out his keys and unlocks the door. Mulder looks around then pushes open the door and points his gun, searching the compartment. No one is there. As the conductor peeks in, Mulder opens Zama's briefcase and looks through a notebook with notes in Japanese.)

Why did I study French in high school?

(He closes it up.)

You got a safe place you can put this?

CONDUCTOR: Yes.

(Mulder hands him the briefcase.)

What am I supposed to tell the doctor when he asks where it is?

MULDER: If he finds you before I find him...

(He bends down and pulls out another gun strapped to his ankle.)

I want you to make him lie on the ground till I get back, okay? You understand?

(The conductor stares at him.)

Have you ever used a gun before?

CONDUCTOR: No.

(Mulder takes the clip out.)

MULDER: I just want you to point it at him.

(He demonstrates how the gun is empty.)

Don't pull the trigger. That will kind of give away the game.

(The conductor chuckles. Mulder hands him the gun.)

CONDUCTOR: What if he runs?

MULDER: Just make sure he runs my way.

(Mulder walks down the hallway.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; 8:25 PM

(Scully sits with Agent Pendrell, who has the chip hooked up to various machines. He looks through a microscope as he pumps charges through it, Scully sitting at the desk, looking at the monitor. A read-out of the electronic impulses is on the screen.)

PENDRELL: I'm feeding the chip impulses. The graph is recording its output, which, when I remove the current, changes slightly but continues. This means the neural network is storing information.

SCULLY: Biological information?

PENDRELL: That was my first guess. You've already told me the chip was placed subcutaneous under the back of the neck, right?

(She nods.)

So it makes sense that it would be recording impulses traveling to and from the central nervous system.

SCULLY: But what?

PENDRELL: But look at the graph. Those are what we call reverbatory loops. They indicate the presence of circular neuronal activity in the brain.

SCULLY: Memory formation.

(Pendrell nods.)

PENDRELL: Yeah, the chip seems to be mimicking that process, replicating the memory process in the brain.

SCULLY: Like a computer hard drive.

PENDRELL: Yeah, but no hard drive we've ever seen. This kind of neural network could be not only collecting information, but artificially replicating a person's mental processes.

SCULLY: You could know a person's every thought.

PENDRELL: Frightening.

(Scully looks away and gasps slightly, covering her mouth. She arches her eyebrows and nods. Pendrell stands and starts around the table. She follows.)

Anyway, I showed the chip to some of my techheads and they weren't as blown away as I thought they'd be.

SCULLY: They've seen this technology before?

(He walks over to a desk and turns on a lamp.)

PENDRELL: Well, they've seen neural nets before, but never one as complex as that... nor are they likely to anytime soon.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

PENDRELL: The chip's so delicate that I effectively destroyed it when I began working on it... but I found something in the silicon matrix, what I believe is the name of the manufacturer.

SCULLY: It's Japanese, isn't it?

PENDRELL: How'd you know?

SCULLY: Oh, it was just a guess.

PENDRELL: Well, I checked for you. I assumed you'd want me to... but there's no record or information on the manufacturer either here or in Japan, except this.

(HE HANDS HER A SHEET THAT READS:

"NOT APPLICABLE NOT APPLICABLE
DR. SHIRO ZAMA (304) 555-0103
R.R. 214
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA
26301")

I had Fed Ex, U.P.S., the postal service... every commercial courier go through their computer records. They turned up one shipment, sent to a Doctor Shiro Zama at a research facility out in Perkey, West Virginia.

SCULLY: Well done, Agent Pendrell. Keep up the good work.

(She pats him on the arm.)

PENDRELL: Hey, thanks. Keep it up yourself.

(She looks at him strangely, then takes her coat and leaves. He sighs.)

"Keep it up yourself." What a doof.



SCENE 5
TRAIN

(The train blares its horn as it speeds down the tracks. As Doctor Shiro Zama makes his way down a car, a certain Red-Haired Man watches him carefully. Zama goes into the next car and the Red-Haired Man slowly follows. Zama looks behind and sees the man following him. He goes into the bathroom but the Red-Haired Man runs up and holds the door open, then swings it open. He takes out two silver bars with a connecting cord as Zama cowers in the stall.)

SHIRO ZAMA: Please...

(The door closes as Mulder walks down the hallway past the room. The bathroom label changes from "vacant" to "in order.")



SCENE 6
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(Scully pulls up to the installation and gets out, holding her flashlight. She hears a bang and spins around to see a man running by.)

SCULLY: Hey!

(Hearing many footsteps, she then manages to see two men running into a building. She follows.)

Stop!

(She runs up the stairs into the building. The only sound is her footsteps as she walks through the vacant room. She feels a lamp on the desk and gasps at it still being hot. Hearing a creak, she turns around to see another man shrink down into a trap door. She slowly makes her way over to it. Pulling up the small cord, she looks into the hole and sees many men with the same skin condition as the man had before, all cowering in fear of Scully.)

ESCALANTE: Please... don't... don't hurt us. Please? Don't...

(She stares at the leper community below her.)



SCENE 7
TRAIN

(Mulder makes his way down another passenger car, looking at the various people in the seats. There is a murmuring amongst the crowd that fades as he moves to the next car. He sees the bathroom door ajar, although the "in service" sign is still on.)

MULDER: Excuse me?

(He pushes open the door to see Zama on the floor, dead. A woman screams behind Mulder.)

MOTHER: Oh, oh, God, he's dead.

MULDER: No, no, shh shh shh, he's just got a little motion sickness.

(He walks over to her and closes the door behind him. She holds her son.)

I'm going to go find a doctor. Why don't you and the young man just find another bathroom?

(He smiles and rubs the kid's head. They walk away. Mulder slides open the door slightly, looks in, then closes it.)



SCENE 8
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(The strange lepers seem to be afraid of the light.)

SCULLY: Who are you? Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm an FBI agent.

(She shows them her badge.)

ESCALANTE: We, we live here. We've lived here at the facility most of our lives.

SCULLY: What kind of facility?

ESCALANTE: The Hansen's Disease Research Facility.

SCULLY: Hansen's Dis... do you mean this is a leper colony?

ESCALANTE: No more, they... the facility's closed now.

(She looks around at the disfigured outcasts.)

SCULLY: L, look. I, I, I came here looking for a Doctor Shiro Zama.

ESCALANTE: Doctor Zama... isn't here anymore. None of the medical staff is.

SCULLY: Where did they go?

ESCALANTE: Well... they all left right before the death squads started coming.

SCULLY: What death squads?

ESCALANTE: That's, that's who we've been hiding from. We thought you'd come to kill us... like they killed all the others.

(She stares at him. Later, he leads her through the woods.)

SCULLY: How many have been killed?

ESCALANTE: Hundreds. All but us.

SCULLY: I don't understand how there could have been hundreds of people here when, when leprosy is supposed to be a treatable disease.

ESCALANTE: Well, it is. Me... and, and, and the other people back at the hiding place? We're the last. Our disfigurement forced us into the camps before there was a treatment.

SCULLY: Who were the others?

ESCALANTE: We never knew. They began arriving several years ago but they were kept apart from us.

SCULLY: And they had Hansen's disease?

ESCALANTE: No, no, they had the Hansen's deformities. Doctor Zama would... round them up in groups for treatment. And then the, the ones that returned always came back worse.

(They stop.)

With terrible burns all over their bodies. It's over there.

(He starts off again, and she follows quickly. They walk over to a trench and Scully gasps in horror at the hundreds of bodies piled on top of each other, each with the alien features.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God... oh...

ESCALANTE: There are more of these pits. They just... dump the bodies on top of each other... like they were garbage.

(A helicopter approaches.)

They're coming!

(He starts off.)

SCULLY: Wait! Hey!

(He stops as the helicopter's searchlight shines through the trees and into the clearing they are in.)

ESCALANTE: No...

(He runs off. Scully tries to shield her eyes from the blinding light shining down upon them. Escalante looks back briefly and Scully follows. The searchlight stays on them as they go through the forest. People with red flashlights approach in front of her. She gasps and turns around only to see more jump out in front of her, led by the same one as before.)

SOLDIER: Move and you're dead.

(Gunshots sound off from behind her and she turns around in horror at the fate of Escalante.)



SCENE 9
TRAIN

(Mulder makes his way through another car and into the next one. He walks over to the conductor.)

MULDER: I found Zama four cars up, strangled in the bathroom.

CONDUCTOR: No.

MULDER: Now, I want you to get up there and seal off that bathroom. I want you to get word to the engineer not to stop this train until I tell him, okay? Until I find the killer.

(The conductor nods. Mulder walks off as the conductor heads in the direction Mulder came from. Mulder comes to the same door with the keypad but finds it open. Drawing his gun, he makes his way inside the dark cabin and past the various machines and cabinets over to a dissecting table in the middle. Passing that, he sees a flashlight shining through another door at the end. Looking through, he sees the living being cowering in fear, a flashlight on him. The shape of the non-human being is reflected in Mulder's green eyes. The being walks towards the door as the Red-Haired Man comes up from behind Mulder and grabs him by the neck, then slams his fist into the door, forcing Mulder to drop the gun. Strangling Mulder with the bars and cord, he tosses him into the table like a ragdoll then pushes him down onto the ground. As the Red-Haired Man pulls up on the cords, cutting off the last of Mulder's air, the conductor aims his gun at the villain.)

CONDUCTER: Hey!

(The Red-Haired Man looks up in shock. Mulder slumps down, barely alive. The Red-Haired Man drops the bars and slowly gets to his feet, hands raised.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: I'm a law enforcement officer.

CONDUCTOR: Stay back.

RED-HAIRED MAN: Just put the gun down.

(He straightens his tie as the conductor holds the empty gun trained on him.)

I'm going to show you my identification.

(He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his badge. He walks slowly towards the conductor.)

Put the gun down.

(The conductor runs for the door, the Red-Haired Man giving chase. Before he can grab the conductor, the door is slammed and locked. The conductor peers in from the other side. The Red-Haired Man bangs on the door.)

You idiot!

(As he slams against the door, the conductor runs out of the outside room.)

MULDER: Put your hands in the air and turn around!

(The Red-Haired Man's body tenses.)

Put your hands in the air!

(The Red-Haired Man fixes his tie and faces Mulder, who is standing in the doorway, gun trained on the man. The villain puts his hands up. Mulder holds his neck. The Red-Haired Man slowly approaches him.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: You have no idea what you're dealing with here.

MULDER: Well, maybe you should've filled me in before you tried to kill me. Now, who are you?

RED-HAIRED MAN: No. Who are you?

MULDER: Answer me!

RED-HAIRED MAN: I work for the National Security Agency.

(Mulder starts to laugh a little.)

MULDER: The N.S.A.? Since when did they start issuing you guys piano wire instead of guns?

(The Red-Haired Man points to his inside coat pocket. Mulder watches him carefully as his attacker takes out his badge.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: Since we learned there's a bomb on this train.

MULDER: There's something on this train, but it's not a bomb. Throw that here.

(The Red-Haired Man tosses Mulder his badge.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: This car is wired to an explosive device. It armed automatically when I entered the car.

(Mulder tosses the badge back. The cut on his neck is quite visible.)

MULDER: Why?

RED-HAIRED MAN: Because of what's in that room. Because if the man responsible for it couldn't get it out of the country, he would rather kill it than let it live.

MULDER: So you killed him.

RED-HAIRED MAN: The only humane alternative, given the circumstances.

MULDER: Put your hands in the air.

RED-HAIRED MAN: This bomb could be wired to anything in the car. The slightest concussion could set it off. If you use that weapon, you take your chances.

(He turns around. Mulder breathes in a sort of taunting relief.)

MULDER: I'll take my chances.

(The Red-Haired Man looks at him, astonished.)



SCENE 10
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(Two soldiers lead Scully into a bunk hall, where the 1st Elder sits on a cot, facing the window.)

1ST ELDER: I'd like to speak with Miss Scully alone.

(The soldiers leave. Scully stares at the back of this man.)

SCULLY: How did you know my name?

1ST ELDER: I know most everything about you, Dana.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

(The Elder faces him.)

1ST ELDER: I think you know.

SCULLY: Who are you? What is this place?

(The Elder slowly walks over to her, his footsteps echoing.)

1ST ELDER: This was one of the most frightening places on the earth. A place where society sent its monsters to live in shame and isolation. Now, their disease is all but conquered. Science has eliminated thousands of years of misery.

SCULLY: I've seen your methods of elimination. What happened to the man who was with me in the forest? What about the people who were in this room?

1ST ELDER: They had been exposed.

SCULLY: Exposed to what?

1ST ELDER: The same thing all these victims have been exposed to him... victims of an inhuman project run by a man named... Zama.

SCULLY: You mean Ishimaru. You hid him here after the war. He stayed here, and he continued his experiments.

1ST ELDER: The ruler of the world is no longer the country with the bravest soldiers, but the greatest scientists. Unfortunately, Ishimaru began to conduct his work in secret, not sharing with those who had risked much in giving him his asylum.

SCULLY: What was he exposing these people to?

1ST ELDER: Terrible things.

SCULLY: What kinds of things?

(He looks away.)

Have I been exposed?

1ST ELDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: Who knows?

1ST ELDER: Please, I'd like to show you something that will give you your answers.

(He walks past her and holds open the door for her. They walk out.



SCENE 11
TRAIN

(The conductor and another man stand outside the door.)

CONDUCTOR: Agent Mulder?

(Mulder looks through the window at the conductor.

Do you want us to try prying this door open?

RED-HAIRED MAN: I wouldn't recommend that.

(Mulder looks at him briefly, gun still trained. He looks back at the conductor.)

MULDER: No.

(Mulder walks towards the Red-Haired Man.)

Where's the keycard?

RED-HAIRED MAN: It's in my pocket.

MULDER: Take it out. Slowly.

(The Red-Haired Man pulls out his keycard slowly.)

Put it on the table.

(The man does so. Mulder picks it up and heads for the keycard pad)

RED-HAIRED MAN: It's not going to work.

MULDER: No? How did you get in here?

(The man glares at Mulder.)

But there's a code, right? Zama gave you a code just before you killed him. What is it?

RED-HAIRED MAN: Four ones, a four-seven and a one.

MULDER: One-one-one-one-four-seven-one.

(Mulder walks over to the keypad.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: I'd assume Zama would be smarter than to give me the entrance and the exit code.

MULDER: What?

RED-HAIRED MAN: He knew he was going to die. When I used the code to enter the car, it activated the bomb. You use it again, it'll almost certainly set it off.

(Mulder slowly approaches him.)

MULDER: There's a bomb on this train, where is it?

RED-HAIRED MAN: I don't know. It could be anywhere.

MULDER: No, it couldn't be anywhere. If you activated it coming in here, it's got to be on this car.

RED-HAIRED MAN: You're probably right.

MULDER: Where do you think it is?

(The man shrugs.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: I don't know.

MULDER: You know what I think? I think you're a liar. I don't think you work for the N.S.A. and I don't think there's a bomb on this train.

(Mulder goes back to the keypad.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: You're choosing a hell of a way to find out!

MULDER: Shut up!

(Mulder slides the keycard through the sensor and pushes four ones, a four, and a seven when a chirping alarm goes off, startling both of them. Mulder tenses up before realizing it is the Red-Haired Man's cellular phone.)

That's you. Answer it.

(He does so, slowly.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: Yes? Yes. Just a moment.

(He extends the phone to Mulder.)

It's for you.

(Mulder smirks.)

MULDER: Put it down.

(The man does so. Mulder picks it up and raises it to his ear.)

Yeah.

(Cut to a white autopsy room much like the one where the video autopsy was conducted.)

1ST ELDER: Mister Mulder, I have someone here who'd like to speak with you.

(He hands the phone to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, where are you?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm in West Virginia.

MULDER: Who dialed this number?

SCULLY: Mulder, we've gotten involved in something, but it's not at all what you think.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Whatever is on that train is not alien.

(Cut to Mulder, who motions for the Red-Haired Man to move away from the door. Mulder approaches it as he does.)

MULDER: You're wrong, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, Ishimaru Zama...

(Cut to Scully.)

He was experimenting on innocent human subjects.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

He'd been doing it for years. Operating out of a leper colony.

(Mulder closes off the glass screen door.)

MULDER: Well, whatever his name was, Scully, he's dead. I don't think this has anything to do with lepers.

SCULLY: The leper colony was just a front. The tests weren't just on lepers. They were on the homeless...

(Cut to Scully.)

On, on, on the insane, they were brought here and they were subjected...

(Cut back to Mulder.)

...to diseases and radiation tests.

(Mulder looks through the window at the person inside.)

MULDER: Who told you this?

SCULLY: The man who handed me the phone.

MULDER: Well, why do you believe him?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Because of what he's shown me.

(Cut to Mulder, who looks back at the Red-Haired Man.)

MULDER: What? What's he shown you?

(Cut to Scully, who walks past plastic curtains into a room much like that on the video and in the boxcar. A dissection table sits in the middle. The Elder walks slowly behind.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm standing in a train car just like the one in your alien autopsy video... only I realize that I've been here before.

(Cut to Mulder, who keeps his gun trained on the Red-Haired Man, who is still on the other side of the glass.)

MULDER: What are you talking about, Scully?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: This is where they brought me, Mulder. This is where they put the implant in my neck, in one of these cars.

MULDER: Scully...

SCULLY: It all makes sense, Mulder. Ishimaru Zama, he was using the secret railroad...

(Cut to Mulder.)

...to conduct his tests across the country. The women in Allentown, they all remember these cars.

(Static builds on the phone Scully talks illegibly, garbled under the static.)

MULDER: Scully? Scully?

SCULLY: Can you hear me?

MULDER: Yeah. So what are you saying, that Zama is the one who abducted these women?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What I am saying, Mulder, is that there is no such thing as alien abduction.

(Cut to Mulder, who listens in disbelief.)

It is just a smoke screen, happily created by our government to cover-up the biggest lie of all.

MULDER: What about the UFO I saw them working on?

SCULLY: That wasn't a...

(Cut to Scully.)

...UFO, Mulder. It was a piece of a Russian nuclear sub that was raised. More lies.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: How can you be so sure?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Because I have what I told you I needed, Mulder... proof. Two weeks ago, the president made a public apology for secret radiation tests that had been conducted on innocent citizens up until 1974.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Only, guess what?

MULDER: Those tests never ended.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me. You have got to stay out of that train car.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Why?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Because there is a bomb on board.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Mulder, if that bomb detonates, thousands of people are going to die of hemorragic fever. That's what the test subject inside has been exposed to.

MULDER: Well, Scully, you're a little late. I'm locked inside that train car.

(He sees the Red-Haired Man walking around and aims his gun again. Cut to Scully, who starts walking.)

SCULLY: Well, then we've got to get you out of there. 'Cause that device is on a timer.

(Cut to Mulder, who opens up the glass door.)

MULDER: Where is it?

SCULLY: There should be...

(Cut back to Scully, who pulls apart some plastic curtains and looks up into a hole in the ceiling.)

...a ventilation grid on the ceiling. It's hidden up inside.

(Cut to Mulder, who looks up at the ceiling, then at the Red-Haired Man.)

MULDER: Step back.

(Mulder looks at a ventilation grid and points to it.)

Open that.

(The Red-Haired Man reaches up. Cut to Scully, who waits, anticipating the worst. Cut back to the Red-Haired Man, who pulls off the vent. After staring at it for a little while, the man puts down the grid.)

SCULLY: Did you find it, Mulder?

MULDER: Hold on.

(Mulder looks up into the duct and sees a bomb. The timer is on 1:42:00 and slowly counting down.)

Oh yeah, I found it.

SCULLY: How much time do you have?

MULDER: Little over an hour and a half.

(Cut back to Scully, who is standing next to the Elder now.)

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, you've got to get them to stop that train so we can get you off of it.

(Cut to Mulder.)

They want you to tell the engineer to stop at the next station.

MULDER: Why?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: So we can get a bomb squad out there.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

And evacuate the train.

MULDER: Uh, Scully, you're breaking up. I can't hear you.

SCULLY: Did you hear that?

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Mul...

(Mulder hangs up. Cut to Scully, who hangs up as well.)

1ST ELDER: Where's the next stop?

SCULLY: It's not on the map.

(She hands him the phone and starts out. He follows. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Step aside.

(He moves away and Mulder goes to the door, looking at his previous attacker the whole time.)

Conductor?

(The conductor walks up to the door.)

Where are we?

CONDUCTOR: Iowa. We passed Murray station about twenty minutes ago.

MULDER: All right, listen to me. I want you to get word to the engineer that there's a bomb on this car.

CONDUCTOR: A bomb?

MULDER: That's right. I want you to tell him not to make his next scheduled stop and to reroute, you understand?

CONDUCTOR: I think so.

MULDER: I want you to tell him to choose a place as far away from a populated area as possible and unhook this car.

(The conductor scurries off.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: What are you doing?

MULDER: Let's move into the corner over there, now.

(The Red-Haired Man starts to walk, Mulder standing close behind.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: You're going to get us both killed.

MULDER: I want you to kneel down and put your hands behind you back.

(The Red-Haired Man slowly does so.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: They'll never be able to find us in time.

MULDER: If what's on this train is important as I think it is, they will.

(It is now morning and the trains screeches to a halt. A man walks out and switches the track path. The train moves along, carrying the final car, labeled "82517." Inside, Mulder talks to the man. The Red-Haired Man fidgets. Outside, the man unhooks the car.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: You're going to die, you know that?

(Mulder lowers his gun and walks over.)

MULDER: What do you care? You were trying to kill me anyway.

(Mulder walks back away. The Red-Haired Man notices a scalpel on the floor. The train slowly pulls away, leaving the boxcar behind. The timer on the bomb now reads 01:11:06.3 and ticking down. Mulder looks at his watch.)



SCENE 12
SCULLY'S CAR

(As she is driving down the road, her cellular phone rings. She picks it up.)

SCULLY: Scully.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, let me tell you, you haven't seen America till you've seen it from a train.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, what happened?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: We're not going to make that station, Scully.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, I figured that, do you have any idea where you are?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: No, but I'm sure they'll find us. We probably lit up every spy satellite in this hemisphere. It was the only thing to do, Scully. If you're right about what's on this car, an explosion outside a populated area...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...would reduce the risks.

SCULLY: Mulder, if I'm right, they're not going to want to find you... but you don't think I'm right, do you?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: We'll have to wait and see.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: We're not waiting for anything, Mulder, we got to get you...

(Cut back to Mulder.)

...out of there as fast as we can.

MULDER: I'm fielding all offers and suggestions.

(Cut to Scully, who drives rapidly, thinking. Cut back to the boxcar. The timer now reads 00:38:16.1. Mulder stares up at it.)

They're not going to come, are they?

(The Red-Haired Man is now sitting in the corner.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: I said you were making a mistake.

(Mulder starts towards him.)

MULDER: Tell me something. You got on this train to kill Doctor Zama, then what? What were your orders then?

(The Red-Haired Man looks around.)

Who are you protecting?

(Still, no answer is given.)

Unless that bomb is as phony as you are, we've both got about half an hour to live. Is that part of the plan?

RED-HAIRED MAN: They don't make provisions for saving my life.

MULDER: Well, what about that thing locked back there? What provisions were made for saving its life?

RED-HAIRED MAN: I don't know. I wasn't expected to fail.

MULDER: You know what it is, don't you? You're going to die for that thing. Is it important enough to die for? What is it, a plague carrier? A leper?

(The Red-Haired Man rolls his eyes a little and smirks, looking away. Mulder steps closer.)

We're both going to die in here. The difference is, I'm going to die quickly.

(He points his gun. The Red-Haired Man keeps smirking.)

As an employee of the National Security Agency, you should know that a gunshot wound to the stomach is probably the most painful and the slowest way to die... but I'm not a very good shot and when I miss, I tend to miss low.

(The smirk disappears from the Red-Haired Man's face as one appears on Mulder's.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: It's a weapon.

MULDER: A weapon?

(He lowers his gun and kneels down.)

What kind of a weapon?

RED-HAIRED MAN: Ask yourself, my friend. What could be more valuable than star wars? More valuable then the atomic bomb or the most advanced biological weapons?

MULDER: A standing army immune to the effects of those weapons. That's what Doctor Zama did, didn't he? He came up with an immunity to those weapons... and he was trying to smuggle that thing back to his own country to share the science, only our government isn't in the mood to share, right? They've been doing experiments since World War II, tests on innocent civilians... but Zama succeeded where the others had failed. And that thing in there...

(He stands.)

That's no innocent civilian. It's not a leper either. It's an alien-human hybrid, isn't it?

(The Red-Haired Man looks up.)

RED-HAIRED MAN: Then again, if that were true, you'd have expected someone would have been here by now to save it, wouldn't you?

(Mulder glares at him, then looks over towards the hybrid again.)



SCENE 13
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully walks in and goes to the desk. She pulls open the drawers and shuffles through them. She finds a small black book and reads some of it. She then picks up the phone and dials a number.)

SCULLY: Yes, hello, my name is Dana Scully and I'm trying to reach Senator Matheson at home. I've already tried him at his office. Please, this is an emergency, can you reach him? Yes, I'm at, uh, 555-0199. Thanks. This area code.

(She hangs up. She then pulls out a roll of masking tape and rips off two pieces, taping an "X" to the window. Walking over to the TV, she puts in the autopsy video.)



SCENE 14
TRAIN

(Mulder's phone rings. He walks over and picks it up. The Red-Haired Man is now in a chair.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Mulder? I think I've got something here.

MULDER: What is it?

(Cut to Mulder's apartment.)

SCULLY: I think I may have a code for you.

(She rewinds and plays at the same time. Zama puts on his medical garb and goes over to a keypad.)

I'm watching Zama punch it into a keypad in one of the train cars.

MULDER: What are you watching?

SCULLY: Your alien autopsy video.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: You mean I might get my twenty-nine ninety-five's worth after all?

(Cut back to Scully, who looks at her watch.)

SCULLY: I've got six minutes left, is that what you have?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Let's hope not. What's the code?

(Cut to Scully, who watches on slow motion.)

SCULLY: One.

(Cut to Mulder, who walks over to the keypad. The Red-Haired Man watches him carefully.)

One, zero.

(Cut to Scully, who growls in frustration a little and rewinds just a bit, then presses play in slow motion again. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Wait, are you there?

(He runs the keycard through the sensor. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, yeah. One, zero, one.

(Cut to Mulder, who punches it in.)

MULDER: One, zero, one.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: And a three... then a three...

(Cut back to Mulder, who punches in the numbers.)

MULDER: Three, three.

(Cut back to Scully. Zama's hand obstructs the view of the last number. She rewinds and tries again.)

SCULLY: Uh... I can't see the last number clearly. His hand gets in the way.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Tick-tick, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: I know, I'm sorry, um... I think it's a one.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: You think it's a one? Are you sure?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.

(She nods, half-believing herself. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: One.

(He presses one. The keypad beeps and the lights turn green. He smiles then is struck from behind and collapses, dropping the phone. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(She hears sounds of a struggle.)

Mulder?!

(Cut back to the train car. The Red-Haired Man effectively stomps a nature trail into Mulder, pounding him on the ground. He then straightens his suit and opens the door. He steps outside of the train car and is blown back in, having been shot. A man steps over him as he groans and moans in pain. X walks over to Mulder and rolls him over. Most of Mulder's face is covered with blood. X stares at him, then looks up at the bomb, which is down to a minute. X goes back to the alien and looks inside. He looks back at Mulder, then at the alien, trying to decide. Outside, he carries a body. Mulder's body. He walks just far enough to escape the ensuing explosion, carrying his ally to safety.)



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.; ONE WEEK LATER

(Scully walks down the stairs and into Mulder's office. He is on the phone. His face still bears the marks of the beating he took at the hands of the late Red-Haired Man.)

MULDER: No. Okay, call me if you learn anything.

(He hangs up.)

Nothing, Scully. Not the rail operators, not the forestry department. Nobody knows what happened to that train car.

(She takes off her coat and lays it across the back of a chair.)

SCULLY: Are there any satellite photos you can get your hands on?

MULDER: Senator Matheson hasn't returned my phone calls. His, uh... his aides say he's out of the country.

SCULLY: Well, the administrator at the hospital where you were admitted said that someone had called and alerted them to your location. Now, I went through the phone records myself, and the call was placed from a phone booth in Blue Earth, Iowa.

MULDER: Did you locate the briefcase that Zama left on the train.

SCULLY: Yeah. I got it right here.

(She pulls it out and hands it to Mulder. He walks over and sits down at his desk, opening it up.)

MULDER: This doesn't look like the same briefcase.

SCULLY: It's the one they gave me, the one they said you gave to the conductor.

(Mulder flips through the notepad. The writing is different.)

MULDER: These aren't the same journals. They've all been rewritten.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: They're getting away with it, Scully.

SCULLY: They've gotten away with it, Mulder. The bodies at the leper colony have all been removed.

MULDER: I know what I saw on that train car. It wasn't a leper and it wasn't human.

SCULLY: And I know what I saw at that research facility. It was barely recognizable as human.

(Mulder slumps back in his seat.)

Don't you see, Mulder? You're doing their work for them. You're chasing aliens that aren't there, helping them to create a story to cover the shameful truth... and what they can't cover, they apologize for. Apology has become policy.

(Mulder stands.)

MULDER: I, I don't need an apology for the lies. I, I don't care about the fictions they create to cover their crimes. I want them accountable for what did happen. I want an apology for the truth.

(They stare at each other.)



SCENE 16
UNKNOWN ROOM

(An elderly Japanese man sits in a dark room, painstakingly translating the Japanese journals. A light flares from a match being lit. The Cigarette-Smoking Man raises the match to the cigarette in his mouth, lighting it. He takes a deep drag, proud of the success, then blows out the match.)

[THE END]
                                           REVELATIONS



SCENE 1
FIRST CHURCH OF REDEMPTION, WAYNESBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

(The Reverend Findley is delivering a sermon.)

REVEREND FINDLEY: God tests our faith so that we may not take it for granted. I once gave counsel to a little girl. She was very distraught because her older brother had told her that Moses hadn't really parted the Red Sea. He said that high winds and strong ocean currents had been responsible. In hearing this, the faith of this child had been severely shaken. In order to restore her credence, she had but one question for me. She asked, "Reverend, is there really such a thing as a miracle? Or are the stories in the Bible just make-believe, fairy tales." I assured her that yes, miracles really do happen. Most people today tend to vest themselves in science and cynicism. They expect proof for all that they see, but miracles are wonders by nature. They need no rationale, no justification. You must witness the miracles of the Lord without question.

(Reverend Findley raises his fists to shoulder level and clenches them. Streams of blood trickle between his fingers. The congregation reacts in wonder.)

REVEREND FINDLEY: My blood flows as a test of your faith. Open your souls to the divine possibilities. It is then, and only then, that you will truly understand the awesome powers of the almighty Lord.

(After the sermon, Reverend Findley is seated at a mirror in his dressing room. In the mirror, he sees the reflection of Gates, who was in the congregation.)

REVEREND FINDLEY: Yes?

GATES: I was impressed with your sermon, Reverend.

REVEREND FINDLEY: Thank you.

GATES: I just want to tell you that some of us do believe.

REVEREND FINDLEY: I appreciate that. It always does my heart good to know that I've touched at least one person.

GATES: Oh, I think you had quite an effect on a lot of people. Me, most of all.

(Gates places his hand on Findley's shoulder, then spins him around, grabs his throat and lifts him off the floor, holding him against the wall.)

REVEREND FINDLEY: Oh! Uh! Oh my God. No!

(Blood is seen dripping onto Reverend Findley's shoes.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Scully is examining the body of Reverend Findley.)

SCULLY: These ligature marks on his neck are consistent with rope or fabric burns - strongly suggesting that he was strangled, but there seems to be an awful lot of blood loss here.

MULDER: His parishioners said the Reverend Finley was bleeding from his hands like the wounds of the crucifixion.

SCULLY: Stigmata?

MULDER: The sign bestowed by God upon the righteous.

(Scully checks his hands, which show no signs of any bleeding.)

SCULLY: I don't see any wounds here on his hands or wrists or otherwise.

MULDER: No, I think this is a case of too much faith. (He dabs his finger into some "blood" next to the body and tastes it) And too much sugar.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: It's fake. Just like the others.

(He opens Reverend Findley's shirt to show tubes and a reservoir of red liquid.)

SCULLY: Others?

MULDER: I've been tracking a series of international religiously motivated murders. All of the victims have been so-called stigmatics and all of them have been frauds, like the Reverend here.

SCULLY: According to certain religious lore, at any given time there are twelve stigmatics in the world, representing the twelve apostles.

MULDER: It's a claim that's wholly unsubstantiated, though there have been many pretenders, eleven of whom have been murdered in the past three years.

SCULLY: Eleven? Any clue as to the motivation?

MULDER: Either we're dealing with a psychotic religious fanatic who's hell-bent on exposing these kind of frauds, or a less programmatic psycho who harbors a murderous resentment towards the church, or maybe it's just a very disgruntled altar boy.

SCULLY: Well, that narrows down the field.

MULDER: Anyway, it's safe to say this guy carries a grudge, and if I'm right about one thing, the killer is here and he's looking for victim number twelve.



SCENE 3
RIDGEWAY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, LOVELAND, OHIO

(A school bell rings, and Mrs. Tynes calls her class to order.)

MRS. TYNES: All right, let's sit down. I trust everyone has studied his or her flash cards for today's quiz.

(The kids all groan.)

MRS. TYNES: All right, let's settle down.

(One of the students, Kevin Kryder, shoots a spitball at a young girl.)

YOUNG GIRL: Geek!

(Mrs. Tynes notices the incident.)

MRS. TYNES: Kevin Kryder. I assume, Kevin, that in the last twenty-four hours, you've become quite the math wizard. Why don't you come on up to the board and share with us your gift of numbers?

(The other kids laugh.)

MRS. TYNES: Let's try some division. You do know the division sign, don't you, Kevin? Let's divide 11 into 170.

(Kevin picks up a piece of chalk and starts to write on the blackboard. As he writes, blood appears on his fingertips. He drops the chalk, which has blood on it. Confused, Kevin looks at his hands and then shows his bloody palms to Mrs. Tynes. The other kids in the class react.)

VARIOUS KIDS: Ewww! Blood!

MRS. TYNES: Oh, my God!

KID: What happened to him?

(Later, Mulder and Scully meet Carina Maywald, from the local social services office, at the school infirmary.)

MULDER: Thank you for contacting us so quickly.

CARINA MAYWALD: When I read the FBI's alert, I thought immediately of Kevin.

SCULLY: You said on the phone that there had been a previous incident.

CARINA MAYWALD: Last year. Kevin arrived at school with bleeding wounds on his hands and feet. Our first concern is always an abusive parent.

SCULLY: Was that the case?

CARINA MAYWALD: Well, it appeared so. Kevin's father was arrested, and we took the boy as a ward of the court. But the state dropped charges for lack of evidence. The mother sued and won custody. Mr. Kryder was institutionalized soon after.

MULDER: Institutionalized for what?

CARINA MAYWALD: When he was released from jail, he locked himself and Kevin in the house. Made all the papers. He was waving a gun at the police, saying he had to protect the boy, that Kevin was chosen by God.

MULDER: Let me talk to you for a minute here ...

(Mulder takes Carina Maywald aside, while Scully enters the infirmary, where a nurse is applying a gauze bandage to Kevin's bleeding palms.)

SCULLY: How's he doing?

NURSE: Fine.

SCULLY: Hi, Kevin. My name is Dana Scully. Can I talk to you a minute?

KEVIN: Am I going back to the shelter?

SCULLY: We don't know just yet. Right now, we have to find out what happened. Can you tell me how you got those cuts on your hands?

KEVIN: No.

SCULLY: No, you can't tell me, or no, you don't know?

KEVIN: You want me to say my Dad did it.

SCULLY: I don't want you to say anything that isn't true.

KEVIN: I don't feel that good.

(Scully places her hand against Kevin's forehead.)

SCULLY: He feels a bit feverish. Did you take his temperature?

NURSE: No, I didn't. Open.

(The nurse puts a thermometer in Kevin's mouth.)

SCULLY: You're a very brave boy, Kevin. You have nothing to be afraid of.

(Out in the hall, Mrs. Kryder approaches Carina Maywald.)

MRS. KRYDER: Where's Kevin? Is he all right?

CARINA MAYWALD: He's doing just fine. The nurse is just changing his bandages.

MRS. KRYDER: Oh my God! I thought this was all over.

MULDER: Mrs. Kryder? My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI.

MRS. KRYDER: The FBI? Who called the FBI?

MULDER: We're here because we have reason to believe that Kevin may be in some danger.

MRS. KRYDER: In danger from what?

MULDER: As strange as it might sound, someone may be targeting people like Kevin.

MRS. KRYDER: What do you mean, people like Kevin?

MULDER: People exhibiting wounds that might be interpreted as having religious significance.

(Back in the infirmary, the mercury in the thermometer rapidly moves past the 103 degree mark. As the nurse is handing Scully a cup of water, the end of the thermometer pops off.)

NURSE: What was that?

SCULLY: I don't know.

KEVIN: I didn't do anything. It just broke.

(In the hall, Mrs. Kryder continues to talk to Mulder and Carina Maywald.)

MRS. KRYDER: Kevin's just a normal kid. He probably just hurt himself out on the playground.

MULDER: I'm sure there's an explanation, Mrs. Kryder, but right now everybody's primary concern should be for Kevin's safety.

CARINA MAYWALD: I'd like to put him back into the shelter until we can sort this out.

MRS. KRYDER: You don't think I did this to Kevin. You think I'm the one who cut his hands?

CARINA MAYWALD: We don't know how he got the cuts, but we'd like some time to evaluate his case, Mrs. Kryder.

MRS. KRYDER: I would never hurt my own child. Do you hear me? Now, I have fought a battle over my son before that tore my family apart. And I'm not gonna to fight it again.

(Mrs. Kryder leaves.)

CARINA MAYWALD: I love my job.

(Carina enters the infirmary, just as Scully is walking out. Scully and Mulder start down the hall.)

MULDER: Let's get out of here, Scully.

SCULLY: The kid's hands were definitely cut, Mulder.

MULDER: They've taken him into custody. We've warned them about his safety. I don't know what else we can do.

SCULLY: Have you determined how his hands were cut?

MULDER: No, not yet, but my guess is that the kid did it to himself. The boy has his father taken away. He hurts himself to relieve his dad of guilt and to get him back.

SCULLY: Maybe we should talk to his father.

MULDER: He's in an institution.

SCULLY: His father said that he needed to be protected. Maybe he knows from whom.



SCENE 4
AN INSTITUTION

(Mulder and Scully are talking to Kevin's father, who speaks very calmly.)

MR. KRYDER: He's bleeding again, isn't he?

SCULLY: Yes. How did you know that?

MR. KRYDER: Because the faithful know.

MULDER: Mr. Kryder, the claims you've made for your son may have put him in danger. Do you know that?

MR. KRYDER: The child was in danger long before I ever made the claims. Since the day he was born, they've been watching him.

MULDER: They?

MR. KRYDER: The forces of darkness. They will come in the form of a powerful and respected man.

MULDER: These forces. What do they want?

MR. KRYDER: To claim all souls. You must understand, this is the great war between good and evil.

SCULLY: Armageddon?

MR. KRYDER: God will find someone to stop it. Someone who is strong enough to make the sacrifice.

MULDER: He's chosen you?

MR. KRYDER: I'm merely a messenger.

MULDER: Let's go.

MR. KRYDER: (to Scully, as she turns to leave) You must come full circle to find the truth.

MULDER: Excuse me?

SCULLY: Full circle to find the truth? I don't know what that means.

MR. KRYDER: (to Scully) You will.



SCENE 5
LINLEY HOME FOR CHILDREN

(At night, Kevin is telling a story to a group of kids.)

KEVIN: The two kids are running down this long hallway. But all the doors are locked. There's nowhere to go. Soon both will be toast. They can hear his bloody leg dragging on the floor. The mutant is on their trail, hungry for the taste of young meat.

KID: What's it look like?

(As Kevin begins to answer, a large man opens the doors in a hallway at the shelter.)

KEVIN: You really want to know? It looks like the devil. And he's bald, because all his hair has burned off in hell. And his fingers are like pitchforks - little barbs on the end. So all he has to do is point at you, and you can't get away. With each step, he gets closer. Step by step by step by step. He's so close now that even the furniture starts to shake. Step by step by step by step.

(The man approaches the room. The door opens, and the large man, who is bald and has an oddly shaped head, enters the room. The other children see him and flee. Kevin remains in his chair.)

KID: Let's get out of here!

(The menacing man approaches Kevin. Kevin extends his hands, palm up, showing him the blood-stained bandages.)



SCENE 6
THE SHELTER

(The following morning, Mulder and a police sketch artist is working with the kids.)

MULDER: What color hair did he have? Was it brown, or blonde, or ...

FIRST KID: He was bald. He didn't have no hair.

SECOND KID: 'Cause it all burned off in hell.

MULDER: How tall was he? (he stands) Was he about my height? Taller, shorter?

FIRST KID: Taller.

MULDER: About 6-2, 6-3?

FIRST KID: Yeah, maybe even bigger. And he was dressed all in black.

(Mulder nods at a shelter employee, and the staff clears the kids out of the room. Scully notices a bloody palm print on a piece of fabric in the room. Mrs. Kryder enters.)

MRS. KRYDER: What happened to Kevin? Where is he?

SCULLY: Kevin was abducted from this room. Several of the children witnessed it. We're getting a description of the man who took him.

MRS. KRYDER: But you were supposed to protect him. You said he would be safe.

MULDER: We're sorry, Mrs. Kryder. We're doing everything we can. Scully ...

(Scully and Mulder move aside.)

SCULLY: Did you get a composite?

MULDER: Yeah, looks like Kevin was abducted by Homer Simpson's evil twin.

(He shows Scully the police sketch, which matches the unusual appearance of the man.)

SCULLY: This isn't the killer, Mulder.

MULDER: I think that's a safe assumption.

SCULLY: No, I mean it doesn't match the MO. None of the previous victims were ever abducted.

MULDER: None of the previous victims were ten year old boys.

(Mrs. Kryder approaches them.)

MRS. KRYDER: Is this the man that took Kevin?

MULDER: Yeah. We're not sure how accurate that is.

MRS. KRYDER: It's Owen.

SCULLY: You know this man?

MRS. KRYDER: Yeah, it's Owen Jarvis. When my husband left, we hired him to do yard work.



SCENE 7
THE ATTIC AT OWEN JARVIS' RESIDENCE

(Owen Jarvis is showing Kevin a small carving of a bird, along with other carvings of animals.)

OWEN JARVIS: I carved all the animals myself. It's the ark. Do you like it?

KEVIN: So when are you gonna take me home, Owen?

OWEN JARVIS: There's no reason to be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. I've been watching you, Kevin. You're a very special boy. You know that, don't you?

KEVIN: I want to go home.

OWEN JARVIS: You can't do that. I can't let you.

KEVIN: Why not?

OWEN JARVIS: (agitated) 'Cause it's not safe! (calmly) I'm your friend Kevin. You have to trust me. Just think of me as ... your guardian angel. (they hear a car pulling up outside) Shhh!

(Jarvis looks out the window to see the car.)

OWEN JARVIS: Don't say a word! Stay here. Don't move.

(Jarvis grabs a shotgun. Jarvis goes down the stairs. As he runs from his kitchen toward the front of the house, Mulder and Scully burst in through the front door, weapons raised.)

MULDER: Federal agents! Put down your weapon! Put it down right here! Down, now! Put it down! (Jarvis complies) Where's the boy? Where's the boy?

(Jarvis doesn't answer. Scully goes around him to search through the house.)

OWEN JARVIS: (to Scully as she passes) Don't hurt him. Please?

(Scully sees the rope for the door to the attic. She lowers the ladder and starts up.)

SCULLY: Kevin?

(Kevin is not in the attic. Shortly after, Mulder and Scully question Jarvis in the attic. Mulder has handcuffed Jarvis' wrists behind him in a chair.)

MULDER: Where's the boy? What have you done with Kevin?

OWEN JARVIS: He can't go home. It's not safe there. I told him that.

(Mulder picks up and shoves a blood-stained towel in Jarvis' face.)

MULDER: Is this Kevin Kryder's blood?

OWEN JARVIS: Yes.

MULDER: Did you hurt him?

OWEN JARVIS: No. I'm not the one that wants to hurt him.

SCULLY: If it's not you, then who is it?

OWEN JARVIS: I was only asked to protect the boy.

MULDER: By who? Who asked you to protect him?

OWEN JARVIS: God.

MULDER: God! That's quite a long distance call, isn't it?

OWEN JARVIS: You don't understand, unless someone protects Kevin ...

MULDER: It's the end of the world as we know it, right?

OWEN JARVIS: He who has ears, let him hear.

MULDER: (angrily) And he that has a tongue, let him speak. Now tell me where he is!

OWEN JARVIS: (to Scully) You believe me, don't you? I mean, you must wear that as a reminder.

(Jarvis looks at the cross on Scully's necklace.)

SCULLY: Mr. Jarvis, my religious convictions are hardly the issue here.

OWEN JARVIS: But they are. How can you help Kevin, if you don't believe? Even the killer, he believes.

MULDER: And townsfolk wonder why I sleep in on Sunday.

OWEN JARVIS: Mass on Christmas, fish on Friday. You think that makes you a good Christian. Just because you don't understand the sacrifice, because you're unwilling, don't think for a moment that you set the rules for me. I don't question His word. Whatever He asks of me, I'll do.

(Jarvis stands up, his hands still bound behind him in the chair.)

MULDER: Sit down, Mr. Jarvis.

OWEN JARVIS: I just want to go to heaven.

(Jarvis, despite having to bend over because of his bonds, runs toward the window.)

MULDER: Hey!

SCULLY: Don't!

(Jarvis throws himself through the window. Mulder goes down the stairs, while Scully runs to the window and looks out. On the ground below, Jarvis struggles to his feet and breaks the handcuffs. His head cut from the broken glass, he runs away. Mulder emerges from the house but sees no sign of him.)



SCENE 8
THE KRYDER RESIDENCE

(It is dark outside, and Kevin enters through the front door.)

KEVIN: Mom! Mom! Are you home?

(Kevin moves through the house, but there is no answer. The doorbell rings, startling him. Kevin walks to a window and peers out, seeing a man outside. He moves back into the house. At the front door, there is a scraping sound, and the doorknob falls to the floor inside the house. The tip of the doorknob glows red for a second, then smolders on the carpet. The door opens and Gates appears.)

GATES: Kevin? (Gates goes up the stairs) Kevin? I know you're here, son.

(Gates opens the door to an upstairs room. He looks at a family photo, then toward a closet in the room. He opens the closet door and turns on an overhead light. He looks around, then notices a large wicker basket. Kevin is in the basket, his hands against the wicker. Gates sees a thin trail of blood on the outside of the basket. He opens the basket and Kevin looks up at him. As Gates reaches for Kevin, Jarvis appears and grabs Gates. They fall to the floor.

OWEN JARVIS: (to Kevin, who has scrambled out of the basket) Run, Kevin! Run!

(Kevin eludes Gates's attempt to grab him. Gates and Jarvis continue to struggle, and Gates clutches Jarvis around the throat. There is smoke around Jarvis's throat and he gasps. Meanwhile, Kevin runs down the stairs and toward the front door. As he nears the door, he runs into Mulder and Scully, who are just arriving.)

MULDER: Kevin, what is it?

KEVIN: (breathing heavily) Upstairs.

(Mulder heads upstairs, while Scully stays with Kevin.)

SCULLY: You'll be OK. You'll be OK.

(Mulder finds Jarvis dead on the floor upstairs. Meanwhile, Scully notices that there are blood stains on the bandages on the back side of Kevin's hands.)

KEVIN: (to Scully) Are you the one who was sent to protect me?



SCENE 9

SCULLY: Owen Lee Jarvis, adult caucasion male. 42 years of age. Cause of death is strangulation, consistent with previous victims, as suggested by burn marks around his neck. Except ... (she examines an area with a magnifying glass) There appears to be some kind of a pattern just to the right of his windpipe, possibly a hand print. Note to the lab to check further. It is now 14 hours after the time of death, but so far his body hasn't even begun to break down. (She examines his hand) Rigor mortis has yet to set in. His core body temperature remains at 98 degrees. His skin color, lividity is healthy. (she holds his hand close to her nose) There seems to be some ...

(Mulder enters through the morgue door.)

MULDER: Any revelations?

SCULLY: (slightly strained voice) Mulder, would you do me a favor? Would you smell Mr. Jarvis?

(Mulder stares at Scully for a couple of seconds.)

MULDER: You want me to smell him? (he moves around the table with a slight smile, then complies) What am I supposed to be smelling?

SCULLY: You don't detect a faint floral odor?

(Mulder stares at Scully who, flustered, backs away from the table.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this man's body is in no way decomposing normally. In catechism, we learned of instances like this - so-called "incorruptibles", whose bodies wouldn't decay and who emitted a smell of flowers.

MULDER: You're serious?

SCULLY: St. Cecilia, St. Francis ...

MULDER: (smiling) And now you're suggesting that this is St. Owen?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Scully, those stories you're referring to are mostly regarded as hagiographic fabrications, not historical truths, just like the occurrence of the stigmata.

SCULLY: Well, what do you think this is?

MULDER: This man? He was rather abnormal in life, maybe he's decomposing abnormally.

SCULLY: Well, isn't a saint or a holy person just another term for someone who's abnormal?

MULDER: Do you really believe that?

SCULLY: I ... believe in the idea that God's hand can be witnessed. I believe He can create miracles, yes.

MULDER: Even if science can't explain them?

SCULLY: Maybe that's just what faith is.

MULDER: Well, I wouldn't let faith overwhelm your judgement here. These people are simply fanatics behaving fanatically using religion as a justification. They give bona fide paranoiacs like myself a bad name. They're no more divine or holy than that ketchup we saw on the murdered preacher. And I think once you've finished your autopsy, you'll come to the same conclusion. St. Owen.

(He leaves, and Scully glances upward for a moment.)



SCENE 10
STATE FORENSIC LABORATORY, HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO

(Mulder is reviewing a report while Scully enters.)

SCULLY: Got your message. What did you turn up?

MULDER: It's what you turned up.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Those burn marks and impressions on Jarvis's neck. They pulled a pair of prints. Take a look at this. A partial index and a full oblique, burned right onto the skin.

SCULLY: Any evidence as to how the killer managed to do that?

MULDER: No, not yet. But I cross-checked the prints in the NCIC database. They belong to a businessman named Simon Gates. He's the CEO of a company based in Atlanta. He's one of the wealthiest men in the south.

SCULLY: A powerful and respected man.

MULDER: He was arrested three few years ago on a DUI - left a young boy paralyzed. He received a suspended sentence, then he left the country. Went to Israel.

SCULLY: Israel?

MULDER: Have you heard of Jerusalem Syndrome?

SCULLY: Yeah, it's when people who visit the Holy Land suffer religious delusions induced by the journey.

MULDER: Yeah, they return home convinced they're the Messiah, Moses, the Virgin Mary, even the Devil himself. Well, if that's what Simon Gates believes, he's just as delusional as Michael Kryder, only a lot more dangerous.

SCULLY: Yeah, but it still doesn't explain how he was able to burn his fingerprints into Owen Jarvis' flesh.

(Mulder's cel phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder. What? Well, how is that possible?

SCULLY: It's Kevin, isn't it?

MULDER: (on phone) Hold on. (to Scully) Yeah, a social worker took Kevin out to lunch at 1 o'clock supposedly, but witnesses claim they saw him outside the facility with his mother at the exact same time.



SCENE 11
BESIDE A ROAD IN A RURAL LOCATION

(Mrs. Kryder has the hood up on her car, with steam and smoke rising around her. The horn blares.)

MRS. KRYDER: Kevin! Lay off the horn. (she tries to touch the radiator cap) Damn!

(Another car pulls over, and a man gets out and approaches Mrs. Kryder. Kevin can't see the man's face because the hood is in the way.)

GATES: Looks like you're having a little trouble. Can I give you a hand?

MRS. KRYDER: Oh, no. It's ... it's fine. It does this all the time. I just have to wait for it to cool down.

GATES: At least, let me take the cap off for you. That should get things started.

MRS. KRYDER: No, I'm fine.

GATES: Really. It's no trouble at all.

(Gates moves around the car, and Kevin sees his face. Gates opens the cap bare-handed, and steam sprays out of the radiator, directly on his hand. Mrs. Kryder looks at him suspiciously.)

GATES: In the old days, people used to stop to help. Now they just drive on by. (Mrs. Kryder stares at him) People also used to say thank you.

MRS. KRYDER: What do you want?

GATES: I think you know.

(Kevin suddenly appears on the grass, some distance from the car.)

KEVIN: Hey, mister!

MRS. KRYDER: Kevin, run! (Gates starts after Kevin, but Mrs. Kryder grabs him) No!

(Gates shoves her down to the pavement and chases after Kevin across a field.)

(A second "Kevin" emerges from the car and goes to his fallen mother.)

KEVIN: Hey mom, get up please! Mom, come on! Mom!

MRS. KRYDER: uh ...

(Gates continues to pursue the first "Kevin", who ducks around a hedge. Gates follows but sees no sign of them. Suddenly, Mrs. Kryder's car appears and hits Gates squarely. Gates hits the hood and windshield and then falls to the ground. The car continues on, back onto the road. Mrs. Kryder is driving but is still groggy from her earlier fall.)

KEVIN: Mom! Are you ok? (the car is swerving) Come on, mom, don't fall asleep! Come on, mom, wake up! Come on!

(As they approach a curve, Kevin tries to grab the wheel to turn it, but the car goes off the road and into a ditch.)

(Some time later, the police, fire department and paramedics are on the scene, along with Mulder and Scully. An ambulance pulls off. Kevin, unhurt, is wrapped in a blanket and sitting in the back seat of their car. The door is open, and Scully is crouching on the pavement beside him.)

KEVIN: She died because of me.

SCULLY: It was an accident, Kevin. Your mother was only trying to protect you.

KEVIN: Why does he want to hurt me?

SCULLY: I don't know. But I won't let him hurt you. I promise.

KEVIN: It's because I'm different, isn't it? Why can't I just be like everybody else?

SCULLY: How are you different, Kevin? (he doesn't answer) Kevin?

KEVIN: I just am.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder and I are gonna take you back to the shelter. There'll be a doctor to take a look at you there.

KEVIN: Do I have to go back there?

SCULLY: No ... No, you don't. Why don't you duck back inside.

MULDER: Is he ready to go?

SCULLY: I want to keep him with us, Mulder, until Gates is apprehended. (Mulder stares at her) Look, I know about getting personally involved and I'm not.

MULDER: Did he ID Gates?

SCULLY: Yes.

MULDER: That'll help. A man fitting Gates' description rented a car, under the name Forau. That's one of the Devil's disciples.

(A short distance down the road, Gates crouches next to a branch and observes the scene.)



SCENE 12
THE WESTWARD INN

(Scully is running a bath for Kevin. As he slips his shirt off, Scully notices a prominent, fresh scar on the right side of his chest.)

SCULLY: I'll wait right outside.

(She exits and closes the bathroom door. Mulder is sitting on the bed reviewing the case file.)

MULDER: You never draw my bath.

SCULLY: Kevin has a cut under his ribs.

MULDER: He was in an accident.

SCULLY: No, I ... I was with the paramedics when they were looking at him. It wasn't there.

MULDER: Maybe you missed it.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, I was paying close attention.

MULDER: What do you think it is?

SCULLY: Yesterday, I saw Kevin's hands. They were bleeding from identical wounds on the top as on the bottom ... just like in the crucifixion.

MULDER: Scully ...

SCULLY: There have been other signs. I haven't said anything until now, because I haven't been sure ... and I'm still not sure.

MULDER: Sure of what exactly?

SCULLY: How Kevin was able to be in two places at once ... just like St. Ignatius was able to do in the Bible.

MULDER: That was in the Bible. It's a parable, it's a metaphor for the truth, not the truth itself. Why didn't Kevin conveniently bi-locate when Owen Jarvis abducted him from the shelter.

SCULLY: How is it that you're able to go out on a limb whenever you see a light in the sky, but you're unwilling to accept the possibility of a miracle? Even when it's right in front of you.

MULDER: I wait for a miracle every day. But what I've seen here has only tested my patience, not my faith.

SCULLY: Well, what about what I've seen?

(In the bathroom, a figure appears at the window. There is a thumping noise. Scully walks toward the bathroom door.)

SCULLY: Kevin? You OK? (she tries the door but it's locked) (to Mulder) I didn't lock it.

(Mulder breaks open the door. Kevin is gone and the window is broken. The bars on the outside of the window are bent and glowing red.)

MULDER: I'll call the police.



SCENE 13
OUTSIDE THE MOTEL WINDOW

MULDER: They put up a cordon in a ten-mile radius. No sign of them. Best I can figure is they must have had an acetylene torch in the back of the truck. I don't know how else they could have done it.

SCULLY: I wasn't out of that room for more than two minutes, Mulder. Come on, there's someone I want to talk to again.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Kevin's father.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: He knew that Kevin was in danger. He warned us about a powerful and respected man.

MULDER: The man's a nut case, Scully.

SCULLY: Maybe he is.

MULDER: But if Kevin is in immediate danger, even if his father has anything to say about Gates, it doesn't help us right now.

SCULLY: Well, it's not doing us a lot of good standing around here.



SCENE 14
THE INSTITUTION

(Mr. Kryder is looking at a portrait of Gates.)

MR. KRYDER: So this is the man who took my son.

SCULLY: You've never seen him before?

MR. KRYDER: No. Why would anyone want to hurt Kevin? What does he want?

SCULLY: You really don't know?

MR. KRYDER: I ... I'm ... I'm sorry. I'm just a little foggy right now.

MULDER: Scully?

(Mulder shows Scully the log of medications that Mr. Kryder has been receiving.)

SCULLY: Haloperidol. It's a powerful anti-psychotic. They've increased his dosage. Mr. Kryder? You said something before about coming full circle to find the truth. What does it mean? Full circle to find the truth?

MR. KRYDER: I don't know. I just can't remember.

(Mulder's cel phone rings. Scully walks out into the hallway while Mulder lags behind to take the call. He hangs up and runs to catch up with her.)

MULDER: Scully. They had a sighting of Gates. He tried to rent another car at the airport, under the name Forau again. Did you hear what I said?

(Scully is looking past him at a waste container against the wall. The container has a recycling symbol on it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look. Arrows that form a circle. Full circle to find the truth. Gates' company owns a recycling plant near here. That's where he's taken Kevin.

MULDER: Scully, the man is at the airport. If he hasn't already killed Kevin, he's trying to get as far away as he can.

SCULLY: I don't think so, Mulder.

MULDER: You think it's you, don't you? You think you're the one who's been chosen to protect Kevin.

SCULLY: I don't know. Look, if I'm wrong, I'll meet you out at the airport. OK?



SCENE 15
21ST CENTURY RECYCLING PLANT
JERUSALEM, OHIO

(Inside the plant are Gates and Kevin.)

GATES: The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon will turn to blood, because of you, son.

KEVIN: Is that why you want to hurt me?

GATES: It's not a question of wanting. You have to die, Kevin. For everyone. For the new age to come. You understand that, don't you?

(Gates sees drops of blood on the floor and checks Kevin's hands. They are bleeding through the bandages.)

GATES: The others were all false prophets. You are the only true one among the twelve.

(As Gates reaches for Kevin's throat, Scully appears, aiming her weapon at Gates.)

SCULLY: Stop! Federal agent, I'm armed! Let him go! Let him go and we'll talk about it!

(Gates pulls Kevin in front of him and they back away.)

GATES: There's nothing to talk about. I was called upon.

(He and Kevin slip behind some stacks of recycled trash. Scully pursues, but Gates pushes a stack over, blocking her way. He then carries Kevin up the stairs to the top of a shredding machine, while Scully struggles to get around the obstacles.)

KEVIN: No! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

(Gates starts the shredding machine. He lifts Kevin up as if to throw him into the machine just as Scully reaches the bottom of the stairs. Both Gates and Kevin disappear over the edge.)

SCULLY: No!

(Scully rushes up the stairs and sees blood in the blades of the shredder. Leaning forward, she sees Kevin hanging to a ledge.)

SCULLY: Kevin! Hold on! Hold on!

(She reaches down and grabs Kevin's hand and pulls him up onto the platform grating. They embrace.)

KEVIN: I knew you'd come.



SCENE 16
THE SHELTER, TWO DAYS LATER

(Kevin and Scully are in one of the shelter bedrooms. Kevin has just finished packing his belongings.)

SCULLY: You all set?

KEVIN: (smiling) Thanks.

(He reaches out to shake hands with Scully. She turns his hand over and sees no sign of a wound on his palm, then shakes it. Kevin starts to leave.)

SCULLY: Maybe I'll see you again sometime.

KEVIN: (looking back) You will.

CARINA MAYWALD: (unseen, from the hall) You all ready, Kevin?

KEVIN: Yeah.

(Kevin leaves. Scully turns away from the door and looks down as Mulder enters. She brings a hand to her eyes to wipe away a tear, as Mulder picks up her coat and helps her into it.)

MULDER: You OK?

SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.

MULDER: We have a couple of hours before our flight. I told the sheriff we'd go down and make a formal statement about Gates' death.

SCULLY: I'd appreciate it if you'd handle that alone, Mulder. I have an errand I need to run.

MULDER: OK.

SCULLY: I'll see you at the airport.



SCENE 17
A CONFESSION BOOTH

SCULLY: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been six years since my last confession, and since then I've drifted away from the church. I'm not sure why exactly.

PRIEST: Have you come to confess?

SCULLY: No, um, there's a man that I work with - a friend - and usually I'm able to discuss these things with him ... but not this. Father, do you believe in miracles?

PRIEST: Of course, I see them every day ... the rising sun, the birth of a child ...

SCULLY: No, I'm talking about events that defy explanation. Things that ... I believe helped me to save a young boy's life. But now I wonder if I saw them at all. If I didn't just imagine them.

PRIEST: Why do you doubt yourself?

SCULLY: Because my partner didn't see them. He didn't ... he didn't believe them. And usually he ... he believes without question.

PRIEST: Maybe they weren't meant for him to see. Maybe they were only meant for you.

SCULLY: Is that possible?

PRIEST: With the Lord, anything is possible. Perhaps you saw these things because you needed to.

SCULLY: To find my way back?

PRIEST: Sometimes we must come full circle to find the truth. (Scully looks up at the priest) Why does that surprise you?

SCULLY: Mostly, it just makes me afraid.

PRIEST: Afraid?

SCULLY: Afraid that God is speaking ... but that no one's listening.

[THE END]

                                        WAR OF THE COPROPHAGES


SCENE 1
MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(An exterminator, Doctor Bugger, pulls a cockroach off the wall and looks at it, the flashlight illuminating both it and his face.)

BUGGER: Behold the mighty cockroach. Believed to have originated in the Surilian period over three-hundred and fifty million years ago. They can be found in every part of the world from the tropics to the arctic. There exists four-thousand known species... and in a year, a single female can produce over half a million descendants.

(He smiles, laughing a little to himself.)

Radiation doesn't kill them. By evolutionary standards, they are nearly flawless creatures but creatures nevertheless. Possessing only a simple nervous system, their behavior is dictated solely by responses to environmental stimuli. Unlike us, they are incapable of thought, of... self-illumination.

(He reaches up and turns on the light.)

Compared to the roach, we are gods... and must therefore act accordingly.

(He drops the roach and steps on it, then looks up at Doctor Eckerle.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Is it true if you decapitate them, they continue to live, eventually dying of starvation?

BUGGER: Look, buddy, I just kill them.

(He puts the flashlight back into his case and walks over to the center of the room, carrying a large canister of insecticide.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Well, that's why I called you. I, I thought that nowadays, you froze the insects to death.

BUGGER: Freeze them? Where's the fun in that?

(He starts to spray the bottoms of the walls and corners with the pesticide.)

No, we got a new pesticide that works like a fungus. It not only kills the infected roach, but that roach then spreads the disease to every other roach he comes into contact with.

(Eckerle starts to undo the top button on his shirt nervously.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Well, just as long as you, uh, get rid of them. Bugs... I don't know. They drive me crazy.

(He walks up the stairs and out of the basement. Bugger looks up and sees a cockroach sitting on a cabinet.)

BUGGER: Why, you arrogant little...

(He sprays it, but the bug seems unaffected. Bugger knocks it off with the tip of the hose and steps on it. The cockroach chirps and Bugger winces in pain. As he lifts his foot, the cockroach crawls away. Bugger gags and chokes, holding his neck. He leans up against the wall, which also has a few cockroaches on it. Back pressed against the wall, moaning and groaning in pain, cockroaches pour out of a hole in the wall and swarm over it. He starts to let out short screams as Eckerle walks back down the stairs.)

JEFF ECKERLE: I forgot to tell you, I also found a roach on the...

(He stops short, seeing Bugger on the floor on his hands and knees, covered in cockroaches, gasping and panting. Bugger stops moving as Eckerle looks on in horror. Elsewhere, crickets chirp under a clear night sky. Mulder sits in his car, looking up at the stars. A white cockroach jumps on his windshield and Mulder turns on the wiper, brushing it off. The phone rings and he takes it out.)

SCENE 2

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day.

MULDER: Oh, my apartment complex was being fumigated so I thought I'd get away for the weekend. I came up to Massachusetts.

(Cut to Scully, who is cleaning her gun with a washcloth at the kitchen table.)

SCULLY: Visiting your mother?

MULDER: No, just, uh... sitting and thinking.

(Cut back to Scully.)

Widespread accounts of unidentified colored lights hovering in the skies were reported last night.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Look, Scully, I know it's not your inclination but... did you ever look up into the night sky and feel certain that... not only was something up there but... it was looking down on you at that exact same moment and was just as curious about you as you are about it?

(Cut to Scully, who unscrews a screwdriver and looks at it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I think the only thing more fortuitous than the emergence of life on this planet is that, through purely random laws of biological evolution, an intelligence as complex as ours ever emanated from it.

(She screws the screwdriver together.)

Uh, the, the very idea...

(Cut to Mulder.)

...of intelligent alien life is not only...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...astronomically improbable but at it's most basic level, downright anti-Darwinian.

MULDER: Scully... what are you wearing?

(She laughs. Cut back to Mulder.)

I understand what you're saying, but I, I, I just need to keep looking.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, well, don't look too hard. You might not like what you find.

(She sprays some polish on a fork. Cut to Mulder, who turns on the wipers, brushing off another bug that landed on his windshield.)

MULDER: Isn't that what, uh, Doctor Zaius said to Charlton Heston at the end of "Planet of the Apes?"

(Cut to Scully. She is polishing the fork.)

SCULLY: And look what happened.

(Cut to Mulder, who smiles. Headlights shine brightly in his face. Cut to Scully.)

MULDER: Scully, I got to go.

SCULLY: Wait... Mulder, what's going on?

(She hears a click, then a dialtone.)

Mulder?

(She hangs up the phone. Cut back to Mulder. Sheriff Frass approaches his car and looks inside.)

FRASS: How you doing?

(Mulder nods.)

What are you doing?

MULDER: Just sitting, thinking.

FRASS: Sitting and thinking?

(Mulder nods.)

And talking on the phone? Who with, your drug dealer?

(Mulder laughs.)

Let me see some I.D.

(Mulder reaches into his pocket and hands him his badge.)

The bureau? You on a case?

MULDER: I heard reports of several UFO sightings in this area last night. You see anything?

FRASS: No, sir, not personally. But we did receive a lot of telephone calls.

MULDER: Any more calls tonight?

FRASS: No, sir. The F.B.I. keeps tabs on these things?

MULDER: No.

(Frass stands, but looks back in.)

FRASS: Excuse me, sir, I don't like to pry, but why are you sitting here with your wiper blades on?

MULDER: Oh, I was just knocking off some bugs that landed on my...

(Frass grabs his gun in panic. Mulder looks at him strangely.)

Landed on my windshield.

FRASS: Cockroaches?

MULDER: Maybe, maybe beetles. I dunno, I'm not really good with bugs.

WOMAN ON APB WIRE: ...send dispatch unit, over.

(Frass looks over to his car, then motions for Mulder to wait a second and goes to his car. As the woman continues to talk, Frass gets in his car and pulls up to Mulder's window, handing back his badge.)

FRASS: Sorry to disturb you, sir.

MULDER: What's the matter?

FRASS: Another roach attack.

(He drives off. Cut to Scully, who is sitting in front of her television set, eating a salad. The phone rings and she picks up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(Cut to Mulder in Doctor Eckerle's basement, kneeling over Bugger's body.)

MULDER: I think you better get up here.

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: It appears that cockroaches are mortally attacking people.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm not going to ask you if you just said what I think you just said because I know it's what you just said.

(Cut to Mulder. Doctor Newton is next to Mulder, wearing rubber gloves.)

MULDER: I'm crouching over a bug exterminator whose recently deceased body was discovered with cockroaches crawling all over him. The local sheriff says that two other bodies were found in the same condition this afternoon.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Where are you again?

MULDER: Miller's Grove.

(Cut back to Mulder. Doctor Eckerle and Frass are also on the scene.)

It has a large science constituency. The other incidents involved a molecular biologist and an astrophysicist and the witness to this case is an alternative fuel researcher. These reports are not coming from yahoos out in the boondock.

JEFF ECKERLE: The image of those cockroaches has been permanently imprinted onto my brain.

(He takes off his glasses and rubs his forehead.)

I see them every time I close my eyes.

FRASS: Try not to close your eyes.

(Eckerle looks at him.)

JEFF ECKERLE: How am I going to sleep? And where?

(He puts his glasses on.)

I'm certainly not spending the night here.

FRASS: Maybe you could get a motel room or something.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Were there insect bites on the body?

(Cut to Mulder, who looks at Newton.)

MULDER: Insect bites?

NEWTON: No.

MULDER: No.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: 'Cause you know, Mulder, millions of people are actually allergic to cockroaches. There have been reported cases of fatal reactions. It's called, uh, anaphylactic shock.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Anaphylactic shock?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Many such reactions have occurred to entomologists or, uh, exterminators.

MULDER: Okay, we'll check that out.

SCULLY: You still want me to come up?

(Cut to Mulder, who stands.)

MULDER: No, no, no, I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Scully.

(He hangs up.)

FRASS: Who was that?

MULDER: My drug dealer.



SCENE 3

(A basement. A "stoner" chops up some kind of brown dust with a razor blade. An old laboratory set is hooked up, a beaker full of it boiling. The stoner breathes in the smoke coming off and holds it in.)

STONER: Dude, that's some good crap.

(He exhales the smoke.)

Come on, it's your hoot.

(A "chick" walks by the "stoner" and a "dude," who's also standing at the table.)

CHICK: Um, I don't know about this, you guys.

DUDE: You really ought to, you know. Try it. This stuff takes your mind and just, sort of, you know... expands it.

(The "stoner" has a completely blank expression on his face.)

CHICK: Yeah, well... something tells me it's more than my mind you guys are interested in expanding.

(The "dude" looks at the "stoner.")

STONER: Well, how about another beer then?

CHICK: Okay.

(She nods anxiously. He pulls off the top of a metal cooler and takes a beer out.)

DUDE: I don't know. I think you're making a mistake here. Beer is just, you know... beer.

(A cockroach crawls out of the pile of minced dung on the table and chirps. The "dude" holds up his hands and demonstrates how mind-blowing this is.)

But this stuff, it like... swings the doors of perception so wide open, you can see whole 'nother world out there. But it's still like this world, you know? It tweaks your mind and does this whole altered state thing to it.

(The "stoner" gives a dull smile, nodding.)

And suddenly, you see reality as it, you know... really exists.

(He scratches his hand and looks down at his arm. A cockroach chirps and makes its way into his body through a fresh wound. The "dude" stands.)

Oh, God...

STONER: Dude, what's wrong, man?

(He starts to laugh. The "dude" tries to grab it but it slithers under his skin, crawling just beneath it. It stretches its skin out as it crawls up its arm. Another burrows into his other wrist.)

DUDE: Oh, God! Roaches!

(It too crawls up his skin.)

STONER: Dude, you're freaking, man!

(The two other teenagers stand, looking at him with concern.)

DUDE: Roaches! Cockroaches!

STONER: What's wrong, man?

(The "dude" takes the razor blade and tears open his arm as the other two grab him.)

CHICK: Stop it!

DUDE: Get them out of me! Get them out!

STONER: Dude, stop!

DUDE: Get them out!



SCENE 4

(They try to wrestle him down. Cut to Scully, who pours the contents of a bottle called "Die! Flea! Die!" onto Queemqueg and starts to run it through her fur. The phone rings and Scully towel-dries her hands.)

SCULLY: Stay.

(Queemqueg whimpers. Scully picks up the phone.)

Hello?

MULDER: I take it back, Scully, I think you better get up here.

SCULLY: Another roach attack?

(Cut to Mulder, kneeling in the druggies' basement over the "dude". Newton is also kneeling, and Frass and the two kids are also there with him.)

MULDER: Yeah, and this was no allergic reaction. Two witnesses claim they saw the victim screaming about cockroaches burrowing into him.

(Cut to Scully, who continues to dry her hands.)

SCULLY: Are there still insects in the body?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: We haven't located any yet, but there are wounds all over the body.

(He stands.)

SCULLY: From the cockroaches?

MULDER: Well... the victim did attempt to extract the insects using a razor blade, but we're not sure all of the incisions are self-inflicted, except for the severed artery.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Well, was there any evidence of drug use at the crime scene?

(Cut back to Mulder. Him and Newton walk over to the lab.)

MULDER: Uh, well, he did have a homemade lab set up, but I'm not sure what he was producing.

(He smells it and winces, pulling away quickly. Newton smells it slightly.)

Aw, man, smells like a septic tank! Would you make sure this gets analyzed, here?

(He points to the stuff to a man walking by.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, there's a psychotic disorder associated with some forms...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...of drug abuse where the abuser suffers from delusions that insects are infesting their epidermis.

(Cut to Mulder.)

It's called Ekbom's Syndrome.

MULDER: Ekbom's Syndrome?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: The victim cuts himself in, in an attempt to extract the imaginary insect.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Still want me to come up?

MULDER: No, uh, you're probably right. I'm sorry to bother you.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: It's no bother. Bye.

(She hangs up and turns around to see that Queemqueg has run off. She looks for the dog and hears a yelping.)

Hey!

(She runs after the dog. Cut to Mulder. Frass stares at the chandelier.)



SCENE 5

FRASS: These kids are braindead. I couldn't get anything out of them.

MULDER: How about some urine? For a drug test.

(Mulder looks over at a table in the back and walks past Frass. He bends over and sees a cockroach on the underside of the table. It chirps and Mulder grabs it.)

FRASS: Did you get it?

MULDER: Get me a container.

(Frass hands him a glass jar.)

Oh, I think I killed it.

(He dumps the contents of his hand out into jar. It is nothing more than metallic ashes.)

FRASS: You killed it? You annihilated it.

MULDER: It must have molted. It's just empty exoskeleton.

FRASS: Well, at least we've got evidence that cockroaches were actually here.

MULDER: We've got more than that, sheriff. I think that bug's exoskeleton was made of metal.

(He looks at his bloodied hand.)



SCENE 6
EXAMINATION ROOM

(Newton is tending to Mulder's hand.)

NEWTON: Nothing more than a skin abrasion.

MULDER: An abrasion caused by a metallic substance?

NEWTON: Why don't we wait until the, uh, analysis of the compound is finished before jumping to any conclusions? Uh, Agent Mulder, as a, as a doctor, I always find it best to be... completely honest and open with my patients, no matter how unpleasant the information.

MULDER: What do you need to tell me?

(Newton sighs.)

NEWTON: No, I need you to tell me something. What the hell is going on here? Wh... are we in any danger?

MULDER: I don't know.

NEWTON: Well, should I evacuate my family?

MULDER: I wouldn't know.

(Frass walks in.)

FRASS: Doc, they're waiting for you to examine the boy's body.

NEWTON: Yeah, uh, as soon I take a little break. Uh, after talking with Agent Mulder here, I suddenly feel slightly constipated.

(He glares at Mulder and walks out.)

FRASS: What's his problem?

MULDER: He's upset that I don't know what's going on here.

FRASS: So what the hell is going on here?

(In the bathroom, the shower head leaks slightly. A cockroach comes out of the drain and chirps, then makes its way towards Newton, who sits in a stall with his pants down. Newton is reading "Scientific American." He picks up a small mail-order card that fell out, uncovering another cockroach. He does not notice it, however, being so entranced with the magazine. It crawls to his foot. Behind him, on the toilet, cockroaches scurry everywhere. Newton plays with the roll of toilet paper, turning it. A cockroach comes up on it, then heads off towards him. In the examination room, Mulder seems annoyed at explaining his position.)

MULDER: I see the correlation, but just because I work for the federal government doesn't mean I'm an expert on cockroaches.

FRASS: So you're saying you don't know anything about the government's experiments being conducted here?

MULDER: Experiments?

FRASS: A couple of months ago, an agent claiming to be from the department of agriculture sets up base on a couple of acres across town. Nobody knows exactly what's going on out there. It's top secret, very hush-hush.

MULDER: What are you suggesting?

(A nurse walks in.)

FRASS: Killer bees were a genetic experiment gone awry, let loose on an unsuspecting populace. Who's to say the government hasn't created a new breed of killer cockroaches?

MULDER: You might want to keep that theory to yourself, sheriff. No need to create a panic.

MAN: Oh! Oh, my God! Somebody help, help, hey!

(Mulder and Frass run into the bathroom to see a man kneeling, checking Newton's pulse.)

FRASS: What the hell happened?

MAN: Cockroaches. He was covered in cockroaches.

MULDER: I don't see any roaches.

MAN: Well, when I went out to look for help and I came back, they disappeared.

(Mulder spots a cockroach sitting on a sink. He motions to it as a crowd gathers near the door, murmuring. Mulder and Frass look at it, Mulder raising his hand slowly.)

FRASS: Gently... gently...

(He grabs it.)

MULDER: Hmm. He doesn't appear odd in any...

(The cockroach speeds out of Mulder's grasp and down the faucet. Mulder and Frass watch it. Mulder reaches for it when it stops to chirp, but it keeps going.)

FRASS: Next time, let me handle the roaches.



SCENE 7
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully sits on her couch, reading "Breakfast at Tiffany's." The phone rings and she answers it.)

SCULLY: Who died now?

(Cut to Mulder, who stands over the body as two men cover Newton with a white sheet.)

MULDER: The medical examiner. His body was found next to a toilet, covered in roaches.

(Cut back to Scully.)

I really think you should come...

SCULLY: A toilet? Check his eyes.

(Cut to Mulder. He bends down and opens up one of Newton's eyes extremely dilated and red.)

Is one of them bloodshot with a dilated pupil?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: It's probably a brain aneurysm.

MULDER: Brain aneurysm?

SCULLY: Straining too forcefully is very common causation for bursting a brain aneurysm.

(Cut back to Mulder. A cart is wheeled in. Mulder stands.)

MULDER: Well, how do you explain the roaches, though?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Did you catch any?

MULDER: Almost.

SCULLY: I don't know what to tell you, Mulder. I just hope you're not implying you've come across an infestation of killer cockroaches.

(Cut to Mulder, who's eyes wander off in thought.)



SCENE 8
USDA BASE; MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder scales the fence and lands just as his phone rings. He answers it.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder? I've been doing some research.

(He starts to walk. Cut to Scully, who sits at her computer, eating ice cream out of the box.)

Back in the mid-'80s, there was a cockroach species previously only found in Asia. And since then, it's made an appearance in Florida. They've now completely established themselves in this country.

(Cut to Mulder as he approaches the building.)

MULDER: Do they attack people?

SCULLY: No, but they do exhibit behavior different than our domestic breeds.

(Cut back to Scully.)

They, they fly for long distances and they're attracted to light.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: But do they attack people?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm suggesting that what's happening out there might be the introduction to this country of a new species of cockroach...

(Cut back to Mulder.)

One that is attracted to people.

MULDER: Well, that all makes perfect sense, Scully. I don't like it at all. Did you know that the federal government, under the guise as the department of agriculture, as been conducting secret experiments up here?

SCULLY: Mulder, you're not thinking about trespassing onto government property again, are you?

(Mulder takes out his lockpick gun. Cut to Scully.)

I know that you've done it in the past, but I don't think that this case warrants...

MULDER: It's too late, I'm already inside.

(Scully hits her palm on the desk and sighs. Cut to Mulder, who takes out his flashlight and shines it around what appears to be a common suburban house.)

SCULLY: Well, what's going on? What do you see?

MULDER: I'm a house. It's apparently empty.

(Cut to Scully, who takes a bite of ice cream.)

SCULLY: What does the place look like?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: It's a, uh... typical two-story suburban house. Nice big living room, sparsely furnished...

(Cut to Scully, who chows down some more.)

Nice carpets... fireplace...

(Cut back to Mulder. He walks into the kitchen.)

Nice kitchen. Modern appliances.

(He looks at the wallpaper and sees bumps crawling underneath.)

Moving walls.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Moving walls?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah. They're rippling.

(He pokes the wallpaper with his flashlight and cockroaches pour out.)

Oh! Cockroaches!

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: What?!

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Cockroaches. They're everywhere.

(Cockroaches cover the walls and appliances on the counters. They run all over the floor and on his feet.)

Ah, I'm surrounded.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you've got to get out of there right now!

(Mulder screams.)

SCULLY: Are you all right? What happened?

(Cut to Mulder, who shakes the flashlight.)

MULDER: Flashlight went out...

(The light turns on. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what's going on?

(Cut to Mulder, who has a slight smile on his face.)

MULDER: Got to go.

(He hangs up. Cut to Scully, who is hearing a dialtone.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!

(She lowers the phone. Cut back to Mulder, who lowers the phone. He stares at the beautiful woman in front of him.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: May I ask why you're trespassing on government property?

MULDER: I'm a federal agent.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: So am I.

(Mulder shows her his badge.)

MULDER: Agent Mulder, F.B.I.

(Berenbaum shows him her badge.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Doctor Berenbaum, U.S.D.A. Agricultural research service.

MULDER: Doctor Berenbaum, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: For instance?

MULDER: What's a woman like you doing in a place like this?



SCENE 9
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully stares at her phone.)



SCENE 10
USDA BASE; MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder and Berenbaum walk into a room much like Mulder's office. There is a terrarium with cockroaches on a desk.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: By studying how insects respond to changes in light, temperature, air currents, food availability, we can determine the best ways to eradicate them.

MULDER: Why all the secrecy about your research? You've got some of the good townspeople suspicious.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: You expect us to advertise that we've intentionally infested a house in their neighborhood with thousands of cockroaches?

(Mulder nods and points out of the room.)

MULDER: Yeah... but those, those cockroaches... are they, uh, a normal species?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: They're a common one.

MULDER: Have you ever come across, uh, a type of cockroach that, uh, is attracted to people?

(They sit down.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Most cockroaches have been known to actually wash themselves after being touched by humans.

MULDER: Really. So, you've never seen an instance where a cockroach actually attacks a human being?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Well, there have been cases where a cockroach has crawled into a person's ear or nose.

MULDER: Nose?

(He winces and slumps back in his chair. He then points to a strange looking device. An orange cone holds a lid on top with a cockroach in it.)

What, what is that there?

(He slides around her.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Oh, it's just a pet project of mine. Since an insect's exoskeleton is a dielectric surrounding the conductive medium of its body fluid, when introduced into an electrical field, a brushed discharge will result in a colored flare.

(She presses a big red button and the exoskeleton glows blue.)

MULDER: What is that supposed to prove?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Well, it's my theory that UFOs are actually insect swarms.

(He stares at her.)

I don't know if you know anything about UFOs, but all the characteristics of a typical sighting are shared with nocturnal insects swarming through an electrical air field... the sudden appearance of a colored, glowing light hovering in the night sky, moving in a nonmechanical matter, possibly humming.

(Mulder does an exaggerated nod.)

Creating interference with radio and television signals.

(Mulder does his exaggerated nod even more.)

Then suddenly disappearing.

MULDER: As, uh... as nocturnal insect swarms. That's, uh... that's fascinating.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Everything about insects is fascinating. They are truly remarkable creatures. So beautiful, and so honest.

MULDER: Honest?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Eat, sleep... defecate, procreate. That's all they do. That's all we do, but at least insects don't kid themselves that it's anything more than that.

(Mulder fidgets in his chair.)

Does my scientific detachment disturb you?

MULDER: No. No, actually, I, I find it quite refreshing.

(They stare at each other, smiling. Mulder's phone rings and they both snap out of their trances. He picks it up.)

Not now.

(He hangs up.)

You know, um... I have always found insects to be very interesting.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Really?

(They stare at each other, smiling again. The cockroach's back glows again.)



SCENE 11
MILLER'S GROVE MOTOR LODGE

(A fat, Asian man lays on his bed, watching a news broadcast on television, channel WKRB 3.)

REPORTER: This is the fifth report of a deceased body being found amongst a hoard of cockroaches, but police are not confirming, at least not yet, that the insects have anything to do with the fatalities.

(A cockroach crawls on the bed and rubs against his feet. The man scratches one foot with the other.)

Police have also disaffirmed the rumor that these deaths were the result of an outbreak of the Ebola virus, somehow being spread by infected cockroaches.

(He scratches his ear. Another cockroach crawls out from under his pillow and scurries off. The man is still scratching his ear.)

As for now, these incidents remain under local jurisdiction, but a nurse here did confirm that an F.B.I. agent is on the case.

(In the background, a nurse walks in with two men in yellow containment suits.)

Police are asking that if you see any cockroaches, don't panic. Simply notify the authorities and evacuate the area immediately. Reporting live, this is Skye Leikin for Channel three, nightwatch news.

(The man changes the channel to an old movie. Cockroaches scurry away from the changer.)

WOMAN: Then suddenly, there was this terrible crash. You know, you could've been killed.

(Mulder can't sleep. He checks his covers, then nervously checks under them for roaches. He sits up, smells his hand, then brushes his other hand through his hair, then flops back down onto the bed. Sighing, he picks up the phone and turns on the light. Rubbing his eyes for a second, he dials. Cut to Scully, who has the phone next to her head as she sleeps. The first ring doesn't finish before she picks it up.)

SCULLY: Mulder, are you okay?

MULDER: I can't sleep.

SCULLY: What happened at the U.S.D.A. site?

MULDER: They're conducting legitimate experiments.

(Cut to Mulder.)

I met an entomologist, Doctor Berenbaum, who agrees with your theory of an accidental importation of a new cockroach species.

SCULLY: Did he give you any idea of how to catch them?

MULDER: No. But she did tell me everything else there is to know about insects.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: She?

(Cut back to Mulder. He stands.)

Yeah, did you know that the ancient Egyptians worshipped the scarab beetle and possibly erected the pyramids to honor them, which may be just giant symbolic dung heaps?

(Mulder carries the phone into the bathroom. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Did you know the inventor of the flush toilet was named Thomas Crapper?

(Mulder laughs a little.)

MULDER: Bambi also has this theory I've never come acro...

(Her eyes widen.)

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Doctor Berenbaum. Anyway, her theory is...

SCULLY: Her name is Bambi?

(Cut to Mulder, who walks out of the bathroom and over to the window.)

MULDER: Yeah. Both her parents were naturalists. Her theory is that UFOs are actually nocturnal insect swarms passing through electrical air fields.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Her name is Bambi?

(Cut to Mulder, who rubs his forehead.)

MULDER: Scully, can I confess something to you?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, sure, okay.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I hate insects.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: You know, lots of people are afraid of insects, Mulder. It's just a... it's a natural, instinctive.

(Cut to Mulder, who sits at the foot of the bed with a magazine.)

MULDER: No, no, I'm not afraid of them. I hate them. One day back when I was a kid, I, uh... I was climbing this tree when I noticed this leaf walking towards me. It took forever for me to realize that it was no leaf.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: A praying mantis?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, I had a praying mantis epiphany and, as a result, I screamed. No, not... not a girlie scream, but the scream of someone being confronted by some before unknown monster that had no right existing on the same planet I inhabited. Did you ever notice how a praying mantis' head resembles an alien's head? I mean, the mysteries of the natural world were revealed to me that day, but instead of being astounded, I was... repulsed.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Cut to Scully.)

Are you sure it wasn't a girlie scream?

(Cut to Mulder. A man screams. Cut back to Scully.)

What was that?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Oh, I got to go.

(He hangs up. Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mul... no...

(Getting a dialtone, she hangs up and sighs. In the motel, Eckerle nervously walks towards the room. Another man looks out of his room.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Did you hear that too?

RESIDENT #1: Came from over there.

(Another resident comes out behind them.)

RESIDENT #2: What the hell is going on?

(They all walk to another door and Eckerle knocks on it.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Hello? I, is everything all right in there?

(Eckerle opens the door to see the fat man from before covered in cockroaches. Eckerle screams and the three residents disperse. Mulder runs past the two residents, carrying the gun, and looks inside the room. Cockroaches are nowhere to be found.)



SCENE 12
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully is packing her suitcase when the phone rings. She picks it up.)

SCULLY: What happened now?

(Cut to Mulder. A photographer takes a picture of the body and walks away.)

MULDER: One of the motel guests died.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm coming up there right now.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, I think this man died from simply from a reaction to the cockroaches.

SCULLY: Two cases of anaphylactic shock...

(He sits down at the foot of the bed. Cut to Scully as she puts some clothes into the suitcase.)

...in the same day in the same town is highly improbable.

(Cut to Mulder. A man holds the newscasters outside.)

MULDER: No, I... I'm saying that I think this mans imply had a heart attack.

(Frass walks in and hands him some papers.)

Word about the cockroach infestation and the deaths related to it have gotten out and... I think this man simply saw some cockroaches and scared himself to death.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Regardless, Mulder, something strange is definitely going on up there.

(Cut back to Mulder, who looks through the papers that Frass gave him.)

MULDER: Maybe not. All your conjectures have proved correct. The exterminator did die from anaphylactic shock. The teenage boy did die from self-inflicted wounds and was getting high off methane fumes derived from burning manure. The medical examiner did die from a brain aneurysm.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: I still haven't been able to explain the cockroaches at all the sites.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Or the fact that their exoskeletons are made of metal.

SCULLY: Metal? What are you talking about? Mulder?

(Mulder looks at a roach motel sitting under the table. Cut back to Scully.)

Mulder, I'm coming up there.

(Cut to Mulder as he goes towards the roach motel.)

MULDER: Whatever.

(He hangs up and picks up the roach motel to see a cockroach inside.)



SCENE 13
USDA BASE; MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(Bambi and Fox look at the cockroach under a large magnifying glass.)

MULDER: Can you tell what kind of cockroach it is?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: I should be able to. The abdomen's still attached and we differentiate species by their genitalia. Oh my God...

MULDER: Is it abnormal?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: I'll say. He's hung like a club-tailed dragonfly. Excuse me.

(She walks past him to a microscope and looks inside.)

MULDER: Does it still look unusual?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Well, yes. For an insect genitalia, but maybe not for a microprocessor.

MULDER: You're implying that this insect is mechanical?

(She looks at the microscope. He looks inside.)

But what am I supposed to be looking at here?

(He looks at her.)

Have, have you ever seen anything like this before?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Only in science journals. I've read about an artificial intelligence researcher who designs robots that resemble and behave like insects. I've never seen them myself, but I've often thought of visiting his lab.

MULDER: He works out of this town?



SCENE 14
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF ROBOTICS

(Mulder walks down the stairs and then a hallway. A small, insect-shaped robot walks down the adjacent hallway (and manages to erase the title of the location as he does somehow.) Mulder watches as it walks into a room, then comes out and looks at him. As Mulder takes a few steps towards him, the insect back away. Mulder follows the insect to a laboratory where the insect robot disappears. Mulder hears a similar whirring and turns around to see Doctor Ivanov approaching him on his wheelchair. The scientist talks out of a microscope that is near his throat. A laptop computer is hooked onto the wheelchair.)

MULDER: Doctor Ivanov?

IVANOV: Why are you scaring my robots?

(Afterwards, Mulder and Ivanov talk as a robot sits on the table next to them.)

For decades, my colleagues in artificial intelligence have attempted to create an autonomous robot. By struggling to give their machines a human-like brain, they have failed.

(Mulder kneels down and waves his hand in front of the "bug." He touches the leg and it moves.)

A human brain is too complex, too computational. It thinks too much. But insects merely react.

(Another robot crawls over to Mulder. Mulder backs away, but the robot follows him.)

I used insects as my model, not just in design but by giving them the simplest of computer programs. "Go to the object. Go away from the moving object." Governed only by sensors and reflex responses, they take on the behavior of intelligence, living beings.

MULDER: So this one is just programmed to head towards any object moving within the field of its sensors?

IVANOV: No.

(Mulder backs away some more, but the robot still follows.)

MULDER: Then why is it following me?

IVANOV: He likes you.

(Mulder and Ivanov sit at a computer.)

MULDER: Your contract is with NASA?

IVANOV: The goal is to transport a fleet of robots to another planet and allow them to navigate the terrain with more intricacy than any space probe has done before. It, it sounds slightly fantastic, but the only obstacle I can foresee is devising a renewable energy source. In any case, this is the future of space exploration. It does not include living entities.

MULDER: I'm just speculating here, but if extraterrestrial lifeforms do exist...

IVANOV: Oh, there's no need for speculation, I believe they do.

MULDER: And assuming that they're more technologically advanced than we are, and if your own ideas about the future of space exploration are correct, then...

IVANOV: Then the interplanetary explorers of alien civilizations will likely be mechanical in nature. Yes. Anyone who thinks alien visitation will come not in the form of robots, but of living beings with big eyes and gray skin has been brainwashed by too much science-fiction.

(Mulder looks away, shrugging slightly. Ivanov stares at him. Mulder takes out a small bag with three insect legs.)

MULDER: Can you identify this?

IVANOV: I'm not really good with bugs. A cricket's legs?

MULDER: Try it under the microscope.

(Ivanov dumps the contents out in a small petrie dish and looks at the contents. The light to the microscope is bright red. Ivanov's eyes widen and he looks at the wall, flabbergasted.)

Are you all right, Doctor Ivanov?

(Ivanov nods.)

Can you identify that?

(Ivanov shakes his head slightly and mouths some words to himself.)

Sir?

(Ivanov looks at him.)

IVANOV: It's... beyond my comprehension.

(They stare at each other. (A cockroach crawls down the screen.))



SCENE 15
MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(The town is in mass hysteria, and no evidence of that is more evident than in a convenience store. A mother and her children hurry in grabbing supplies. A tall, black man pulls a kid out of the way.)

MAN #1: Hey, kid, move! Gimme that!

(He grabs a pack of toilet paper. People shout to each other as they grab anything they can. Another man grabs a whole shelf of bottled water. Men take different packages off the shelves.)

CLERK: Hands off, buddy!

(Another man grabs a number of things before grabbing a canister of "Die! Bug! Die!" This seems to be the most popular item as people clamor for it desperately. A sailor stocks up on chocolate and pantyhose. Scully walks in and looks at the panic around her. Outside, a car crashes into another right outside, and Scully turns around in shock. The man in the second car yells at the other one.)

MAN #2: Hey, what are you crazy? Watch yourself!

WOMAN #1: Hey, you idiot, you hit me!

(Scully walks in and a man brushes past her harshly. She goes over to the clerk, who is bagging a woman's purchases.)

SCULLY: Excuse me, do you sell road maps?

(The clerk nods.)

Could you tell me where they are?

WOMAN #2: Come on, hurry up!

(Scully looks at the impatient shopper.)

SCULLY: What's going on here?

WOMAN #2: Haven't you heard about the roaches? They're devouring people whole.

(Scully gives her a strange look.)

Everybody's getting the hell out of here.

SCULLY: Have you seen any of cockroaches yourself?

WOMAN #2: No, but they're everywhere.

(She runs off. The next man in line goes to the counter.)

MAN #3: Roaches aren't attacking people, lady. They're spreading the Ebola virus.

(He throws a bill down on the counter and picks up his stuff.)

Look, keep the change.

(He looks back at Scully as he starts out.)

We're all going to be bleeding from our nipples!

(He runs out. Scully has had enough.)

SCULLY: All right.

(She starts screaming, holding up her badge.)

All right, listen up!

(Amazingly, as she talks, people stop and listen.)

I'm Agent Dana Scully from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I am assuring you that you are not in any danger. Everything is going to be okay if you just calm down, and start acting rationally. Now, where the hell are those road maps?

(She looks at the clerk. A woman looks at another one and they both reach for the last can of "Die! Bug! Die!" They both grab it and pull at it.)

WOMAN #3: Hey! This last can is mine!

(The other woman yanks her around and knocks her backwards into a store display loaded with Choco Droppings. The small, brown pebbles fall out onto the floor, rolling everywhere. An especially frightened man looks down.)

MAN #4: Roaches!

(Everyone screams and leaves, except for Scully. Outside, car engines start and cars honk, people screaming. Scully slowly makes her way over to the spilled candy. She bends down and picks up a half-empty box, then eats a piece, looking around.)



SCENE 16
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF ROBOTICS

(Ivanov and Mulder sit at a quarter-full bottle of scotch. Ivanov drinks from his glass.)

MULDER: Oh, Doctor, I, uh... I appreciate you taking the time to, uh... answer my questions.

(He takes a sip.)

IVANOV: Yeah.

(Mulder leaves as Ivanov takes another sip. As Mulder walks out, he passes another robot and sees a cockroach that had been knocked over by it. He bends down and picks it up, watching it struggle between his fingers. Mulder's picture is fractured in the insect's vision.)

MULDER: Greetings from planet Earth.



SCENE 17
USDA BASE; MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(Berenbaum inspects the cockroach under the magnifying glass as Mulder watches on.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Well, it's a cockroach all right. It's not like the leg segment you had me examine earlier. It's just a typical cockroach.

MULDER: Even the...

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Yes, even the genitalia is normal. Cockroaches are common in this area at this time of year. It's one of the reasons I set up my study here.

(Mulder bangs the desk and the cockroach lights up. They both stare at the glowing cockroach for a little while before Mulder takes his hand off of the button. His phone rings and he sits and answers it.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully, still in the convenience store, standing behind the desk.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this town is insane.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Where are you?

SCULLY: I'm in a convenience store on the outskirts of, uh...

(Cut back to Scully, who is writing on the desk.)

Civilization. Look, I think I may have a lead. Remember that Doctor Eckerle who was the alternative fuel researcher that witnessed the exterminator's death? Well, the fuel that he's researching is methane gas... methane derived from manure.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Manure?

SCULLY: He has an import license...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...to bring in animal dung samples from outside the country. Now, maybe you can confirm this with your Doctor Bambi...

(Cut to Mulder. Mulder looks up at Bambi.)

...but I think that cockroaches are...

(Cut to Scully.)

...dung-eaters, and if so, some of them may have been shipped accidentally in some of the samples. This fuel research facility could be ground zero for the infestation.

(She eats another Choco Dropping. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully, if an alien civilization were technologically advanced enough to build and send artificially intelligent robotic probes to the farthest reaches of space, might they not have also been able to perfect the extraction of methane fuel from manure?

(Bambi smiles at him, having been listening. He looks up at her, now trying to impress her.)

An abundant and replenishing energy source filled on a planet with dung-producing creatures.

(Cut to Scully, who sits and chews the candy slowly, thinking about this.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I think you've been in this town too long.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Where's the research facility located?



SCENE 18
ALT FUELS; MILLER'S GROVE, MASSACHUSETTS

(The sign reads "ALT FUELS Inc.; Waste is a Terrible Thing to Waste." Mulder and Bambi drive up.)

MULDER: Wait, Bambi. You better wait here until I make sure it's safe.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Well, be careful. We still don't know what these cockroaches are capable of, if they're even cockroaches.

MULDER: Well, I'm not so much worried about the cockroaches than I am about the human element.

(He gets out of the car. Doctor Eckerle peers out of his window through his blinds, frightened, breathing heavily. Outside his window, he sees rows of dung sitting on long tables, cockroaches crawling over them and chirping. He sits down and clutches the can of bug spray to his chest. He looks at a cockroach sitting on the desk and sprays it with the "Die! Bug! Die!" The bug is immune to the spray and crawls down the desk. Eckerle keeps spraying at it, almost crying. He throws the can at the desk. Mulder walks through the dark facility and into the room full of dung. He walks past, looking at all of the cockroaches. He reaches down to pull one off of a pile when a gunshot rings out. Mulder ducks as the bullet strikes the dung heap he was reaching to. He looks up to see Eckerle aiming his gun at him.)

MULDER: Doctor Eckerle?

(He stands, holding his hands out.)

JEFF ECKERLE: They're after me. First at my house, then at the motel, and then I came here to get away... but... they're following me.

(They both walk to their left. Eckerle seems to have completely broken down, holding his gun on Mulder.)

MULDER: You're not in any danger, these insects won't harm you.

JEFF ECKERLE: I've seen them kill two men.

MULDER: They weren't responsible for those deaths... but they might be responsible for ours if you continue firing your gun in a plant full of methane gas.

JEFF ECKERLE: Don't you understand? The bugs... they drive me crazy.

(He starts to cry, shaking the gun violently. Outside, Scully drives up next to Mulder's car and looks at Bambi.)

SCULLY: Let me guess... Bambi.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Fox told me to wait out here while he checked inside first.

(Scully unbuckles her seatbelt and gets out of the car.)

Should I come along with you?

SCULLY: No... this is no place for an entomologist.

(She takes out her gun, loads the clip and walks towards the building. Eckerle watches the cockroaches crawl over the dung heaps and chirp.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Why are these roaches making those weird noises?

MULDER: In Madagascar, they have roaches that hiss by blowing air through the holes in their upper thorax.

JEFF ECKERLE: Really? How, how do you know so much about them?

MULDER: I don't. That's why we shouldn't kill these, but capture them for further study. Now, please... put the gun down.

(Eckerle looks at the gun and takes a deep, jagged breath.)

JEFF ECKERLE: Have I lost my mind?

MULDER: No. You've just had a very stressful day that's affected your ability to think clearly. Your judgment is a little clouded right now.

JEFF ECKERLE: It is?

(Mulder nods, reaching for the gun. Eckerle points it at him and Mulder straightens back up.)

Then how do I know... that you're not a cockroach?

(He approaches him, Mulder backing away. Scully walks through the dark facility.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder!

(Scully sighs and pulls out her cellular phone. She starts dialing. Mulder is still trying to calm Eckerle down.)

MULDER: I assure you, Doctor Eckerle, I'm just as human as you are... if not more so.

(His phone rings, sounding much like the chirping emitted by the strange roaches. They look at it.

JEFF ECKERLE: You are one of them!

(Eckerle fires at Mulder, but Mulder ducks. The bullet strikes a valve and fire sprays out. Mulder runs off as Eckerle shoots at him again and hits a canister, which also lights on fire. All over the building, valves shoot out fire. Mulder runs up the stairs and towards Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Get out, Scully! This whole place could blow!

(They run outside. Mulder looks over at Bambi.)

Get down!

(She puts her head between her knees as Mulder and Scully run for cover. They duck behind Mulder's car as the inside of the facility explodes in fire, flames bursting out of the windows and spraying everything with manure. Bambi looks back at the agents, who are covered in the feces.)

Crap.

(They look at each other. In the early morning, it is raining. Firemen are hard at work as Frass walks towards them, wearing a raincoat. The agents are sharing an umbrella.)

FRASS: It's like a crematorium in there, I don't think we're going to locate the doctor's remains.

MULDER: Or anything else, for that matter.

FRASS: Still, it's not as bad as some of the other fires we had last night.

SCULLY: There were others?

FRASS: Four, to be exact. Plus eighteen auto accidents, thirteen assault and batteries, two stores were looted, thirty-six injuries all total, half of them from insecticide poisoning... but, we didn't receive reports on cockroaches or otherwise for the last couple of hours. Maybe this town's finally come to its senses. You two ought to go home and get some rest. You look pooped.

(He walks away. Mulder smiles. Ivanov rolls up to them, an umbrella attached to his wheelchair. Bambi, also holding an umbrella, watches him intently.)

IVANOV: Agent Mulder? They told me I could locate you here. Those, uh, segments you showed me earlier... may I examine them again?

(Mulder shrugs and reaches into his pocket.)

MULDER: Well, they're completely desiccated... just like the molted exoskeleton.

(He hands the bag to Ivanov.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: You know, many insects don't develop wings until their last molting stage. Perhaps whatever these things were, they had their final molt and have flown off back to wherever they originated.

SCULLY: Yeah, that would explain everything.

(Mulder looks at her and is about to say something when Ivanov cuts him off.)

IVANOV: May I borrow this, Agent Mulder, for further study?

MULDER: Well, I've already had a similar sample analyzed, it's nothing but common metals. What do you hope to find from it?

BAMBI BERENBAUM: His destiny.

IVANOV: Isn't that what Doctor Zaius said to Zira at the end of "The Planet of the Apes?"

(She nods, smiling.)

BAMBI BERENBAUM: It's one of my favorite movies.

IVANOV: Mine too. I love science fiction.

(Mulder looks at them strangely.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: I'm also fascinated by your research.

(She and the doctor start off.)

Have you ever considered programming the robots to mimic the behavior of social insects like ants or bees?

IVANOV: As a matter of fact, I have.

BAMBI BERENBAUM: You know, I read in November of '94 in "Entomology Extreme..."

IVANOV: Oh, I remember that...

BAMBI BERENBAUM: Your article about the pollination of...

IVANOV: Yes, I really enjoyed writing about that...

(Mulder watches them leave, saddened.)

SCULLY: Smart is sexy.

(Mulder looks at her.)

Well, think of it this way, Mulder. By the time there's another invasion of artificially-intelligent, dung-eating robotic probes from outer space, maybe their uber-children will have devised a way to save our planet.

MULDER: You know, I never thought I'd say this to you, Scully... but you smell bad.

(He smirks and walks away, taking the umbrella with him.)



SCENE 19
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder sits at his desk, typing up his report. He is also eating a rather large piece of cake that resembles a dung heap. We can hear him say what he is writing.)

MULDER: The development of our cerebral cortex has been the greatest achievement of the evolutionary processes. Big deal. While allowing us the thrills of intellect and the pangs of self-consciousness, it is all too often overruled by our inner, instinctive brain, the one that tells us to react, not reflect, to run rather than ruminate.

(He takes a piece of candy on the cake and eats it.)

Maybe we have gone as far as we can go, and the next advance, whatever that may be, will be made by beings we create ourselves using our own tech...

(It beeps as he presses the first key to the word. He tries it again.)

Tech...

(It beeps. He smacks the screen and it beeps three times. He continues typing.)

Technology, lifeforms we can design and program not to be ultimately governed and constricted by the rules of survival.

(He eats another piece of cake.)

Or perhaps that step forward has already been achieved on another planet by organisms that had a billion years head start on us. If these beings ever visited us, would we recognize what we were seeing? And upon catching sight of us, would they react in anything but horror at seeing such mindless, primitive, hideous creatures?

(He goes to take another piece of cake but sees a white cockroach on the plate. He picks up a stack of files, including the X-File for the case, number "667366," and goes to hit it. It crawls to the front of his plate and he watches it's head move, lowering the papers. It crawls out onto the desk and he slams the papers down onto it.)

[THE END]

                                          SYZYGY



SCENE 1

(Its dark, a group of children are holding candles.)

BOOM: I remember me and him all the way back to kindergarten. He was, eh, I dunno. He was like a brother or something. And we had some good times. Good times that Ill never forget. Junk like that. (louder) Right now we all gotta stick together and protect each other, thats what Bruno wouldve wanted. Cuz they say the cult is gonna come and try and get some more of us and, we cant let that happen. So we gotta kick some butt. We gotta kick some butt,like Im sure Brunos doing in heaven right now. (walks away crying, two blonde girls (Terri and Margi) who have been looking very bored during his speech follow him.)

TERRI: Boom, are you okay?

BOOM: Yeah.

MARGI: That was beautiful.

BOOM: Yep.

TERRI: So did you hear who the cult is supposed to be coming after next?

MARGI: A blonde virgin.

BOOM: (looks at Terri and Margi) Cmon, Ill give you guys a ride home.

(In the car)

TERRI: (To Margi) Your mom is always saying wait until youre married, dont just give it away.

MARGI: Yeah, and then some cult member wants to kidnap you and sacrifice you because you are a virgin. Oh, God. I mean, how do they even know if you really are a virgin?

TERRI: I dont know. I dont even want to think about it.

MARGI: Youre not a virgin, are you, Boom?

BOOM: Eh, no.

TERRI: You know, maybe if we werent virgins, we wouldnt be so scared.

(The car suddenly pulls off the road. We see a full moon with two planets.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Two Caryl County police cars arrive and policemen start searching the rocks. There already is a blue car standing with its doors open.)

POLICEMAN: Over here!

POLICEWOMAN: Is he dead?

POLICEMAN: Yeah, it looks like he hung himself.

(The camera follows the rope from the body (no head visible) up to the top of the hill, voices start)

MARGI: He loves me.

TERRY: He loves me not.

MARGI: He loves me.

TERRY: He loves me not.

MARGI: He loves me.

TERRY: He loves me not.

MARGI: He loves me.

TERRY: He loves me not.

MARGI: He loves me.

TERRY: Not.

(They giggle as they pull the last leaf off a white flower.)



SCENE 3

(A car approaching an intersection. View of a sign saying Leaving COMITY The Perfect Harmony City.)

SCULLY: The map says to turn right at the intersection.

MULDER: The detective who contacted me told me to turn left.

SCULLY: At the intersection?

MULDER: Stoplight.

SCULLY: This isnt a stoplight, its a stop sign.

MULDER: Well, Im sure she meant stop sign.

SCULLY: A turn right.

(Mulder turns right, for a few seconds we see the empty intersection, then Mulder comes racing back to the left.)




SCENE 4

(At a funeral)

MINISTER: What more can I say about the loss of a young man like Jay Deboom, that the sadness in each of our own hearts does not express more poignantly. A few people have asked if they might come up and share some of their own personal remembrances of Jay. And Id like to invite them to come forward at this time and share some of those thoughts.

(A blonde woman, agent White, walks to Mulder and Scully.)

WHITE: (softly) His friends called him Boom, quarterback in the football team, he was well liked, a leader and he was looking forward to college until he was found hanging in the woods two days ago, the third high school boy in as many months.

MULDER: And your fact sheet said that theres strong suspicions of a satanic cult at work?

WHITE: Thats the popular opinion around here. Wildly popular, actually.

SCULLY: Based on what evidence?

WHITE: Various eye-witness accounts of satanic rituals being conducted.

SPEAKER: I remember me and Boom back at kindergarten, he was, I dunno, like a brother, or something.

SCULLY: And you have physical evidence of these rituals being conducted?

WHITE: No. No, just the murder victims.

SCULLY: So you have nothing concrete to connect these things to Satanists.

WHITE: (affirms)

MULDER: If, eh, you detect a hint of skepticism or incredulity in agent Scullys voice, thats because of the overwhelming evidence gathered by the FBI debunking virtually all claims of ritual abuse by satanic cults.

WHITE: Is that true?

MULDER: Dont ask me

SCULLY: (irritated) Our research has proven that most of these accounts are false or imagined. That, eh, the trauma or mental illness that is often linked to satanic cults is a result of denial, hysteria and misplaced blame.

WHITE: Well, youre gonna have a hard time convincing the locals of that, especially after hearing the stories of two girls that were there the night Boom died.

SCULLY: Who interviewed them?

WHITE: I did.

SCULLY: Together or separate?

WHITE: Together. Why?

SCULLY: Well, then you have no way of determining whether or not the stories are fabricated.

WHITE: No, no, these are good kids were talking about. Outstanding students, and the details they gave, I doubt they could have made them up.

SCULLY: Let me guess, they told you about a wild beast entering in on a black mass, the drinking of blood, the sacrifice of an infant,or a blonde virgin.

WHITE: Yeah, thats right, excuse me. (walks away)

SCULLY: Where is she going?

MULDER: You dont suppose shes a virgin, do you?

SCULLY: I doubt shes even a blonde.

(A man (Bob) enters the room, even though agent White and some others tried to stop him.)

BOB: How long are we going to stand by and watch our children die, while Satans soldiers run free in this city?

WHITE: Bob, this is no time to

BOB: No time? No time?

WHITE: Hé, Bob, this is not the place for this.

BOB: My wife cant sleep at night, my kids say they can feel Satans presence.

(Terri and Margi hold each others hand.)

BOB: (continues) We gotta, we gotta.., wake up and take action people, we gotta cast the Devil out of our community.

(Smoke starts coming from Booms coffin, then flames, people panic.)

WHITE: Allright, everybody, stay calm.

(Mulder and Scully look at the burning coffin.)

MULDER: (to Scully) Maybe were just imagining that.

(Mulder walks out, followed, at distance, by Scully. Terri and Margi are the only ones left in the room.)




SCENE 5
Caryl County Sheriffs station

(In an interrogation room.)

TERRI: My name is Terry Roberts, I go to Grover Cleveland Alexander High school, Im a senior with a 3.98 grade point average.

(Other interrogation room, with Mulder.)

MARGI: Im Margi Kleinjan, I go to Grover Cleveland Alexander High school, Im a senior with 3.75 grade point average. Im on the cheerleading yell squad with my best friend Terri.

TERRI: Im on the cheerleading yell squad with my best friend Margi and we plan to go to college together in the fall.

SCULLY: Yeah, could you tell me again exactly what happened the night of Jay Debooms death?

TERRI: Boom, Jay, was giving us a ride home in his truck, when all of a sudden he swerved off the road.

MARGI: Like, he had been possessed or something. And he made us get out of the car, and walk to a clearing, where, people were wearing black robes and holding black candles. I couldnt see their faces underneath their hoods, but, I knew they up to no good.

SCULLY: How did you know they were up to no good?

TERRI: Well, they were all standing around this altar, and one of them had a long knife, with a snakes head on the handle, ruby eyes. And I thought first we were dead, because wed heard that they were gonna sacrifice a blonde virgin,

MARGI: But instead they just pulled out this little crying baby, and put it on the altar, and the man with the knife started saying some kind of prayer. (starts crying)

TERRI: He was chanting (starts crying) and he was saying stuff about how they were gonna sacrifice the baby, because it hadnt been christened yet. And how they were gonna bury it in a mass grave on the outskirts of town, with all the other babies that theyd killed, and




SCENE 6

TAPE OF MARGI: And, the whole group was chanting and saying things. And the man with the knife raised the knife up over the baby, and thats when Terri and I just ran for our lives.

(White stops the tape.)

WHITE: The two stories are virtually identical, the one corroborates the other.

SCULLY: I dont suppose there have been any actual reports of stolen infants, or mass graves being uncovered anywhere in town, or that you found an alter, or any other evidence of a black mass?

WHITE: No, no, in fact, we havent.

SCULLY: The problem is, that the details of these accounts could have been taken from any newspaper or magazine. As horrific as they sound, the stories that these girls told are common, even cliché.

MULDER: If you detect a hint of impatience in agent Scullys voice, thats because the FBIs study also found that in most cases, like the McWarren preschool trial, witnesses were often prompted in their statements by rumors of stories that were being circulated and that there was in fact nothing to support them.

WHITE: How do you explain the burning coffin at the funeral?

MULDER: Dont ask me



SCENE 7

(At the morgue, Scully removes the plastic cover and opens the half-burned coffin.)

SCULLY: There have been incidents where the embalming fluid used to preserve the body have caused chemical reactions and produced heat and burning, I, I see nothing here that would suggest otherwise.

WHITE: (pointing at a V-shaped burn on the bodys chest) What is that?

SCULLY: Whats what?

WHITE: That pattern, here, on his chest.

MULDER: Yeah, I see it, it looks like a, eh, goat, some kinda horned beast.

SCULLY: A horned beast?

MULDER: (Pointing at burning that indeed looks kinda like a horned beast.) Yeah, right here, in this circle.

SCULLY: I think you guys are seeing something that isnt there.

WHITE: No, no, right here, look, you see, the horns are right there.

SCULLY: No, I dont see the horns right there. (Snaps on surgical glove)

WHITE: (After looking at Mulder.) I assume youll call me if you need anything further. (leaves)

MULDER: (To Scully) If its no bother, if its not too big a deal, maybe you can get me a few photographs of that thing which bears absolutely no resemblance to a horned beast.

SCULLY: Sure, fine. (Snaps on other glove.) Whatever.




SCENE 8

(A cats head fills the screen, then we see Mulder, hes sitting on someones front steps. Agent
White opens the door.)

MULDER: Oh, hi.

WHITE: Eh, hi. What are you doing with my cat?

MULDER: He was scratching to get in and I thought, with the threat of satanic animal sacrifices looming, maybe you should keep him inside. (Hands over cat.)

WHITE: (Puts cat down.) I thought the FBIs research wouldve debunked that theory.

MULDER: Eh, first off, Id like to apologize for my partners rude behavior, she tends to be rather rigid, but, but rigid in a wonderful way, not like she was today. Personally, Id like to try to keep a more open mind.

WHITE: So, what are you doing at my house?

MULDER: I was hoping you could help me solve the mystery of the horny beast.




SCENE 9

(We see a neon sign saying "ZIRINKA: astrology, readings, numerology, runes. Inside".)

ZIRINKA: (Looking at picture of burn) Let me make sure I heard you right, you say you see horns.

MULDER: Do you see a, a goat here, some kinda beast?

ZIRINKA: This is a trick, right, to try and entrap me.

WHITE: Nobody is trying to entrap you.

ZIRINKA: Eh, yeah, right. There are a lot of loonies running around this town that like to think that Im a Satanist. But the truth is, Im just a number cruncher, trying to make an honest living.

MULDER: Well, what do you think is going on, if I may ask?

ZIRINKA: Well, I think the whole towns lost its marbles. I shouldve been the first to see it coming, but, its hard being a small business owner, I mean, you should see the paperwork.

MULDER: What do you mean seen it coming?

ZIRINKA: Well, were heading into a rare planetary alignment, where Mercury, Mars and Uranus are extreme influences.

MULDER: On what?

ZIRINKA: (Hands over her business card.) Office hours are nine to five, all major credit cards accepted.



SCENE 10

(view of a horned animal (goat?) on the floor of a gym. Theres a basketball practice, Terri and Margi are sitting behind a table with sodas.)

TERRI: (pointing at one of the boys.) Craig Wilmore.

MARGI: Hate him, roger.

TERRI: Points up for his dermatology gene.

(players start fighting)

MARGI: Can it be true that these people will soon be adults bringing new life into this world?

TERRI: Im so depressed.

(one of the boys picks up a cup from the table.)

TERRI: Hi, Scott. (TO MARGI: ) Scott Simic, babe-a-licious in [overtime seeing].

(Scott walks to his girlfriend.)

MARGI: Minus the Brenda-appendage.

TERRI: Hate her.

MARGI: Hate her, wouldnt wanna date her.

(Brenda, practicing some cheerleading, falls.)
(One of the players bumps into the table with sodas and spills the drinks all over Terri and Margi.)

BOY: Oh, hé, sorry. (Walks away.)

TERRI: Hate him!

MARGI: Hate him, wouldnt wanna date him!

(The boy gets hit on the head with a ball, the ball rolls on under the blenches, he follows it.
Suddenly the lights fail and the blenches start retreating, trapping the boy.)



SCENE 11
January 12, 5:10 AM

(In the gym, Mulder and White looking at the blenches.

SCULLY: What happened?

WHITE: Another young man has died.

MULDER: An electrical surge caused a power failure, but somehow activated the motor that retracts the blenches and he got caught inside of them.

AN AGENT: Detective White, can I see you?

WHITE: (To Mulder and Scully.) Excuse me.

(Scully looks around and sees Terri and Margi making statements to the local cops.)

SCULLY: (TO MULDER: ) You werent in your motel room.

MULDER: I went to follow up a lead with detective White.

SCULLY: I see.

MULDER: You see what?

SCULLY: Look, weve been working together for, what, two years now? We have different opinions, but I didnt expect you to ditch me.

MULDER: I didnt ditch you!

SCULLY: Fine, whatever.

WHITE: (returning) We got more trouble; a mob has gathered on the south side of town.




SCENE 12

(Locals, led by Bob, are digging in a field when Mulder, White and Scully arrive.)

WHITE: Whats going on here, Bob?

BOB: George Huntackers little boy got a phone call from someone who said they knew the location of the mass grave.

WHITE: Youre destroying private property, Bob, youre gonna have to stop digging.

BOB: Our children are dying!

WHITE: Well, that does not give you the right to come out here and tear up Harvey Molages back yard.

BOB: Maybe Harveys got something to hide. Weve got two kids whore prepared to say he took them on a camping trip and made them play naked movie star games!   (leaves)

MULDER: That man, is he always that hysterical?

WHITE: No, Bobs our high school principal, Ive never heard him say a bad word about anyone.

SCULLY: This is called rumor panic. Its when XXX that links up with a popular satanic cult myth and an increase of attention in a community. A villain or villains are singled out as the focus of the communitys confusion and angst about unexplained events, like the death of the high school boys. There have been at least twenty incidents since 1983 from upstate New York to Reno, Nevada and not one of them has turned up a single shred of evidence to support the wild allegations.

A WOMAN: (Screaming) I found bones!

BOB: She found bones!

(Commotion, everybody goes to the woman.)

SCULLY: Allright, everybody, stay back!

WOMAN: Theyre in the bag.

(Mulder and Scully both get down and start to put on surgical gloves, then they look at each other.)

MULDER: Go ahead

SCULLY: No, you go ahead.

MULDER: No, no, be my guest. I know how much you like snapping on the latex.

(Scully snaps on the glove and opens the bag; there are small bones in it.)

BOB: Theyre childs bones!

MULDER: (Pointing at a tag) Whats that, what is that, right there, that some kind of lettering there?

SCULLY: (reads) R. W. G.

BOB: Dick Godfrey. That bag belongs to doctor Godfrey. Hes the baby killer!

(Everyone leaves, led by Bob.)

MULDER: Whos doctor Godfrey?

WHITE: Hes a town pediatrician.

SCULLY: (Sigh, looks up (probably thinking: Im tired of all this/not again.))




SCENE 13

(Mob comes to dr. Godfreys house, Bob bangs on the door.)

BOB: Come on out, Godfrey!

(In the house, dr. Godfrey comes down the stairs, wearing very high heels, a (silk?) peignoir and make-up, he briefly looks our of the window, then runs.)

BOB: Hes home, hes in there!

(Mob start banging on the door and windows, yelling.)




SCENE 14
(At the precinct)

WHITE: Let me get this straight, for the record; you havent seen the bag in a year and you sold it at a garage sale.

GODFREY: To a young girl, one of the Roberts family. They live a few doors down.

WHITE: Why was it filled with bones and buried in the middle of a field?

GODFREY: I have no idea.

WHITE: Well, the people of this town seem to think you do. Would you be willing to take a lie detector test?

GODFREY: Eh

(Scully enters.)

SCULLY: You can go now dr. Godfrey, I dont think well be needing you any further. Your story checked out.

GODFREY: Thank God. (Gets up and puts on jack, standing behind Mulder.)

SCULLY: The bones, turned out to be the skeletal remains not of an infant, but of a beloved, fourteen year old [lasa apso], formerly known as (holds out collar) Mr. Tippy.

(Terri enters the room.)

TERRI: Mr. Tippy

MULDER: This may not be any time to mention it, but someone is wearing my favorite perfume.

(Everyone looks at him.)

SCULLY: Can I have a word with you?

(They go out into the hall.)

SCULLY: This has gone on far enough.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: I am not going to be humiliated by you, in front of you, or by having to bring a teenage girl in, on her birthday of all days, to identify the bones of her dead dog, Mr. Tippy!

MULDER: (Loses interest, starts sniffling the air, closing in around Scullys head.)

SCULLY: I see no reason to pursue this case any further and not only that, I find your conduct and comportment in this investigation not just alarming, but highly objectionable. What are you doing?!

MULDER: (slightly distracted.) Must be detective White

SCULLY: If thats the reason were sticking around, thats your business. (Walks away.)

MULDER: What? (surprised/incredulous) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Detective White.

MULDER: We came down here because of three unexplained deaths, detective White is just trying to solve them. She could use our help.

SCULLY: Well, you two seem to have a certainsimpatico. Im going back to Washington in the morning.

(Mulder slowly sinks to the wall while Scully leaves.)




SCENE 15

(Full moon, two planets vertically align under it. View of a street, sounds of a party. Inside a house a party is going on, we see a balloon saying Happy birthday Terri & Margi, a table with cake and presents. Theres loud music and some people are dancing. In another room, in silence, a group of children is playing with an Ouija-board.)

BRENDA: Who am I gonna marry?

(The pointer on the board slowly moves to the S, then almost reaches C, but quickly bends of to A and continues to T, A, and N. The group of children spells every letter out loud and gradually becomes more frightened.)

ALL: Satan?!

(Brenda runs to the bathroom, enters, sees Terri and Margi standing in front of the mirror, there are also some candles burning.)

TERRI/MARGI: One Bloody Mary, two Bloody Mary, three Bloody Mary, four Bloody Mary

BRENDA: What are you guys doing?

MARGI: You just close your eyes and count to thirteen and Bloody Mary appears in the mirror.

TERRI: Come on in, Brenda.

BRENDA: No. Thank you.

(Brenda tries to leave, but the door closes in front of her.)

TERRI/MARGI: Five Bloody Mary, six Bloody Mary, seven Bloody Mary

(Downstairs the children hear a scream, they turn off the radio, the scream continues.)




SCENE 16
8:25 PM
COMITY MOTEL

(Mulder is putting something thick and yellow (half - frozen orange juice?) in a half - full bottle of vodka, shakes it and drinks some. The top two buttons of his shirt are open and his tie is hanging untied on his shoulders. He turns on the TV, a black-and-white movie is playing (MUSIC: Sabre Dance), its on every channel.)

(The camera turns away to Scullys room. She is sitting on the bed, smoking, surfing the channels; the same movie everywhere. Scully switches off the TV, throws the remote next to her on the bed and gets up. She starts to walk towards the window, saying to herself: Detective White could use our help. She looks briefly out of the window, then continues pacing the room, mumbling things like Just here to solve this case and Detective White)

(Mulder is still trying to get something else from the TV, hes trying the remote from every possible angle. Then someone knocks on the door, he opens.)

WHITE: Can I come in? (Comes in and takes coat off.)

MULDER: What happened?

WHITE: (Points at shoe box she brought in.) I found that on my front doorstep.

(Mulder opens the box, in it is the collar of Det. Angela Whites cat (tel. nr. 555-0114).)

WHITE: (upset) If theyre not Satanists, who are they?

(Mulder walks to her and embraces her comfortingly, then starts sniffling her perfume.)

WHITE: (pushing him away.) What are you doing?

MULDER: Nothing.

WHITE: Youve been drinking.

MULDER: Yes, I, I have, which is funny, because I usually, I normally never, I dont drink.

(White nods a bit, then walks to the bottle of vodka, picks it up and looks at Mulder, who, somewhat apologizing, shrugs. She looks at the bottle and then drinks some herself.)

WHITE: You know, I dont feel like going home. Do you mind if I slept here? (Kicks off her shoes and takes off her jacket.)

MULDER: (Kinda fuzzy) Actually, Im sure I could eh, get you another room.

(Mulder goes to the phone, tries to get the operator, but White throws him on the bed and positions herself over him so he cant get up.)

WHITE: Maybe we can solve the mystery of the horny beast.

MULDER: Maybe we should just watch some television. Theres a movie on TV, actually, its the same movie on every channel.

WHITE: Weird. I like weird, I feel weird. (Starts kissing Mulder)

(Suddenly Scully comes in.)

SCULLY: Mu (sees them). Theres been another death.



SCENE 17

(Scully walks to the car, hastily followed by Mulder and White.)

MULDER: Was it a murder?

SCULLY: A high school girl was impaled by flying glass from a bathroom mirror. (Opens door on drivers side)

MULDER: Let me drive

SCULLY: Im driving.

MULDER: Scully, its not what you think

SCULLY: I didnt see anything anyway. (Sits down.)

MULDER: Will you let me drive!?

SCULLY: Im driv Why do you always have to drive? Because youre the guy? Because youre the big macho-man?

MULDER: No. I was just never sure your little feet could reach the pedals. (Closes Scullys door, then to White: ) Will you go with her, please? Thank you. (To Himself: ) Big macho-man



SCENE 18
10:01 PM

(Somewhere at a diner. Scott is staring over his burger. Terri and Margi enter, sit down at his table,theyre dressed in black and wearing much make-up).

MARGI: Hé.

TERRI: Loss of appetite, thats not a good sign.

SCOTT: Id like to be alone.

TERRI: Well, you got your wish.

SCOTT: What happened to you guys. You used to be

TERRI: Look, Scott, were not dressed like this for the funeral. Were here to make you feel better tonight. Carpe PM

SCOTT: Oh (leaves).

TERRI: Hate him.

MARGI: (no reaction)

TERRI: Hate him!

MARGI: (looks at Terri, then leaves)




SCENE 19

(at Zirinkas. Zirinka is checking Mulders credit card(s))

MULDER: When we were here before you s

ZIRINKA: Im just waiting for authorization.

MULDER: Im a federal agent.

ZIRINKA: Last I heard, the federal government couldnt pay its bills. Okay, youre good for up to 300 bucks. How can I help you?

MULDER: You said that you knew why people are behaving so strangely around here.

ZIRINKA: Well, the same reason that my dogs been trying to mate with the gas barbecue for the last two months.

MULDER: You said it was planetary?

ZIRINKA: Once every eighty-four years Mercury, Mars and Uranus come into conjunction. Only this year Uranus is in the house of Aquarius.

MULDER: Thats a bad thing?

ZIRINKA: Bad like an Irwin Allan movie. I mean, things are gonna fall outta the sky, disaster lies await, especially around here.

MULDER: Why here?

ZIRINKA: Were in a geological vortex, a high-intensity meridian.

MULDER: (question-mark face)

ZIRINKA: A cosmic G-spot? All combinating on January 12th when they come into perfect alignment. Which would be (looks at watch) today. Hé.

MULDER: Why is this affecting everyone?

ZIRINKA: Well, some people more than others. Relationships are gonna suck, significant dates can exaggerate the effects.

MULDER: What if today was my birthday?

ZIRINKA: Then Id say happy birthday. Unless of course you were born in 1979,and then Id call the police.

MULDER: (?)

ZIRINKA: Youd have a Jupiter-Uranus opposition, forming whats called a grand square, where all the planets align into a cross. All the energy of the cosmos would be focused on you.




SCENE 20

(Scott puts his pick-up in the garage, when he gets out, Margi rises from the back)

MARGI: You dont have to be alone tonight.

SCOTT: What are you doing?

MARGI: (closing in on Scott) The insensitivity to your pain way too much for me to bear. So I

(Scott closes garage door, just after Terri enters)

TERRI: What? So you what? So you blew me off so you could snatch same shoulder-time with rude-boy?

MARGI: (looks at spring) Back off Terri!

TERRI: Happy birthday, bitch. (spring flies to Scott)

MARGI: Right back at you!  (other spring flies through garage)

TERRI: Youre bleeding.

MARGI: So are you.

(they both look at the back of the garage, where Scott sinks to the floor, being pierced by the spring that still sticks in the wall)

MARGI: You killed him.

TERRI: What dyou mean, I killed him? You killed him.

MARGI: I didnt kill him.

(Terri has left, Margi kneels down besides Scotts body)




SCENE 21

(a dark road with a car, inside Scully and White, silent, suddenly they both gasp; a complete bird has splashed on the windshield. Scully stops, the road is filled with dead birds, people with lights are coming from the other direction)



SCENE 22

ZIRINKA: Ill let you fill in the amount.

MULDER: (filling in check when his phone rings) Mulder

MARGI: I know who the killer is. I know who did it all.

MULDER: Who is this?

MARGI: Margi Kleinjan.

MULDER: Where are you, Margi? Just tell me where you are




SCENE 21B

(the people with the light are much closer now, Scully and White look at them, Bob leads)

SCULLY: I dunno what you think youre doing, but I suggest you put that gun down, sir, or Im
gonna have to arrest you.

BOB: Were not standing around anymore, waiting for answers. Were taking this situation into our own hands.

SCULLY: You cant go walking down the middle of a street carrying a loaded weapon, it is against the law.

BOB: Not if Im hunting, its not. Hunting Satanists.

SCULLY: There are no Satanists here.

BOB: Then who killed those kids, and who killed all these birds.

TERRI: (comes running from behind Scully and White) Somebody, help me! I know who the killer is. I know who did it all. All the murders.




SCENE 23

(Mulder enters Scotts garage, sees Margi and Scott and the spring in the wall)

MULDER: Come on, Margi, lets get you out of here.

MARGI: She killed him.

MULDER: Who?

MARGI: Terri, she killed all of them.

MULDER: She killed all the high school boys.

MARGI: And Brenda Summerfield.

MULDER: How did she do it?




SCENE 21C

TERRI: I think shes possessed or something. She killed Scott Simic with a garage door spring. I dunno how she does it, I think she..

MARGI: I think shes evil. She tricked Boom into going up on that cliff, and then she pushed him off. And laughed about it, just like she did Eric Fowler the other night in the gym.

TERRI: When all the lights went out, and she knew that he was trapped under the blenches, she could hear him screaming and she wouldnt make it stop.

SCULLY: Why didnt you stop her Terri, why didnt you tell anybody?

TERRI: Because, because I was afraid of her, because she was my best friend. Best friends are supposed together, right?

SCULLY: (phone rings) Scully

MULDER: Scully, its me.

SCULLY: (oh great look on her face, gets in car) Where are you?

MULDER: Im at a crime scene, a new one. I think I have a solid lead on these deaths.

SCULLY: Im way ahead of you, Mulder. Ive got a suspect I wanna bring in.

MULDER: Whos that?

SCULLY: Margi Kleinjan.

MULDER: (walking out of Margis hearing range) (to Margi) Hold on a second (to Scully) Margi Kleinjan?

SCULLY: Thats right, her friend just gave us a statement.

MULDER: Actually, Im way ahead of you, Scully, because Im standing here with Margi Kleinjan and she just gave me a statement implicating her friend.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Terri.

SCULLY: Well, actually Im way ahead of you, Mulder, because Im with Terri right now.

MULDER: You what?

SCULLY: Ive got your suspect and youve got mine. Why does that make sense to me at this point?

MULDER: Look, Scully, I dont think this has anything to do with any cult. I wanna get them both in and get a formal statement and clear this thing up, okay?

SCULLY: (no reaction)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Sure, fine, whatever. (turns phone off)



SCENE 24
11:48 PM

(At the precinct, Mulder brings Margi in)

MULDER: Wait right here (starts walking away, then turns to ask:) Detective Whites cat?

MARGI: (affirms)

MULDER: (sighs and walks away, then hears sabre dance and looks at TV: the movie from the other night in the motel)

(Everything starts shaking, movie on every computer screen, furniture moves. Terri enters, followed by Scully.)

TERRI: Hé, girlfriend.

MARGI: Hé. (silence, shaking continues)

MULDER: (points at Margi) Get her outta here.

(all weapons fire, music continues, light fails. Mulder grabs Margi and takes her away, the further away she is the calmer the room gets. Mulder throws Margi in the first cell he can find. Terri follows)

TERRI: Out of my way!

(Mulder and Scully (who followed Terri) throw her with Margi in the cell, everything starts shaking.)

SCULLY: What the hell is going on here?

MULDER: Something cosmic.

(more shaking, Mulder looks at wall clock; at exactly 24:00 hours the shaking stops, Bob and group enter.)

MULDER/SCULLY: Put that gun down!

BOB: Where is she?

MULDER: Who?

BOB: The girl, the guilty one.

MULDER: Theyre both in here.

BOB: Well, I think wed like to see for ourselves. (Mulder stops him) (points gun at Mulder) I think were all tired of waiting for law-enforcement to bring about justice in our city.

WHITE: (works her way up front, stops Bob) Open the door.

MULDER: You dont wanna go in there.

WHITE: (walks to door, comes face-to-face with Scully.) Excuse me.

SCULLY: Gladly. (steps aside)

(White opens the door. Terri and Margi are sitting in a corner, crying. They all look at them)

MULDER: We are but visitors on this rock, hurling through time and space at sixty-six (Voice-only) thousand miles an hour. Tethered to a burning sphere by an invisible force and an unfathomable universe. This most of us take for granted while refusing to believe these forces have any more effect on us than a butterfly beating its wings halfway around the world. Or that two girls, born on the same date, the same time and the same place, might not find themselves the unfortunate focus of similar unseen forces. Converging like the planets themselves into burning pinpoints of cosmic energy, whose absolute gravity would threaten to swallow and consume everything in its path. Or maybe the answer lies even further from our grasp.

BOB: I think it was Satan.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other)

BOB: Yes, sir, Satan it was.

GROUP: Oh..




SCENE 25

(Mulder puts the bags in the trunk of the car. Scully is sitting in the drivers seat, adjusting the chair. Mulder gets in.)

SCULLY: You ready?

MULDER: Youre the driver.

(The car squeaks away)

(reaching the intersection, we see the sign)

Entering Comity The Perfect Harmony City
pop 38,825

MULDER: Eh, Scully, if Im not mistaken, were gonna be taking a left up here.

SCULLY: (no reaction)

MULDER: Eh, theres an intersection up here, youre gonna wanna

SCULLY: (no reaction)

MULDER: Scully! Youre gonna, wanna!

SCULLY: (no reaction, goes straight over intersection)

MULDER: You just. ran a stop sign back there, Scully.

SCULLY: Shut up, Mulder.

MULDER: Sure, fine, whatever.

[THE END]

                                          GROTESQUE



SCENE 1
GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY EXTENSION PROGRAM
WASHINGTON D.C.

(A male nude model poses for a class of night students. A sketch by one of the students is seen. Pretty good. There are many students and they are all sketching in various degrees of ability on canvas on easels. We see a short haired, twitchy man in the back sketching and looking at the model and sketching. The sketcher, John Mostow, is a man with a mission it seems as he digs the pencil into the canvas. He's definitely not sketching the hunk of man modeling. He's sketching a mean old gargoyle. His pencil breaks and he takes a knife to sharpen the tip. He cuts his finger. It doesn't faze him. He goes back to sketching and soon the gargoyle has a blood red left eye.)

TEACHER: All right everyone, we've run out of time.

(The teacher puts a blanket around the male model.)

TEACHER: That's right. We're finished. You'll have more time next week.

(The students and Mostow put their things away. Mostow hurries and puts his sketch in a portfolio and puts on his coat. He barrels to the door. In the process, knocks into one of the other students.)

MALE STUDENT: Hey, man!

MOSTOW: Excuse me.

(He goes out the door as the male model watches him.)

OUTSIDE

(Mostow walks outside. He pauses and walks/runs down the street and around the corner. The camera lifts up and we see a gargoyle on the building.)

ALLEY

(We see the male model, now dressed, going to his car parked in the alley. He hears a noise and looks down the alley. The only thing we see is steam escaping from a manhole. The man fumbles for his keys. We see the back of someone looking at him with a knife in his hand. He tries to put the key in the car door, but there's already a broken off key in the lock. He turns and is slashed. He screams.)



SCENE 2
MOSTOW'S APARTMENT 6:30 AM

(Mostow is in bed. The alarm goes off. He reaches a hand out to turn it off. He's trying to wake up. The door bursts open.)

FBI AGENT: FBI!!

(FBI agents enter the apartment with guns and flashlights. One of them holds up his badge.)

FBI AGENT: Don't move!

(Three of the agents charge to the bed and Mostow.)

FBI AGENT: John Mostow ... We have a warrant for your arrest. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right...

(They pull Mostow off the bed.)

FBI AGENT: Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law.

(Mostow screams as they put him on the floor. They try to handcuff him. Mostow has a hand on the floor and it drags back, fingernails scraping the floor. They stand him up.)

FBI AGENT: Do you understand these rights as they've been explained to you?

(We see the head FBI Agent, Agent Patterson, watching the proceedings.)

FBI AGENT: Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent?

(Mostow bites the hand of one of his captors, Nemhauser.)

NEMHAUSER: OH GOD! He bit me! The son of a bitch bit me like a dog!

(They lead Mostow away.)

FBI AGENT: Nemhauser, you okay?

NEMHAUSER: Yeah.

(They all leave except Patterson who looks at the surroundings. On the walls are literally hundreds of gargoyle sketchings. Patterson snaps on the latex.)

PATTERSON: My God...

(He takes one of the sketchings off the wall with his gloved hand. He looks around. He looks under the night table. He pulls out from under the bed Mostow's paint box. He fumbles through it. He finds the knife Mostow used in the studio to whittle the pencil. It has blood on it. Mostow's or the model's or both??)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE

(A mug shot of Mostow is on the slide projector screen.)

MULDER: (Voice over) He's an unemployed painter, divorced, no children. He came to the US from Uzbekistan during Perestroika. He failed to mention on his INS application that he spent the better part of his twenties in an insane asylum.

SCULLY: He was arrested last week for the murders of at least seven men.

MULDER: You thought all they produced were great hockey players. The crimes took place over a three year period. All the victims were male. Aged 17 to 25.

SCULLY: Was there a signature or a defining MO?

MULDER: Well, according to the ME there was no evidence of any sexual assault. Death was caused by massive blood loss due to facial mutilation. We also reported that the wound pattern on all the victims was identical. It's all there on page three.

(Scully reads.)

SCULLY: Both eyes punctured... signature gashes from the corners of the mouth to the ears.

(Mulder flips through slides of the victims.)

SCULLY: The level of violence and overkill here would suggest the work of a very angry individual.

MULDER: Or individuals, if you count the spirit Mostow says possessed him during the murders.

SCULLY: Well, possession is a common claim by criminals who have dissociative disorders. It's how they... distance themselves from their actions.

MULDER: That was the operational opinion until last night...

(Mulder flips the slide to another victim.)

MULDER: When a 19 year old male was found dead six miles from here with an identical set of facial wounds.

SCULLY: A copy cat?

MULDER: Well, according to Assistant Director Skinner, who asked us to look into this case, the details of the mutilations were never released. Only members of the crime team would have that information. And Mostow's been in custody for five days.



SCENE 4
D.C. CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
LORTON, VIRGINIA

(Mulder and Scully walk through the hall of the correctional facility. They get to Mostow's cell and it's opened for them. The light that shines into the dark cell hurts Mostow's eyes and he groans.)

MOSTOW: Please! The light hurts my eyes.

(Mulder and Scully enter the cell.)

MOSTOW: Leave me alone...

(Mostow is sitting on the floor against the wall.)

SCULLY: You have a nice soft bunk, sir. Why aren't you using it?

MULDER: Cuz he's been working.

(There are sketches in the cell.)

MULDER: Haven't you, John? What is it? What is this thing?

MOSTOW: It killed those men.

MULDER: Does it have a name? Does it have a name to go with that face?

MOSTOW: All men know its name.

MULDER: What do you call it? Satan? The devil?

SCULLY: Or maybe it's just the name of your accomplice.

MOSTOW: I had no accomplice.

SCULLY: You killed all those young men yourself?

MOSTOW: It killed them. How many times do I have to tell you?

SCULLY: Well, its fingerprints weren't on the murder weapon, yours were. And it won't be tried for seven murders under the death penalty.

MOSTOW: That is why it laughs at fools like you... (he looks at Mulder) And you... fools who would pretend evil can be brought to heel like a brindle bitch or be held by your pathetic gulags. While with a snap of its finger, it makes men lick the greasy floor of hell ... Just to see its reflection.

SCULLY: Is that was it did last night, John? Snapped its fingers and let another young man die?

MOSTOW: It killed again? Yesterday? It found somebody... just like it found me.

(The door opens and Mulder squints at the light.)

PATTERSON: Agent Mulder... Can I see you two outside?

HALLWAY

(Mulder and Scully join Agent Patterson and his men in the hallway.)

PATTERSON: So what is it, Mulder? Little green men, evil spirits, hounds of hell?

MULDER: Scully, this is Bill Patterson. He runs the investigative support unit out of Quantico.

SCULLY: Yes, I know. Behavioral Science... You wrote the book. It's a honor, sir.

PATTERSON: Is that what you think, too? That the suspect is possessed by some dark spirit?

SCULLY: No, not at all, sir.

PATTERSON: Funny company you keep then.

MULDER: That's what always amazed me about you, Bill. You never fit your own profile. No one would ever guess how really mean-spirited you are.

(Mulder starts to walk away.)

PATTERSON: The arrest of John Mostow...

(Mulder stops.)

PATTERSON: Resulted in three years of hard work by my unit. Three years... You can imagine we were awful upset by this latest murder. And by the suspect floating this possession theory.

MULDER: You think he's got an accomplice then. Even though your own profile of Mostow states that he's most certainly working alone.

PATTERSON: My profile led to his arrest. No, he acted alone. And that murder last night was done by a second killer, and he acted alone too.

MULDER: What about these drawings of Mostow's? The gargoyles?

PATTERSON: You know why he draws those? Did you ask him?

MULDER: I didn't get a chance to...

PATTERSON: He says he draws them to keep this demon of his away.

MULDER: Well, that would make sense. Historically, that's what gargoyles have been used for. To ward off evil spirits. Like on the eaves of buildings.

PATTERSON: Come on, Mulder. I don't need a history lesson. And I don't need anyone indulging this guy's story.

MULDER: I was asked to look into this case. If you've got a problem with that I suggest you take it up with AD Skinner.

(He walks away. Scully looks at Patterson and follows Mulder.)



SCENE 5
HALLWAY OUTSIDE MOSTOW'S APARTMENT

(Mulder and Scully are talking as they walk to Mostow's apartment door. It's a dark, damp, dingy place.)

SCULLY: You're not going to tell me when your love affair with Patterson ended?

MULDER: Patterson never liked me.

SCULLY: I thought you were considered his fair-haired boy when you joined the bureau.

MULDER: Not by Patterson.

SCULLY: Why not?

MULDER: Didn't want to get my knees dirty.

(They smile.)

MULDER: Couldn't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student.

SCULLY: You mean you couldn't worship him.

MULDER: Something like that. Yeah.

(They stop at his door. Mulder gets out the key.)

SCULLY: Well, from what I hear, there are a lot of men who did. A lot of men joined the FBI because they wanted to be him.

(Mulder rips the crime scene tape away from the door.)

MULDER: Yeah, Patterson had this thing about wanting to track a killer, to know an artist, you have to look at his art. It really meant, if you want to catch a monster, you have to become one yourself.

(They open the door and enter.)



SCENE 6
MOSTOW'S APARTMENT

(It's the same state as it was during the arrest. Mulder and Scully, with flashlights, look at the walls covered with gargoyle sketches.)

SCULLY: By the looks of this, I'd say that served him pretty well.

MULDER: This guy is definitely some kind of monster.

(Scully looks closely at a sketch and a cat loudly meows and leaps from a shelf above the sketch Scully was looking at. She is surprised and jumps against the wall. The cat runs.)

MULDER: It's just a cat...

SCULLY: I thought it was one of those pictures coming to life.

(She smiles, embarrassed.)

SCULLY: One of our guys must have locked it in here.

(Mulder stoops and sees a hole in the wall near the floor.)

MULDER: No. He obviously has his own key to the place.

(Mulder and Scully investigate the wall behind the sketches above the hole.)

MULDER: There's air coming through here. There could be something on the other side of the wall.

(They feel the wall. Scully finds a door frame.)

SCULLY: It's a door.

(They rip away the sketches until the doorframe is exposed. Mulder opens the door. He's going to go into the secret room.)

SCULLY: Why don't you wait until we can get some more light in here?

MULDER: I've got some light.

(He turns his flashlight on and enters the room. Scully, gun drawn, stays put.)



SCENE 7
SECRET ROOM

(The cat watches Mulder's feet enter the room.)

SCULLY: (off screen) See anything?

(Mulder looks around at the clay statues that fill the room.)

MULDER: More gargoyles, Scully. Lots of them. Sculpted in clay.

SCULLY: (off screen) Why would he keep them in a secret room?

(Mulder looks closely at one of them.)

SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder...

(He pulls at the clay face of the gargoyle statue.)

SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder, what is it?

(The clay falls away.)

SCULLY: (off screen) What do you see?

(A male with slashes from the mouth to the ears is under the clay to form the statue.)

SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder! Can you tell me what's going on in there?



SCENE 8
STUDIO - NIGHT

(A man is blowing glass. A shadow walks in. The glass blower notices someone in the studio and turns and is attacked as he screams in terror. He drops the glass.)



SCENE 9
HOSPITAL - GLASS BLOWER'S ROOM

(Scully is standing by the glass blower's bed. A doctor is with her.)

DOCTOR: I'm not too encouraged by what I've seen. The man is lucky to be alive.

(Patterson and Nemhauser walk in.)

PATTERSON: Thank you, doctor. Agent Scully...

SCULLY: We've turned the studio upside down and there doesn't seem to be any more bodies.

PATTERSON: How many were recovered?

SCULLY: Five. All of them dismembered, all of them young men whose faces were mutilated. Just like the latest victim here.

(She motions to the glass blower.)

PATTERSON: At least this one is still alive.

NEMHAUSER: Same signature mutilation right down to the choice of weapon by the look of it.

(Patterson leaves.)

SCULLY: What does Patterson have to say?

NEMHAUSER: I haven't spoken to him yet. But I bet he's going to come around to the idea that it's someone working directly with Mostow.

SCULLY: Well, I'd have to agree with that theory.

NEMHAUSER: What's Agent Mulder think?

SCULLY: He thinks our finding Mostow's secret gallery isn't going to do him any favors with Patterson.

NEMHAUSER: Well, between you and me, I think Patterson secretly went to Skinner and requested Mulder on this case.

SCULLY: He requested him?

NEMHAUSER: I've worked with Patterson for three years on this. And this just about killed him, until we finally got a break and arrested Mostow. Then this first copy cat murder... It threw him for a loss.

SCULLY: Mulder's under the impression that Patterson never thought too highly of hm.

NEMHAUSER: No. That's just Patterson. Late at night, with a few beers in him, he starts telling me Mulder stories. He's some kind of crack genius.

(Scully notices Nemhauser's hand.)

SCULLY: Stitches? What happened?

NEMHAUSER: Mostow. He bit me during the arrest.

(Patterson comes back in.)

PATTERSON: How's our victim? Has he been able to ID his attacker?

NEMHAUSER: Doctor says it's still too early to try.

PATTERSON: I'm not even sure he's going to make it.

(Patterson looks at the sleeping victim then at Scully.)

PATTERSON: Where's Mulder?

SCULLY: He was going to see what he could find out about these drawings of Mostow's.

PATTERSON: What's he looking for?

SCULLY: I think the same thing you are, sir. A second killer.

(The victim wakes and the heart monitor races. He's terrorized by the three standing by his bed. The doctor comes back in.)

DOCTOR: I think you should continue this conversation outside.

(They leave. The doctor tries to comfort the victim.)

DOCTOR: Stay with us.



SCENE 10
LIBRARY

(Mulder sits at a table alone with lots of books around him. First we hear his voice over and then see him. He's been there for a while.)

MULDER: The name is from the French "gargouille". The name of a medieval dragon that prowled the river Seine. Whose horrible image became the symbol of the soul of the condemned. Turned to stone. Or of the devils and demons of the underworld spared eternal damnation. The embodiment of the lesser forces of the universe who inspired dread, the threat of our own damnation. Ushers into hell or into the realm of our own dark fears and imagination. For over 1200 years, this grotesque image has found its expression in stone, clay, wood, oil and charcoal. Born again and again as if resurrecting itself by its own will through tortured human expression, almost as if it existed. Haunting men inwardly so that it may haunt mankind for eternity. As it must have haunted John Mostow. But what impulses moved it to kill? Could this be the same dark force at work? Its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh? Of the very hand that creates it? Is this evil something born in each of us? Crouching in the shadow of every human soul waiting to emerge? A monster waiting to violate our bodies and twist our will to do its bidding? Is this the monster called madness?

(Patterson appears behind Mulder, startling him.)

PATTERSON: They're closing up in a few minutes.

(He looks at the table, of the books and Mulder's own drawings.)

PATTERSON: So... is this how you're looking for the second killer? Really, Mulder. What do you expect to find here?

MULDER: I'm not sure yet.

PATTERSON: But you must have some idea. Some kind of theory.

MULDER: I have a few theories. I'm just trying to stitch them together right now.

PATTERSON: With your face stuck in a library book.

MULDER: You said it yourself. If you want to know the artist, look at the art. I'm finally agreeing with you.

PATTERSON: I know where you're going with this, Mulder. Because I've been there myself. So I can tell you you're wasting your time.

MULDER: Maybe you can also tell me why this man was compelled to sculpt and draw the same face again and again. Why he's still doing it now.

PATTERSON: Because he's insane.

(Patterson throws a hand to the papers on the desk.)

PATTERSON: This is the scrawling of a mad man.

MULDER: He said that this thing wants to see his own reflection.

PATTERSON: Mostow has said everything but what I need to hear. The name of his accomplice.

MULDER: Unless he's telling the truth.

PATTERSON: About being possessed? I have to tell you, I'm really disappointed in you.

MULDER: Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you by not disappointing you.

PATTERSON: After all this time I thought you finally put your feet back on the ground. Clearly, I was mistaken.



SCENE 11
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Scully enters Mulder's apartment.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, its me.

(It's dark. There are sketches of gargoyles all over the walls.)

SCULLY: Mulder?



SCENE 12
MOSTOW'S SECRET GALLERY

(Mulder looks at the sketchings. Becomes very focused. Starts working the clay into a gargoyle.)



SCENE 13
MOSTOW'S SECRET GALLERY 3:40 AM

(Mulder is asleep on the couch. He hears a noise. It's a man. Mulder runs after him. They run through the building. After Mulder goes up the fire escape, he's attacked, blind-sided. He's slashed on the side of the face. He screams.)



SCENE 14
LATER CRIME SCENE

(An EMT is putting a bandage on Mulder's cut. Scully is standing near.)

SCULLY: I was scared, Mulder. I didn't know where you were. I kept trying your cell phone but you didn't answer.

MULDER: It was turned off.

SCULLY: You turned your phone off? Why do you even bother carrying it?

EMT: We're all set. You ought to see a doctor some time, in case of infection.

(Mulder walks away, putting on his suit coat.)

SCULLY: (to EMT) Thanks.

EMT: Sure.

(She follows Mulder.)

SCULLY: You still haven't told what you were doing in Mostow's studio.

MULDER: I was working.

SCULLY: AT 3:30 in the morning? Mulder, I haven't seen or spoken to you in almost two days. You haven't been returning my calls--

MULDER: This thing exists, Scully. It's real.

SCULLY: It? What are you talking about?

MULDER: Whatever keeps killing those young men.

SCULLY: Mostow killed those men, Mulder, and out of some sick alliance some other person is continuing where he left off.

MULDER: Whoever attacked me wasn't a person.

SCULLY: Well, did you actually see it? Mulder, maybe you're seeing what you want to see.

MULDER: What makes you think I'd want to see that? I didn't imagine it, Scully.

SCULLY: Listen to yourself, Mulder. Listen to what you're saying. You're starting to sound like...

(Mulder is far ahead of her walking very fast.)

SCULLY: Look, when I couldn't reach you, I went to your apartment.

(They stop.)

SCULLY: I saw your new wallpaper. Don't you realize what is happening here, Mulder? He is testing you. He is the reason you were brought on this case in the first place.

MULDER: Patterson?

SCULLY: He requested your involvement through Skinner's office. I checked the 302 myself.

(Mulder gets in his car.)

SCULLY: (tired) Mulder... where are you going?

(He doesn't answer. Just shuts the door, turns on the engine and drives away. Scully sees Patterson, Nemhauser and another agent and she walks to them.)

PATTERSON: So, how's Mulder holding up?

SCULLY: Sir, can I have a minute?

PATTERSON: Of course.

SCULLY: In private?

(The others leave.)

PATTERSON: What's this about?

SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me... I'm curious about what you're doing concerning Agent Mulder.

PATTERSON: I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.

SCULLY: I think you do, sir. I think you knew exactly how Agent Mulder would respond when you brought him on this case. You did request him, didn't you?

PATTERSON: If you're concerned about Agent Mulder's conduct or behavior, maybe you should take that up with him.

SCULLY: You know I already have.

PATTERSON: Then what do you expect me to do?

SCULLY: I just want you to be honest with me about what you're trying to do. Is this some kind of a payback for what happened eight years ago? Because Mulder quit the ISU?

PATTERSON: My motivations aren't that petty.

SCULLY: Then why?

PATTERSON: I asked for Mulder because ... I want to close the book on this God-forsaken case once and for all.

SCULLY: And you knew that he could help you solve it.

PATTERSON: My advice to you, Scully... Let Mulder do what he needs on this case. Don't get in his way and don't try to hold him back, because you won't be able to.

(She walks back to her car. She sits in the driver's seat and thinks. She turns on the car. She sees something shiny in a tire of another car. She turns off the car and walks to the tire and pulls out a blade of an exacto knife, the murder weapon. She looks under the car and sees the other part of the blade.)



SCENE 15
MOSTOW'S CELL

(Mostow is sitting on the nice soft bunk as Mulder walks in. Mulder is not a happy camper.)

MULDER: Why didn't it kill me like it killed the others? Why did it let me live?

MOSTOW: I could never tell you why. You would not understand.

MULDER: Then help me understand, John.

MOSTOW: Please! Go away.

MULDER: No.... You have to help me go deeper. You have to help me get inside his head. Just how he got inside yours so I can find out what it wants.

MOSTOW: It knows what it wants.

MULDER: It wants to kill innocent young men by carving up their faces?

MOSTOW: You have felt its hunger... like your bones rattles by its frozen breath... So you know... nothing can be done.

MULDER: Unless I find it...

MOSTOW: Then what will you do?

MULDER: Just tell me how to find it, John.

(Mostow recoils.)

MOSTOW: No!

MULDER: Just tell me how to find this thing.

MOSTOW: You can't find it.

(Mulder slugs him and grabs his neck.)

MOSTOW: Only... It can find you...

(Mostow looks into Mulder's cold, dead eyes.)

MOSTOW: Maybe... it already has.



SCENE 16
FBI SCI-CRIME LAB - LATENT FINGERPRINT SECTION

(Scully and a technician are in the lab.)

TECHNICIAN: First time I struck out. All three pieces were clean. On my second try, I got lucky. I dusted it with redwop.

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

TECHNICIAN: Powder spelled backwards. It's what we call the flourescent light compodium.

(They look at the knife blade under blue light. The tech and Scully wear glasses.)

SCULLY: It looks like a partial index.

TECHNICIAN: On the left half of the handle, almost a full thumb. The placement of the prints struck me...

SCULLY: They're oriented how someone would have gripped the knife.

TECHNICIAN: Which is why I thought I had the guy. Except I wasn't as lucky as I thought. So I ran the prints against the NCIC data base.

SCULLY: Your message said that you identified them.

TECHNICIAN: We did. Turns out it's one of our own people.

SCULLY: An FBI agent?

TECHNICIAN: Your partner.

SCULLY: These are Mulder's prints?

TECHNICIAN: Yes.

SCULLY: Are you sure?

TECHNICIAN: I double checked. Why? I assumed he was the one who recovered the knife at the crime scene.

SCULLY: Excuse me.

(She leaves.)



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS EVIDENCE ROOM L-7

(A man leads her through the aisles between floor to ceiling bookshelves full of evidence. They stop and the guy pulls out a box.)

GUY: There's a table up front.

SCULLY: No, that's okay. You can just throw it on the floor.

(A phone rings.)

GUY: I need to get that.

(He puts the box on the floor and walks away. Scully looks through the box and sees the knife in an evidence bag.)

GUY: (answers the phone off screen) Evidence....

(On the side of the bag is a chain of evidence log.)

GUY: (off screen) Yes, she is.

(The knife had been checked out by Mulder. The guy comes back.)

GUY: Agent Scully? Assistant Director Skinner has asked to see you right away.

(Scully puts the knife bag back in the box and leaves.)



SCENE 18
SKINNER'S OFFICE

(Skinner is at his desk. There's a knock on the door.)

SKINNER: Come in.

(Scully enters and walks to the desk.)

SCULLY: You wanted to see me, sir?

SKINNER: Yes. Sit down.

(She does.)

SKINNER: I heard they found you in evidence. I assume you were looking for the murder weapon in this Mostow case?

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Did you find it?

SCULLY: No, sir.

SKINNER: Is it your opinion that missing evidence is the same weapon you recovered at a crime scene today?

SCULLY: I'm not altogether certain.

SKINNER: But Agent Mulder's prints were found on it.

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Have you seen Agent Mulder or spoken to him about this?

SCULLY: No, sir.

SKINNER: Do you have any insight into Agent Mulder's current disposition of his mental state?

SCULLY: I know Agent Mulder is working very hard on this case at your request, sir.

SKINNER: Are you worried about him, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: No... sir.

SKINNER: Off the record.

(Scully doesn't answer, but the sadness and resignation on her face says it all.)

SKINNER: So am I.



SCENE 19
MOSTOW'S SECRET GALLERY

(Mulder walks through the room and the clay gargoyles with his flashlight. He's attacked but Mulder's able to fend him off. Mulder then slashes the attacker. The attacker screams.)



SCENE 20
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(It's a dream. He wakes up and he's in his own apartment. He leaves.)



SCENE 21
STREET

(A car goes through an alley and parks.)



SCENE 22
MOSTOW'S BUILDING

(Mulder walks to the apartment and to the secret room.)



SCENE 23
MOSTOW'S SECRET GALLERY

(Mulder shines his flashlight on the gargoyles. He sees the cat and a fresh pool of blood. And a body.)



SCENE 24
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(She checks her messages.)

NEMHAUSER: (on machine) Yeah... this is Craig Nemhauser... Please call me right away at 555-0143. I need to talk to you right away about a possible ...

(Scully shuts off the machine and dials Nemhauser's number.)



SCENE 25
MOSTOW'S SECRET ROOM

(Mulder hears the phone and follows the ring to it. He answers it.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I'm at Mostow's studio.

SCULLY: Are you with Nemhauser?

MULDER: No. Should I be?

SCULLY: Well, that's who I was calling. He left this number on my answering machine. He said he had to talk to me.

(Pause as Mulder looks around the studio.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Do you know where he is?

MULDER: I'm not sure.

SCULLY: Mulder, that knife that we recovered at the crime scene, I think it's the same one that Mostow used.

MULDER: What makes you say that?

SCULLY: Because Mostow's was stolen from evidence.

MULDER: When?

SCULLY: I was hoping you could tell me. Your prints were all over it.

MULDER: Yeah. I examined Mostow's knife yesterday in the evidence room.

SCULLY: Why?

(Mulder looks at one of the fresh gargoyles.)

MULDER: Because I wanted to hold it. Wanted to see what it felt like in my hand.

SCULLY: Yeah, but why?

MULDER: Look... Scully, I didn't take it.

SCULLY: Okay, Mulder. Listen to me carefully. I want you to stay exactly where you are. I'm going to be there in a few minutes and we're going to work this thing out together. Okay? Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

(He pushes the end button on the phone. He looks closely at the gargoyle. He pulls away the face. Nemhauser with slashes is under the clay. Mulder hears footsteps and points his gun at the noise. It's Patterson.)

PATTERSON: Mulder...

MULDER: What are you doing here?

PATTERSON: What are you doing here?

(Mulder motions with his head at the body.)

MULDER: It's Nemhauser.

(Patterson walks closer. Mulder looks Patterson over.)

MULDER: But you already knew that, didn't you? You killed him, Bill. When he suspected it was you... You killed him.

PATTERSON: Are you out of your mind?

MULDER: Not me. Not now.

PATTERSON: Put that gun down.

MULDER: Not until you tell me what you're doing here.

PATTERSON: What I'm doing here!

MULDER: Look at your hands.

(They're encrusted with clay.)

MULDER: Now ask yourself what you're doing here.

PATTERSON: I'm not sure.

MULDER: You're here because John Mostow stole three years of your life. Every day and every night for three years you lived and breathed the horror show that was in his head and I'm sorry... imagining everything that he imagined. Sinking deeper and deeper into the ugliness that you taught us to do. When you finally caught him, it didn't just go away, and the violence... it stayed alive inside you ... til it had to come out. You didn't want to do what you were doing. You wanted to stop but you couldn't. Not by yourself. That's why you called on me in the first place, why you couldn't kill me when you had the chance.

SCULLY: Mulder! What the hell are you doing?

(Scully shows up behind Patterson with her flashlight blazing.)

MULDER: Scully, get that light off me!

SCULLY: First, put the gun down.

MULDER: You don't understand!

SCULLY: Help me understand why you have a gun on Agent Patterson!

(Patterson knocks Scully over on his way out of the room. Mulder picks her up.)

MULDER: It's him, Scully.

(They run after him through the building. Patterson is a raving loony.)



SCENE 26
ROOF

(They get to the roof and Mulder and Scully separate. Mulder gets startled by a flock of birds. He climbs to another building's roof. He's attacked by Patterson. Patterson tries to strangle Mulder. Mulder tries to get him off. Awful guttural noises come from Patterson. A shot rings out.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(She runs over. Patterson is shot.)

SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?

(Mulder is sitting up and Patterson is face down on the roof. She turns Patterson over.)

SCULLY: We should call an ambulance. His pulse is still strong.

(Mulder gets out his cell phone. He has to turn it on before dialing 911. There is a gargoyle on the building watching over the scene. Scully opens Patterson's collar.)

MULDER: This is Agent Mulder FBI. There's a man down... gunshot wound.



SCENE 27
8 WEEKS LATER
CELL

(In the same place Mostow is held, we hear a lunatic screaming.)

PATTERSON: (off screen) Oh, God!

(He's crying. Patterson thrusts himself to the bars.)

PATTERSON: Are you listening to me? For God's sakes! Is someone listening to me?! I didn't do it! It wasn't me! I didn't kill them! Please!!

(His cries echo as the screen goes black. We hear Mulder's voice over.)

MULDER: We work in the dark. We do what we can to battle the evil that would otherwise destroy us.

(We see the gargoyle sketch from the beginning with the red eye hanging on a cell wall.)

MULDER: But if a man's character is his fate, it's not a choice but a calling. Sometimes the weight of this burden causes us to falter. From the fragile fortress of our mind. Allowing the monster without to turn within. We are left alone staring into the abyss. Into the laughing face of madness.

[THE END]

                                                PIPER MARU


SCENE 1
PACIFIC OCEAN
LATITUDE 42 DEG NORTH
LONGITUDE 171 DEG EAST

(Several men are on an ocean vessel preparing to send a man, GAUTHIER, down in a deep sea dive suit. They are speaking French. ENGINEER #1 is giving directions to the other men while inspecting the suit.)

ENGINEER #1: [Ready for the dome. Let's go, let's go. Are the oxygen tanks ready? How is the oxygen pressure? Is the oxygen at 20.8?]

GAUTHIER: [20.8 Check set.]

ENGINEER #1: [Are you ready for the dome?]

GAUTHIER: [Yes.]

ENGINEER #1: [Close it... tighten it up.]

(Gauthier, in dive suit, is hoisted by a crane and lowered into the water.)

ENGINEER #1: [Cable detached. He's solo.]

(Gauthier descends into the depths of the ocean.)

(Crew monitors Gauthier's descent on ship's computers.)

ENGINEER #1: [Water temp is 2 degrees. Surge is negligible.]

ENGINEER #2: [Two hundred and seventy meters.]

GAUTHIER: [I should be close to the bottom.]

ENGINEER #1: [We're picking up some radiation.]

(View changes to Gauthier's dive suit camera.)

ENGINEER #1: [A strong reading, Gauthier.]

GAUTHIER: [Maybe this thing's right down below me.]

ENGINEER #2: [After three months, to find the needle in the haystack now...]

(Gauthier continues to descend. A World War II era P-51 Mustang airplane is resting on the ocean floor. Gauthier's camera continues to transmit the live image of the airplane to the ship.)

GAUTHIER: [Are you seeing this up there?]

ENGINEER #1: [We see something. What is it, Gauthier?]

(Gauthier scans the ship with his flashlight. The flashlight highlights the airplane's call number JTTO 111470.)

GAUTHIER: [I think it's one of the squadron.]

(Gauthier's flashlight highlights the saying "DROP DEAD RED" on the airplane's body.)

GAUTHIER: (A banging sound occurs.) [Do you hear that?]

ENGINEER #1: [We hear it. What is it?]

GAUTHIER: [I don't know.]

(Gauthier's camera loses its connection.)

ENGINEER #1: [We're losing him! Try a different frequency!]

ENGINEER #2: [Gauthier? Gauthier? Gauthier!? We've lost contact. Gauthier!?]

(Banging sound continues as Gauthier studies the airplane. Gauthier sees a young man in the cockpit of the airplane, banging on the window and yelling. The young man stares blankly and blinks. The black oil passes over his eyes. Gauthier looks on in horror.)

(View of the ship at night. Gauthier rises to the surface.)

ENGINEER #1: [Wait a minute! There he is!]

ENGINEER #2: [All hands activate the winch.]

(Gauthier is hoisted by the winch back onto the ship.)

ENGINEER #1: [Quickly - open the mask and get him out!]

(ENGINEER #1 passes his hand over the dive suit, seemingly puzzled by something.)

ENGINEER #2: (Dive suit dome is removed.) [Are you all right, Gauthier?]

GAUTHIER: [Yes. I think so.]

ENGINEER #1: [What happened down there?]

GAUTHIER: [I don't know. I became disoriented.]

ENGINEER #1: [We lost all contact.]

ENGINEER #2: [Are you sure you're okay?]

GAUTHIER: [Yes. Yes. Just help me out of the suit.]

(Gauthier stares straight ahead and blinks. The black oil passes over his eyes.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON DC

(Scully walks out of an elevator, reading a folder)
(a door in the alleyway opens behind her, it's Skinner)

SKINNER: Agent Scully? Can I see you for a few minutes?

(Scully enters his office)

(Skinner's office)

SKINNER: Kimberly would you excuse us please?

KIMBERLY (THE SECRETARY): Certainly sir.

(Kimberly stands up and walks out the office)
(Skinner and Scully are both standing)

SKINNER: A memo came across my desk last night. I debated whether or not to call you at home but I decided to..

SCULLY: And it concerns me?

SKINNER: Yes, and your sister. It's been 5 months and there have been no leads or new evidence on her murder investigation by the DC police team or the Bureau. I've been told the case is to remain inactive until further notice.

SCULLY: I see.

SKINNER: I don't think there's anything to be read into this. I think it's a case of manpower and workload. I want you to know that I am going to appeal this decision and I am gonna go back over all the evidence again myself and make sure that nothing has been overlooked.

(Scully walks towards the door, and turns back)

SCULLY: You know, it's strange. Men can blow up buildings, and they can be nowhere near the crime scene but we can piece together the evidence and convict them beyond a doubt. Our labs here can recreate out of the most microscopic detail the motivation and circumstance to almost any murder, right down to a killer's attitude towards his mother and that he was a bed wetter. But in a case of a woman, my sister, who was gunned down in cold blood in a well-lit apartment building by a shooter who left the weapon at the crime scene, we can't even put together enough to keep anybody interested.

SKINNER: I don't think this has anything to do with interest.

SCULLY: If I may say so sir, it has everything to do with interest. Just not yours, and not mine.

(Scully turns back, opens the door and walks out the office)



SCENE 3
(Mulder's office)
(knocking)

MULDER: Yeah?

(Scully enters)

SCULLY: Sorry I'm late.

MULDER: Anything up?

SCULLY: No. It's nothing. What did you want to talk to me about?

MULDER: Something interesting came into my attention last night. A French salvage ship, the Piper Maru, limped into port in San Diego yesterday, all the way from the north Pacific.

SCULLY: Why is that of interest?

MULDER: Using the national weather service satellite system, I was able to track its course. This was its original position.

SCULLY: Longitude uh.. 171 east, latitude 42 north.

MULDER: Yeah, that's where the boat we know as The Talapus pulled up what you believe was a Russian sub, but what I believe was the remains of a UFO.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Look Scully, I don't know what it is but something is still down there and now the French are looking for it too.

SCULLY: So what?

MULDER: So why all the attention paid to this site? What information are they acting on?

SCULLY: Why don't you just ask them?

MULDER: I would but the entire crew is being treated for radiation burns.

SCULLY: From exposure to what?

MULDER: The French government is keeping that information classified for some reason.

SCULLY: Could it have anything to do with their resumption in nuclear tests?

MULDER: I checked. It's thousands of miles away from any test sites. (Scully smiles and laughs) What?

SCULLY: I'm just constantly amazed by you.. you're working down here in the basement, sifting through files and transmissions that any other agent would just throw away in the garbage.

MULDER: Well that's why I'm in the basement Scully.

SCULLY: You're in the basement because they're afraid of you, of your relentlessness and because they know that they could drop you in the middle of the desert, and tell you the truth is out there, and you would ask them for a shovel!

MULDER: Is that what you think of me?

SCULLY: Well, maybe not a shovel. Maybe a backhoe.

MULDER: Well that's good because there's some garbage in San Diego I want you to help me dig through.

(Scully takes the flight ticket Mulder hands her)



SCENE 4
SAN DIEGO NAVAL HOSPITAL, CA
(in a room full of patients with burns, a doctor standing is writing a report)

MULDER: Dr Seizer?

DR: Yes?

MULDER: Special agent Mulder. This is agent Scully.

DR: You're here about these French sailors with the radiation exposure?

MULDER: Yeah, how are they doing?

DR: Not real good. (Scully looks over the patients) It's been difficult to determine a proper course of treatment, because there's an air of secrecy around what happened. The source of their exposure is still undetermined.

SCULLY: These symptoms, would you characterize then as acute or somatic? (Dr Seizer is confused) I'm a medical doctor.

DR: They're somatic, although I don't think we've seen the worst of it. The effects are degrading rapidly, spontaneous internal bleeding in the mouths and intestinal tracts (Mulder looks around), blood in the urine. All these men are suffering severe delirium, the pre-advanced stages of coma.

SCULLY: What kind of exposure are we talking about here?

DR: 200, maybe 400 Roentgens, with a high rate of absorption.

SCULLY: That's verging on the levels of victims of Hiroshima suffered.

DR: Whatever these men came in contact with, it was man-made, levels like this just don't appear in nature.

MULDER: Not on this planet.

SCULLY: Did you get the chance to talk to any of them?

DR: No, they were in pretty bad shape by the time they got to me, except for one man, and this was strange because he's the only one who seems to be completely unaffected. I held him for the 1st day, but I detected none of the symptoms of the others. His leukocytes and erythocytes were high. Actually, he was in very good health.

MULDER: How could that be? With that level of radiation, how could one man not be exposed?

DR: Doesn't make any sense, but it's lucky for these men because he was the one who piloted the boat in. And none of these men could've done that in their condition.

MULDER: Could it be possible for us to talk to him?

DR: You could if he was still here, but he discharged himself this morning. He's a Frenchman, has a San Francisco address, his name is Gauthier.



SCENE 5
PACIFIC HEIGHTS
SAN FRANCISCO, CA
(a man enter house #64, looking around, looking at a picture of himself and a woman.. the phone rings, he doesn't answer and continues to look around)



SCENE 6
US NAVAL STATION
SAN DIEGO, CA
(on the Piper Maru, people in yellow isolation suits take off their masks and get off the ship)

A MAN'S VOICE: Ok let's wrap it up and get in the trucks.

(Mulder and Scully arrive in their car)

Scully (with her cell phone): I'm getting no answer at this man Gauthier's home number.

MULDER: Try the INS or the French Consulate, see what you can pull up on him.

Scully (talking on the phone): Yes can I have the number for the French Consulate please?

(A man in blue approaches)

MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.

MAN: I'm Wayne Morgan. I'm with the uh Navy's investigative services unit.

MULDER: Have you turned anything up?

MORGAN: No nothing, but I'm not exactly sure what I'm supposed to be looking for.

MULDER: The crew of this ship is being treated for radiation.

MORGAN: Yeah we got all that, we had hazmat team poring over the boat, didn't find a trace.

SCULLY: Nothing?

MORGAN: We have divers in the water going over the hull, put probes down the bilge. Couldn't detect the slightest level.

MULDER: So it's ok for us to go on board?

MORGAN: Sure, you'll probably get more radiation off your cell phone.

ON THE BOAT
(the lights are out)
(Mulder, alone, looks around with his flashlight, he takes a look at a dive suit, there is some sort of oil all over it. He notices the suit is equipped with a video camera)
(Scully, on her side, looks at a charted map with Zeus Faber written at the bottom of it with a marker)
(lights are back on)

MORGAN TO SCULLY: Generator's back, is that better?

SCULLY: Yeah, thanks. Is this the way you found this room?

MORGAN: Nothing's been touched, not since you've been tied up here anyway. (Mulder enters) It's a mess huh?

MULDER: Feels like home.

SCULLY: It feels like somebody was looking for something, any idea what?

MULDER: No, I'm looking for the vcr.

SCULLY: What for?

MULDER: The dive suit has a video camera.

(Mulder finds the vcr, switches on a monitor, and browses through the tape)

MORGAN: What the hell is that?

MULDER: Looks like the fuselage of a plane.

SCULLY: It's a North American P-51 Mustang.

MORGAN: Yeah it sure is.

MULDER: I just got very turned on.

SCULLY: It's the shape of the canopy. I used to watch my father and brothers put together World War II model planes as a kid.

(Mulder passes drawing "Drop Dead Red")

MULDER: Would it have been carrying anything radioactive?

(Mulder stops on call numbers JTT0 11470)

SCULLY: No it was just a fighter.

MULDER: Then what was it those men exposed to?

SCULLY: I don't know, but I might know somebody I can ask.



SCENE 7
GAUTHIER'S HOUSE
(Gauthier's looking all over his files and documents in the drawers of his desk)
(he finds a letter, opens it and reads it)

WOMAN'S VOICE: You're home! (it's his wife) I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me? (she comes and hugs the man but he has no reaction) There were these men from the consulate, they said there've been an accident...Why aren't you answering me? (she gets scared when she sees the guy has been going through his own papers) Why aren't you answering me?

(she runs, and tries to flee but Gauthier gets to her and he has some dark glow in his eyes) (next, the woman gets out of the house and she now has the thing in her eyes)



SCENE 8
MIRAMAR NAVAL AIR STATION
(SCULLY ARRIVES IN A BLUE CAR AT A CHECK POINT)

SCULLY: Hi, I'm here to see Commander Johansen.

MILITARY: Name please?

SCULLY: Special agent Dana Scully, FBI. (she shows her ID)

MILITARY: You have an appointment?

SCULLY: No, uh.. he used to be a friend of my father's. I'm out here from Washington and I wanted to surprise him.

MILITARY: Let me give you directions.

SCULLY: I know my way, thanks.

(as Scully is driving, she sees kid playing, in particular 2 girls...then she flashes back her and her sister playing the same game)



SCENE 9
SAN FRANCISCO, CA
(Mulder knocks at Gauthier's door, with #64 on it)

MULDER: Mr Gauthier? Mr Gauthier? open the door, it's the FBI.
(Mulder opens door, it's unlocked, he enters) Mr Gauthier?

(he looks at the picture, looks around, notices the mess at the desk)
(Mulder finds a letter in French with the reference JTT0 111470)
(then he looks for the envelope return address, because the top of the letter is torn, and he finds it, the address is J. Kallenchuk Salvage Brokers, 3702 Medlock Street, San Francisco, CA 94101. We can also see the 1st name of Gauthier: Bernard, and part of his address: Number 3215, his zip code being either 94161 or 94164)
(Mulder puts the envelope in this coat and then, there's a sound coming from the kitchen, he draws his gun)
(Gauthier is lying on the kitchen, with oil all over him like on the dive suit)

MULDER: Mr Gauthier? I want you to lie still. I'm with the FBI. What happened?

GAUTHIER: Just fall, I don't know.

MULDER: How did you get here?

GAUTHIER: I can't remember. I was on the boat.

MULDER: The Piper Maru? That's the last thing you remember?

GAUTHIER: Yes, I was on the dive.

MULDER: Do you know where you are?

GAUTHIER: I'm at home.

MULDER: Yeah.

GAUTHIER: Where's my wife?

MULDER: Nobody else's home, but somebody has been going over your papers.

GAUTHIER: Where's Joan?

MULDER: She's not here, look.. you need to be careful, you have some kind of oil all over you?

GAUTHIER: What's going on here?

MULDER: I want you to remain calm, ok? I'd like to ask you a few questions about a letter. About a J. Kallenchuk Salvage Brokers.

GAUTHIER: I don't recognize that name.

MULDER: Well, somebody did. And I think you know why.

GAUTHIER: I would like to speak with the French Consul General. I have nothing more to say.



SCENE 10
BASE

Woman (to Scully): He'll be right out.

(shortly after)

OLD MAN: Yes?

SCULLY: Commander Johansen?

JOHANSEN: Yes?

SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I used to live 3 doors down. My father was Captain William Scully. I went to school with your son..

JOHANSEN: I'm sorry.. my memory isn't quite what it used to be. Richard doesn't live here anymore.

SCULLY: Actually sir, I came to see you. I work for the FBI now and there's a question I'm hoping you can answer.

JOHANSEN: Um.. well would you come in. Do sit down.

SCULLY: Thank you.

JOHANSEN: Would you like something to drink?

SCULLY: No thank you. I know that you were an officer in the Pacific during World War II. I wanted to ask you about a plane that's been discovered.

JOHANSEN: Discovered?

SCULLY: Yes, a P-51 Mustang at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean (Scully looks at her notes..) with the uh..call numbers JTT0 111470.

JOHANSEN: Well those are not the call numbers of a P-51.

SCULLY: There was an illustration on the fuselage with the words "Drop Dead Red".

JOHANSEN: I'm .. sorry.

SCULLY: Would the words Zeus Faber mean anything to you?

JOHANSEN: No.. but as I said, sometimes my memory is not so sharp.

SCULLY: Well would you know anybody I might be able to talk to? Somebody who might be able to give me that information?

JOHANSEN: I wish I could help you.

SCULLY: I wish you could too. There's a number of French sailors who may die from radiation exposure. If we knew more about the plane, we might be able to understand why. Anyway.. it was very good to see you again sir.

(they stand up and shake hands)

JOHANSEN: Oh say hello to your father for me.

SCULLY: I wish I could, he's passed away.

JOHANSEN: I'm very sorry.

SCULLY: I have to say this place brings back memories for me. I remember all the kids used to play a game called beckons wanted, right out there. Well.. if you talk to your son, will you tell him I stopped by? (Johansen nods) Thank you. (she walks out the house)



SCENE 11
3702 MEDLOCK STREET
SAN FRANCISCO, CA
(a woman is looking into files)
(knock on door)

WOMAN: Who is it?

MULDER: My name is Mulder, I'm with the FBI.

(she closes back all the drawers, and put the files she's holding an attache, and locks it)
(she sits at her desk)

WOMAN: It's open. (Mulder enters) Can I help you?

MULDER: I'm looking for Mr Kallenchuk.

WOMAN: I'm sorry Mr Kallenchuk is out of town, perhaps I can help you with something?

MULDER: Maybe you can tell me where I could find him.

WOMAN: Sure, the Far East. (she puts her hand on a gun under the desk)

MULDER: Well I've got a letter here typed on his stationary. Maybe you typed it for him.

WOMAN: Sorry I don't type. What did you say your name was again?

MULDER: Mulder.

WOMAN: Mr Mulder I'd be happy to relay any messages you have for him, but I really have no way of contacting Mr Kallenchuk just now.

MULDER: Ok well, why don't you have him call me as soon as he can. (Mulder hands her his card)

WOMAN: Sure, the FBI.

MULDER: Yes, what did you say your name was?

WOMAN: Geraldine.

MULDER: Thank you Geraldine. (Mulder leaves)

(outside, Mulder lay lows in his car parked in front of the Kallenchuk office)
(3 cars arrive, with French MIBs in them, they bust in the office, Geraldine drives away using the back door, Mulder follows her)



SCENE 12

THE BASE
(Scully approaches the check point, she's about to leave the base but she's stopped)

MILITARY: Agent Scully, would you step off the car please?

SCULLY: Why?

MILITARY: Turn off your engine and step off the car please.

SCULLY: What's this about?

MILITARY: You're being detained .

(another car arrives with Johansen in it, he gets out of it and makes a sign to the guard, he gets in
Scully's car)

JOHANSEN: Pull over there.

(Scully acts as she's told)

SCULLY: What's going on?

JOHANSEN: I can't give your regards to my son, Miss Scully, he was killed in a training accident during the Gulf War.

SCULLY: I'm sorry...there's something else, isn't there?

JOHANSEN: We bury our dead alive, don't we?

SCULLY: I don't know if I understand.

JOHANSEN: We hear them everyday, they talk to us, they haunt us, they beg us for meaning. Conscience... it's just the voices of the dead.. trying to save us from our own damnation.

SCULLY: You know something about that plane don't you?

JOHANSEN: I know because, I was sent to find it.. as an officer in a submarine, called the Zeus Faber.



SCENE 13
SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
(Geraldine picks up a flight ticket at a desk under a sign : Hong Kong, flight 621)
(Mulder keeps an eye on her, his phone rings)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me, where are you?

MULDER: San Francisco airport, where are you?

SCULLY: Miramar Airbase. I think I've just found out what those men were exposed to, what the Piper Maru was out there looking for.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: That P-51 Mustang was part of an escort for a B-20 carrying an atomic bomb, just like the one we dropped on Hiroshima. Only this one never reached its target.

MULDER: Says who?

SCULLY: Says one of the men originally sent to find it, on a submarine called the Zeus Faber.

MULDER: That was the name we saw written on that dive chart right?

SCULLY: It all makes sense Mulder, why would they build a nuclear weapon when they can salvage one?

MULDER: Why if they knew about it, why wait 50 years to try to recover it? And why was the only person not exposed, the diver, sent down to find it.

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Why don't you try to find out?

SCULLY: What about you?

MULDER: I gotta go to Hong Kong.

SCULLY: Hong Kong?

MULDER: Yeah, look, uh..(going into the gate) I'm gonna miss my flight, so uh... I gotta call you back ok?

(Joan, Gauthier's wife, is behind Mulder, and she follows him)



SCENE 14
WASHINGTON DC
(IN A RESTAURANT, STREET NUMBER 3205)
(the restaurant is empty except for Skinner who is drinking coffee and reading the menu)
(3 MIBs enter)

WAITRESS: Hi.

(MIB#1 sits in front of Skinner, MIB#2 sits besides him, and MIB#3 stands still)

MIB#1: Anything good here? Anything not on the menu?

SKINNER: You'll have to ask the waitress. (the 3 MIBs stare at Skinner) You gentleman have a problem?

MIB#1: When something is not on the menu Mr Skinner, there's usually a reason, wouldn't you say?

SKINNER: I'm sorry I didn't came here for conversation.

MIB#2: A hierarchy exists in the FBI, isn't that right? A man has status, like yourself, you're assistant director, those under him obey his orders, right?

SKINNER: Who are you guys?

MIB#1: We work with the intelligence community.

SKINNER: Remind me not to move there.

(Skinner stands up, and grabs his coat)
(MIB#1 and MIB#2 stand up also)

MIB#1: You take your orders like those below you, Mr Skinner. A case is made inactive, the death of an FBI agent's sister, maybe that's because those above you have done the hard work of arriving at that decision.

SKINNER: Thanks for the enlightenment, I'm gonna go now. (Skinner walks away)

MIB#1: It helps to know these things when a man looks forward to his career, to his plan for future.



SCENE 15
BASE
(a black and white picture with sailors on it)

JOHANSEN: We'd all joined thinking we'd come home heroes. That's me. (points at his face on the picture) The rest of the men of the picture...a month later they were all dead. The madness we planned to unleash on the Japanese...we ended up setting it loose on ourselves.

SCULLY: Radiation killed all those men?

JOHANSEN: The men you say had burns on their bodies.. that's how it began with us. Awful burns.

(flashback in black and white of what happened)

Johansen (voice over): We'd found the sunken squadron, when a Japanese destroyer moved into the area.. but rather than attempt to return home, Captain Sanford ordered us to go to silent running. After 3 days the burns started to appear. Baker got them first, then Vorce and Innocenti. No one had seen burns like these before. But a lot of us began to suspect they had to do with the planes that we'd been sent to recover. The men were all frightened to die. As the X.O. I urged the captain to return to port but against all reason and good sense, he refused to leave the area.

(in the sub)

MAN: Captain Sanford, I'm not an MD but I know a lost cause when I see one, these men are all dying and there's nothing that I can do to stop it.

SANFORD: Just do your damn job.

MAN: Sir I'm trying, but if we stay down here any longer, none of us are going home.

(later)

MAN (WHISPERING): Johansen, you've gotta get us to the surface .

JOHANSEN: We are under the captain's orders.

MAN: He's losing his mind.

JOHANSEN: The Japanese are shadowing us. That destroyer is doing wide circles above our position.

MAN: You have to take control of this sub sir, you have to make a decision.

ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE: We're all gonna die!

(Johansen and the man rush to see what's happening)
(in the room with all the sick people, one of them is holding a gun)

All of us, we're dying, can't you all see that? You've gotta get us outta here (speaking to the captain)

(he fires but the captain manages to disarm him) (Johansen and the man arrives)

Johansen (voice over): Our silence had been shattered by the gunshot, the only command that could save us from the Japanese destroyer now was the command to return home, an order I knew the captain would never issue..

(Johansen locks the door, and the captain with all the sick people)

SANFORD: Johansen! Open this door! Open this door! Johansen!

JOHANSEN (VOICE OVER): I knew mutiny was our only chance for survival. But I also knew, by sealing that door, I was sealing the fate of the men I locked behind it.

(Sanford has the thing in his eyes, and all the other crew men in the medical room are afraid)
(back to now)

JOHANSEN: By luck, or the grace of God, we made it to Pearl Harbor.

SCULLY: What happened to Sanford and the sick crew men?

JOHANSEN: When they opened that door, those who weren't dead were dying. There were 144 men on that boat, only 7 of us had survived. Whatever killed then, I was allowed to live, to raise a family, to grow old. None of us never got an explanation why.



SCENE 16
HONG KONG
(in a restaurant, Geraldine is having Chinese food with chopsticks)
(Mulder joins her table)

MULDER: Is this seat taken Miss Kallenchuk? Geraldine Kallenchuk, isn't it?

GERALDINE: Jerry, with a J.

MULDER: I noticed you flew 1st class, must be good money selling classified government secrets.

GERALDINE: It's a bull market, hon, and I'm Miss Popular. Let's make a deal.

MULDER: How much for the location of that P-51 Mustang you sold the French government?

GERALDINE: Why should I tell you?

MULDER: Actually I'd rather know who sold you the secret.

GERALDINE: I'm a middle man Mr Mulder, pardon my gender type. I take a cut, then slice off the top. It would be bad business to divulge my sources.

MULDER: Why did you run off to Hong Kong?

GERALDINE: To meet the buyer.

MULDER: To sell him what?

GERALDINE: Pardon your gender type.

MULDER: Oh your buyer's a woman.

GERALDINE: Actually you know, it's none of your damn business.

MULDER: Actually you know it is my damn business because whatever you're selling is killing half a dozen sailors in a California Hospital. Which is why I'm gonna arrest you.

GERALDINE: Arrest me? With what? Your chopsticks? This is Hong Kong Mr Mulder, they don't allow handguns here, they took yours away.. at the airport. (Mulder cuffs the woman to himself) Hey! Hey! You can't do that!

MULDER: I just did it, now let's make a deal.

(Mulder makes Geraldine stand up and they get out of the restaurant)

(they walk now down a dark corridor)

GERALDINE: You are violating my civil rights.

MULDER: You gave up your civil rights when you committed treason.

GERALDINE: You can't force me to do anything.

(they are now in front of a J. Kallenchuk Salvage Broker door with Chinese words below)

MULDER: Open it. (she does nothing, so Mulder kicks the door open) Pardon my gender type, but after you. (he pushes Geraldine in) Where are the lights?

MAN'S VOICE: Right here.

(it's Krycek with a gun pointed on Mulder)

MULDER: Krycek. I thought guns were against the law here.

KRYCEK: You know what they say when guns are outlawed...

MULDER: Why don't you take that gun and shoot yourself in your head like you shot my father?

GERALDINE: Great.. High Noon in Hong Kong.

KRYCEK: Aw... why don't you SHUT UP!

(he pushes Geraldine out the office and closes the door... she's still cuffed to Mulder)

GERALDINE: My God!

MULDER: It's no way to treat your business partner, especially since she's been moving those secrets you've been selling so well.

(on the other side of the door, Geraldine is shot down by MIBs)
(Krycek is on his way to the window)

KRYCEK: Looks like she's your partner now.

(Mulder looks for his key but drops it)

MULDER: Damn. (he tries to reach the dropped key on the floor)

(on the other side, the MIBs approaches, they bust in, but there is nobody on the office)

MAN'S VOICE: Au fond a gauche. Allez on s'depeche, on s'depeche. (they look through the window Mulder's running away) Il est parti. Allez on s'depeche vite, allez les gars on y va.

(a woman arrives by the corridor)
(the French operatives get out of the office)
(it's Joan, she glows and shines)
(the MIBs are down, blinded by the light)
(then the light dims, and we see all the men have burns on them)



SCENE 17
BACK IN DC, THE SAME RESTAURANT
(Skinner enters with a newspaper)

SKINNER: Is the coffee hot?

WAITRESS: Yeah.

(Skinner sits)
(a guys passes him by and goes to the counter)

SKINNER: How's the blue plate?

WAITRESS: Looks good. (she pours coffee for him)

SKINNER: I'll have one medium rare please. (she takes his order)

Man at the counter (speaking with a Hispanic accent): You got a pay phone that's out of order nobody complains? I'm complaining.

WAITRESS: I'm sorry sir, I'm sure it's been called in. (Skinner looks up)

MAN: You're sure? Meanwhile, I'm going to miss the phone call. That's gonna cost me time and
money..Who's gonna call that in?

WAITRESS: I'm sorry, sir, I don't know what else to say.

(Skinner, irritated, stops reading)

MAN: Say you're gonna pay me.. the 1.75 the phone ate.

(Skinner stands up and goes to the counter)

WAITRESS: No you'll have to deal with the phone company sir.

(Skinner is right behind the man)

MAN: You'll deal with 'em, I want my money.

SKINNER: Is there a problem there?

(the man turns)

MAN: Yeah there is a big problem. (draws his gun and shoots it)

(Skinner collapses)
(the waitress screams)
(the man spits at him)

MAN: Chupa dura ("suck hard"), amigo. (he splits)

WAITRESS: Oh my god! I'll call 911.



SCENE 18
SCULLY'S APT.
(Scully gets home)
(phone rings, she answers)

SCULLY: Scully.

WOMAN'S VOICE: Agent Scully, this is Kim Cook from the director's office.

SCULLY: Yes.

KIM: We've just got some bad news, AD Skinner has just been shot.

SCULLY: When?

KIM: About an hour ago, he's been taken to Northeast Georgetown.

SCULLY: I'm on my way.



SCENE 19
HONG KONG AIRPORT
(Krycek looks at a sign: flight 1121 to Washington)
(he walks towards Mulder who has his back turned, Mulder's acting like he's on the phone)
(when Krycek arrives at Mulder, Mulder turns back, punches him in the face)

MULDER: That's for your partner. (he kicks him under the belt) This is for me (Mulder draws Krycek's gun and points it at his gut) And this is for my father (Krycek has blood all over his face)

KRYCEK: No! I didn't kill your father.

MULDER: Now you tell me.

KRYCEK: It wasn't me.

MULDER: Oh yeah? Then who was it?

KRYCEK: I don't know, don't know.

MULDER: Either way Krycek you're a liar.

KRYCEK: Come on, finish it Mulder, c'mon finish it, come on.

(Mulder releases Krycek but still has him at gun point)

MULDER: I want that digital tape.

KRYCEK: I don't have it.

MULDER: Like hell you don't, it contains the secrets you were selling as well as everything else our government knows about the existence of extra terrestrial life .

KRYCEK: How could I sell anything? The tape's encrypted.

MULDER: Obviously, you found a way.

KRYCEK: I don't have it...I'll give it to you if you let me go.

MULDER: Where is it?

KRYCEK: DC... in a locker. (he takes a key out of his pocket) No. (he doesn't give it to Mulder) If you let me go, I'll tell you.

MULDER: You put that tape in my hands and we'll talk about it. Why don't you go to the bathrooms and clean yourself off? If you're not out of there in 3 minutes, I'm coming in there to kill you.

(Mulder escorts Krycek to the bathrooms, but before, he looks to see if there's no exit in it, Mulder tells him he can go in, and waits outside)
(outside, Joan passes by Mulder and goes in the bathrooms)
(when Krycek sees her in the men's bathrooms, he smiles but she smashes him against the wall)
(next Krycek walks out the bathrooms and walks ahead Mulder)

MULDER: Feel better?

KRYCEK: Like a new man. (dark glow in his eyes)

                                             APOCRYPHA


SCENE 1
NAVY HOSPITAL
PEARL HARBOR, HAWAII
AUGUST 19, 1953

(coughing) (a recording machine is rolling)

MAN: The navy...wanted to hear my story. They said, I owed it to the dead, to tell them the truth. I told them where to stick the truth.

(slow zoom out, the man is lying in a bed, with burns on him)

I'm the last man who knows who killed the men aboard that submarine, who knows it was a suicide mission but I'll burn in hell before I tell the murderers who sent us there.

#1: That's why we came here all the way from Washington sailor, to hear your story, to make sure that justice is served.

(zoom out, 3 young men [#1, #2, #3] are standing near the sick man, they are in a large room with a lot of beds, but they are all empty except for the sick man's)

#1: You said that after your outburst, the X.O. Johansen, locked you up with your captain.

MAN: Johansen did what he had to. That's war. Some are sacrificed so that others can live.

(flashback)

MAN: You gotta get us outta here!

(he shoots but is disarmed by the captain)
(Johansen arrives, and shuts the door)

MAN (VOICE OVER): But when that door shut, I knew my life, all our lives have just been sacrificed.

SANFORD: Johansen! Open this door! Open this door! Johansen!

(Sanford tuns back and has the thing in his eyes)

MAN (VOICE OVER): For the 1st time, I saw the enemy who was killing us.

(the crew men are afraid)
(one of them hits Sanford from the back with a tool, he's down)
(they all approach Sanford)
(some oil leaks through his nose, mouth, and eyes, it leaks its way out of the room)

MAN (VOICE OVER): That thing was causing the slow, painful deaths.

(back to 1953)

MAN: And I prayed, one of the Japanese depth charges would finish the job.

#1: You called this thing "the enemy". You're saying it was an entity of some sort.

MAN: The navy says we were sent to recover an A-bomb. That's why we got all these burns. Gimme a freaking break. Whatever it was, we were sent to guard it.

#1: This was what exposed the crew to radiation?

MAN: Before it slithered away, back to where it came from, back into the sea, back into who knows what.

(#1 is reaching to stop the recording machine, but the sick man grabs his hand)

MAN: That thing... is still down there! The navy will deny it... but you've got to make sure the truth gets out. I can trust you to do that, can't I Mr. Mulder?
(#1: Mr Mulder, looks at his partners)
(#3 puts a cigarette in his mouth, and lights it)

THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You can trust all of us.
(he takes a puff and exhales)

SCENE 2
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER
WASHINGTON DC
PRESENT DAY

(Scully arrives at the hospital, and goes to the front desk)

SCULLY: Excuse me, where can I find Walter Skinner? He was brought in with a gunshot wound.
(the woman points Scully to a direction)

FULLER: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Agent Fuller. (she walks towards him)

FULLER: This is agent Caleca (a female agent) we got a call from the DC police.

SCULLY: How bad is he?

FULLER: We don't know. He's been in surgery.

SCULLY: What happened?

CALECA: Looked like some hot-head drew a gun in a coffee shop. Skinner happened to be in the way.

SCULLY: What do we have on the shooter?

FULLER: We have a description from the waitress. A handgun was recovered in the parking lot, unregistered, no prints. Our guys got 2 partials off the cash register.

SCULLY: Hair and fiber?

FULLER: This just happened a few hours ago.

SCULLY: This is the assistant director who's been shot. We have to make all resources available.

(Skinner is out of surgery, being wheeled by on a gurney)

SCULLY: Excuse me. (she goes to see him)

SCULLY: How is he? (puts her hands on Skinner's)

DR: He came out of the surgery all right but he's still in a lot of pain.

(Skinner holds her hand)

SKINNER (WHISPERING): I've seen him before... the man who shot me.

(Skinner is taken away by the doctors)



SCENE 3
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
WASHINGTON DC

(a plane lands at night)

(Krycek and Mulder walks out of a car rental office, they get in the car, Krycek's on the driver's side)

MULDER: Give me the key.

KRYCEK: When we get there.

MULDER: I wanna make sure we get there together, give it to me.
(Krycek hands mulder the key: yellow with C.I. 517 on it) What's "C.I." mean?

KRYCEK: When we get there.
(Krycek turns on the engine and drives)



SCENE 4
THE HOSPITAL
(Skinner's room)

(Scully reads his medical chart)
(Fuller and Caleca enter)

FULLER: How's he doing?

SCULLY: He's on steady Demerol, he's in and out. I thought I asked for guards to be posted outside.

CALECA: We put in a request with the DC police.

SCULLY: This wasn't a random shooting. I want guards posted here and I want them here now!

FULLER: I think it's a matter of pulling men on something else.

SCULLY: I've heard the excuses. I don't care if you and agent Caleca have to stand in the hallway yourself. This man has to be protected. Okay? (she walks away)



SCENE 5
COUNTY ROAD 512
MARYLAND

(Mulder and Krycek's car passes by a car pulled over on the side with 2 people in it, it follows their car, Mulder looks back)

MULDER: We're being followed. A dark sedan with its lights off. It was parked on the shoulder about half a mile back. Speed up. (pointing his gun at Krycek) Speed up!

(Krycek speeds up, but the other car catches up and runs them off the road)
(Mulder's head hit the windshield, Krycek was protected by the airbag)
(the car arrives)
(the 2 men, #1 and #2, approach, armed with guns)
(Krycek look up, #1 open the door)

#1: Get out.

(#2 goes to Mulder's side)
(#1 and Krycek walk away)

#1: Where's the digital tape?

KRYCEK: I don't have it.

(#1 hits him in the stomach with his gun but Krycek doesn't feel a thing, #1 pushes him
ahead and they continue walking)
(#2 is gonna open Mulder's door when there's a scream, and there's a big flash behind the pillar where #1 and Krycek went. #2 rushes to see what happened)

#2: Hey are you all right?
(Mulder regains partial consciousness, sees the big flash, hears another scream, but loses consciousness again)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Scully enters an office)

SCULLY: I got a message you called.

MAN: Good morning, we found something I knew you wanted to see ASAP.

SCULLY: It's on the shooter?

MAN: Yeah, the partial prints we pulled out of the cash register didn't add up to anything. We found saliva on Skinner's shirt that wasn't his. This is an analysis of the secretors and other hemofactors.
(Scully looks at the sheet she's handled)

SCULLY: Which tells us we're looking for a male, probably in his 40s with blood type B positive, but we already know all that from the waitress' description.

MAN: There's more. We were able to chromosome-stain some of the hair fibers we picked up last night.

SCULLY: We still gotta find the guy before we can get a match.

MAN: We can still run those indicators against all the suspects arrested in the DC area in the last couple of years.

SCULLY: This takes too much time. You know what, run them anyway. Can I borrow you this for a little while?

MAN: Go ahead.

SCULLY: Thanks.



SCENE 7
LOCATION UNKNOWN

(a man with burns on him, covered with bandages is in observation)

DR: We picked them up last night. The burns you're looking at, they're somatic, caused by close proximity radiation exposure. Same as the French sailors aboard that salvage ship. Identical.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What's the prognosis? (he puts a cigarette in his mouth)

DR: It's just a matter of time, this kind of absorption will have a rapid effect on cellular activity, giving rise to the onset of massive and malignant cancers. (the Cigarette-Smoking Man lights his cigarette)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Has anyone been in to see these men?

DR: No, your orders were to isolate them. (The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks through the bandages of the sick man, his eyes still move). But I think we should get a specialist in here because, frankly, I've never seen anything like this before.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I have.

DR: Do you know what caused this?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Have the bodies destroyed. (walks away)

DR: But.. but sir...these men aren't dead yet!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Isn't that the prognosis? (leaves)



SCENE 8
HOSPITAL

(Mulder wakes up with a bandage on his forehead)
(Scully is at his bed side)
(they exchange a smile)

MULDER: Guess I'm not dead.

SCULLY: What happened? (pause)

MULDER: Maybe you can tell me.

SCULLY: The State police found you unconscious. You were strapped in the passenger's seat of a rental car that had been driven into a ditch.

MULDER: We were run off the road by 2 men.

SCULLY: Who's "we"?

MULDER: Krycek.

SCULLY: Krycek?

MULDER: He was in Hong Kong, he's got the digital tape. He's been selling information.

SCULLY: Is that what the men wanted?

MULDER: They ordered him out of the car. I thought they were going to kill him. I though they were going to kill us both. And then there was this bright flash. That's all I remember.

SCULLY: Well it may not be the best time to tell you but, you're not the only one in the hospital. Skinner's been shot.

MULDER: What's his condition?

SCULLY: A bullet perforated his small intestine. The doctor seems to think he'll be fine.

MULDER: Who shot him?

SCULLY: I'm not sure. But I have an idea. (she opens a folder)

MULDER: What are those?

SCULLY: PCR results (Mulder looks at them) this one belongs to the man who shot Skinner. (Mulder puts the 2 sheets together, they match)

MULDER: Yeah and who's this one belong to?

SCULLY: The man who shot Melissa. (Mulder looks again, they match exactly)



SCENE 9
46TH STREET
NEW YORK CITY, NY

#1: We've received disturbing reports from our intelligence sources. (a lot of shadowy characters are in the office, some are standing, others are sitting, one of them is the Well-Manicured Man) A French salvage vessel has came into San Diego. Its crew all dying of radiation exposure. Its last given position was the site where we recovered the UFO.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: How could they have gotten information about that location?

#2: We haven't been able to determine that. The French government has denied any involvement.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Well they got those coordinates somehow.

#1: It seems we have an information leak gentleman.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Has our associate in Washington looked into this?

#1: Apparently he has responded to the situation in a way that I don't think any of us would have anticipated.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: How do you mean?

#1: I don't have all the details yet but I've asked him to come here and explain it himself.



SCENE 10
HOSPITAL
(Scully shows her badge to an officer posted in front of a room, he lets her in)

SCULLY: Hi, how are you feeling?

SKINNER: Like someone's been inside my stomach redecorating. What have you turned up on the shooter?

SCULLY: We've determined that the man who shot you was the same man who shot my sister.

SKINNER: I bet you had to work to get that, huh?

SCULLY: Yes I did, you don't seem surprised.

SKINNER: 3 men came to see me a few days ago, they warned me about pursuing your sister's murder investigation.

SCULLY: Do you realize what you're saying sir?

SKINNER: I'm not advancing any conspiracy theory here Scully.

SCULLY: You're saying, that they closed down my sister's case not because of lack of evidence but because they didn't want us to catch the killer.

SKINNER: You should be very careful about the accusations that you make.

SCULLY: The man who shot you.. you said that you've seen him before.

SKINNER: Several months ago, he was one of the men who attacked me in the stairway,with Krycek.

SCULLY: He was working with Krycek?

SKINNER: They're the ones who stole the digital tape from me.

SCULLY: Damn it! Krycek, Mulder had him.

SKINNER: Listen to me, anger is a luxury that you cannot afford right now. If you're angry you're gonna make a mistake, and these people will take advantage of that, you've seen how they operate

SCULLY: I'll be ok (walking out)

SKINNER: Scully.. if you can't keep your head.. it's all right to step away.

SCULLY: It's exactly what they want (leaves)



SCENE 11
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully, typing on her laptop computer)

SCULLY: (voice over): Addendum to case number 621517, in the absence of any official response my request to have my sister's case reopened, I am now petitioning to devote full Bureau resources to the search for Alex Krycek. Since agent Mulder's release from the hospital, we have had no success locating Krycek or the 2 men he described as his abductors. Personally, I believe Krycek is the key to identify the larger forces behind the crime we are investigating. He alone can name the man who shot my sister, and explain the strange radiation deaths aboard the French salvage vessel.



SCENE 12
X-FILES OFFICE

(Scully opens the door and enters)
(the diving suit from the Piper Maru is there)

MULDER: It looked great on me in the store.

SCULLY: What's this doing here?

MULDER: I had it flown it from San Diego as evidence.

SCULLY: Evidence of what?

MULDER: The suit was covered in a thin film of oil, as was the French diver when I found him lying delirious on his kitchen floor.

SCULLY: What kind of oil?

MULDER: Well from the reports I'm getting, it's the same substance that was found on the French diver's wife when she was discovered on the floor of a Hong Kong airport bathroom a few days ago. According to the analysis, it's 50-weight diesel oil. It's the same oil that was used during World War II submarines and on P-51 Mustangs for that matter.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

MULDER: This oil is not only 50 years old Scully, but its composition has been altered by exposure to radiation.

SCULLY: I still don't understand how did this get onto the diver and then onto the diver's wife.

MULDER: This just wasn't ordinary diesel oil, I think it's huh.. I think it's a medium, a medium being used by some kind of alien creature that uses it to .. body jump.

SCULLY: So you're saying that this stuff has intelligence.

MULDER: I think that it came off of whatever they pulled from the bottom of the Pacific ocean, it's been waiting 50 years down there for another host, another body to bring it up to the surface.

SCULLY: Waiting to jump into the diver and then into the diver's wife.

MULDER: And then into Krycek.

SCULLY: Krycek?

MULDER: I think that Mrs Gauthier went to Hong Kong under the control of this thing (Scully laughs) to find Krycek. I know, I know how it sounds.

SCULLY: Is anybody not looking for Krycek?

MULDER: No but I think that the 64 thousand dollar question is what is this thing looking for? And now that it's in Krycek, what does it want?



SCENE 13
ROCKVILLE, MD

(Capitol Ice, skating arena)
(Byers, Langly skate around, browsing at everyone)
(they signal Frohike, and he goes to the lockers, where he recovers an envelope)

(they get out of there and get in Mulder's car, parked across the street)

FROHIKE (handing the envelope to Mulder): Nothing to it.

BYERS: You should call upon our service more often.

LANGLY: We show a talent for these G-man activities.

MULDER: You mean if I want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead pipe?

FROHIKE: Only if you want the job done right.

(Mulder opens the envelope, and he finds an empty tape case)

MULDER: It's gone.

(The Lone Gunmen are disappointed, so is Mulder)



SCENE 14
LOCATION UNKNOWN

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is having some alcohol while watching an old war movie)
(he puts the glass on the table near him, and reaches for his smoking cigarette on the ashtray when a digital tape is thrown on the table)
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is surprised, stands and turns back, it's Krycek)

KRYCEK: Where is it?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN (regaining confidence, takes a puff): I've been expecting you.

(The Hispanic Man holds a gun on Krycek's neck)

Put that down.

(he follows the order) I have what you want.
(zoom on Krycek's eyes, dark glow in his eyes)
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man remains emotionless)



SCENE 15
NEW YORK CITY

(the well-Manicured Man's office, a few shadowy figures have tea and coffee)
(The Cigarette-Smoking Man enters, he takes off his coat)

WELL-MANICURED MAN (looks at his watch): You've made us wait.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: There was a weather delay on the shuttle from Washington.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: You had business there?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yes. (approaches) You huh.. may have already heard (puts a cigarette in his mouth)

#1: We've heard you acted on your own, and moved the salvage UFO to another location.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: These new attempts to recover it have increased our need for security.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Who else is looking for it?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN (smoking): In the event, I moved it to as a safeguard.

#1: Somebody better damn now find out how the French even knew how to look for it.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I can assure you it will be completely inaccessible now.

#2: Why not bring it to Nevada, like the others?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Leaks in security and a heightened public interest have made the base of Nevada unviable. (to the Well-manicured Man) Is this why I was called here?

WELL MANICURED MAN: No, we'd like an explanation about this business with the assistant director of the Bureau, Skinner.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Random shooting for all I know.

WELL MANICURED MAN: They have a waitress, who has given a description of the shooter, they released a composite of his face to the press. (hands the Cigarette- smoking man a newspaper, it's the face of the Hispanic-Man) One of yours, isn't he?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I don't know what to tell you. If he did, he acted on his own.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Good lord.

#2: This is a very serious exposure for us.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'll take care of it.

WELL MANICURED MAN: My advice to you sir, is to understand the priority here, get the shooter out of the country as quickly as possible, if the assistant director IDs him, our well placed operatives won't be able to stand in the way of an arrest, compromising beyond repair the secrecy of our work, and the security as you so arrogantly assert of our project's future.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It'll be handled.



SCENE 16
THE LONE GUNMEN'S

FROHIKE (wearing special glasses): I've got something here.. writing somebody wrote on top of the package and left an impression.

MULDER: Let me see that.

BYERS: Your guys at the FBI turned a major serial murderer with a vestigial pen impression.

MULDER: Hand me a pencil.

LANGLY: Your sci-crime guys at the Bureau have a laser there that can measure any change in a surface down to a few nanometers (Mulder is going over the impression with the pencil)

BYERS: Actually they can lift perfect impression using magnetic toner and a sheet of mylar an electrostatic device is applied to the specimen, and renders the information, by drawing the toner from the indentation to the mylar surface.

FROHIKE: Actually..

MULDER: Actually, it's a phone number, New York City area code (212), 555 1012. Now don't drop that (giving the pencil to Frohike) that's a finely calibrated piece of investigative equipment. I gotta make a phone call. (Frohike is puzzled)

FROHIKE: I'll be damned.



SCENE 17

The Well-Manicured Man's office
(The Well-Manicured Man is putting his coat, helped by a young man when the phone rings.. he's very surprised)
(the young man answers the phone)
(The Well-Manicured Man looks at his watch)

MAN: Yes? No this is a private line, you must have misdialed. No there's no one here to take your call. I'm sorry I can't help you. (The Well-Manicured Man approaches) Please hold on.

(The Well-Manicured Man answers)

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Who is this?

MULDER: Who is this?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Who gave you this number?

MULDER: You probably know. A man named Krycek.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Alex Krycek?

MULDER: Yeah nice guy, killed my father, you wouldn't happen to know where he is, do you?

WELL-MANICURED MAN: It's Mr Mulder isn't it?

MULDER: It's so nice of you to remember.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Mr Mulder, can we meet somewhere?

MULDER: I would love to.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: Give your phone number to my assistant, he will call you back in 5 minutes. (to the assistant) Tell him I'll meet him in 3 hours in Central Park, near the lighted walkway off 79th, near the reservoir. When you hang up, have this number disconnected.

(the assistant takes over the phone)



SCENE 18
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(slide showing)

FULLER: Well we got a name to go with the face.

SCULLY: Beautiful.

FULLER: His name is Luis Cardinal (The Hispanic Man), native of Nicaragua, school of the America's alumni, career mercenary, apparently impressed a lot of people with his marksmanship during the Iran contra deal.

SCULLY: I'll bet.

FULLER: That's actually the good news.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

CALECA: He entered the country without a visa or papers. As far as we can tell we can't find anything on him, address, phone number, financials, nothing.

SCULLY: Does he have an alias?

CALECA: Several, non-checked out either in all likelihood, this guy's already out of the country.

SCULLY: Damn it, they think they can just get away with it.

FULLER: I wish I could tell you otherwise.

SCULLY: Keep looking for him.

FULLER: We.. pretty much exhausted our avenues.

SCULLY: What's it gonna take?

CALECA: At this point? Other than a sign from God?

SCULLY: I've seen stranger things, believe me.

MAN: I believe she has.



SCENE 19
CENTRAL PARK

(Mulder is waiting)
(The Well-Manicured Man finally shows up)

WELL MANICURED MAN: I trust we're all alone.

MULDER: We're all alone in New York City, sir.

WELL MANICURED MAN: You're looking for Alex Krycek, to kill him, in revenge. What makes you think we haven't done that already?

MULDER: What for?

WELL MANICURED MAN: Tell me what you know and I'll consider giving you Krycek.

MULDER: No, you'll answer a few questions for me first, like what was pulled off the bottom of the Pacific ocean.

WELL MANICURED MAN: It was a UFO, a so called foo-fighter, downed by American fighter pilots in the 2nd World War.

MULDER: Left out until now?

WELL MANICURED MAN: There was salvage attempts. A US sub was sent in 50 years ago, but there were complications.

MULDER: Almost the entire crew died.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Yeah, it's still a mystery.

MULDER: A mystery to whom?

WELL MANICURED MAN: The cover story said it was the 3rd A bomb bound to Japan, but the truth is, no one knows what killed that crew.

MULDER: I know.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Do you now?

MULDER: You give me Krycek and I will tell you.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Mr Mulder, I've given you so much this evening, you offered me next to nothing in return.

MULDER: You haven't told me anything I didn't already know.

WELL MANICURED MAN: I'm curious, if you've encountered Krycek, why didn't you kill him then?

MULDER: 'Cause he has the tape.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Ahh yes, the tape .

MULDER: The tape he's been selling those secrets off. (The Well-Manicured Man is surprised) You don't know where he is either, do you? (the Well-Manicured man smiles) You're looking for him too.

WELL MANICURED MAN: Mr Mulder, everyone can be gotten to, certainly, you've no doubt of that. (Mulder walks away) Mr Mulder?



SCENE 20
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(phone rings, Scully answers)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: Scully it's me. (Mulder's calling from his cell phone) The 2 guards you had posted in front of Skinner's room, are they still there?

SCULLY: They should be why?

MULDER: I want you to get down there and double check for me, ok?

SCULLY: I got it covered Mulder.

MULDER: Just get down there and check, ok?



SCENE 21
HOSPITAL

SCULLY: Nurse, what happened to the guards who were outside this room?

NURSE: They've left.

SCULLY: Where did they go? And what happened to the man who was in this room?

NURSE: Mr Skinner is no longer a patient here.

SCULLY: Where is he?

NURSE: Well the oderlies were here a few moments ago, and they took him away.

SCULLY: Where did they take him?

NURSE: To another hospital, the ambulance must have just left.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(Scully catches up with the ambulance)

SCULLY (showing her badge): I'm with the FBI, are you transporting a Walter Skinner?

DRIVER: yeah, is there something wrong?

SCULLY: No everything is fine, I'm just gonna ride with you the rest of the way, ok?
(she gets in by the back)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, what are you doing here?

SCULLY: I just wanted to make sure you got where you were going safely.

(the ambulance stops at a red light)
(there's something wrong)
(rattling)

SKINNER: What is this Scully?

SCULLY: You just lie still (stands and draws her gun)

(is about to open the door, the Hispanic Man fires but missed, he runs away now, and Scully chases him)
(the Hispanic Man is hit by a car, but he gets up and continues running)
(he eventually stumbles and falls)

SCULLY: Federal agent stop right there! (yelling) Are you Luis Cardinal?! Are you Luis Cardinal?!

CARDINAL: Please.

SCULLY (still yelling): Are you the man who shot my sister?!

CARDINAL: Don't kill me, please.

SCULLY: You shot my sister!

CARDINAL: Please I can tell you.

SCULLY: Tell me!

CARDINAL: I can tell you.

SCULLY: Tell me!

CARDINAL: I can tell you what you want, you want Krycek, I can tell you where he is? Please, please don't shoot me.

(sirens wailing)
(cop cars arrive)

OFFICER (yelling): Drop the gun! Put the gun down! Put it down now!

SCULLY (shows her badge): FBI.

OFFICER: Don't move.

(Cardinal is arrested)
(Scully has tears in her eyes)

(Mulder's in a car)
(cell phone rings)

MULDER: Yeah Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder it's me, where are you?

MULDER: At the airport in New York.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm looking for my rental car agreement.

SCULLY: What are you doing in New York?

MULDER: I'll tell you when I see you.

SCULLY: Mulder, your instincts were right about Skinner. We've just arrested a man for what looks like attempted murder.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: It's him Mulder, the man who shot my sister.

MULDER: Scully..

SCULLY: Mulder listen to me, he said he knows where Krycek is. I don't know if this makes any sense to you, he says he's headed towards an abandoned missile site somewhere in North Dakota.

MULDER: I want you to meet me at the DC airport in an hour, I want you to get 2 tickets on the 1st flight for North Dakota.

SCULLY: What's in North Dakota?

MULDER: The salvaged UFO.



SCENE 22
BLACK CROW, NORTH DAKOTA

(Mulder and Scully arrive at the site)
(they get out of the car)

SCULLY: There must be 200 silos out here. If I'm correct they were all filled with concrete in accord with the disarmament treaty when the base was decommissioned.

MULDER: I didn't sign any disarmament treaty. (they draw their guns and enter the 1st silo)

(the door's lock has been broken)
(it's dark in there, they both have their flashlights)

SCULLY: My ears are still popping.

MULDER: We're 8 stories down.

(they get in a missile silo)

SCULLY: Where's the concrete?

MULDER: Apparently, nobody else signed that treaty either.

SCULLY: 1 down, 199 silos to go.

(they go on searching)

MULDER: These tunnels must go on for miles.

(there's a noise)
(Mulder and Scully switch off their flashlights)
(they go in another way where military operatives are down)

MULDER: He's here.

(they have burns on them)
(the lights are on)
(other armed operatives arrive)

MAN: Hold it right there!

(Mulder and Scully run)

MAN: Hold!

(Mulder and Scully continue running, but they are cornered)

MAN: Hands in the air! Come on! Come on!

(their guns are taken away, and they are escorted out, they walk away of a red isolation door marked with the numbers 1013 on it)

(outside)
(the Cigarette-Smoking Man arrives, as the FBI agents get out)

MULDER: He's here. You led him here, didn't you?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: There's nothing here but holes in the ground Mr Mulder.

MULDER: Why are you here? Why all these men?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I don't know, you owe me answers.

MULDER: The UFO's here. That's what Krycek's after, isn't it?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Krycek? Alex Krycek disappeared 5 months ago.

SCULLY: We saw bodies in there. (she's taken away) Men with radiation burns!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You saw nothing (enters the silo).

MULDER: You won't get away with this! You can't bury the truth!

(Mulder and Scully are both taken away in a blue van)

(in the silo)
(the Cigarette-Smoking Man sees the men with burns)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Take these away.

(he walks towards the door with 1013 on it, lights a cigarette, takes a puff, and leaves)
(zoom into the little window of the 1013 red door)

(retching)
(Krycek is spitting oil out, oil which is also leaking through his eyes and his nose)
(he's on a triangular UFO)
(as the oil leaks its way inside the UFO, Krycek is horrified with what he sees)



SCENE 23
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON DC

(Mulder is writing something, at his desk, he has his glasses on)
(knocking)

MULDER: Yeah.

SKINNER (with a cane): Agent Mulder.

MULDER (stands up and shakes Skinner's hand and helps him to the chair): Sir, I didn't expect you back to work for a few weeks.

SKINNER: I was looking for agent Scully, there was something I wanted to talk to her about, thank you. (sits)

MULDER: Actually I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to thank you for everything you did.

SKINNER: You mean getting a shot in the gut?

MULDER: You got a shot because you stood up to these people.

SKINNER: I think you're perceiving from a mistaken impression, what I did, I did it because it's my job.

MULDER: From what I understand, you put your job and your life on the line for Scully.

SKINNER: This isn't my crusade agent Mulder. A woman was murdered, I mistakenly thought that we could bring the man who committed that crime to justice.

MULDER: What do you mean mistakenly?

SKINNER: This is what I need to talk to Scully about.

(Scully's walking in a cemetery, with flowers)
(She puts them before a tombstone saying: Melissa Scully, beloved sister and daughter,
1962-1995)
(Mulder arrives by car, with flowers too)

SCULLY: I was just thinking about something that a man said to me. That the.. that the dead speak to us from beyond the grave, that that what's conscience is.

MULDER: It's interesting, I never thought of it that way.

SCULLY: You know I thought... when we found him, this man that killed Melissa, that..that when we brought him to justice, I would feel some kind of closure. But the truth is no court.. no punishment is ever enough.

MULDER: I came here to tell you something (they start walking away) there may be some justice, just not the kind you're looking for.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: They found this man, Luis Cardinal, dead in his cell.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: They made it look like a suicide. The men he worked for couldn't take the chance that he point his finger at them.

SCULLY: And what about Krycek?

MULDER: Oh he was there. I know that.

SCULLY: You think they got to him too.

MULDER: I don't know, but if they haven't they will. I doubt it'll weight on their consciences though.

SCULLY: I think the dead are speaking to us Mulder, demanding justice. Maybe that man was right. Maybe we bury the dead alive.



SCENE 24

(banging)

KRYCEK'S VOICE: Help!

(in the missile silo)
(Krycek is banging at the door, the UFO's still there, behind him) Help! (groans) Help! (screaming)
(zoom out from Krycek's face, from the little window of the red door with 1013 on it)
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
(screaming)

[THE END]

                                        PUSHER



SCENE 1
MT. FOODMORE SUPERMARKET; LOUDOUN COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(A peaceful day at the supermarket. "Misty" is playing over the P.A. Robert Modell, a.k.a. Pusher, hums along, carrying a handheld carrying cart, walks out of the produce section and down an aisle. He grabs some pasta, then some "Carbo Boost," an energy drink. He tosses around ten in, then just starts piling them in as fast as he can. A young man walks over to the aisle and eyes him carefully. Pusher starts off, stops, takes one more can, then walks towards the registers. The young man follows him. Pusher gets in line, puts his cart down and picks up "World Weekly Informer." He looks at the picture of a strange-looking Flukeman on the cover and chuckles at the absurdity. He then looks outside and his smile fades as a police car pulls up. The young man trailing him has taken a place behind him. The cash register can be heard beeping as items are checked, then the receipt cycles up.)

PUSHER: Let's get this show on the road.

(He reaches over to the guy in front of him and un-velcros a section on the back of his jacket, revealing the letters "FBI." Together, that man and the man behind him rush him and twist his arm around, pushing his face against the conveyor belt.)

AGENT #1: Federal agents! Get down!

(They whip out their guns. Other agents come rushing out of the woodwork, pointing their guns as well.)

AGENT #2: Federal agent! Get down!

(Pusher doesn't struggle, merely smiles.)

PUSHER: Turn this thing off.

(Detective Frank Burst walks in and turns off the conveyor belt.)

FRANK BURST: You're Pusher, I presume.

PUSHER: You must be Frank Burst. You know, I got to tell you... you got the greatest name.

FRANK BURST: Agent Collins, read him his rights and lets get the hell out of here.

(The first agent stands him up. Collins, the man who had been trailing him, starts reading the Miranda rights.)

COLLINS: You have the right to remain silent. If you choose to give up that right, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney...

(They all start to walk.)

PUSHER: Think you can hold me?

FRANK BURST: Put him in a waist chain and leg arms!

COLLINS: If you choose to waive that right...

FRANK BURST: I want him in a car with a cage! Loudoun County Unit, whatever. I'll ride shotgun.

(A long caravan of police cars and FBI sedans have reached a busy intersection. The first police car pulls out. The back car contains Pusher, looking rather cocky. Down the road a long ways, a sixteen-wheeler pulls onto the road.)

It would really help me out if you gave us your name.

PUSHER: Pusher's good enough.

(Pusher clears his throat and leans forward slightly towards Deputy Kerber, who is driving.)

Hey, you know, Deputy, I just got to say that your uniform is really the most soothing shade of blue. I'm not kidding you. I notice those things. It's a sky blue.

(The line of cars has decreased to one as another pulls out.)

Very calming. Very tranquil. I think the word for that particular shade is cerulean, actually. Cerulean blue.

FRANK BURST: Okay, okay, we get it. It's a nice shade of blue.

PUSHER: Cerulean blue. Cerulean makes me think of a breeze. A gentle breeze.

FRANK BURST: Hey! Mister Blackwell. Put a sock in it.

(Kerber looks out the window aimlessly at the traffic. A subtle change forms in him. He is growing slightly agitated, but is very calmed nonetheless. His eyes are blank. Pusher's voice is soothing. A blue truck is driving towards them down the intersecting road.)

PUSHER: Cerulean is like a gentle breeze. Cerulean... a gentle breeze.

(The truck disappears from the deputy's line of sight. The deputy pulls out into the intersection. Pusher lays down on the seat and braces himself against the doors for the upcoming impact. Burst looks at the oncoming truck.)

FRANK BURST: Stop!

(A loud crash.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Down in the X-Files office, there is a slide up of the deputy, lying in the street, bloodied, dead. Burst is sitting in a chair next to Scully. His face is battered and bruised. Mulder is sitting at his desk.)

FRANK BURST: I was knocked unconscious. Deputy Scott Kerber was mortally injured. Before he succumbed, he managed to, uh, pull himself out of the car, dig his keys out of his pocket... and his last breath was spent unlocking my prisoner, who, despite his own injuries, managed to escape on foot. Calls himself "Pusher."

MULDER: What's his story?

FRANK BURST: He cold-called me about a month ago. Confessed to a series of contract killings going back over the course of two years.

SCULLY: He wanted to turn himself in?

FRANK BURST: No. It was a game. He was bragging. See, the thing about these murders is, nobody considers them murders. They went down in the books as suicides.

SCULLY: So you think he was just a crank?

FRANK BURST: No. He knows too much about each case, too many details that were only in the police reports.

SCULLY: What connection did this dead deputy have with him?

FRANK BURST: None, as far as I can tell. Kerber was a good cop.

SCULLY: Then why did he free him?

(Burst sighs and flips to the next slide. It is of the side of the truck that collided with the police car. The name of the company the truck works for, imprinted on the door, is "Cerulean Hauling.")

FRANK BURST: Pusher kept rambling about cerulean blue. Kept saying how it reminded him of, uh, a breeze or something. "Cerulean blue is like a gentle breeze..." over and over and then, uh, Kerber pulled into the truck and... blammo.

MULDER: So you think that Pusher somehow talked him into doing this? He willed him into doing that?

SCULLY: Willed him? How?

FRANK BURST: No kidding, how?

(He flips to the next slide. On the side of the wrecked car are the letters "NIN OR" in blood.)

Your guess is as good as mine on this one.

(Mulder stands and walks over to the viewscreen.)

See, Pusher likes to leave clues.

(Mulder walks over to the slide projector and takes out the slide, flips it around and puts it back in. The letters are backwards, forming a make-shift spelling of "RO NIN," despite the letters being backwards.)

Ronin.

MULDER: Ro-neen. It's a samurai without a master.

(Scully and Burst look at him curiously.)

What? You never saw Yojimbo?

SCULLY: Still, what does it mean?

MULDER: It means I bet I know ten-to-one what this guy's got stacked on the back of his toilet.

(Later, in the research section of the bureau, Mulder drops a stack of "American Ronin" magazines onto his desk and sits. He flips through some. Scully is already flipping through a few. A young woman named Holly walks over to them. She has a noticeable bruise on her right cheek.)

HOLLY: Agents?

MULDER: Oh, thanks.

(She puts a stack of magazines down on the desk.)

HOLLY: Here's volume ten.

(Scully stares at her bruise. Holly looks away, embarrassed.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry, I couldn't help noticing.

HOLLY: I was in Georgetown this weekend. A guy knocked me down and stole my purse.

MULDER: They get him?

HOLLY: Do they ever? No offense. Excuse me.

(She smiles and walks out.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm still not sure what we're looking for.

MULDER: Samurais without masters have to advertise.

SCULLY: Yes, but advertise for what? I mean, how... how did this "Pusher" convince an otherwise honest deputy sheriff to free him? I mean, I'm sure you have a theory.

MULDER: Suggestion is a powerful force. The science of hypnosis is predicated on it, as are most TV commercials. I mean, they're designed to plant thoughts in your head.

SCULLY: Inducing someone to buy hair color is a little different than inducing them to drive in front of a speeding truck.

MULDER: But the mechanism of suggestion is the same. It's just a lot more powerful in this case. I mean, this guy calls himself "Pusher." Can't we take that to mean that he pushes his will onto other people?

SCULLY: Well, even if he could push his will, why would he, he cause an accident when he himself was in the car?

MULDER: Maybe he really didn't want to go to jail.

(Scully sighs.)

MULDER: Look at this.

(He points to a personal ad that reads:

"I SOLVE PROBLEMS. OSU.
(703) 555-0146, (703) 555-0118,
(703) 555-0177.")

"I solve problems. O-S-U."

SCULLY: Ohio State University?

MULDER: No, it's a northern Virginia area code. I've seen this ad in all these magazines dating back to April, 1994.

SCULLY: The time span of the murders.

(Mulder stands and goes to the bookshelf. After looking around, he pulls out an English-Japanese dictionary. He starts to flip through.)

MULDER: O-S-U... O-S... U...

(He laughs.)

Osu. It's a Japanese word. It means "to push."

SCULLY: I say we run down those telephone numbers.

(Mulder nods and puts down the dictionary.)



SCENE 3
BELTWAY COMMUTER LOT; FALLS CHURCH, VIRGINIA

(A phone booth is ringing in the middle of the night. No one is around, save for Mulder and Scully, sitting in the car. Scully is sleeping, her head on Mulder's shoulder. Mulder is calling on his cellular phone. After letting it ring a few times, he hangs up. He then looks at Scully and wipes some drool from the side of her mouth. She gasps, waking up.)

MULDER: Hey. I think you drooled on me.

SCULLY: Sorry.

(She sighs slightly, looking embarrassed. He puts his cellular phone away.)

What time is it?

MULDER: It's, uh... twenty to three.

(She yawns.)

SCULLY: No luck, I take it?

MULDER: No, nothing here, nothing at the other two payphones. I checked in with Burst. He's beginning to think it's a wild goose chase.

(The payphone rings. Mulder and Scully look at each other, then get out and run down the block to the phone. Mulder answers it.)

Hello?

(Pusher's filtered voice rings through.)

PUSHER: Are you two just going to sit there all night?

(Mulder motions to Scully, who takes out her cellular phone. Mulder takes out a tape recorder and presses record, holding it up to the mouthpiece.)

Don't bother hunting around for me, I'm far away. Although...

(Scully whispers into her phone.)

SCULLY: Okay on the trace.

PUSHER: I was watching you up until about an hour ago. You and your pretty partner seem awfully close. Do you work well together?

MULDER: Who is this? What's your name?

(Pusher laughs.)

PUSHER: Sorry, G-man, it's not that easy. You have to follow my little bread crumb trail, prove your worth. So far, you're doing all right.

MULDER: Why do I have to prove my worth to you? You think this is a game? What, do you want to be found?

(Silence.)

All right, where's my next bread crumb?

PUSHER: Right in front of you. You let your fingers do the walking, G-man.

(He hangs up. A dial tone rings through. Mulder hangs up. Somebody talks on the other end of Scully's line.)

MAN: Sorry, we didn't get him.

SCULLY: Okay.

(She hangs up.)

Not a complete trace. They think he was using a digital scrambler.

(She sighs.)

MULDER: "Let your fingers do the walking."

SCULLY: Phone book.

(She reaches for it.)

MULDER: No, no, what if, what if Pusher was the last person to use this phone? Can you redial on these kind of phones?

SCULLY: Hang on a second.

(Scully presses redial on her cell phone.)

MAN: Murphy.

SCULLY: Yeah, it's me again. We want the last number dialed out from this location. Just ring it on through. Okay.

(She hangs up. After a second, the phone rings. Mulder picks up and the two listen.)

WOMAN: Hi! You've reached Tee Totallers, golf driving range and pro shop. Our hours of operation are seven A.M. to midnight, Monday through Saturday, and seven A.M. to ten P.M. on Sundays.

(Mulder hangs up.)

SCULLY: So he's a killer and a golfer.

MULDER: Rings a bell, huh? Let's go, G-Woman.

(They start off.)



SCENE 4
TEE-TOTALLERS GOLF DRIVING RANGE AND PRO SHOP

(A bunch of golf fans are sitting at the driving range. A man in a green jacket nails one. Pusher walks over to him.)

PUSHER: Oh, yeah! Strong shot. Good shoot. Hoo-hoo!

(The green-jacketed man sits down. Pusher is holding a golf club and a ball.)

All right, gentleman, I'm using this here non-sanctioned golf ball.

(He places it down on the tee. There is a bruise on his face.)

It's got a core of uranium, or some damned thing, I don't know what... gets up there like Sputnik.

(Pusher nails it and watches it sail away.)

Yeah!

(He looks out onto the range, into the deep brush. He notices a suspicious looking piece of brown-ish shrubbery start to move, carrying an assault rifle.)

About time.

(He puts the club in his bag and starts out.)

Konichiwa, gentlemen. I was never here.

(Around the driving range, agents start to surround the building. One agent, Collins, bashes open the door to a very dark room, shining some dim light onto the lower half of Pusher.)

COLLINS: Police! Get down!

PUSHER: Whoa! Okay.

(Pusher raises his hands.)

COLLINS: Get down!

PUSHER: Okay. Okay... relax. Relax.

(Collins lowers his gun slightly.)

Let me see your face. Take it easy... come on now.

(Collins take off his helmet.)

That's right. That's right.

(Collins then unwraps the sheath from around his face, exposing his identity. Pusher's voice is smooth.)

Hey, Collins. Listen.

(He steps into the light.)

I need you to do something for me.

(Collins is calm. Pusher picks up a can of gasoline.)

Will you do something for me?

(Mulder, Scully and Burst are walking around the building when they hear a man sobbing.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(They hurry around to see Collins carrying the gasoline can, dumping some on the ground as he walks slowly. He is drenched in it. He carries an open lighter in the other hand.)

FRANK BURST: Collins?

COLLINS: God... God...

FRANK BURST: What the hell...

(Scully runs off.)

COLLINS: Stop me.

FRANK BURST: Collins, what the hell are you doing?

(Collins tries to light the lighter.)

MULDER: Collins, let it go.

COLLINS: Stop me!

(He sobs loudly, unable to control his actions. He lights it.)

FRANK BURST: Collins!

(Mulder takes off his coat. Collins jerks his head from side-to-side, trying to break Pusher's control.)

MULDER: Put that down.

(Collins screams and jams the lighter onto his chest. He erupts in flames just as Scully reappears with a fire extinguisher. She sprays Collins down as Mulder tackles him with the coat, smothering the flames. Other agents run over, shouting. Collins' flesh is already burnt off in most parts.)

COLLINS: Light up... light up, light up... light up... light up...

(Burst takes out his walkie-talkie.)

FRANK BURST: Come in, this is Burst! Get a burn crew down here. Yeah, Collins is down bad.

COLLINS: Light up... light up... light up...

FRANK BURST: Bad, yeah, real bad. I don't know what happened, get over here!

COLLINS: Light up... light up... light up... light up...

FRANK BURST: Yeah, get somebody over here! Now!

(Mulder hears a car horn blaring and runs over to it, followed by other agents. He opens the door and sees Pusher slumped against the car horn. Mulder aims his gun and pulls him back into his seat. Pusher looks drained.)

MULDER: Federal agent!

PUSHER: Light up... light up... light... light it up...

(He looks at Mulder and smiles.)

Oh. Bet you five bucks I get off.

(Rain starts to downpour.)



SCENE 5
HEARING ROOM A

(A court room, preliminary hearing. Pusher is seated with his attorney. The judge is seated at a desk in the front next to a chair. The bailiff stands, as does Pusher and his attorney.)

BAILIFF: State your name and address for the court.

PUSHER: Robert Patrick Modell. Thirty-eighty-three Roseneath Avenue, apartment nine, Alexandria, Virginia.

(Mulder is standing in the back with Burst. Pusher looks back at them and smirks. Scully is nearby. Afterwards, Mulder is in the witness stand.)

JUDGE: Agent Mulder, does the F.B.I. believe that this defendant is responsible for fourteen murders?

MULDER: That is correct, your honor.

JUDGE: Well, in each of the cases, the coroner's office ruled suicide.

MULDER: We believe that they were indeed murders, your honor.

JUDGE: You believe... but do you have any actual evidence?

MULDER: We have the defendant on audio tape confessing to the murders. On several separate occasions, he clearly identifies them as such. Furthermore, the defendant knows crime scene details that were only available to the police.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRENT: Your honor, one of these so-called "murder victims" threw herself in under a commuter train. This was a crowded platform. A hundred witnesses. Nobody pushed her. No one was within thirty feet of her.

(Scully is now seated in the audience, Burst is seated at the prosecution table.)

MULDER: But your client was present.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRENT: Which is how he knew your crime scene details.

JUDGE: Make your point, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I believe that these people died because it was the defendant's express will that they do so.

(Scully looks down, remembering how this line of reasoning got them in trouble with Tooms.)

JUDGE: His will?

MULDER: This man admitted to being a killer for hire. I believe he has a unique suggestive ability which makes for the perfect M.O. He is able to talk his victims into injuring themselves.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRENT: I can't believe this.

JUDGE: You want to run that by me one more time, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yesterday, a federal law enforcement officer was induced to self-immolation by the defendant. I witnessed it. All these other officers witnessed it.

FRANK BURST: Your honor, we have Modell's confession. All we're asking...

PROSECUTER: Your honor, the evidence chain to this case has been rather difficult to establish. We're asking the court's indulgence while we complete our investigation and we'd like to have Mister Modell held for trial based on the strength of his taped confession.

JUDGE: What about this audio tape, Mister Modell? Did you confess to... fourteen murders?

(His lawyer whispers in his ear.)

PUSHER: Unfortunately, yes, your honor. Not that I remember any of it.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRENT: This was, uh, basically, a drunken phone prank on the part of my client, your honor.

(Pusher is staring at the judge, who is staring back. It's obvious that Pusher is now mesmerizing the judge.)

MULDER: A phone prank? He had the details of every case, your honor.

DEFENSE ATTORNEY BRENT: And Robert deeply regrets the distress and confusion this situation has caused.

JUDGE: Do you deny these charges?

PUSHER: Absolutely, your honor. I'm not guilty.

(These words sink deeply into the judge. Afterwards, Pusher is walking out with Brent, shaking her hand.)

Thank you very much. Will you excuse me for a minute?

(They walk over to Mulder, Scully and Burst. The three are standing at the corner of the stairwell.)

I believe you owe me five dollars.

(Mulder sighs and pulls out his wallet. Burst is looking at Pusher with great disdain, but is glares are met with a smile. Mulder pulls out a five.)

MULDER: Hey, your shoe's untied.

(Pusher looks down, then back at Mulder.)

Made you look.

(He smiles. Pusher isn't amused.)

How do you do it?

(Pusher grabs at the bill, but Mulder pulls it away. Pusher smirks and nonchalantly walks down the rest of the stairs with his lawyer. Burst yells at him as Modell walks away.)

FRANK BURST: Hey, Modell. I know your name now. I know where you live!

(Pusher stops for a second, then keeps walking, never turning around.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder empties his clip into a "Q" on a piece of paper in the firing range, wearing goggles and ear protectors. Scully walks in behind him and takes off the ear protectors she was wearing. Mulder takes off his.)

SCULLY: I dug up a few more things on our Robert Patrick Modell.

MULDER: Let me guess. He was an average student, he attended an average community college, he did an average stint in the military.

SCULLY: Which branch of service?

MULDER: Not his first choice. He wanted to be a Navy Seal and then he wanted to be an Army Special Forces Green Beret. Promptly washed out of both, though not for lack of intelligence. He ended up being a supply clerk at Fort Bragg. Served two years, general discharge.

(Scully is impressed.)

SCULLY: Did you know that he applied to the F.B.I.?

(Mulder's eyebrows arch in surprise.)

He didn't even come close to passing the psyche screening.

MULDER: You got a copy of that?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(She hands him a folder.)

They found him to be acutely ego-centered. He has no regard for the feelings of others, instead perceiving people as objects. He's extremely suspicious of government and authority.

MULDER: Yet he wants to be in authority.

SCULLY: The screener caught him in a dozen self-aggrandizing lies... saying that he was a master of martial arts, that he had been trained by gurkhas in Nepal and ninjas in Japan.

MULDER: Well, ninjas are said to have the ability to cloud the minds of their opponents.

SCULLY: Are we talking kung-fu movies, Mulder?

MULDER: He certainly clouded the mind of that judge, Scully.

SCULLY: Even if Modell could, he didn't need to. We barely had a case against him.

MULDER: Oh, we had enough to get past a simple preliminary hearing. Modell psyched the guy out. He put the whammy on him.

SCULLY: Please explain to me the scientific nature of the "whammy."

MULDER: I don't know, maybe, maybe it's some mental aspect of some eastern martial art. You know, the temporary suppression of the brain's chemistry, produced by a specific timbre or cadence in Modell's voice. His voice seems to be the key.

SCULLY: Mulder, Modell's last known employment was as a convenience store clerk. He has never been trained by ninjas. He has never even been out of the U.S. He is just a little man who wishes that he were someone big... and, and, we're feeding that wish. That, that failed psyche screening... if, if Modell could actually control people's minds, right now, he'd be an F.B.I. agent, right? He'd be a Green Beret, uh, a Navy Seal.

MULDER: Maybe the ability came to him more recently, like in the last two years.

(Scully looks unsatisfied.)

Well, o, o, okay. What's your big theory? How do you explain what Agent Collins did? I mean, this was a sane man, a family man with no prior history of psychological problems, sets himself on fire. You witnessed that. How does that happen?

SCULLY: What do you need me to say, Mulder, that I believe that Modell is guilty of murder? I do. I'm just looking for an explanation a little more mundane than "the whammy."

MULDER: Well, he's laughing at us, Scully.

(The firing sheet slides forward. Downstairs, in the lobby, Pusher walks in. He looks over at the metal detector, then ducks behind a column and writes the word "PASS" on a piece of paper, then sticks it into his pocket where it is clearly visible. He walks through the gate and looks at the security guard, who is staring at the piece of paper.)

PUSHER: Excuse me. Where might I find the computer records section?

(The whammy is placed.)

LOBBY GUARD: Fourth floor, west wing.

PUSHER: Thank you very much.

(He walks around to the metal detector, waits for a second, and walks through. It goes off, but the security guard gives no notice. Pusher walks down the hall to the Computer Records Office, where Holly sits at her computer.)

HOLLY: Can I help you?

(Pusher closes the door, then starts to close all the blinds.)

PUSHER: I need to know some things... Holly.

(He smiles and closes the last of the blinds. In a few minutes, Holly is calling up a personal record. The screen reads:

"WARNING
The contents of personnel files are
the sole property of
The Federal Bureau of Investigation
No access without the express
authorization of the
director.")

Great. Just, uh, let me have the keyboard for a minute.

(Holly stands and Pusher sits down. He wipes his forehead, sighs, and starts to type a few things. He smiles, then turns to Holly, his voice soothing.)

I'd love a print-out of this...

(Holly leans over and starts to type.)

And a cup of coffee when you get the chance.

(He stares at the bruise on her face, rubbing his fingers lightly against it. Holly looks slightly confused, but still calmed, under his influence.)

I wish I could get my hands on the guy that did that you. I'd make him pay.

(Holly stares blankly. Skinner is walking by, reading a folder, when he sees the blinds closed. He hears some talking inside.)

This is great, Holly. It's perfect. What I wanted.

(He walks in to see Pusher and Holly standing. Pusher is holding the print-out.)

SKINNER: Can I help you?

PUSHER: No. No, thanks. We're, uh... we're just fine.

(Skinner looks down at the computer. Pusher glances at Holly, who is still under his power.)

Look, we're in the middle of something here, so...

SKINNER: Who are you and what are you doing here?

PUSHER: Take a walk, Mel Cooley.

(He pushes Skinner, but Skinner grabs his hand and twists it around into a hammerlock, then slams Pusher up against the filing cabinet. Pusher's other hand breaks some glasses sitting on top of it. Holly doesn't know what to do.)

Let me go! Let me go!

SKINNER: Shut up. Shut up! Holly... call security.

PUSHER: Holly. He's the one. He's the one who mugged you.

SKINNER: Holly, call security now!

PUSHER: Make him stop hurting me, Ho...

SKINNER: Shut up! Holly, now!

PUSHER: Holly?

SKINNER: Holly!

(He pushes the "0" key himself, then picks up the phone.)

MAN: Security.

SKINNER: Yeah, we've got a situation in here, fourth floor...

(Holly whips out a can of mace and sprays Skinner in the eyes. Skinner screams.)

Oh, God!

(He falls in pain. Pusher leans over to Holly.)

PUSHER: Hurt him back.

(He walks out. Holly starts to kick Skinner in the ribs repeatedly. They both grunt with each kick. Later, Holly is sitting in Skinner's office. Scully is sitting across from her. Skinner is standing nearby. He has a small bandage on the side of his face.)

HOLLY: I'm so terribly, terribly sorry. I don't know why I... oh, God...

(She sniffles, crying.)

I'm so sorry.

(Skinner turns to some agents behind him.)

SKINNER: All right, let's hit the bricks, huh?

(Everybody walks out except Scully, Skinner, and Holly. Skinner closes the door.)

SCULLY: Holly, can you tell us anything more that might help us understand why you attacked Assistant Director Skinner?

HOLLY: It's like suddenly, I was watching myself from across the room... doing these things. It's like he was with me inside my head.

(Mulder walks in.)

SCULLY: Modell?

(Holly nods slightly.)

HOLLY: That's the only way I know how to put it.

MULDER: Excuse me, sir? Can we speak outside?

SKINNER: Yeah, sure. Uh, Holly, excuse us for a minute, please.

(Scully, Skinner and Mulder step outside and close the door.)

MULDER: I reviewed the building's security tapes. Modell can clearly be seen entering and leaving unnoticed. He had the word "pass" on his lapel. Cars that waved him by don't even remember seeing him at all.

SKINNER: And you're saying this same mysterious phenomenon is the reason I have a size-seven heel mark in my face?

SCULLY: I have to agree with Agent Mulder, sir. I can't even begin to explain how, but I think that Modell is responsible for your injuries?

(Skinner turns to Mulder.)

SKINNER: Why is this guy so interested in you?

MULDER: What do you mean?

SKINNER: He left with one file, yours. He didn't access any others.

(Mulder nods.)

SCULLY: Now he knows where you live.

SKINNER: And you know where he lives. Go pick him up.

MULDER: Yeah, for what? About the only thing we got on him now is criminal trespass.

SKINNER: That's enough for a warrant.



SCENE 7
3083 ROSENEATH AVE., APT. 9; ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA

(The police burst down the door to Pusher's apartment, dressed in SWAT team garb and carrying rifles.)

MAN #1: Police! Get down!

MAN #2: Police! Get down!

(They start to swarm the apartment.)

MAN #3: Police, get down!

(Burst, Mulder and Scully walk in behind them.)

MAN #2: Modell!

SCULLY: Lights coming on!

(She flips on the lights.)

MAN #1: Not here.

(Scully walks over to the television, which is still on. "Svengali" is playing. The villain is hypnotizing a woman.)

MAN ON TV: Lighten the eyes... lighten the eyes...

WOMAN ON TV: Help me. Let me go.

SCULLY: Svengali.

WOMAN ON TV: No.

(Mulder sticks the warrant to the television. Two agents walk up to Mulder.)

MAN #2: All clear. No one's home.

MULDER: Search the whole building.

SCULLY: And nearby buildings too. We know that Modell likes to watch from a distance.

FRANK BURST: Check the place out. I'll talk to the neighbors.

(Mulder puts on rubber gloves and goes to the kitchen. Mulder opens the refrigerator and takes out one of the health food drinks Pusher purchased before.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, check this out.

(She walks over. He shows her the drink.)

"Mango Kiwi Tropical Swirl." Now we know we're dealing with a madman.

(He puts it back into the refrigerator, which is stocked to the brim with them. Afterwards, Scully is on the phone in the bathroom. Mulder is looking over Pusher's books.)

SCULLY: Is there anything else you can tell me? Yeah, yeah. When does it date to? Right.

(He puts the book down and walks over to her.)

Thank you very much.

(She hangs up and shows Mulder a bottle of pills.)

Tegretol.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: It's to relieve Modell's seizures. He has temporal-lobe epilepsy. I just talked to his doctor's office. They wouldn't give me much over the phone... just that that prescription dates back to April 1994.

(He takes the bottle.)

MULDER: What causes epilepsy this late in life?

SCULLY: Uh, head injury, neurological disease, a brain tumor or a lesion...

MULDER: Brain tumor? The growth of brain tumors has been linked with the reported occurrence of psychic ability.

SCULLY: Mulder, those reports are completely unsubstantiated.

MULDER: Just, just bear with me for a second. What if Modell's suggestive ability is really a form of psychokinesis?

SCULLY: Brought on by the brain tumor?

MULDER: Well, it fits. All those protein drinks in his fridge? Maybe he's got to replenish the metabolic energy that he uses in the process of controlling somebody's will.

SCULLY: Mulder, more to the point, if Modell did have a brain tumor, the effects on his health would be more debilitating. It's, it's likely that he simply wouldn't be well enough to play these cat-and-mouse games with us.

MULDER: Maybe he isn't. Maybe that's the whole point.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: His exhaustion at the driving range. He didn't let us capture him. He was too sick to escape, too tired, too wiped out. Why would a, a killer who is so proficient confess to murders that he'd already gotten away with? Maybe he's dying.

SCULLY: And he wants to go out in a blaze of glory.

MULDER: Not with a whimper but a bang.

(The phone to the apartment rings. Burst and an agent run over to the phone. Burst gets ready to answer it.)

FRANK BURST: Get the tracing gear.

(The other agent runs past Mulder and Scully to the other room. Burst picks up the phone.)

Hello?

PUSHER: Hey, hey, hey, what do you say?

(Burst signals wildly to Mulder and Scully, who run into the other room.)

FRANK BURST: What's up, Modell? How are you doing? Long time no see. Told you I knew where you lived.

(Mulder and Scully pick up the phone in the other, dimly lit room. Other agents run over to Burst with tracing gear and begin setting up the laptop and equipment.)

Uh, nice apartment, Modell. Who does your decorating? The Grinch that stole Christmas?

(Pusher chuckles.)

PUSHER: Agent Frank Burst, the guy with the great name. Say, Frank, are Agents Mulder and Scully there?

(Mulder and Scully are both listening in.)

MULDER: Yeah, we're here.

PUSHER: Perfect. Frank, how much do you weigh?

(The SWAT lieutenant, the SWAT Lieutenant, mouths the words "Yeah, we got it" and nods.)

FRANK BURST: Excuse me?

PUSHER: About how much do you weigh?

(Mulder is slightly taken aback by the question.)

FRANK BURST: Anything to keep you on the line, you stupid piece of... I don't know, about a hundred-ninety, hundred and ninety-five.

(The wiretap traces it to area code "703." Pusher laughs.)

PUSHER: Two-fifteen if you're a day, you're totally the wrong weight for your height. I mean, no offense, Frank, but you're built like a fireplug.

FRANK BURST: Yeah, and I got stubby little legs that are gonna kick you right in the ass. You going somewhere with this, Modell?

(Pusher chuckles. Mulder has figured out where this is going.)

PUSHER: Yeah, it's just that it can't be healthy. And you look like maybe you're a smoker, you probably take a little drink now and then, eat greasy fried food... sausage, bacon, eggs-over-easy.

MULDER: Frank...

PUSHER: Onion rings that soak those dark stains through the cardboard. And I'm guessing you shake on that salt like a maraca.

MULDER: Frank...

PUSHER: How about it? Am I packing it up on this?

MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone.

FRANK BURST: What are you talking about, Modell? What's your point?

PUSHER: Frank, you know what that's doing to your arteries.

(FIRST NUMBER OF THE CALL: Five.)

Terrible things, Frank. Terrible.

MULDER: Frank...

PUSHER: Waxy yellow chunks of plaque are tumbling through your bloodstream...

(Mulder angrily takes off his headset. The next number at Pusher's location is another five. Burst groans and winces in pain.)

Sticking like glue to your arterial walls...

(Mulder runs in.)

MULDER: Hang up the phone.

PUSHER: Squeezing shut your aorta... can you feel it, Frank?

(Mulder walks over to Burst, who grips the phone tightly despite his pain.)

MULDER: Come on, man, hang up the phone.

PUSHER: Can you feel your aorta...

MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone!

FRANK BURST: Back off!

(He reaches for the phone, but Burst pushes him away.)

PUSHER: ...closing shut? All those miles of aorta.

MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone!

FRANK BURST: I said back off!

(Mulder reaches to hang up the phone, but Burst grabs his hand pushes him away. Two agents hold Mulder against the wall.)

MULDER: Hang up!

(Wincing, Frank looks to the SWAT Lieutenant.)

PUSHER: The pressure...

FRANK BURST: Finish the trace.

(Scully walks in.)

PUSHER: Ever hear of pachyemia, Frank?

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Somebody hang up the phone!

(Scully looks to Frank, who is obviously in pain.)

PUSHER: Ever hear of a medical condition called pachyemia? It's when the blood thickens...

(Scully spots the wall socket and makes a dash for it.)

...up in your veins like strawberry jam.

(An agent stops her and holds her off to the side.)

FRANK BURST: Finish the trace!

MULDER: Frank, hang it up!

(There is a moment of tense silence as the SWAT Lieutenant, worried, looks at the screen. The number is "555-01" so far.)

PUSHER: Your heart flatlines...

(Pusher imitates a life support machine flatlining. Burst gasps and keels over.)

MULDER: Frank!

(The soldiers let him go.)

PUSHER: And you die, Frank.

(Scully and Mulder kneel over Burst. Mulder stares at the phone.)

Frank? Yo, Frank?

(Scully checks his pulse.)

SCULLY: No pulse. Get an ambulance.

(She turns him over. Agents start to run around, panicking.)

LEAD SWAT COP: Yeah, we need an ambulance, thirty-eighty-three Roseneath Avenue, apartment nine, possible cardiac arrest.

(Scully applies pressure to Burst's chest repeatedly, but gets no response. Mulder picks up the phone.)

MULDER: Modell?

PUSHER: Hey, Mulder. How's Frankie-boy?

(The SWAT Lieutenant picks back up the phone, resuming his position.)

MULDER: What is it, Modell, really, what you want?

PUSHER: A worthy adversary. It's obviously not that fat lout lying at your feet.

(Scully pinches Burst's nose and starts to give mouth-to-mouth.)

And I'm hoping it's you.

MULDER: Why me?

PUSHER: I've read all about you. You're a top criminal profiler. Oxford University grad, all-around bright, young man. You know what makes guys like me tick, right? You think you see right through old Bob Modell.

MULDER: Sick old Bob Modell, right? You're dying, aren't you, Bob? What, do you want to take a few innocent people with you before you go?

(Scully sighs and shakes her head. the SWAT Lieutenant looks horrified.)

PUSHER: Biology tells us we're all dying... and original sin tells me ain't nobody innocent.

MULDER: Yeah, and some are more innocent than others. Now why don't you just tell me where you are?

(Scully stands and rubs her forehead in frustration.)

PUSHER: Oh... you want the phone number? Sure. Just, uh... it's five-five-five oh-one-nine-seven.

(Mulder looks at the SWAT Lieutenant, who lowers the phone. The same number is the one traced.)

You know it's just a payphone. In two minutes, I'll be gone.

MULDER: You mean you killed this man for nothing, you sick bastard?

(Pusher chuckles.)

PUSHER: Me? No, haven't you caught on, Mulder? They all kill themselves.

(He hangs up. Mulder immediately looks to the SWAT Lieutenant.)

MULDER: Where's Modell calling from?

SWAT LIEUTENANT: The gas station parking lot. Twelve-thousand block Chain Bridge Road.

(He turns the monitor to show a map of the city and a red dot over a gas station parking lot.)

It's a payphone... just like he said.

(Mulder stares at the monitor. Down Chain Bridge Road is Fire Dept., and the other way is Fairfax Mercy Hospital.)

MULDER: Fairfax Mercy Hospital is right down the street from there, huh?

(Scully whispers to herself.)

SCULLY: Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy...

(She takes out the empty pill container, holding it with a cloth.)

"Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy." He must need regular treatment, Mulder.

MULDER: Well, let's go find out.



SCENE 8
FAIRFAX MERCY HOSPITAL

(Snipers set up positioning on the roofs of all adjoining and nearby buildings, poised to open fire on Modell at any of the openings.)

MAN #1: Okay, unit two is ready.

(The man listening to the headphones waves some more agents by. They set up behind every car, the headphones garbling messages. They start nodding to each other, and a man moves for the parking lot. Inside a van, Mulder, Scully and the SWAT Lieutenant have set up with monitors and recordings.)

He's not in his car. Engine's still warm. He's probably in the building.

MAN #2: All entrances covered. Do we hold or go in?

(Scully is listening on the phone. There is a moment of tense silence.)

MULDER: Hold.

SCULLY: Right, thank you.

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Hold.

(Scully hangs up.)

SCULLY: The outpatient office says Modell is scheduled for a two-thirty M.R.I. That's right now.

SWAT LIEUTENANT: How do you want to play this?

MULDER: I think I should go in alone.

SCULLY: Why?

SWAT LIEUTENANT: My team could flush him out.

MULDER: What if Modell turns one of your men against the others... in a crowded hospital? I think we should give him what he wants.

SCULLY: You.

(She is disappointed and worried.)

MULDER: We stand a better chance if we're separated. I'll go on mike. That way, you'll know what he's doing and where he is at all times.

(Scully shakes her head, not liking this plan.)

You got a radio so I can keep my hands free?

SWAT LIEUTENANT: I got just what you need.

(He takes out a metal box marked "Eyes and Ears" and opens it. There is a headset with a microphone, headphone and camera inside. He attaches the bulletproof vest to Mulder, complete with battery hook-up, and Mulder turns around so he can attach the headset.)

Two-lux video camera. It'll practically see in the dark.

(Scully sits off to the side, watching, despondent.)

It's designed for bomb disposal work to keep only one officer at risk. See?

(There is a monitor receiving the feed. Mulder looks around and everything shows up on the monitor perfectly.)

MULDER: Think I get the Playboy channel?

(They both chuckle. Mulder looks over to Scully and kneels down in front of her. She is also on the monitor.)

Smile, Scully.

(He grins. Scully just stares at him, then looks away. Mulder frowns and hands her his gun.)

SCULLY: Take it.

MULDER: No. I wouldn't want to end up pointing it at anybody except Modell.

(She looks about to cry. She places her hands over his, which are on her knees. They stare at each other.)

Let's get this show on the road.

(Mulder nonchalantly walks through the emergency sliding doors past a confused doctor. Everybody watches him go by. As he walks past the nurse at the desk, he shows her his badge.)

Federal agent, go about your business as usual.

(She nods. He keeps walking.)

Scully, do you read me?

(Cut to the van, where Scully has a headset on, watching the monitor.)

SCULLY: I'm with you, Mulder.

(On the headset, from Mulder's point of view, he walks by a young couple. Mulder is not visible at all.)

MULDER: Nothing out of the ordinary.

(The SWAT Lieutenant talks into his headset.)

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Swat team, hold outside.

MAN: Swat team still holding.

(The two watch the monitor intently. Mulder looks inside a few rooms and sees no one except for some bed-ridden patients and nurses. A gunshot goes off, and the people around Mulder jump, startled.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(Mulder hurries down the hallway. Another gunshot goes off.)

MULDER: Two shots fired.

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Swat team!

MULDER: No, not yet!

(People, such as nurses and patients, start to run by Mulder. The reception becomes garbled.)

Everybody keep moving! Federal agent! Let me see what the hell's going on.

SCULLY: We're losing you!

(Mulder heads for a sign that reads "Intensive Care." The picture goes out, turning to static. Scully takes off her headset and stands.)

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Mulder! Agent Mulder!

(A picture starts to return.)

Wait, Agent Scully!

(She looks back at the monitor and sees two men down on the ground, a guard and a doctor, the picture and sound returning.)

MULDER: You, uh, you getting this back there?

(She sits down and puts on the headset. Cut to the hospital. Mulder walks up to the dead bodies, both bleeding massively from gunshot wounds to the head. He leans over the doctor. Cut to the van monitor. Mulder's hand reaches out and takes the doctor's pulse. He then looks towards the guard. Two shells litter the floor.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened?

(Cut to the hospital.)

MULDER: Looks like the guard shot the technician, then he shot himself.

(Cut to the van. Mulder looks at the guard's empty holster and points to it.)

His gun is missing. the SWAT Lieutenant, tell your men Modell may be heading your way.

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Swat team!

(Cut to Mulder, who looks up slowly.)

Suspect is armed and is possibly...

(Cut back to the van. Mulder is staring at a desk with a monitor showing a scan of a brain.)

....making his way out of the building.

MAN #1: We copy. We're ready for him.

MAN #2: Shooters in position.

SCULLY: Mulder, wait, wait. Get close to the computer monitor.

(Cut to Mulder. He stands and leans over to the computer monitor.)

MULDER: Over here.

SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.

(Cut to the van. The picture of the brain has a large white mass on the left cerebrum.)

There. That light mass in his temporal lobe.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Right here.

(Cut to the van. Mulder's finger points to the white mass.)

SCULLY: You were right, Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Now check around you. Modell's chart should be somewhere around there.

(He starts looking around the desk. He picks up a folder and flips through it. He reads quickly, then mouths some words to himself, thinking.)

MULDER: We're batting a thousand, Scully. Modell's dying. He's got nothing to lose.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, just get out of there.

(Cut to Mulder. His eyes slowly move upward.)

Go.

(Mulder stares into the next room, thinking. The catscan machine is placed in the center, but the room is empty. Cut to Scully.)

Mulder?

(Cut to Mulder. He thinks for a second, then spins around quickly to see Pusher directly behind him, gun point-blank in Mulder's face.)

Mulder!

(Pusher grabs the headset, and the view goes black.)

God!

(She rips off her headset and rushes out, followed by the SWAT lieutenant. Down the hall, SWAT team members are lining the halls, armed and ready. The SWAT lieutenant walks down the hall with Scully, who is now wearing a bulletproof vest.)

SWAT LIEUTENANT: We think they're three doors down. We got both ends sewed up tight, but there are six critical care rooms we can't get to. If we gas the halls, we might kill those patients.

(Scully hands her gun to the lieutenant and prepares to go in.)

Why do we keep giving this guy exactly what he wants?

SCULLY: Just wait for a signal from me.

(He nods, putting the gun in his vest and putting on his goggles.)

SWAT MEMBER: You're clear.

(Scully walks down the hall. The lieutenant arms himself and watches. Scully looks into the first room and sees a bald man hooked up to monitors. She moves over to the second door and slowly opens it. Two women hooked-up to life support. Opening the door farther, she sees Mulder seated at a table, staring blankly at the wall in front of him.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(She opens the door more and sees that Mulder is staring at Pusher, who sits directly across from him. The gun rests between Pusher's hands, which are flat on the table. Mulder's are as well. She walks in very slowly, unsure of what is going on. Pusher and Mulder never take their eyes off each other.)

PUSHER: Thanks for joining us.

SCULLY: We've got a dozen law enforcement officers outside in the hall... another thirty in the parking lot.

PUSHER: Regular convention.

SCULLY: So whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work out the way you it want to.

(Pusher continues to stare at Mulder angrily.)

PUSHER: You don't know what I got planned.

(Scully looks down at the gun, then at Mulder, who is expressionless. She sits down in the chair nearest the door exactly between them. Pusher picks up the revolver and checks the chamber.)

Two warriors of equal skill fight to the death. One is a student of Japanese budo... the way of war.

(He spins the chamber, which only contains one bullet.)

Budo teaches the warrior to leave himself outside the battle. In other words...

(He closes the chamber.)

To disregard his own death.

(He places the gun down.)

Because of that, the budo warrior always wins. I am that warrior. I don't fear my death. So I...

(He slides the gun over between Mulder's hands, handle first.)

I'm going to give you... one pull of the trigger against me.

(Scully's eyes are wide, staring at Mulder.)

One-in-six chance.

(Mulder continues to stare at Pusher, moving his hand down onto the gun. Pusher puts his hand on top of Mulder's quickly.)

One. One pull.

(Mulder fits his finger into the trigger and lifts the gun, aiming it nonchalantly at Pusher.)

SCULLY: Wait. Mulder, look... there's pure oxygen in this room.

(The chamber can be heard clicking lowly.)

There's no telling what could happen if you pull that trigger...

(He pulls the trigger, but the bullet isn't in the chamber. Scully gasps slightly, having been cut off in mid-sentence. After a few seconds, Pusher exhales deeply, his body relaxing slowly. He smirks, out of breath from fear.)

PUSHER: Piece of cake. Your turn.

(Scully's eyes go to Mulder again.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no.

PUSHER: Mulder, yes.

(Scully is about to cry.)

PUSHER: Go.

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me. Give me the gun. We can stop this thing right now. You and I can walk outside of this room...

(Mulder cringes and jerks the barrel to his head while pulling the trigger in one quick, fluid motion. No gunshot. Scully stands and pounds the table with both hands, near tears, glaring at Pusher.)

No! Damn you! You bastard! Mulder, hand me the g...

(She reaches for the gun, but Mulder's head jerks back up, glaring at Pusher, aiming the gun at his controller. Scully sobs shallowly, no tears forthcoming though. Mulder nonchalantly moves his arm and points the gun at Scully. Her eyes widen. She breathes shallowly.)

Mulder, you don't have to do this. You're stronger than this.

PUSHER: Your turn, Scully. Got to play by the rules. Pull the trigger, Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, fight him. You can fight this.

PUSHER: Come on. Pull the trigger, Mulder. She shot you, I read it in her files. Payback time... shoot the little spy!

(Scully looks at the mirror across the way from her and spots a fire alarm on the back wall in the hallway. Mulder speaks angrily, glaring but not at Scully, even though that is who he must face.)

MULDER: I'm going to kill you, Modell.

PUSHER: Yeah, pull the trigger, you get another crack at me.

(Scully slowly starts to back out of the room.)

MULDER: Scully, run! Scully...

(His finger tenses on the finger. The chamber starts to turn, clicking into position. She stares at him, then runs out and pulls the alarm. The alarm blares and Pusher looks away from Mulder for the first time, over to Scully. He looks back at Mulder, who turns to him, glaring, and points the gun. Modell gasps. Mulder pulls the trigger and Pusher is shot, slamming against the back of his chair, then falling. Mulder stands, tips over the table and continues to dry-fire at Pusher, even though he knows the chamber is empty. Other agents swarm in.)

SWAT LIEUTENANT: Federal agents! Get down, get down, get down!

(Mulder continues to pull the trigger until finally lowering the gun. The alarm continues to ring. Scully looks at him, worried. He hands the gun to her, then puts his elbows on his knees and his face in his hands. Pusher is hooked up to a respirator, although it is covered with bandages, along with most of his face. In fact, his whole body is pretty much bandaged, life-support systems around him. Mulder stands over him silently, watching with disdain. Scully walks into the hospital room behind him.)

SCULLY: There's no telling how long he'll hang on, but he'll never regain consciousness.

(Mulder nods slightly.)

MULDER: You know, we thought he was undergoing treatment. We were wrong.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Read his chart. The M.R.I.s were a way to gauge how much life he had left, but he consistently refused treatment. The tumor remained operable right up until the end, but he refused to have it removed.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: I think it was like you said. He was always such a... little man. This was finally something that made him feel big.

(Scully looks down slightly, acknowledging the fact quietly. She takes his hand.)

SCULLY: I say we don't let him take up another minute of our time.

(She walks out. He stares at Pusher disdainfully for a second, then follows.)

SCENE 1
TESO DOS BICHOS EXCAVATION
ECUADOR HIGHLANDS
SOUTH AMERICA

(South American natives working at archeological dig site. One of them finds something and gets very excited.)

MAN: Ven aqui! Ven aqui! Ven! Aver.

OTHER MEN: (running to him) Nos debemos irnos y dejarlo en paz. Debemos decirle al anciano. El sabra que hacer. Esto es malo, muy malo. Nos va a traer problemas para todos nosotros.

(LONNIE BILAC, a dig supervisor, looks at the find in awe.)

BILAC: Le tenemos que decir al Doctor Roosevelt. Inmediatamente.

(BILAC runs to the tent of DR. ROOSEVELT, an American, in charge of the dig.)

BILAC: Dr. Roosevelt.

DR. ROOSEVELT: What is it?

BILAC: We found something I think you should see.

(DR. ROOSEVELT follows BILAC back to where the MEN are all standing around upset, shaking their heads. DR. ROOSEVELT kneels down reverently beside a large broken urn with a small skeleton inside it.)

DR. ROOSEVELT: It's an Amaru.

BILAC: I know.

DR. ROOSEVELT: It's fantastic. It's nearly intact.

BILAC: We cant take it.

DR. ROOSEVELT: What do you mean?

BILAC: They're saying the body of a female shaman is sacred to the tribe. They won't allow us to disturb her.

DR. ROOSEVELT: (insistent) Were not disturbing her. Were saving her. You know the situation here. I thought you could handle these people. (starts back to his tent)

BILAC: (pause) Dr. Roosevelt, I think this is dangerous. I don't think this is right.

DR. ROOSEVELT: Have the piece cleared and packed. It's going with us.

(MEN chanting and singing "Guybidae" BILAC looks up to see a SHAMAN looking down at the dig disapprovingly.)

(Later that night, DR. ROSENFELD is listening to classical music in his tent. He turns down the music for a moment to listen to what sounds like very loud crickets, then shrugs and turns the music back up.)

(CUT TO: MEN are circled around a fire playing drums and maraca-like things that make the weird cricket sound. Elders of the tribe performing a ritual around a cauldron with a yellow liquid which they ceremonially drink as they chant. BILAC sits with them and also drinks the yellow liquid. He winces, then we see his perspective is now blurred and yellowish.)

(CUT TO: Blurred, yellowish, animalistic perspective fast approaching DR. ROOSEVELTs tent. We see the shadow cat-like figure as it attacks DR. ROOSEVELT. He screams. For a long time.)

SCENE 2
HALL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
BOSTON MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
THREE WEEKS LATER

(SECURITY GUARD walks through the exhibits. Passes a stuffed jaguar.)

GUARD: Mr. Horning, you still here? Mr. Horning? (steps in a puddle of red liquid) What the hell ...?

(Shines flashlight over worktable and sees more blood. Terrified, he runs out of the room. Camera closes in on the urn that was taken from the dig site.)



SCENE 3

(Museum. Next morning. Crime scene. MULDER is looking around. SCULLY interviews DR. LEWTON, a member of the museum staff.)

SCULLY: How did you learn about what happened here last night?

DR.LEWTON: Tim Decker, one of our security guards, called me when he first discovered the blood.

SCULLY: According to the police, you felt this murder may have been an act of political terrorism.

DR.LEWTON: I think Craig Horning was killed because of the project he was working on.

SCULLY: Is that the survey and excavation of the uh (reads) "highland burial grounds of the Secona Indians?" (he seems surprised, doesnt answer) This is from a letter that was sent to the State Department on behalf of the Secona demanding the return of a certain artifact.

DR.LEWTON: The Amaru Urn. It was among the antiquities we rescued last month.

SCULLY: Rescued?

DR.LEWTON: When Petroecuadot announced plans to build a gas pipeline through the burial grounds Carl Roosevelt and I organized the dig.

SCULLY: As I understand it, Roosevelt disappeared under circumstances not dissimilar to the ones here.

DR.LEWTON: The Ecuadorean government claimed he was carried off in some kind of wild animal attack.

(MULDER is listening.)

SCULLY: But thats not what you believe.

DR.LEWTON: Not after last night.

SCULLY: Have there ever been any death threats?

DR.LEWTON: No.

MULDER: Well, what about the curse? The Secona believe great evil would befall anyone that disturbed the remains of an Amaru, a woman shaman  that they would be devoured by the Jaguar Spirit.

DR.LEWTON: A myth that gained some currency among the Secona when Dr. Roosevelt disappeared.

MULDER: (very dry) Im sure.

DR.LEWTON: The unfortunate thing is somebody exploiting it to promote fear, to pressure us into returning the bones which I have absolutely no intention of doing.

MULDER: Can we see it?

DR.LEWTON: Yes, of course. (calls to young woman across the room, MONA WUSTNER) Uh, Mona.

(MONA, MULDER, and SCULLY wheel the Urn into a back room.)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Personally, if someone digs me up in 1,000 years I hope there's a curse on them too.

MONA: They should have left it buried. None of this would have happened.

MULDER: Do you believe the bones are cursed?

MONA: Might as well be.

SCULLY: Did you know Craig Horning?

MONA: Yeah, I've been helping Craig sort and catalog the Ecuadorean artifacts. I'm a PHd. candidate at BU.

SCULLY: Did he have any warning that this could happen?

MONA: Craig? No. He was so dedicated. He was just doing the work that Dr. Lewton asked him to.

MULDER: He had no political feelings about the piece being brought here?

MONA: No, not Craig.

SCULLY: Are you aware that a letter of protest was sent to the State Department concerning this urn?

MONA: Im aware of several letters of protest.

SCULLY: This one was written by a man named Alonzo Bilac.

MONA: Dr. Bilac. He was the liaison with the Secona Indians.

SCULLY: Is he still with the project?

MONA: No, he either resigned or was forced out by Dr. Lewton depending on who you talk to.

SCULLY: Why is that?

MONA: Dr. Bilac feels the Secona have the right to determine the fate of their ancestral remains.

MULDER: Do you know where we might find him?

(MONA looks reluctant.)



SCENE 4

(MULDER and SCULLY knock at BILACs front door. BILAC slowly opens it.)

SCULLY: Dr. Bilac?

BILAC: (he is speaking very slowly, dreamlike) Yes.

SCULLY: (showing badge) Were with the FBI. Were investigating the disappearance of an associate of yours --- Craig Horning.

BILAC: Yes.

SCULLY: May we ask you some questions?

BILAC: Come in then.

(MULDER and SCULLY follow him inside. SCULLY interviews BILAC while MULDER looks at the many pictures and artifacts on the walls. He still listens very closely to everything BILAC says.)

SCULLY: Dr. Bilac, you were part of the expedition that brought back the Amaru urn.

BILAC: Who told you that?

SCULLY: Mona Wustner.

BILAC: I objected from the beginning.

SCULLY: But you were Dr. Roosevelt's liaison in Ecuador. At what point did you part company with him on the taking of artifacts?

BILAC: When I felt like he had gone too far. Against the wishes of the Secona.

SCULLY: Did you express that to him?

BILAC: Yes. He wouldnt listen.

SCULLY: Were you speaking for yourself or for the Indians?

BILAC: I spent the last six months living with the Secona, learning from them, coming to understand the nature and the depth of their culture.

SCULLY: Well, apparently, theyve learned something from you too.

BILAC: Yes, I've been teaching them the joys of American bureaucracy.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

SCULLY: Dr. Lewton believes that the protest over the Amaru urn has something to do with Craig Horning's disappearance.

BILAC: You say disappearance as if you expect to see him alive again.

SCULLY: What do you think happened to him?

BILAC: You don't want to know what I think.

MULDER: Yes, we would like to know. We'd be very interested in what you think. (sits beside him)

BILAC: I think whatever happened to Craig Horning will continue to happen until the bones are returned to their rightful place.

SCULLY: Let me ask you, Dr. Bilac. How far would you go to defend the rights of the Seconas? Farther than writing a letter to the state department?

BILAC: If you think I did this, then youre a fool.

SCULLY: Can you account for your whereabouts last night?

BILAC: I was here.

MULDER: Alone?

BILAC: Yes. Your investigation is a waste of time and that's something I can assure you of.

(MULDER and SCULLY share a look. SCULLY raises eyebrows.)



SCENE 5

(MULDER and SCULLY exiting the house, alone.)

MULDER: It's nice to meet people who really believe in something, isn't it?

SCULLY: You mean the kind who would kill for their cause?

MULDER: Do you think Bilac's a suspect?

SCULLY: No. I think he's *the* suspect.

MULDER: Based on what?

SCULLY: Based on the arrogance of his politics, on his rift with Dr. Lewton, on his sympathies towards the Indians. And the lack of any other suspect.

MULDER: He did look a little squirrely back there.

SCULLY: Maybe because he was up late murdering Craig Horning.

MULDER: Well, let me remind you we don't have a body and not much more forensic detail than a lot of spilled blood.

SCULLY: Craig Horning's blood. What do you think he did with him?

MULDER: I'm not sure he did anything.

SCULLY: You think Bilac's innocent? That the victim wasn't even murdered at all? That he was devoured by a mythological jaguar spirit?

MULDER: Go with it, Scully.

(MULDER gets in car. After, pausing to roll her eyes, SCULLY joins him.)



SCENE 6

(MONA on phone alone at night in the museum.)

MONA: (on phone) Why did you lie to them? You're only drawing suspicion to yourself by lying, Lonnie.  You should have told them the truth.I'm worried about you. .Let me come over. Why? Why not?

(She is startled by the sound of the door creaking. DR. LEWTON enters.)

MONA: (on phone) Dr. Lewton's here. I got to go. I'll call you later. (hangs up)

DR. LEWTON: Thought you'd already left.

MONA: (nervous) I have, uh...I really need to keep working right now.

DR. LEWTON: I'd feel better if you weren't alone here.

MONA: The guard knows I'm here.

DR. LEWTON: Was that Dr. Bilac on the phone?

MONA: Yes.

DR. LEWTON: We have a responsibility, Mona, to history and posterity. Dr. Roosevelt was only doing what any good conservationist would have done in bringing the Amaru urn back. Otherwise, it would certainly have been destroyed.

MONA: I know.

LEWTON: You know, if we get caught up in the politics we lose sight of that. (starts to leave) Mona, let me give you a little free advice. You have a bright future here. Be careful where you plant your flag.

(He exits. MONA starts as she hears a door creak, then relaxes as she sees her Golden Retriever, SUGAR, Vancouvers Worst Canine Actor, come into the room.)

MONA: Oh, Sugar.



SCENE 7

(DR. LUTEN goes out to his car and tries to start it. It sounds like theres a problem with the battery. We hear heavy breathing, and see distorted view of DR. LUTEN as if through something elses eyes. He opens the hood and leans over to look in the engine. He reaches in and touches something small and furry covered in blood. Looks at blood now on his fingers. Heavy breathing intensifies, then suddenly DR. LUTEN is attacked and screams for a long time as his body is mauled and dragged away. Lots of chewing and slurping sounds.)



SCENE 8

(Next morning. SCULLY is leaning over the engine of the car from last night. She is assisted by an OFFICER holding an evidence bag. From the engine, she pulls out half a dead rat and holds it out to the OFFICER who is clearly not pleased to have to take it.)

SCULLY: Label that.

OFFICER: As what?

SCULLY: (as if the answer is obvious) Partial rat body part.

(SCULLY crosses to MONA who is standing with a POLICEMAN.)

SCULLY: Excuse me Can I have a word with you? You were working here last night when Dr. Lewton was killed.

MONA: (not willing to give any information) He stopped by my office on his way out.

SCULLY: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Was he behaving strange or did he seem nervous about anything?

MONA: No, not at all.

SCULLY: Did he say anything to you about Dr. Bilac?

MONA: No, he didn't.

SCULLY: Do you have any idea when the two of them last spoke to each other?

MONA: I really don't know.

SCULLY: (giving up) I'm going to give you my card. Call me if anything comes to mind.

(SCULLY joins MULDER who is searching in the woods. There is an aerial shot of MULDER through the blurred yellow perspective.)

SCULLY: Mulder

MULDER: They turn up a body?

SCULLY: No. They've been over the entire museum grounds. Have you found anything at all out here?

MULDER: If Dr. Lewton was brought through here, it's going to be hard to determine. It looks like it rained pretty hard last night.

SCULLY: Well, they determined that the hood release had been pulled. They found a small flashlight near the car. Looks to me like he was checking the engine when attacked.

MULDER: Maybe somebody didn't want that car started.

SCULLY: I dont think so, Mulder.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: We found evidence of at least two mutilated rat bodies down in the engine compartment.

MULDER: Rats?

SCULLY: Apparently, the museum has always had a rat problem. They must have crawled into the engine to keep warm.

(They walk farther into the woods.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, there's hardly a thing about these deaths that adds up.

MULDER: Whats he estimate on the time of death?

SCULLY: Somewhere between 9:30 and midnight when the guard discovered the blood.

MULDER: That's about the same time as Craig Horning.

SCULLY: Whats the connection?

MULDER: I dont know.

SCULLY: I think Mona Wustner might know something.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: Well, she seemed to get nervous when I asked her about Bilac. Maybe shes trying to protect him.

(Red liquid drips down onto MULDERs face.)

MULDER: I think its starting to rain again.

SCULLY: I dont think so, Mulder.

(SCULLY wipes a drop of blood off MULDERs temple. They look up and see, 20 feet off the ground, about four feet of something that looks like bloody small intestine hanging from a tree.)

MULDER: What the hell is that? (wipes at his temple in disgust)



SCENE 9

(MONA knocks at BILACs door. No answer. She opens the door and enters.)

MONA: Lonnie?

(No one answers.)

MONA: Lonnie? (she reaches for the light)

BILAC: Dont.

MONA: Lonnie? I came to tell you... Dr. Lewton is dead. Did you hear what I said? Say something, Lonnie, please. You're scaring me.

BILAC: I told you not to come here.

MONA: Why not? What's happened to you? Ever since you came back you're acting like some stranger. Like someone else.

BILAC: The blood has to stop.

MONA: You know something, dont you?

BILAC: You wouldnt understand.

MONA: Then help me to understand! (sees bowl of yellow liquid in front of BILAC) You can tell me. You know that, don't you? What is that?

BILAC: Vine of the soul.

MONA: (shocked and angry) Yahe?! Youre drinking Yahe?!!! (pushes bowl off table, he grabs it) You're sick, Lonnie! You need help. Don't you see what's happening here? Can't you see what you're doing to yourself?

BILAC: Go.

MONA: Let me help you.

BILAC: I said GET OUT!!!!!

(Crying, MONA leaves.)



SCENE 10

(Autopsy bay. SCULLY performing autopsy with MULDER observing.)

SCULLY: Well, it's human. Small intestine. There's about four feet of jejunum and another foot of ileum.

MULDER: Do we know for sure it's Lewton?

SCULLY: Yeah, by what he had for lunch. Corn chowder. It looks like he'd been snacking on sunflower seeds all afternoon.

MULDER: A man of taste.

SCULLY: What I can't determine how the body was eviscerated. There are no knife marks on the epithelium. I imagine they could have been torn or pulled from the body cavity.

MULDER: Torn or pulled?

SCULLY: But I can't determine that, either, because there was considerable postmortem predation.

MULDER: By what?

SCULLY: Well, by the size of the bite marks, a small animal, most probably a rat.

MULDER: More rats.

SCULLY: Yep.

(SCULLYs cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully?. Slow down, Mona.

MONA: (on phone in museum with SUGAR the dog) I I was with Dr. Bilac. He frightened me. I  I thought he was going to hurt me.

SCULLY: (on phone) What happened, Mona?

MONA: (on phone) Hes sick. He doesnt know what hes doing.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Where is he now?

MONA: (on phone) At his house. I left him there and I came back to the museum. But I feel like someones here. Like someones watching me.

(Beside her, the dog SUGAR barks.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I want you to stay exactly where you are. Im going to send Agent Mulder over to get you, right away, okay? Hes on his way.

MONA: Okay.

(MONA hangs up and begin working again on the urn. SUGAR keeps barking at the door and cameraman.)

MONA: What is it Sugar?

(Slowly, MONA walks toward the bathroom. She hears a faint clattering sound.. MONA goes into the bathroom. SUGAR stays outside the bathroom. Loud banging sound. She opens one of the stalls and sees the closed toilet lid bouncing and clattering as if it is being pushed from beneath. The sound is coming from all the stalls. She reaches out and lifts the lid. Rats begin swarming out of the toilet. MONA screams.)



SCENE 11

(SCULLY arrives at BILACs house.)

SCULLY: Dr. Bilac?

(No one is home. Door is open. She enters uses flashlight, no light switch to find the Yahe, and his journals and a stuffed jaguar.)



SCENE 12

(MULDER walking through museum. Runs into the GUARD.)

GUARD: Oh! What are you doing here?

MULDER: Looking for Mona Wustner. I got a panicked call from her.

GUARD: From Mona?

MULDER: Yeah, where is she?

GUARD: I'll show you.

(They go to the room with the Urn. No MONA. MULDERs cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me. Did you find Mona?

MULDER: (on phone) No, but her car is parked outside. Shes not here. Did you find Bilac?

SCULLY: (on phone) No. Hes not here either. But I found his journals. "I've seen the Amaru coming out of the jungle with the eyes of a scorpion, the claws of a jaguar. She leaps down from the trees. She tears at my flesh, then holds my head in her hands, and eats out my eyes."

MULDER: (on phone) Is there a date of entry on that?

SCULLY: (on phone) These are all recent.

MULDER: (on phone) Read about the jaguar coming down from the trees again.

SCULLY: (on phone) Why?

MULDER: (on phone) Maybe thats how the intestines got up there.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I think Bilacs been tripping. I found something strange in a ceremonial bowl and - and from his writings it says that its .. its a hallucinogen called "Yaje." "The Vine of the Soul."

MULDER: (on phone) What the hells that supposed to mean?

SCULLY: (on phone) I think he's been praying to the Amaru through some kind of a ceremony.

MULDER: (on phone) What's he want from her?

SCULLY: (on phone) It looks like he's invoking the curse, Mulder.

(MULDER sees bloody water coming from under the closed bathroom door.)

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, I'm going to have to call you back.

SCULLY: (on phone) Did you find Mona?

MULDER: (on phone) I hope not. (hangs up)

(MULDER draws his gun and walks cautiously into bathroom which is covered with water. The walls are covered with blood. MULDER finds BILAC huddled in a stall, shaking.)

MULDER: What are you doing here? (no answer) I said, what are you doing here?

BILAC: She's dead.



SCENE 13

(Interrogation of BILAC. SCULLY questions. MULDER listens.)

SCULLY: Where is she?

BILAC: I don't know.

SCULLY: You told Agent Mulder that she was dead. You must know where she is.

BILAC: I didn't kill her.

SCULLY: Then why do you have blood on your clothes?

BILAC: I told you. I came here because the Amaru would not be appeased. I was afraid for Mona. I tried to keep her away from all this... She was an innocent.

SCULLY: She said she was scared. She said that you became violent.

BILAC: She wouldnt listen.

SCULLY: Maybe you were too high to know the difference. There is no curse, is there, Dr. Bilac? You are the curse.

BILAC: No. This is more powerful than any man. This is a spirit you're dealing with-- the spirit of the Amaru. This is not something you can put in handcuffs.

(MULDER quickly exits the room. SCULLY watches him go, then turns back to BILAC.)

SCULLY: Im going to ask you one more time, Dr, Bilac, where is Monas body?

BILAC: I don't know.

(SCULLY stares at him, then goes out of the room.)

SCULLY: (to OFFICER and GUARD at door) That man stays in that room until there's a full search of the museum, okay?

OFFICER: Yes, ma'am.

MULDER: (from the bathroom) Hey, Scully! Come here for a second. (she joins him) Just dawned on me. Why do you think there's so much water in here?

SCULLY: I just assumed that one of the toilets had overflowed.

MULDER: There's water on every seat. It's more like every toilet overflowed. Now, why would that happen?

SCULLY: There's only one way to find out.

MULDER: (not thrilled) I hate this.

(Looks in toilet. Dead rats floating.)

MULDER: Rats.

(Looks in the other toilets. More rats.)

MULDER: In every toilet.

SCULLY: How did they get in there.

GUARD: (entering) Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Yeah.

GUARD: The police found something outside.

SCULLY: Mona Wustner?

GUARD: No. Sugar  her dog. Hes dead.

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Finally a body.

(They exit.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER and SCULLY enter examination room where VETERINARIAN is finishing autopsy on SUGAR.)

SCULLY: What did you find?

VETERINARIAN: I have to run a full toxicological to be sure but it looks like warfarin poisoning.

SCULLY: Warfarin?

VETERINARIAN: Rat poison.

MULDER: Someone fed this dog rat poison?

VETERINARIAN: No. When I dissected the dog's stomach I found an undigested fragment of intestine which appears to be feline.

SCULLY: The dog ate a cat.

VETERINARIAN: I also found what appears to be bits of rat fur. I think the rat ate the poison.

SCULLY: The cat ate a rat.

MULDER: And the dog ate the cat. (SCULLY gives him a small smile.) More rats, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER puts his hand on her shoulder and pulls her to the side.)

MULDER: Don't you think that's significant?

SCULLY: Significant of what?

MULDER: There were rats in Dr. Lewton's car engine. There were rats in the bathroom where it looks like Mona might have been killed and now here.

SCULLY: Its an old building, Mulder. They have a rat problem. A lot of old buildings have rats.

MULDER: No, no. I think its more than that. What is it that the Secona believe? That the jaguar spirit will devour anybody that desecrates the burial place of a holy woman. Essentially, theyre talking about transmigration of the soul into animal form achieved through a ceremony where they drink, the uh...

SCULLY: Yaje.

MULDER: Yeah. To summon the spirits.

SCULLY: So, what are we talking here, Mulder, a possessed rat? The return of Ben?

MULDER: No, I think those rats were killed trying to escape from something.

SCULLY: From something that sent them diving into the toilet.

MULDER: No, the lids were down. They werent trying to get into the toilets, they were trying to get out. They were coming from within the sewer lines trying to get away from something.

SCULLY: Have *you* been drinking Yaje, Mulder?

MULDER: Go with it, Scully.

(SCULLY, looks skeptical, but follows MULDER out.)



SCENE 15

(MULDER and SCULLY get back to the room where they left BILAC.)

OFFICER: Agent Scully? Bilacs gone.

SCULLY: What? Hows that possible?

OFFICER: I dont know. I went to check on him and he just wasnt there.

(They enter room. It is empty.)

SCULLY: Did you step away from this door at any time?

OFFICER: No.

SCULLY: And no one entered this room?

OFFICER: Absolutely not.

MULDER: What about a rat?

OFFICER: Sir?

MULDER: You ever see any rats in this room?

GUARD: All the time. Why?

MULDER: How do you think they get in here?

GUARD: Through the old heating system. There are vents all over this place.

(MULDER looks around the room.)

SCULLY: Are there any other doors or windows in this room?

OFFICER: I checked. Theres only one way out.

SCULLY: You didnt hear anything?

OFFICER: Nothing. I heard nothing.

SCULLY: I want you to search the entire building beginning with every room on this floor.

OFFICER: Yes, Maam.

(MULDER finds a HUGE heating vent in a wall near a corner of the room and scrape marks in front of it.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.

(MULDER pulls desk out of the way.)

SCULLY: Where does it lead to?

GUARD: The old steam tunnels.

MULDER: (feeling the floor just inside the vent) How do you get down there?

GUARD: Theyre pretty much sealed up. Havent been used for 50 years.

SCULLY: You think Bilac crawled down there?

MULDER: (holds up his hand with blood on it) Unless he was dragged.

(MULDER exits, SCULLY follows. OFFICER who is SUPPOSED to be searching every room stands there with the GUARD looking at the vent.)



SCENE 16

(Later, still night. MULDER lift the lid off of a manhole outside the museum. The hole is filled with cobwebs.)

SCULLY: (looking at blueprints) The system looks like it branches off into three directions. There must be miles of tunneling down there.

MULDER: And only one way in.

SCULLY: And one way out.

MULDER: (looking hopefully at SCULLY) Ladies first?

(SCULLY smiles and shakes her head. MULDER sighs and climbs down into the hole. SCULLY follows. They walk into the blue lit tunnels.)

MULDER: Which way?

SCULLY: (looking at blueprints) To the left, it looks like.

(They walk further. Shot of blurred yellow perspective of MULDER and SCULLY, then shot of cat eye watching them. There is a clanking sound, then they see a rat run across the tunnel.)

MULDER: Follow that rat.

(They do.)

SCULLY: We should be directly under the museum here.

(MULDER shines light on a door. He goes one direction. SCULLY looks in a little room. MULDER finds the rat which has stopped. He shines his light up near the ceiling.)

MULDER: (urgent) Scully? Scully?!

SCULLY: (in another tunnel) What is it?

(SCULLY joins MULDER and looks at the body he has found, now on the floor.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God. Its Dr. Lewton. It looks like his eyes were eaten right out of his sockets.

MULDER: We still dont know by what.

(Blurred Yellow Perspective of MULDER and SCULLY. They hear a sound and turn the flash light on the cat, who promptly runs away.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: I think its a cat.

(As they walk through the tunnel, we see the cat watching them and it makes a growl that a lion would be proud to make. Blurred yellow perspective again.))

SCULLY: You think that cat killed those people?

(They walk over a large grate under which swarm a group of cats meowing. Anyone who has opened a can of catfood for more than 3 cats knows the swirling furry image presented here.)

MULDER: No, *these* cats. Which way is out?

(SCULLY gasps as a cat leaps from the wall at her face. GA is allergic to cats, so they used a stuffed one. Did they film it in shadow? NOOOO!!!! We get full face shot of the Stuffed Killer Pussy Cat on SCULLYs shoulder scratching her face, then lots of nice close ups as MULDER battles the SKPC and flings it off SCULLY.)

MULDER: Come on, Scully!

(They run down a tunnel pursued by a horde of meowing kitties. MULDER starts down one tunnel, but SCULLY urges him into another.)

SCULLY: No, Mulder, this way. Theres a room here with a vent. Up there.

(MULDER closes the door and watches the meowing army out in the tunnel. SCULLY opens the vent and gasps as she sees a body in the vent.)

SCULLY: Its Bilac.

(They turn to see the cats scratching through the door.)

MULDER: Can you reach up in there?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Lets pull him down.

(They pull BILACs body onto the floor, then MULDER boosts SCULLY into the vent, turns to see cats gnawing on BILAC, then crawls in himself. They emerge into the room where they had originally left BILAC, slam and lock the vent, then run out of the room. Meowing continues behind the metal door.)



SCENE 17

(Next morning. Big Crime scene.)

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, I will call you back later.

SCULLY: Well, the search team's on their way back up. They've recovered all the bodies including Mona's and Bilac's.

MULDER: What about the cats?

SCULLY: Animal control is still looking. So far, they haven't found any sign of them.

MULDER: Well, we both saw them down there, Scully. We know theyre down there.

SCULLY: No ones denying that, Mulder, its just that there are miles of tunnels down there. And theyre saying its gonna take weeks to search them all.

MULDER: Well, by then it wont even matter.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I just got off the phone with the Assistant Secretary of States office. Theyve called in the Ecuadorean Ambassador.

SCULLY: What for?

MULDER: Five people had to die but they're finally taking it seriously.

SCULLY: The curse?

MULDER: (short laugh) No. Bilac's letter of protest. The State Department has asked that the museum remain closed until they can act officially on it.

SCULLY: Are they going to send back the bones?

MULDER: The urn will be back in Ecuador by the end of the week.



SCENE 18

MULDER: (voiceover as camera pans over artifacts in the museum) The Suffolk county coroner ruled the deaths at the museum were the result of animal attacks. What motivated these attacks and why no more have occurred since has not been explained. To the museum, the urn was an artifact from a dying culture-- its curse merely a primitive superstition. Dr. Bilac learned there is a world beyond our own, unseen but powerful, and as real as the urn itself.

(CUT TO: South America, MEN reburying the urn.)

MULDER: (voiceover) The icons from that world represent forces that cannot be tamed or collected in a museum. The true curse that struck the museum was the failure to understand that there are powers that should not be disturbed... That some things are better left buried.

(The SHAMAN watches as the urn is covered.)

(We are now looking up at the SHAMAN from inside the urn. Our view is blurry and tinged with yellow.)

(We finally cut back to the SHAMAN. His eyes are animal-like.)

[THE END]
                                          HELL MONEY



SCENE 1
CHINATOWN
SAN FRANCISCO, CA

(Night. Chinese parade along the crowded streets. A young Asian man, JOHNNY LO, walks through the crowd nervously looking behind him. He jumps as firecrackers explode near him. Runs to a dark decrepit apartment building. Oriental background music. A Chinese symbol is painted in white paint on the door. He touches the paint and finds that it is still wet. He enters the dark apartment. Suddenly, a flashlight is turned on and pointed directly into LOs eyes. He can only see the outline of the man holding the flashlight. The Man Holding Flashlight speaks Cantonese threateningly. LO replies, as if desperate to explain something.)

MAN HOLDING FLASHLIGHT: [You knew the rules. Now you pay the price.]

JOHNNY LO: [I told you I wanted out.]

MAN: [You start, you finish.]

(Man Holding Flashlight is not impressed and flips open a switchblade. LO screams and attacks Man Holding Flashlight, knocking him to the floor with a stab wound to his right shoulder. LO then turns in shock to see three Asian men, their faces painted. They stare at LO.)



SCENE 2
BAYSIDE FUNERAL HOME

(Same night, later. NIGHT WATCHMAN sits playing a handheld video poker game. Hears a banging sound. Goes to investigate.)

NIGHT WATCHMAN: Somebody in here?

(His flashlight briefly illuminates the three Asian Men With Painted Faces, then they disappear. He hears banging from the operating crematorium.)

NIGHT WATCHMAN: Holy Moses.

(Looking through a peephole in the crematorium, NIGHT WATCHMAN sees LO screaming and writhing in pain as flames engulf him.)

SCENE 3

(Funeral home next day. MULDER and SCULLY observe the burned body with LIEUTENANT NEARY of the San Francisco PD.).

SCULLY: What a way to go. Have you seen this MO before, Detective? Men cremated alive?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Yeah. Third time this year.

MULDER: Eleventh time, actually. There were three in Seattle, three in Los Angeles and two in Boston, all Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 40. All recent immigrants.

LIEUTENANT NEARY: We werent able to determine any of that until just recently. The other two bodies were much more badly burned. We got lucky with this one.

MULDER: Lucky? Thats an interesting word for it.

(SCULLY taps a glass eye in the burned body.)

MULDER: You got any leads on this case, Detective? Any thoughts or ideas?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Weve had a big influx of immigrants from Hong Kong trying to get out before 1997. And weve seen stepped-up gang activity in the Chinese community, but so far we cant tie these deaths to anyone or anything.

(MULDER shines his flashlight inside the crematorium. He sees a white painted symbol.)

MULDER: You got anybody that can read or speak Chinese?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Yeah, Glen Chao. He's right over there. Why?

MULDER: Will you get him? I want to see if he can, uh, read this for me.

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Sure. Glen.

CHAO: (to person hes talking to) Just a second.

(DETECTIVE CHAO, a young Asian man, comes over, shakes hands with MULDER.)

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Detective Chao. Glen Chao, Agent Mulder.

CHAO: Hi.

MULDER: Hi.

CHAO: What have you got?

MULDER: There's something written up here on the ceiling. I was wondering if you could read it.

CHAO: (looking inside the crematorium) Yeah. It says "gui". It means ghost.

MULDER: Ghost?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Does that mean anything to you?

MULDER: I don't know, but it's something strange for a man being burned alive to write, don't you think?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Hmm.

(MULDER reaches into the crematorium and finds a partially burned piece of paper.)

MULDER: What's this? Does anybody recognize this? Looks like some kind of foreign currency.

CHAO: It's called Hell Money. It's used as an offering during the Chinese festival of the Hungry Ghosts.

MULDER: Is it worth anything?

CHAO: It's not money per se. It's a symbolic offering to the evil spirits and the ghosts for good luck.

MULDER: Where would I get this Hell Money?

CHAO: There aren't a whole lot of places in Chinatown that sell it.

MULDER: That's good. Maybe we just found a way to identify the body.



SCENE 4

(Day. MULDER and SCULLY drive up to the decrepit apartment building and begin ascending the outdoor stairs.)

SCULLY: His name was Johnny Lo. He moved here about six months ago from Canton. Still in the INS application process. He was a dishwasher in Chinatown.

MULDER: How many dishes do you have to break before your boss tosses you in an oven?

SCULLY: (short laugh at MULDERs joke) I think it's pretty clear this is some kind of a horrific cult or gang retribution killing.

MULDER: Why would he write the character for "ghost" on the inside of the crematory oven?

SCULLY: I dont know.

MULDER: What about the guard seeing three figures that seemed to vanish without a trace?

SCULLY: So now were chasing ghosts?

MULDER: Who you gonna call? Ghosts or ancestral spirits have been central to Chinese spiritual life for centuries.

SCULLY: So you're saying that the ancestral spirits pushed Johnny Lo into the oven and turned on the gas?

MULDER: Well that would sure teach him to respect his elders, wouldnt it?

(CHAO comes out of the apartment and joins them on the landing.

CHAO: Hey. I checked all the neighboring buildings. Nobody saw or heard a thing -- Not surprisingly.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at another white painted symbol on the front door of the apartment.)

MULDER: What does it say?

CHAO: I don't recognize that. It could be idiomatic-- some kind of code.

SCULLY: (touching it) It's still tacky.

MULDER: Can you copy it down for me?

CHAO: Yeah. Sure.

MULDER: (walking into the apartment) Talk about tacky.

(MULDER and SCULLY look around the apartment.)

SCULLY: Someone's been here. This place has been cleaned out. Look at this.

(She points to where dust patterns show that things have been removed from a table. MULDER and SCULLY walk into the other room.)

MULDER: What's that smell?

SCULLY: Maybe it's this new carpet.

(A new cream colored carpet covers the floor.)

CHAO: (joining them) Yeah. That's what it looks like.

SCULLY: What slumlord would spring for a new carpet in a dump like this?

MULDER: (pulling up a corner of the carpet) Looks like they saved some money on carpet tacks and didnt even bother to replace any of the old padding.

(SCULLY opens a desk drawer and pulls out a small white bag with Chinese lettering on it.)

SCULLY: What's this?

CHAO: Chinese herbal medicine.

(She pulls out a bowl with a very dead frog.)

SCULLY: And what about this?

CHAO: That's a dried frog. I think they're sometimes used as charms-- good health and prosperity, protection.

MULDER: (still looking under carpet) Looks like Mr. Lo could have used a little of both.

(SCULLY and CHAO look where MULDER has pulled up the carpet far enough to expose a large bloodstain.)

MULDER: Lets get this blood tested.



SCENE 5

(HSINs apartment. Old, low rent, but neatly kept. Lots of pictures on the walls and small objects on the tables. HSIN, tired looking Asian man in his fifties, places kettle on the stove, then goes to sit with his daughter, KIM, who is lying in bed. She is about 20 and appears to be very ill. He pours her something to drink from a small teapot.)

KIM: (in Chinese) What did you buy?

HSIN: (in Chinese) Its for you. (gently places a tray of food on her lap) Eat

KIM: (in Chinese) Stay and have tea with me.

HSIN: (in Chinese) I have to go out.

KIM: (in Chinese) Where?

HSIN: (in Chinese) To see someone.

KIM: (in Chinese) Always seeing people What kind of people?

HSIN: (in Chinese) (sighs) I have business to make money so you can get well.

KIM: (in Chinese) You can go tomorrow.

HSIN: (in Chinese) Money can pay for doctors.

KIM: (in Chinese) The doctors say the operation cost too much money.

HSIN: (in Chinese) Dont talk like that.

(KIM looks down sadly as HSIN leaves her.)



SCENE 6

(Night. Deserted Chinese restaurant. HSIN knocks at door, exchanges some words in Chinese with a man at the door. He enters and goes upstairs joining perhaps 100 other working class Chinese men in a large room, perhaps dining room for restaurant. They are all talking excitedly. At least one of the men is obviously blind, but he has two glass eyes. Three Asian men wearing suits and carrying two large green glass vases and a carved wooden box enter. VASE MAN begins walking through the crowd with the largest vase collecting small tiles from each of the men present. Each tile has the owners name.)

TILE MAN: [Okay, who will it be today?]

(MONEY MAN opens the box revealing a great deal of money. Lots of "Oooos" and "Ahhhhs" at the sight of the money. HSIN places his tile in the vase. At the table, unseen by all the men, another of the men in suits, TILE MAN, is placing triangular tiles in the other vase. Each of the tiles has a symbol on it and a red border. Finally, he polishes another tile, this one with a gold border and places it beside the vase. VASE MAN finishes collecting the names and hands the large vase to TILE MAN who bows and takes the vase. He removes a tile and reads the name.)

TILE MAN: Li Di-Huan! Li Di-Huan!

(Envious reaction from the crowd. LI DI-HUAN has one glass eye. He smiles hopefully as TILE MAN holds the gold edged tile up for all to see, then drops it into the smaller vase with the red rimmed tiles. VASE MAN carries the vase to LI DI-HUAN who raises the vase over his head and shakes it twice. He reaches in and pulls out a tile. Slowly he opens his fist and his face falls as he sees it is one of the red rimmed tiles. He closes his hand again in despair. VASE MAN pries the tile away, looks at it, then holds it up and announces the symbol.)

VASE MAN: Xin!

(HSIN turns his head away sadly as the crowd reacts with pity. The men in suits lead a resigned LI DI-HUAN out of the room.)



SCENE 7

(Next day. MULDER, SCULLY, and CHAO look at shelf of herbs in an Asian herbal store.)

SCULLY: I couldn't tell you what any one of these things are.

CHAO: Well, they're roots, mostly like ginseng, turmeric. Then you got your more exotic stuff-- bear gall bladder, snake, shark fin-- usually prepared in a soup or a tea.

MULDER: What had the victim been using?

CHAO: (to DR WU) [Ma'am, do you know what these are?]

(DR WU looks in the packet.)

DR WU: [It's skullcap root and Chinese angelica.]

CHAO: She says that its skullcap root and Chinese angelica. Theyre used for painkillers.

SCULLY: Does she remember Johnny Lo or remember selling it to him?

CHAO: [Ma'am, do you remember Johnny Lo, whom you sold this medicine?]

DR WU: [Yes.]

MULDER: Ask her if she knows hes dead.

CHAO: [Ma'am, do you know he's dead?]

DR WU: [No.]

MULDER: Ask her if she recognizes those characters that were painted on his door.

CHAO: [Ma'am, can I ask what this is?]

(They show her the sign on Lo's door and she reacts with fear.)

DR WU: ['Xiongzhai'.]

(She looks afraid and leaves.)

SCULLY: What was that about?

CHAO: She says that the house was branded a xiongzhai. A haunted house.

MULDER: Haunted? You mean by ghosts?

CHAO: Yeah. It's hard to give an exact translation, but it's what I was telling you about before. The Chinese Yu Lan Hui-- the Festival of the Hungry Ghosts.

(As CHAO narrates, Asian man with glass eye from last scene, LI DI-HUAN sits in a chair in a bright light drinking a warm liquid. He opens his eyes and sees a shadowy figure approaching him.)

CHAO: (voiceover) You see, on the 15th day of the seventh moon in the Chinese calendar it's believed the gates of hell are opened and the ghosts of unwanted souls roam the earth. Now, believers protect themselves by leaving gifts of food and hell money outside their homes to appease the ghosts. To keep them from coming inside and causing trouble.

(LI DI-HUANs vision continues. The shadowy figure is joined by others, at least one is a child. The first figure reaches into LI DI-HUANs chest. We hear the sound of a heartbeat. The figure removes LI DI-HUANs heart as LI DI-HUAN watches.)

CHAO: (voiceover) But for some spirits-- the ghosts most feared by the Chinese-- there's no buying them off. The Preta-- the ancient ghost of a murdered man who wanders the earth exacting its revenge on the living.

(LI DI-HUANs eyes close and he passes out. His vision is over and we see HARD-FACED MAN in surgical gear checking LI DI-HUANs good eye to make sure he is unconscious.)

CHAO: (voiceover) Or the wu jiung gui who collect the souls of doomed men and drag them down to Ti Yu ... the Chinese hell.

(Night. Later, MULDER, SCULLY, and CHAO walk down a street in Chinatown.)

MULDER: You think these murders could be related?

CHAO: It makes sense. This year's festival is just about over.

SCULLY: What about you, detective? Do you believe in Yu Lan Hui?

CHAO: I find it hard to argue with 2,000 years of Chinese belief -- the stuff my parents and grandparents believe in. But the truth is, Im more haunted by the size of my mortgage payments.



SCENE 8
HIGHLAND PARK CEMETARY

(Night. NIGHT WATCHMAN drives up to a gravesite in a truck and sees Men With Painted Faces standing next to an open grave.)

NIGHT WATCHMAN: Hey! What are you doing? (he shines his flashlight toward them, but they have vanished) What the hell...?

(Later, MULDER, SCULLY, CHAO, and LIEUTENANT NEARY are investigating.)

LIEUTENANT NEARY: The night patrolman described three men wearing the same masks as the ones IDd at the crematory.

SCULLY: What were they doing here?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: We don't know exactly. They were spotted around this grave over here but we can't figure out exactly what they were up to.

MULDER: Is this a newly dug plot?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Yeah. There's a burial here at noon tomorrow.

MULDER: Chinese?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: I don't know. We can check. Chao, see if you can get the name of the future occupant here.

SCULLY: I still don't understand what anybody would want with an empty grave.

(MULDER drops down into the grave.)

LIEUTENANT NEARY: (to SCULLY) What the hell's he doing?

(SCULLY just shakes her head.)

MULDER: Something just occurred to me. (pushes dirt aside exposing the dead face of LI DI-HUAN) Looks like somebody was trying to get two burials for the price of one.



SCENE 9

(MULDER enters autopsy bay where SCULLY is performing autopsy on LI DI-HUAN.)

MULDER: What did you find?

SCULLY: A lot. And I haven't even finished my preliminary visual exam. (pulls plastic off the scarred body) Look at this. This guy's like a jigsaw puzzle. These are all surgical incisions and judging by the color of the scars Id say they were all made within the last year.

MULDER: What was wrong with him?

SCULLY: If you ask me, nothing.

MULDER: Nothing? What do you mean?

SCULLY: Do you know how much the human body is worth, Mulder?

MULDER: Depends on the body. (SCULLY gives VERY small smile) I don't know. A few bucks. How much?

SCULLY: (putting on latex gloves) It's worth a fortune.

MULDER: You're saying that this guy was selling his body parts for money?

SCULLY: A kidney, a portion of the liver, a cornea bone marrow... A person can lose these things and live to cash his social security checks.

MULDER: He won't be cashing any social security checks any time soon.

SCULLY: No, but if Im right this is one man who left his heart in San Francisco.

(MULDER grins at her joke as she begins opening up the body for the internal exam.)

MULDER: Scully, even if you're right, it doesn't figure. There's no long-term business sense to dying. What connection does this have to the crematory deaths?

SCULLY: I only saw one body, but the only thing that wasn't burned to a delicate crisp on Johnny Lo was his glass eye.

(SCULLY gasps and backs away as the incision shes working on begins to move.)

SCULLY: Oh, God.

(MULDER and SCULLY watch as a small frog crawls out of the body.)



SCENE 10

(The large room with Asian men and Asian Suit Men with the Vases. TILE MAN draws HSINs name.)

TILE MAN: Hsin Shuyang! Hsin Shuyang!

(HSIN looks nervous. They drop the gold rimmed tile into the other vase and take it to HSIN who raises it over his head, shakes it, then draws out a piece in his fist. Crowd calls out encouragement. VASE MAN takes the tile and looks at it then announces the symbol on it.)

VASE MAN: Gan!

(A grim-faced HSIN is lead out of the room.)



SCENE 11

(Day. CHAOs office. CHAO on the phone speaking Cantonese. MULDER and SCULLY enter. CHAO ends his conversation and hangs up. SCULLY hands him a jar with the frog in it. MULDER stands by the window eating sunflower seeds.)

CHAO: What's this?

SCULLY: Maybe you can tell us. It was found in the body cavity of the man who was dumped in the grave.

CHAO: This?

SCULLY: You said the frog was a symbol of luck and prosperity. Unless this is somebodys sick joke Id say it must have another meaning.

CHAO: (setting jar down dismissively) Well, if it does, I don't know what it is. I mean, it could be some kind of... Triad symbol. Something from organized crime.

SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me this: have you heard any word on the street about the black market selling of body parts?

CHAO: What? Here, in Chinatown?

SCULLY: This man with the frog in his chest was missing a cornea and a kidney. They were taken prior to the time of death before the final removal of his heart. (MULDER watches CHAO intently) And I found what is known as "sterile ice" on the skin in and around the incision on his chest. It is a substance that is used to preserve human organs for transplant.

CHAO: (laughing) I dont even know where to start.

MULDER: (still eating seeds) Well, were gonna need more help from you than that, Detective.

CHAO: The implication being that Im not trying to help?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Either you resent us being here or you feel some kind of protectiveness towards the Chinese community.

CHAO: (angry and defensive) Look you dont even know what the hell youre dealing with here. This isn't some pretty little lacquer box you can just take the lid off and find out what's inside. You might see the face of a Chinese man here but let me tell you something -- they don't see the same face. They see the face of a cop... American-born Chinese, ABC. To them, Im just as white as you are.

(He picks up a piece of paper and stands up.)

CHAO: You think because I speak the language I can get all your answers for you but what good is an interpreter when everyone speaks the language of silence? (He hands MULDER a piece of paper and begins putting on his jacket heading for the door.)

MULDER: What's this?

CHAO: (bitter and sarcastic) It's the name of the company that installed the carpet in Johnny Los apartment. I just happened to run across it while I was sitting there twiddling my thumbs. (leaving office) You coming or not?



SCENE 12

(HSIN cracks door of his apartment. CHAO, MULDER, and SCULLY are in the hall.)

HSIN: [What do you want with me?]

CHAO: I'm detective Chao with the San Francisco police. Could we have a word with you?

HSIN: I'm late for work.

CHAO: It'll only take a minute. Could we come in, please?

(HSIN lets them in. His right eye is covered with a bandage.

SCULLY: Mr. Hsin, can I ask what happened to your eye?

HSIN: Accident at work. Carpet tack.

(MULDER and SCULLY share a look.)

MULDER: How long have you lived in this country, Mr. Hsin?

HSIN: Three years.

MULDER: You live here alone?

(KIM in her bedroom calls out to her father.)

HSIN: (indicating) My daughter.

(MULDER begins looking around the apartment.)

SCULLY: Mr. Hsin, you laid a carpet in an apartment that was occupied by a man named Johnny Lo.

HSIN: I... Don't know the name. The-the man I work for tells me address only.

SCULLY: We contacted the man that you work for. He said it must have been a job you took on the side. He has no record of a work order.

(On a table near the window, MULDER finds the red bordered tile that HSIN drew the night before. He picks it up and looks at it carefully.)

HSIN: What was the name of the man who lived in this apartment?

SCULLY: His name was Johnny Lo. He's dead now-- murdered-- and we think that the carpet was laid in an attempt to cover up evidence. Now your employer says.

(SCULLY continues the interview as CHAO opens bedroom door and sees Kim in bed. They speak quietly.)

KIM: (in Chinese) Where is my father?

CHAO: (in Chinese) He is here.

KIM: (in Chinese) Who are you?

CHAO: (in Chinese) Im just here asking him some questions.

(CHAO closes the door and returns to the main room.)

SCULLY: Do you remember who called you about the job?

HSIN: (shaking his head) I dont know any of this.

MULDER: Thank you, Mr. Hsin. If we need you, we'll get back to you. Okay? Thank you.

(MULDER leads SCULLY out of apartment and into the hall. CHAO and HSIN speak in Cantonese.)

SCULLY: Whats up?

MULDER: (watching the two men) Ill tell you in a minute.

(They watch as CHAO continues speaking to HSIN who is agitated. HSIN goes into apartment. CHAO joins MULDER and SCULLY.)

MULDER: What was that about?

CHAO: He has the back window blocked up. Told him it was a firetrap.

MULDER: (showing CHAO the tile he picked up) You know what this is?

CHAO: No.

MULDER: Do you know what it says?

CHAO: Its the character for "wood."

MULDER: Wood?

CHAO: Yeah. Why? What are you thinking?

SCULLY: That this guy didnt have an accident at work.

MULDER: Hes missing his eye and Id like to know how he lost it.

SCULLY: I say we monitor Hsins every movements.

MULDER: I doubt theyre to the ophthalmologist, though.

(MULDER, SCULLY and CHAO leave. Inside the apartment, KIM has gotten out of bed.)

KIM: (in Chinese) Papa? Are you in some kind of trouble?

HSIN: (in Chinese) What are you doing? Go right back to bed Go now, go now.

KIM: (in Chinese) What happened to your eye?

HSIN: (in Chinese) Nothing. I had an accident.

KIM: (in Chinese) What kind of accident?

HSIN: (in Chinese) A work accident, thats all.

KIM: (in Chinese) Last night when you got off work, nothing was wrong. You hurt it afterwards.

HSIN: (in Chinese) Its no business of yours! Do you understand?

KIM: (in Chinese, coming close to him) No, I dont understand.

HSIN: (in Chinese) How will you get well? How will you get well if we dont have the money for the doctor?

KIM: (in Chinese) What would I do if something happened to you? Im just worried about you

HSIN: (in Chinese, taking her hands) I wake up every day and worry. Have I made a mistake? Am I being foolish? Do our ancestors scorn us for leaving our home? Is that why you are sick now?

KIM: (in Chinese) Youre not to blame.

HSIN: (in Chinese, crying and embracing her) Who is to blame? If you cant help, whos the one to blame if not me?



SCENE 13

(Night. CHAO arrives home. Is nervous as he sees a red Chinese symbol painted on his white door. He opens the house and enters. He sees the Men With Painted Faces waiting in the darkened hallway. Asian background music swells.)



SCENE 14

(Night. Festival is still going on. MULDER is in car watching HSINs window. He jumps as SCULLY opens the passenger door and gets in.)

SCULLY: Look like you just saw a ghost.

MULDER: (smiles) No, Im just a little tired, jumpy. One more string of firecrackers goes off, Im going to get out of the car and shoot somebody.

SCULLY: He hasnt left his apartment, has he?

MULDER: No, but Im glad youre here cause I was just about to go and ask Mr. Hsin if I could use his bathroom.

SCULLY: (putting on seatbelt) Well, you can use the one down at St. Francis Hospital.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Detective Chao was attacked in his town house tonight. I just talked to Lieutenant Neary. He says hes cut up pretty bad.

MULDER: Who cut him?

SCULLY: I dont know, but I think we should go check it out.

(MULDER starts car and drives away. One of the Asian Men in Suits, HARD-FACED MAN, from the restaurant adjusts his collar and watches them drive away, then walks over to HSINs apartment building.)

(Inside the apartment, HSIN is eating. There is a knock at the door.)

HSIN: (in Chinese) Who is it?

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) You know who it is.

(HSIN lets HARD-FACED MAN in. HARD-FACED MAN walks around the apartment confidently.)

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) I did not receive your payment.

HSIN: (in Chinese) I want out.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) You want out of the game?

HSIN: (in Chinese) I quit.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) Youve been luckier than most. All this time and one bad draw. Most men would be happy to trade places with you. The pot is almost two million dollars. One draw, Mr. Hsin. One draw and maybe youll win more than I did. (puts some of HSINs dinner in his mouth and eats it)

HSIN: (in Chinese) But maybe Im not so lucky.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese, considers) The money could help to save your daughters life.

HSIN: (in Chinese) But maybe Im not so lucky. Maybe my daughter will die with no father at her side. Alone with strangers.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) You have to keep playing. You know the rules. No one talks about the game. No one leaves the game

(KIM watches, hidden, from the bedroom door.)

HSIN: (in Chinese) But my daughter

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) Those are the rules. They cannot be broken, or its said that the Prata and the fires of Ti Yu will consume you.

HSIN: (in Chinese, bowing and pleading) Please! I beg you.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese, leaving the apartment) It is not my choice.

(KIM quietly closes the bedroom door.)



SCENE 15
ST FRANCIS GENERAL HOSPITAL

(MULDER and SCULLY enter the hospital. They find LIEUTENANT NEARY.)

SCULLY: How is he?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Hes gone. I got down to see him. Hes not in his bed.

MULDER: Did anybody see him get up?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: The nurse said they just finished sewing him up. That he got up to go to the bathroom. That's the last anybody saw of him.

SCULLY: Why would he just take off?

MULDER: Can I see his chart?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: His chart?

MULDER: Yeah.

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Sure, I guess. (goes to get it)

SCULLY: You want to see what his injuries were?

MULDER: I want to see what his blood type was.

SCULLY: His blood type?

MULDER: Why would he run?

SCULLY: You think Chaos involved?

MULDER: Maybe all this heel dragging's a diversion. That ghost story's a ruse. What was the hemotype of the blood we found on the carpet padding? (LIEUTENANT NEARY hands him the chart) Thank you.

SCULLY: (checking her notes) Uh, O-negative.

MULDER: Glen Chao, O-negative. Well, that's a coincidence.

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Wait a minute. What are you saying?

SCULLY: That the blood that we found on the carpet padding in the victim's apartment was Detective Chaos.

MULDER: And Id be willing to bet that he's the one who asked for it to be installed.

SCULLY: Mr. Hsin.

MULDER: Yeah. That conversation they had wasn't about any firetrap.



SCENE 16

(HSINs apartment. KIM opens apartment door a crack to see MULDER and SCULLY in the hall.)

SCULLY: We're looking for Mr. Hsin. Is he home?

KIM: No. I'm sorry.

SCULLY: Are you his daughter?

KIM: Yes.

SCULLY: May we talk to you?

(Later, they sit talking.)

MULDER: What's your father involved in, Kim?

KIM: I don't know. He goes out. I know he does it for me. Because of me.

SCULLY: You're sick, aren't you?

KIM: Um, I was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia six months ago.

SCULLY: But that's a treatable form of cancer.

KIM: We have no money or insurance. And now, I fear that my father has done something illegal, that he made a mistake and something bad is coming.

MULDER: Who are these men that come to visit your father?

KIM: Oh, I don't know them. I just know my father say he want out. He want out. But of what, I don't know.

MULDER: (showing her the tile) Do you know what this is?

KIM: No.

MULDER: Do you know what it says? I found it over there by the TV before.

KIM: It is, uh, the symbol for wood but in Chinese, it also correspond to the eye like fire to the heart, and earth to the flesh.

SCULLY: (looking up from some papers she has been looking through) This is a human leukocyte work-up. Was your father rejected as a bone marrow donor?

KIM: Yes. Several months ago.

SCULLY: This is from the Organ Procurement Organization. Its dated only a month ago. Your father had an HLA but he also had his kidneys measured, his liver.

MULDER: (realizing) Theyre playing some kind of game.



SCENE 17

(Large room with the Asian men. Men in Suits enter. HSIN sits quietly, waiting.)

(Same time. Organ procurement agency. Knock at door. NURSE lets MULDER and SCULLY in.)

NURSE: Agents Mulder and Scully?

SCULLY: Thanks. We need some information and we need it as soon as possible.

NURSE: What kind of information?

SCULLY: You had a man come in here named Shuyang Hsin. He had an HLA work up and.

NURSE: I think I may know what this is about.

MULDER: What?

NURSE: Weve seen a number of Asian men come in for typing and antigen work-ups but when we find a compatible recipient for them their doctor says they've left the area or disappeared.

MULDER: Do you have a name or a phone number for this doctor?

(Large room with Asian men. They all drop their names into the green vase. HSINs name is drawn again.)

VASE MAN: Hsin Shuyang. Hsin Shuyang.

(HSIN stares in shock.)

(CUT TO: MULDER and SCULLY pull up outside the restaurant.)

MULDER: 311 Porter, right.

SCULLY: Yeah. Thats where the doctors phone is registered.

(They see CHAO enter the building.)

MULDER: Hey Scully, look whos here. This must be the place, after all.

(Inside building, HSIN shakes the vase and draws a tile. VASE MAN takes the tile and reads it.)

VASE MAN: Xin!

(HSIN doesnt react. Crowd reacts loudly. HSIN is led out of the room. This is bad. CHAO, now in the room too, watches silently.)



SCENE 18

(MULDER and SCULLY pick the lock and enter the first floor of the restaurant. With flashlights, they explore what appears to be a dark kitchen - long tables and refrigerators.)

MULDER: Its definitely not Chinese food Im smelling.

(They see a fresh red stain on the floor.)

MULDER: It smells like rubbing alcohol.

SCULLY: Or sterile ice.

(MULDER opens the commercial refrigerator. There are lots of objects packed in ice.)

MULDER: Whats this?

(He removes a plastic tray with several glass jars packed in ice. They look at one of the jars. It contains a human eye.)

(CUT TO: DR. WU checks HSINs pupils to see if he is unconscious. Two other men carry him to an operating table.)

(CUT TO: Upstairs room with all the Asian men. CHAO reaches out to stop TILE MAN who brushes him aside.

TILE MAN: (in Chinese) What are you doing?

CHAO: (in Chinese) I cant let you do this.

TILE MAN: (in Chinese) Youve been warned once, Chao. There will be no more warnings.

CHAO: (in Chinese) Let him go. His daughter is dying. You are killing two people. Not one.

TILE MAN: (in Chinese) That is the game, Mr. Chao. Those are the risks. You are just as much a part of it. We paid you well to protect the game from the foreigners.

CHAO: (in Chinese, nodding) Then this game. (Yells, angry)  is over!!!

(CHAO flips table over, shattering the vase and dumping the money and tiles on the floor. CHAO looks down at the tiles. They all have the same symbol on them.)

CHAO: (in Chinese) Theyre all the same. (Yells to the other men.) This game is fixed.

(Men all begin loudly rioting against the men in suits.)

(CUT TO: Downstairs, MULDER and SCULLY hear the men yelling.)

SCULLY: What is that?

MULDER: It sounds like its coming from upstairs.

(They run toward the stairs.)

(CUT TO: Operating room, iodine is spread across the drugged HSINs chest. HARD-FACED MAN is giving instructions.)

(CUT TO: MULDER and SCULLY enter large room where riot is still going on.)

(CUT TO: Operating room. HSIN regains partial consciousness, sees beautiful Asian woman reaching her hand out to him.)

HSIN: (in Chinese, weakly, to the woman) Forgive me. I beg you to forgive me.

(The image of the woman is replaced by HARD-FACED MAN holding a scalpel.)

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) They forgive you.

(HARD-FACED MAN places the blade of the scalpel on HSINs chest. CHAO kicks the door open, gun out.)

CHAO: (in Chinese) Step away.

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese) Youre too late.

CHAO: (in Chinese) I said step away!

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese, stepping back) Chao. Dont be a fool!

(CHAO shoots HARD-FACED MAN in the shoulder. Behind CHAO, MULDER kicks in another door and holds gun on CHAO.)

MULDER: Chao? Hands in the air. Hands in the air!

(SCULLY passes them, gun out, and goes to check HSIN.)

SCULLY: Hes still alive.

(MULDER begins cuffing CHAO.)

HARD-FACED MAN: (in Chinese, to CHAO) Chao. You should have killed me.

MULDER: What did he say?

CHAO: He said the games not over.



SCENE 19

(Police interrogation room. SCULLY interviewing HARD-FACED MAN who casually smokes a cigarette.)

HARD-FACED MAN: My people live with ghosts. The ghosts of our fathers and our fathers' fathers. They call to us from distant memory, showing us the path.

(He slightly smiles and takes a puff of the cigarette.)

SCULLY: No ghosts called to those men. You did, by preying on their hopelessness and their desperation.

HARD-FACED MAN: Yes-- they were desperate. Just as I was desperate when I first came to this country but I committed no crime.

SCULLY: You cheated them out of life by promising them prosperity when the only possible reward was death.

HARD-FACED MAN: In my belief, death is nothing to be feared. It's merely a stage of transition but life without hope-- now, that's living hell. So, hope was my gift to these men. (SCULLY sighs angrily) I don't expect you to understand.

SCULLY: I understand this. You are going to prison for a very long time.

(MULDER enters the room.)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Can I talk to you for a minute?

(SCULLY stares at HARD-FACED MAN with hatred, then follows MULDER into the hallway.)

MULDER: I just got back from St. Francis Hospital. Hsin's still in intensive care.

SCULLY: What about his daughter?

MULDER: I checked with the donor procurement organization. Shes been put on the recipient list.

SCULLY: That's great.

MULDER: Yeah.

(LIEUTENANT NEARY is waiting for them. He doesnt look happy.)

SCULLY: What's wrong?

LIEUTENANT NEARY: Its our case against this guy. We've had our task force interviewing everybody we busted at the gaming parlor that night.

SCULLY: And?

MULDER: They put up a wall of silence. They all claim to be members of some social club. That they saw nothing.

SCULLY: What about Chao? His testimony would be enough.

LIEUTENANT NEARY: We can't find him.

MULDER: He was supposed to testify before a grand jury this morning. When he didn't show, they went to his home. He's vanished. Like a ghost.

(SCULLY stares at MULDER.)



SCENE 20

(Shot of peephole in crematorium. CHAO wakes up. He is lying down in the crematorium. He turns his head slowly and sees a blue pilot light next to him. There is one second of realization, then the space bursts into flame. Through the flame, we see the Chinese symbol for "ghost" painted on the wall.)

[THE END]
                                   JOSE CHUNG'S 'FROM OUTER SPACE'



SCENE 1
KLASS COUNTY; WASHINGTON

(A starship approaches from the south hovering over all... or not. It is actually the underbelly of a crane lift for an electric man named Roky Crikenson talks on the phone as he lifts up into the air.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: Yeah, this is Roky. I checked all the connections. I don't know why all the power's down out here. I'm going to have to come in and get some more equipment. Yeah, yeah... yeah, I'll need several of those. All right...

(Another car passes by the orange cones which block off the crane. A young boy and girl sit in the front seats, the boy driving.)

HAROLD LAMB: Um... I don't want to scare you, but... I think I'm madly in love with you.

(She smiles.)

I mean, you're all I think about. You're my whole world.

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Harold, I like you a lot too, but this is our first date. I mean, I think that we need more time to get to know one another.

(The whole car shuts down and it slowly moves to a halt.)

What happened?

(He tries to start the engine. Suddenly, a bright light shines down from above. Chrissy shrieks. The spaceship hovers down. Harold desperately tries to start the car.)

HAROLD LAMB: Oh my God... oh my God...

(Two beings approach them from either side of the car, looking like classic gray aliens.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Harold, what are those things?

HAROLD LAMB: How the hell should I know?

(The two aliens get on each side of the car. The two teenagers stare at the ones on each side of them and strangely pass out. The one near the drivers side looks perplexed. Harold stares at him, eyes glazed over, as the alien reaches in to grab him. The aliens drag them back towards the ship. A sharp noise is heard and another, different looking spaceship comes down, shining a red light down. The aliens turn in shock, putting down the bodies. A giant crude-looking, claymation-ish behemoth jumps down and slowly walks towards them, growling and roaring. He stops before them, towering over them and roaring in their faces. The alien that had been dragging Chrissy looks at the other one.)

ALIEN: Jack... what is that thing?

ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN: How the hell should I know?

(Their masks move as they talk. The behemoth roars.)

SCENE 2
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Jose Chung, famous author and philosopher, walks towards Mulder's "I Want to Believe" poster.)

JOSE CHUNG: I had never thought much about it before. I guess that's because I always felt like such an alien myself. That to be concerned with aliens from... other planets, that just seemed so, uh... redundant.

SCULLY: Well, I'd never actually much considered it myself before I started this job.

JOSE CHUNG: Yes. Now, if I understand it correctly, your partner is the, uh, actual expert?

SCULLY: Yes, and I feel that I must apologize for his refusal to speak with you, Mister Chung, but, uh, I must admit, I probably wouldn't have myself if I wasn't such an admirer of your work.

JOSE CHUNG: Oh!

SCULLY: "The Lonely Buddha" is one of my favorite novels.

(He chuckles.)

JOSE CHUNG: And hear I was thinking you were just some... brainy beauty. Now I find out that you also have good taste.

(She smiles as he walks around the desk and sits down.)

SCULLY: What made you decide to write a book about an alien abduction if you're not that interested in the subject yourself?

(She sits across from him.)

JOSE CHUNG: Actually? It was my publisher's idea. At first I was reluctant, until I realized that I had an opportunity here to create an entirely new literary genre... a non-fiction science fiction. Now, see, that gimmick alone will guarantee it's landing on the best-seller list. In short, to answer your question? Money.

SCULLY: Well... just as long as you're attempting to record the truth.

JOSE CHUNG: Oh, God, no. How can I possibly do that?

SCULLY: What do you mean?

JOSE CHUNG: I spent three months in Klass County and everybody there has a different version of what truly happened. Truth is as subjective as reality. That will help explain why when people talk about their "UFO experiences," they always start off with "well, now, I know how crazy this is going to sound... but."

SCULLY: So you're here to get my version of the truth?

(He holds her hand.)

JOSE CHUNG: Exactly.

(He picks up his pen and puts it to paper.)

Now, when did you first find out about the case?

SCULLY: Well... not right away, of course. Um... not enough time had elapsed for it to be considered a missing person's case before the girl was found the following morning.



SCENE 3
KLASS COUNTY; WASHINGTON

(The car sits on the side of the road, stranded. Scully talks over the scene. Inside the car, Chrissy sits, curled up in a ball, a blank expression on her face.)

SCULLY: She was suffering from what my partner calls "missing time." She recalled nothing of the previous night, nor how she had arrived at her present whereabouts. Her body exhibited signs of physical abuse, and all of her clothes were on backwards or inside-out.

(She plays with a button on her shirt, which is the wrong way. Cut to the office.)

JOSE CHUNG: Have I had my share of mornings like that. Oh, but these have the characteristics of someone who has...

(He motions for her to wait a second and flips back a page in his notebook.)

Uh, do you prefer the term "abductee" or "experiencer?"

SCULLY: Actually, I prefer neither, but my partner uses "abductee."

JOSE CHUNG: My preference is for the other.

(He leans in and whispers.)

"I've just had a, uh... little alien experience." As opposed to, "I've just been abducted!"

(He points at her with his pen and starts to write down things.)

SCULLY: Well, regardless, the girl was considered neither at the time. She appeared more to be the victim of date rape than anything else.

(He shrugs a little and writes it down. Cut to Chrissy's bedroom, where she is sleeping. Scully talks over the scene.)

She was given a physical exam and her statement was taken. Later that night, she received her... visitation.

(Chrissy, with a visible scar on her cheek, wakes up and wipes some blood off her nose. The nosebleed has dripped down onto the pillow. She looks at the foot of her bed and sees an alien reaching out to grab her. She screams and turns on the light to reveal her stuffed cat. The cat is then punted across the room. A rattling is head from the other side of the room and she turns off the lights, scared. Looking out at the window, she sees a giant shadow stretching across the lawn. She gasps, then looks again to see Harold walking away. She opens the window.)

HAROLD LAMB: Oh, Chrissy, thank God you're all right.

CHRISSY GIORGIO: How dare you come here.

HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy, I did everything I could.

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Don't I know it, you bastard.

HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy! Don't you remember?

FATHER: What the hell is going on up there?

HAROLD LAMB: Chrissy! I love you!

(He runs away. Scully starts her voice-over again.)

SCULLY: The father informed the police, who apprehended the boy back at his own home.

(Harold sits in a chair in an interrogation room. Detective Manners paces in the back, another man sitting across from Harold.)

HAROLD LAMB: We... we were abducted by aliens.

MANNERS: You don't sound so sure of it.

HAROLD LAMB: It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy doesn't remember it.

MANNERS: You're willing to take a lie detector test to prove you were abducted by creatures from outer space?

HAROLD LAMB: Yes, I am.

MANNERS: Well, too bad! 'Cause I don't need no lie detector to tell me the only thing you were abducted by were your rampaging hormones, you punk!

(Harold looks away in sorrow. Jose and Scully talk over.)

JOSE CHUNG: But he did take a test and passed it?

SCULLY: And he stuck to his story... until we got there.

(Seemingly no time has passed, but Scully is now sitting where the other man was and Mulder is walking across the room.)

HAROLD LAMB: If she says I raped her, then... I guess I raped her.

MULDER: You don't sound so sure of that.

HAROLD LAMB: It all seems so crazy, and I don't know why Chrissy remembers it that way.

MULDER: Would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that you raped her?

(Harold will not look up at the agents.)

HAROLD LAMB: No, I'm not.

MULDER: Well, that's too bad. Because the next rape you experience will probably be your own... in prison.

(Harold looks back down at the desk. Scully talks over.)

SCULLY: That should have ended our investigation, but Mulder brought the girl in for questioning.

(Chrissy sits across from Mulder. Scully is leaning against the door at the back wall. Chrissy's parents sit in the back.)

MULDER: Are you having trouble sleeping? Are you experiencing muscle pains? Vision problems? Nose bleeds? When you look at a particular object, do you receive the sudden flash that you're actually looking at something else? An alien's face?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Yes!

(Mulder turns and talks to her parents. Scully rolls her eyes. Scully talks over the scene.)

SCULLY: So, my partner became convinced that she was suffering from what he calls "post-abduction syndrome."

JOSE CHUNG: You don't believe in the disorder?

SCULLY: Well, I think that stress of any kind can cause all of those physical ailments. In any case, Mulder convinced the girl and her parents to let her be hypnotized.

(Mulder turns back to Chrissy. Cut to the X-Files office.)

JOSE CHUNG: What is your opinion of hypnosis?

SCULLY: I know that it has its therapeutic value, but it has never been proven to enhance memory. In fact, it actually worsens it since, since, since people in that state or prone to confabulation.

JOSE CHUNG: When I was doing research for my book "The Caligarian Candidate..."

SCULLY: One of the greatest thrillers ever written.

JOSE CHUNG: Oh...

(He chuckles.)

Thank you. I was, uh... interested in how the C.I.A., when conducting their MK-Ultra mind control experiments back in the '50s, had no idea how hypnosis went.

SCULLY: Hmm.

JOSE CHUNG: Or what it was.

SCULLY: No one still knows.

JOSE CHUNG: Still, as a storyteller, I'm fascinated how a person's sense of consciousness can be... so transformed by nothing more magical than listening to words. Mere words.

(Cut to the interrogation room. Doctor Fingers sits across from Chrissy very closely. In the background, Chrissy's parents are sitting down in the back like before. Manners is standing, then Mulder is more to the front. Scully is still leaning on the door in the back. His voice is very soothing and slow. She is sitting in a recliner, eyes closed.)

FINGERS: You are feeling very sleepy, very relaxed. As your body calmly drifts deeper and deeper into a state of peaceful relaxation, you will respond only to the sound of my voice.

(She opens her eyes as the room starts to become shaky in her vision. She gasps as everyone is replaced by aliens, down to one still holding Manners' cup of coffee. As the "Fingers" alien talks, the mouth does not move.)

Chrissy? Can you recall where you are?

(Chrissy is hooked onto a glass table with white lines all over it up against the wall. She and Fingers talk over the scene.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: I'm in a room... on a spaceship... surrounded by aliens.

FINGERS: What do the aliens look like?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: They're small... but their heads and their eyes are big. They're gray.

FINGERS: Are you alone?

(She looks to her left and sees Harold on a similar table, one hooked to the floor.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: No, Harold's on another table... but he seems really out of it... like he's not really there.

(In reality, the table has donuts and coffee on it.)

FINGERS: What are the aliens doing now?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: They're sort of arguing. I sort of hear them but I can't understand what they're saying.

(The aliens bicker illegibly. The "Scully" alien walks over to the "Mulder" alien. She and Fingers still talk over the scene.)

Except the leader. I can understand him.

FINGERS: When the leader speaks to you, does his mouth move?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: No.

(She starts to cry.)

But I hear him in my head.

FINGERS: What is he saying?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: He's telling me this is for the good of my planet, but...

FINGERS: But what?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: I don't like what he's doing. It's like he's inside my mind, like... like he's stealing my memories.

(Mulder looks at Scully. Later, Chrissy is being led out of the room.)

MULDER: The description of the aliens, the physical exam, the mindscan, the presence of another human being that appears switched off, it's all characteristic of a typical abduction.

SCULLY: That's my problem with it, Mulder. It's all a little too typical. Abduction lore has become so prevalent in our society that you can ask someone to imagine what it would be like to be abducted and they'd concoct an identical scenario.

MULDER: Yeah, if it were only one person, Scully, but we have two individuals here, each verifying the other's story.

(Manners walks over to them.)

MANNERS: Well, thanks a lot! You really bleeped up this case.

(Cut to present day.)

SCULLY: Well, of course, he didn't actually say "bleeped." He said...

JOSE CHUNG: I'm, uh, familiar with, uh, Detective Manners' colorful phraseology.

(Cut back to the interrogation room.)

MULDER: You still going to hold the boy?

MANNERS: Oh, you bet your blankety-blank bleep I am.

MULDER: But the victim seems to confirm his alibi.

MANNERS: The hell she did! Those kids' stories couldn't be more bleeping different.

(He walks away. Scully rubs her forehead.)



SCENE 4
UNKNOWN LOCATION

(Harold sits in a small cell. Screams echo throughout the room, which is so long it seems to have no end, covered with small jail cells. He grabs the bars and pulls away in pain, gasping. Over the room, other bars spark. He looks down at Chrissy, who is sleeping in the cell with him.)

HAROLD: Chrissy! Chrissy!

(He looks over at another gray alien in the next cell.)

What do you want with us?

(The alien looks at him.)

What do you want with us?!

(Cut to the interrogation room.)

MULDER: How did the alien respond?

HAROLD LAMB: Well... all he did was...

(Cut back to the alien. Harold talks over the scene as the alien raises a cigarette to his mouth and takes a drag. He leaves it in his mouth as Harold looks on in awe. Chrissy wakes and looks at the Abducted Smoking Alien.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: What, what's happening?

HAROLD LAMB: Don't worry, it'll okay. I'm here to protect you. I'll never let anything happen to you.

(The roof of the cell slides open and a bright light shines down. The behemoth roars and she screams as she is pulled from the cage. The doors slide shut. Her screams drift off. Cut to the interrogation room.)

MULDER: What was the other alien, the gray, what was it doing during all this.

(Scully walks up behind Harold.)

HAROLD LAMB: He was just... talking.

MULDER: Telepathically?

HAROLD LAMB: No. In english. He just kept saying the same thing over and over again.

(Cut to the Abducted Smoking Alien, who has his head in his hands.)

ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN: This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening. This is not happening...

HAROLD LAMB: Would you shut up already?

(The roof to Harold's cell slide open again and he is pulled out as the behemoth roars.)

No! No!

(The doors slam shut.)

ABDUCTED SMOKING ALIEN: This is not happening. This is not happening.

(Cut back to the interrogation room.)

HAROLD LAMB: I don't know where I was taken, because the whole time I was like this, in pain.

(He shows how he held up his arms to block the shots.)

MULDER: Because the other alien was conducting torturous experiments on you?

HAROLD LAMB: No... no, it was like... you know, you know when you were a kid and you tore the legs off a bug for no reason? I guess I was the bug. Anyways, the next thing I remember, I was suddenly outside... like I was flying through the air or something.

MULDER: Then what?

HAROLD LAMB: And then I think I hit the ground. When I came to, I, I immediately ran to Chrissy's to make sure she was there and that she was okay.

SCULLY: Harold... did you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse that night?

(Harold looks away.)

HAROLD LAMB: If her father finds out, I'm a dead man.

(Later, the agents sit across from each other in the empty room.)

MULDER: He said it happened before the abduction. So what if they had sex?

SCULLY: So we know that it wasn't an alien who probed her. Mulder, you've got two kids having sex before they're mature enough to know how to handle it.

MULDER: So you're saying that all this is just a case of sexual trauma?

SCULLY: It's a lot more plausible than an alien abduction, especially in light of their contradictory stories.

(Manners barges in.)

MANNERS: Hey! I just got a call from some crazy bleep-head saying he was an eyewitness to this alien abduction. Do you feel like talking to this blank-hole?



SCENE 5
ROKY CRIKENSON'S HOUSE

(Roky is sitting at his artist's desk in the basement, papers in front of him. Mulder and Scully are standing on either side of him.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: I know how crazy all this sounds, but I don't care. What I have to say has to be said.

SCULLY: Why did you wait till now to tell us this information? Two kids' lives may be affected by it.

ROKY CRIKENSON: Well, it, it's bigger than a couple of kids. It has to do with the entire planet... the universe and who knows what else!

MULDER: Why don't you tell us what happened that night?

ROKY CRIKENSON: This.

(He holds up a document.)

It's all here. After seeing what I saw that night, I rushed right home and wrote it all down. Forty-eight hours straight. I didn't want to forget a single detail.

(Mulder reaches for it, but Roky holds up his hand in protest.)

But I feel that I should warn you, I don't want to be overly dramatic here, but by looking at this, you're putting your lives in danger.

MULDER: Why is that?

ROKY CRIKENSON: Because last night, the weirdest thing happened.

(Cut to the previous night. Roky is sitting at his artist's desk, drawing, when the garage door opens up. He turns to see a black sedan with more than just a slight resemblance to the Batmobile pull in. The garage door closes as Roky stares in awe. The window slides down to reveal a man in black.

1ST MAN IN BLACK: No other object as been misidentified as a flying saucer more often than the planet Venus.

ROKY CRIKENSON: Really?

(Seemingly no time has passed, but Mulder and Scully are back in the room.)

That was when I realized something was weird.

SCULLY: At which point?

ROKY CRIKENSON: See, normally, if two strangers drive into my garage, I tell them to get the hell off the property. But this time, I didn't! It was like I was in a trance or something.

MULDER: What did these men look like?

ROKY CRIKENSON: Usually, I'm really good with faces, but this time, all I can remember is how they were dressed. They were...

MULDER: All in black?

(Roky stares at him, then looks at Scully, then slumps back slightly, staring at Mulder.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: How'd you know that?

MULDER: Since the '50s, people who have had close encounters have reported subsequent visits by these unearthly men in black.

(Scully seems like she thinks this is all ridiculous. Jose Chung talks over the scene.)

JOSE CHUNG: But you know, myths about men in black garments...

(Cut back to the present day, X-Files office.)

...have been recorded throughout history in many different cultures. The Celtic legends are filled with trickster men in black and how anyone who encounters them becomes enchanted.

SCULLY: Unfortunately, I'm not sure that modern reconstruction of ancient fairy tales lends any more credence to Roky's testimony.

(Cut back to the garage. The man in black steps out of the car and walks slowly towards Roky.)

1ST MAN IN BLACK: Even the former leader of your United States of America, James Earl Carter Jr., thought he saw a UFO once...

(He looks down at the document, which reads "The Truth About Aliens by Roky Crikenson.")

But it's been proven he only saw the planet Venus.

(Roky grabs the document and clutches it close to his chest, leaning back in his chair as far as possible.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: I'm a republican.

1ST MAN IN BLACK: Venus was at its peak brilliance last night. You probably thought you saw something up in the sky other than Venus, but I assure you, it was Venus.

ROKY CRIKENSON: I know...

(Roky sits up, but the man in black pushes him back to where he was.)

What I saw.

(The man in black leans in as he talks, basically scaring the hell out of Roky.)

1ST MAN IN BLACK: Your scientists have yet to discover how neural networks create self-consciousness, let alone how the human brain processes two-dimensional retinal images into the three-dimensional phenomenon known as perception.

(The man in black stands and holds his arms in disbelief.)

Yet you somehow brazenly declare seeing is believing?

(The second man in black walks over to Roky, his face shaded to all but Roky.)

Mister Crikenson, your scientific illiteracy makes me shudder, and I wouldn't flaunt your ignorance by telling anyone that you saw anything last night other than the planet Venus, because if you do, you're a dead man.

(He gets back in the car. The second man in black is already in.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: You... can't threaten me.

1ST MAN IN BLACK: I just did.

(He rolls up the window. The garage door opens and the MIB's car pulls out of the garage backwards and speeds back the way it came, backwards. Roky stares in disbelief. Seemingly no time has passed, but Roky passes the document to Mulder.)

ROKY CRIKENSON: This is what they wanted me not to show anyone.

(Mulder looks at it as Roky stands.)

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go pack.

MULDER: If we have any more questions, where can we find you?

ROKY CRIKENSON: You won't find me.

(Mulder looks up at him. Roky leaves.)



SCENE 6
MOTEL ROOM

(Mulder sits on a bed across from another, which has Scully in it. Mulder reads from the document.)

MULDER: " I sat in my stalled truck, frozen in terror, watching as this third alien attacked the other two gray aliens. And then it happened, the thing that forever changed my life...

(Cut to the past. Roky drives up in his electric company crane car and stops next to the abandoned car. The crude-looking behemoth roaring, swings at the other two grays, who duck under his blows. Roky leans over, shrinking down in his seat. Footsteps approach and the behemoth roars. A thunderous voice echoes through the area.)

LORD KINBOTE: Roky! Roky!

(Roky sits up slightly to see the giant behemoth standing next to the car, talking to him.)

Be thou not afraid! No harm will come unto thee.

ROKY CRIKENSON: Wh, what do you want from me?

LORD KINBOTE: Your efforts are needed for the survival of all earthlings.

ROKY CRIKENSON: How can I do that?

(The behemoth motions for him to come out of the car.)

LORD KINBOTE: Come. I shall showeth...

(Cut back to the motel room. Mulder is still reading.)

MULDER: "...thee. Before I knew it, I was aboard the hover vessel and was not heading into outer space, but inner space, heading towards the earth's molten core. For that is the domain of the third alien, whose name, he soon told me... was Lord Kinbote."

(Mulder looks up at Scully. Cut to the X-Files office.)

SCULLY: In short, Roky showed signs of being what is known as a fantasy-prone personality.

JOSE CHUNG: Agent Scully, you are so kindhearted. He's a nut! I just read his manifesto!

SCULLY: How did you get a copy?

(He pulls out the manifesto.)

JOSE CHUNG: One was sent to my publishers. I don't know what was more disturbing... his description of the inner core reincarnated souls sex orgy... or the fact that the whole thing is written in screenplay format.

SCULLY: It definitely was peculiar.

JOSE CHUNG: Well, surely, your partner didn't believe any of it?

SCULLY: Wh, wh, well, Mulder's had his share of peculiar notions. He's not inclined to dismiss anything outright.

(Cut back to the motel room.)

Mulder, you're nuts!

MULDER: I'm not saying he isn't delusional, I'm just suggesting that his delusional state was triggered by something he actually witnessed that night. And the first part of his story verifies the boy's version. In fact, the only version that doesn't add up is the girl's.

(He picks up the phone and starts to dial.)

SCULLY: Who are you calling?

MULDER: I'm going to arrange to have her re-hypnotized.

SCULLY: Re-hypnotized? What for?

MULDER: To see if what she remembers is really what she remembers.

(Once again, in the interrogation room, everybody is standing as before.)

FINGERS: You are feeling very sleepy, very relaxed. As your body calmly drifts deeper and deeper into a state of peaceful relaxation, you will respond only to the sound of my voice.

(Scully talks over the scene.)

SCULLY: So the girl was put under again to see if she could confirm any of the boy's story. And as I suspected she might under such conditions, she did.

(Chrissy holds up her hands to show how she blocked the shots.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: The whole time it's beating me, I'm like this. And then I, I'm flying through the air.

(She slowly lowers her hands. The room becomes wavy again. Manners takes a sip of his coffee.)

FINGERS: Now what's happening?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Some men are lifting me off the ground... men in Air Force uniforms.

MULDER: Air Force?

FINGERS: Where are you now, Chrissy?

(Chrissy sits in a chair in a bright room. In front of her now are not aliens, but C.I.A. men and such standing in the same position as the others did. Chrissy and Fingers talk over the scene.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: I'm in a room. In an office. I'm surrounded by men. Some are in uniforms, some are in suits.

FINGERS: What is he saying?

(The man replacing Doctor Fingers talks.)

HAND: You're feeling very sleepy, very relaxed.

CHRISSY GIORGIO: I don't remember.

FINGERS: What are the other men doing?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: They seem to be arguing.

(The man replacing Manners now speaks.)

AIR FORCE MAN #1: Ask her if this third alien had a Russian accent.

(Now the man replacing Mulder talks.)

CIA MAN #1: This is way beyond their capabilities. This is way beyond our capabilities.

CIA MAN #2: Ask if she knows where the gray alien's saucer went to.

CIA MAN #1: How is she going to know that?

AIR FORCE MAN #1: Have we located any of the others?

CIA MAN #2: We're combing the area but this weather makes it tough.

(The man replacing Scully walks up to her.)

CIA MAN #1: All right. Rinse her out and give her the usual abduction rigmarole.

FINGERS: What is the doctor doing now?

CHRISSY GIORGIO: He's telling me this is for the good of my country. I don't like what he's doing. He's stealing my memories.

(Later, Scully and Mulder talk in the empty interrogation room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I think you and the hypnotherapist were leading her and I think there was more confabulation in the second version than in the first.

MULDER: No, I think you're wrong about that, Scully. But I do think you're right about one thing, that this case might not have anything to do with aliens.

(Manners walks in.)

MANNERS: Hey, I just got a call from some crazy blankety-blank claiming he found a real live dead alien body.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other.)



SCENE 7
BLAINE FAULKNER'S ROOM

(Blaine is sitting on his bed. Chung is sitting at the desk.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: I know how crazy this is going to sound, but... I want to be abducted by aliens.

JOSE CHUNG: Why? Whatever for?

BLAINE FAULKNER: I hate this town. I hate... people. I just want to be taken away to someplace where I... I don't have to worry about finding a job.

JOSE CHUNG: So you were out in the field that night?

(Blaine nods.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: Looking for UFOs.

(Cut to a wooded area. Blaine walks through the tall underbrush, carrying a flashlight. Blaine and Chung talk over the scene.)

There had been some recent sightings so I was just hoping to stumble across one.

(Blaine yells and falls flat on his face as he trips over something.)

Now, I've read every book ever written about UFOs and aliens, not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

(Blaine looks back at the thing, puts on his glasses and shines his flashlight. He gasps and tries to struggle to his feet and crawls off in the other direction of his findings.)

I should've known to just go get my video camera then instead of notifying the proper authorities.

(He runs off. After, he watches a black car, much like the MIB one, pull up next to a police car.)

JOSE CHUNG: What was wrong with doing that?

BLAINE FAULKNER: Because the proper authorities showed up with a couple of men in black.

(The "men in black," Scully and Mulder, get out of their car, carrying flashlights, and slowly walk towards him.)

One of them was disguised as a woman, but wasn't pulling it off. Like, her hair was red but it was a little too red, you know? And the other one... the tall, lanky one... his face was so blank and expressionless. He didn't even seem human. I, I think he was a mandroid.

(Blaine turns around, wincing, feeling stupid and afraid. Mulder indeed shows no emotion as they approach the dead gray alien's body.)

The only time he reacted was when he saw the dead body.

(Mulder lets out a very girlie, high-pitched shriek.)

MANNERS: Yeah, that's a bleeping dead alien body if I ever bleeping saw one.

SCULLY: Wrap it up.

OFFICER: You got him?

(Two officers do so. Manners, Mulder and another officer walk away. Scully looks at Blaine, then grabs him by the collar. Blaine gasps as the light is shone in his face.)

SCULLY: You never saw this. This didn't happen. You tell anyone, you're a dead man.

(Scully pushes him away slightly as Blaine whimpers. She walks away. Cut to the present day, X-Files office.)

He said I said what?

JOSE CHUNG: When I interviewed him, he claimed you threatened him.

SCULLY: That's ridiculous! I'm... and besides, we allowed him to view the autopsy.

(Cut to the autopsy room. Scully takes a scalpel to the alien's chest when Blaine bursts in. He sees the body.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: Whoa!

(He runs towards them, holding a video camera. Manners grabs him and pushes him back, trying to keep the camera off the autopsy.)

MANNERS: Hey, hey!

BLAINE FAULKNER: You can't suppress the truth! The people have a right to know! Roswell... Roswell!

MULDER: Hey! Does that video camera work?

(Manners and Blaine look at him. Blaine nods. Afterwards, the video camera records various horrible shots of the autopsy that don't show much. A gentler version of the X-Files theme song plays in the background. Scully inspects the mouth, then takes a sawblade to the alien's head. Yappi appears to a starry background.)

YAPPI: Is this actual footage of an alien autopsy?

(He raises his left eyebrow.)

Or simply a well-made hoax?

(Cut to the X-Files office, where Chung fast-forwards the tape.)

JOSE CHUNG: So this is footage of the actual autopsy you performed.

(Scully groans and walks by the monitor.)

SCULLY: This is so embarrassing.

(Scully looks at the case to the video: "Dead Alien! Truth or Humbug." A picture of Yappi is in the lower corner. Chung presses play.)

YAPPI: Who is that mysterious man who seems to be overseeing the proceedings?

(The camera does not show Mulder's face as it goes around the body, then zooms in on Scully.)

And what secret government agency does this autopsy doctor work for?

SCULLY: But see? Whoever got ahold of this footage edited it in such a way as to delete all the significant findings.

(In the autopsy room, Scully peels back the skin with forceps.)

There appear to be two layers of epidermis. There's a metal strip that runs just under the top layer down the...

(He looks up at Mulder.)

It's a zipper.

(Mulder looks closely, then Scully pulls off the "head" to reveal a dead human body instead of a dead alien one. She holds up the mask as Mulder frowns. After all of the costume is taken off, she takes off her mask. Everyone is dismayed.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: You mean it, it's... it's just a dead human being? Well...

(He gags and runs to the bathroom.)

MANNERS: Well, then who is this bleep?

MULDER: I don't know, but I bet we can find his I.D. from the, uh, military database.

(Scully carries a copy of the identification form, walking towards Mulder in a hallway.)

Have you seen our video cameraman?

SCULLY: No, but I found our alien's I.D. You were right, Mulder. Air Force Major Robert Vallee.

MULDER: That was fast.

(He looks down the hallway at two soldiers being led by the air force man in Chrissy's dream.)

AIR FORCE MAN: Agent Mulder?

(Mulder nods.)

We were notified one of our officers was confined here under your custody.

MULDER: Who notified you?

AIR FORCE MAN: Major Vallee is AWOL, sir. Our orders are to escort him back to the base.

SCULLY: Well, the major is dead. His body is being detained for further investigation.

AIR FORCE MAN: Investigation into what, ma'am?

MULDER: Possible kidnapping.

AIR FORCE MAN: May we at least view the body for verification?

SCULLY: I don't see why no...

MULDER: No, no, no, but you can talk to the other AWOL pilot that was brought in with him.

AIR FORCE MAN: Lieutenant Jack Schaffer is also in your custody?

MULDER: That's right. Yeah, he's, he's, he's right down...

(He points down the hallway and sees no one.)

Here. Oh. He, he was, he was here just a few minutes ago. I, I... I guess he's still AWOL.

(The Air Force Man glares at him.)

You want to take a look at Vallee?

(They walk into the autopsy room to find the body gone.)

AIR FORCE MAN: Hmmm. Guess he's still AWOL.

(He walks out.)

SCULLY: So what else is new?

MULDER: I got to find that video guy.

(Mulder walks off. Cut back to Blaine's room. He is watching the video. Scully talks in it as she works on the body.)

SCULLY: The wound is situated to the left of the midline abdomen. The edges of the tissue appear...

(There is a knock on the door. Blaine gets up and goes to the door.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: Who is it?

(The door is slammed forward into his face and Blaine yells a few times, falling backwards. The man in black walks in, followed by the second one. They step over Blaine and go to the VCR.)

Hey! You just can't... what do you think you're doing?

(Blaine stands.)

Hey, I...

(The second man in black grabs him on the shoulder. Blaine looks at him and smiles, knowing the man.)

Hey!

(The first MIB rips the top off of the VCR, destroying it and takes the tape. Blaine runs to him.)

You have no right to suppress th...

(The MIB picks him up.)

Roswell! Roswell! Ros...

(Blaine is put into a sharp-looking side backbreaker and falls to the floor, unconscious. Blaine talks over the scene.)

I was unconscious for... I don't know how long. And the only reason I came to was...

(Seemingly no time passes, but Blaine is woken up by a sharp slap to the face by Mulder. Mulder, wearing all black, grabs him by the collar.)

MULDER: Where's the tape?

BLAINE FAULKNER: They took it.

(He is slapped again.)

MULDER: Who?

(Blaine starts to cry.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: The other men in black.

MULDER: If I find out you lied to me, you're a dead man.

(He throws Blaine's head back to the floor. Blaine's eyes roll back into his head, lapsing back into unconsciousness. Cut to his interview with Chung.)

BLAINE FAULKNER: And that's when he left. I never saw any of them again.

JOSE CHUNG: Aren't you nervous telling me all this after receiving all those death threats?

BLAINE FAULKNER: Well, I didn't, I didn't spend all those years playing Dungeons and Dragons and not learn a little something about courage.

JOSE CHUNG: Oh.

(He chuckles, then straightens his face and writes something down.)

Mm-hmm.



SCENE 8
KLASS COUNTY; WASHINGTON

(Mulder is driving down the road. Scully talks over the scene.)

SCULLY: After not recovering the tape, Mulder was heading back to the motel and that's when his account of things gets a little... odd.

(A man walks out into the room and Mulder screeches to a halt to not hit him. He looks at the man and turns around, driving after him. He drives alongside the man, who is half-naked and cut up.)

MULDER: Lieutenant Jack Schaffer?

(The man stops and looks at him. He grabs Mulder by the collar.)

JACK SCHAFFER: This is not happening! It's not happening! This is not happening. It's not happening. It's not happening.

(Later, they sit at a diner counter. Schaffer plays with his mashed potatoes with his fork. The cook is cleaning the counters near the front of the store. The pink neon sign shines brightly.)

Used to project the image of the Virgin Mary over the French trenches in World War One. The enemy's always willing to fire upon an invading force... but on a holy miracle?

MULDER: Or on visitors from outer space?

JACK SCHAFFER: Yeah, the enemy sees an American recon plane, they start shooting. They see a flying saucer from another galaxy... they hesitate.

(He puts down his fork.)

You know what happens to most people after seeing a UFO?

(He puts a cigarette in his mouth.)

MULDER: They experience "missing time."

JACK SCHAFFER: Any number of "soft option kills" will do... nerve gas... low frequency infrasound beams...

(He lights a match.)

Hell, with high-powered microwaves, you can not only cut enemy communications, you can cook internal organs.

(He lights the cigarette and shakes the match out.)

MULDER: But abductions?

JACK SCHAFFER: Don't know as much about them. I'm just the pilot. You ever flown a flying saucer?

(Mulder shrugs slightly.)

Afterwards, sex seems trite.

(He takes another drag.)

MULDER: But what do you do with the abductees?

JACK SCHAFFER: Take them back to the base. Let the doctors work on them. Nothing physical, they just mess with their minds.

MULDER: Hypnosis.

(Schaffer nods.)

JACK SCHAFFER: At the base, I've seen people go into an ordinary room with an ordinary bunch of doctors... and come out absolutely positive they were probed by aliens.

MULDER: But if abductions are just a covert intelligence operation and UFOs are merely secret military airships, piloted by aliens such as yourself... then what were you abducted by?

JACK SCHAFFER: Don't you get it? I'm absolutely positive me, my copilot, and those two kids were abducted but I can't be absolutely sure it happened. I can't be sure of anything anymore!

MULDER: What do you mean?

JACK SCHAFFER: I'm not sure we're even having this conversation. I don't know if these mashed potatoes are really here. I don't know if you even exist.

MULDER: I can only assure you that I do.

JACK SCHAFFER: Well... thanks, buddy. Unfortunately... I can't give you the same assurance about me.

(The door slams. Mulder and Jack look over to see a number of soldiers being led by the Air Force Man. Jack takes a drag of his cigarette and prepares to leave.)

Well, looks like I'm a dead man.

MULDER: Wait a minute, wait a minute. It can't all be fake memory implantations. What about that third alien? What, what was that thing?

JACK SCHAFFER: Who? Lord Kinbote?

(He stands.)

SOLDIER: Right, come on.

(Everybody walks out but Mulder. Cut to the X-Files office.)

JOSE CHUNG: That is odd. Because almost every day I was there, I ate lunch at that diner and became dear friends with the cook. He told me a story about the night you're talking about.

(He looks at another set of notes. Cut back to the diner. The neon sign now says "Ovaltine." Mulder walks in. Chung talks over the scene.)

A man walked into his place...

MULDER: Sweet potato pie.

(Chung continues talking.)

JOSE CHUNG: Sat down, ordered sweet potato pie, identified himself as F.B.I. Agent Mulder.

(Mulder sits and holds up his badge towards... us, effectively breaking down the fourth wall. The cook walks over and takes out a piece of pie.)

He then questioned my friend.

(The cook puts down a piece of pie in front of Mulder.)

MULDER: You ever seen a UFO in these parts?

(Mulder takes a huge bite. The cook watches him. Chung talks again.)

JOSE CHUNG: He then ordered piece after piece, each time asking another question.

(The cook picks up the empty plate and puts another one down.)

MULDER: You ever experienced a period of "missing time?"

(He takes another huge bite. Later, the cook replaces that empty plate with one with another piece of pie.)

You ever had the suspicion that you've been abducted by aliens?

(Another piece of pie is soon to come.)

Have you ever found a metal implant in your body?

(The cook shakes his head. Mulder digs into another piece of pie.)

Have you checked everywhere?

(The cook looks at him. Mulder stands and puts a bill down on the counter. Chung talks over the scene.)

JOSE CHUNG: He ate a whole pie in that fashion, then got up and left. My friend never saw him again.

(Mulder leaves.)

The cook never mentioned Lieutenant Schaffer, let alone any other Air Force personnel.

(Cut back to the X-Files office. Scully is placid.)

You seem non-nonplused by these contradictions?

SCULLY: Well, not after what happened when Mulder left the diner and got back to the motel.



SCENE 9
SCULLY'S MOTEL ROOM

(Mulder knocks on the door to Scully's room, number seventeen. The door swings open as he does.)

MULDER: Scully?

(Mulder sees the second man in black sitting on the bed, facing away. The first man in black is looking through her dresser. Mulder whips out his gun.)

Where's Scully?

1ST MAN IN BLACK: Oh. She, uh... she went to get some ice.

MULDER: Where is she?!

(Mulder is quite angry. Scully calmly walks in behind him, carrying a full bucket of ice. She puts it down on the nightstand.)

Scully, what's going on here?

SCULLY: Mulder, these gentlemen have something very important to tell you.

(The first man in black walks towards Mulder.)

1ST MAN IN BLACK: Some alien encounters are hoaxes perpetrated by your government to manipulate the public. Some of these hoaxes are intentionally revealed to manipulate the truth-seekers who become discredited if they disclose the deliberately absurd deception.

(Mulder puts the gun away and walks to the man.)

MULDER: Similar things are said about the men in black. That they purposely dress and behave strangely so that if anyone tries to describe an encounter with them, they come off sounding like a lunatic.

1ST MAN IN BLACK: I find absolutely no reason why anyone would think you crazy if you described this meeting of ours.

(The second man in black puts his hand on Mulder's shoulder. He bears an uncanny resemblance to Alex Trebek.)

2ND MAN IN BLACK: You're feeling very sleepy, very... relaxed.

(Chung talks over the scene.)

JOSE CHUNG: Alex Trebek?

(Cut to the X-Files office.)

The game show host?

SCULLY: Mulder didn't say that it was Alex Trebek. It was just someone that looked incredibly like him.

JOSE CHUNG: Did he? I mean, you were there.

SCULLY: Well, not exactly, I'm... I don't have any recollection of this. I... was surprised to wake up the next morning with Mulder asleep in my room.

(Cut back to the motel room. Scully is under the covers in her bed, Mulder is sitting in the opposite one.)

But, Mulder... I, I don't even remember letting you in.

MULDER: I told you, you didn't let me in. They were already here.

(The phone rings. Scully answers.)

SCULLY: Scully. We'll be right there.

(Mulder dips his hands in the ice bucket, finding water instead. Scully hangs up.)

That was Detective Manners. He said they just found your bleeping UFO.



SCENE 10
WRECKAGE SITE

(Mulder, Scully and Manners walk towards a downed plane. Soldiers are all over the place. A number of them carry out a body on a sheet.)

MANNERS: Apparently, that was the cause of all those UFO sightings three nights ago. They refused our assistance because it's some kind of top secret, experimental plane.

(They stop walking.)

MULDER: They don't want assistance. They want witnesses to their alibi.

(The officers carrying the body walk by.)

OFFICER: Excuse me, ma'am.

(Mulder looks at the body of Jack Schaffer. He runs after them. Another group of men pass carrying the body of Robert Vallee.)

MANNERS: Hey! That was the guy that was...

(Scully looks at him and runs off after them. Manners looks at the deserted wreckage.)

Bleep.



SCENE 11
X-FILES OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Chung dots the last period harshly and glares at Scully.)

SCULLY: I know it probably doesn't have the sense of closure that you want... but it has more than some of our other cases.

(Chung closes his notebook.)



SCENE 12
JOSE CHUNG'S OFFICE

(Chung is typing on the typewriter. He hears murmuring outside and sees a silhouette in his window. He takes out his gun and slowly makes his way to the door. He opens it to see Mulder and another man starting off.)

JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder?

(He motions for him to come in. Mulder looks at the other man.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(Mulder walks in and Chung closes the door. They stand opposite each other at the desk.)

JOSE CHUNG: What can I do for you, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Don't write this book.

(Chung sits. Mulder walks over to the left and stands next to a small dresser with books.)

You'll perform a disservice through a field of inquiry that has always struggled for respectability. You're a gifted writer, but no amount of talent could describe the events that occurred in any realistic vein because they deal with alternative realities that we've yet to comprehend. And when presented in the wrong way, in the wrong context, the incidents and the people involved in them can appear foolish, if not downright psychotic.

(He walks back to the right, in front of Chung's desk.)

I also know that your publishing house is owned by Warden White, Incorporated... a subsidiary of MacDougall-Kesler, which makes me suspect a covert agenda for your book on the part of the military-industrial-entertainment complex.

JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder, this book will be written. But it can only benefit if you can explain something to me.

MULDER: What's that?

JOSE CHUNG: What really happened to those kids on that night?

(Mulder looks down.)

MULDER: How the hell should I know?

(Chung stands in anger.)

JOSE CHUNG: Agent Mulder, I appreciate this little visit but I have deadlines to face.

(Mulder stares at him for a second, then walks out as Chung sits back down. Chung starts to type again, but stops and looks at the door. He talks over the scene.)

Evidence of extraterrestrial existence remains as elusive as ever...

(Cut to Blaine, pointing his flashlight to the sky as he is lifted up on the electric company crane. Chung continues to talk.)

...but the skies will continue to be searched by the likes of Blaine Faulkner, hoping to someday find not only proof of alien life, but also contentment on a new world. Until then, he must be content with his new job.

(Blaine screams as sparks fly off of the electric pole. Cut to El Cajon, California. A group of people sit on the floor, gathered around Roky, who is standing in front of a strange diagram of the earth with a triangle in the middle, much like an Egyptian pyramid. The triangle has an eye in each corner and clouds in the middle. Roky is wearing a crystal necklace. Chung continues to talk from his book.)

Others search for answers from within. Roky relocated to El Cajon, California, preaching to the lost and desperate.

ROKY CRIKENSON: And so, at each death, the soul descends further into the inner earth, attaining ever greater levels of purification, reaching... enlightenment at the core. Assuming, of course, that your soul is able to avoid... the lava men.

(He holds his crystal. Cut to the X-Files office, where she is reading Jose Chung's new book, "From Outer Space." Chung talks over.)

JOSE CHUNG: Seeking the truth about aliens means a perfunctory nine-to-five job to some. For although Agent Diana Lesky is noble spirit and pure of heart, she remains, nevertheless, a federal employee.

(Scully glares at the book. Cut to Mulder's apartment. Mulder lies in his bed, shirt off, watching television. He changes the channel. Chung continues his monologue.)

As for her partner, Reynard Muldrake... that ticking timebomb of insanity... his quest into the unknown has so warped his psyche, one shudders to think how he receives pleasures from life.

(Mulder watches the television intently, a shaky video camera footage of Bigfoot walking through the woods far away. Cut to Chrissy Giorgio, typing at her computer.)

Chrissy Giorgio has come to believe her alien visitation was a message to improve her own world, and she has devoted herself to this goal wholeheartedly.

(There is another rattling on the window. She goes to it and opens it to reveal Harold standing outside.)

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Oh, it's you. What do you want?

HAROLD LAMB: I just wanted to tell you I still love you.

CHRISSY GIORGIO: Love. Is that all you men think about?

(She closes her window. Harold's eyes tear up. Chung keeps talking.)

JOSE CHUNG: Then there are those who care not about extraterrestrials, searching for meaning in other human beings. Rare or lucky are those who find it.

(Harold starts off.)

For although we may not be alone in the universe, in our own separate ways on this planet, we are all... alone.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
WASHINGTON, D.C., MARCH 7, 1996

(Skinner is in his lawyer's office. He sits at a table with some papers in front of him while the lawyer paces behind him.)

SKINNER: This is it? I just sign this and it's done?

JANE CASSAL: As soon as I file it with the City Clerk.

SKINNER: (staring at his pen) This pen ... she gave it to me. It was an anniversary present. I don't remember which one.

JANE CASSAL: Walter. They are expecting the signed documents by the end of business today - which was 10 minutes ago.

SKINNER: I know what time it is.

JANE CASSAL: Then you should sign.

(Skinner puts the cap back on the pen, stands and puts his coat on.)

JANE CASSAL: What are you doing, Walter?

SKINNER: After seventeen years, they can wait another day.

JANE CASSAL: Listen. No one knows better than I what an emotional experience this is ...

SKINNER: Don't "lawyer" me, Jane. I'll do it tomorrow.

JANE CASSAL: Why put yourself through another day of this?

SKINNER: I said tomorrow.

(He leaves. She gathers the papers, which have at the top "Petition for Dissolution of Marriage.")



SCENE 2
CHESAPEAKE LOUNGE, AMBASSADOR HOTEL

(Skinner sits alone at the bar in the crowded lounge. A young woman approaches him.)

CARINA SAYLES: Excuse me. Are you holding this for someone? It's the only open seat.

SKINNER: Go ahead.

BARTENDER: (to Carina) Good evening. What can I get you?

CARINA SAYLES: Tonic water with lime, please.

BARTENDER: Sir, would you like another one?

SKINNER: Sure.

CARINA SAYLES: (to Skinner) Thanks.

SKINNER: For what? Ordering another drink?

CARINA SAYLES: There's a man behind me wearing a red tie. For some reason, he felt compelled to tell me half his life story. I was afraid if you got up, he might try to get in the other half.

SKINNER: (smiles) I guess some people think that you owe something, just 'cause you're out alone.

CARINA SAYLES: Does it ever bother you?

SKINNER: What?

CARINA SAYLES: Being alone.

(Skinner and Carina are making love in a room at the hotel. He has his head back and eyes closed as Carina kisses his neck. There is a screeching noise and when Skinner opens his eyes, he sees an old woman lying on top of him instead of Carina. He then appears to awaken from a dream, breathing heavily and sweating. He looks beside him and sees Carina lying motionless, the sheet partially covering her face. When he lifts the sheet, he discovers that both her back and face are toward him. Her neck has been broken. He recoils in horror.)

SCENE 3

(Mulder has come to the hotel the next morning. As he gets off the elevator, Carina's body is being wheeled out on a stretcher. There are several officers and detectives in the hallway. He flashes his badge at an officer and then approaches two officers outside the room.)

MULDER: I'm looking for Detective Waltos?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Who's asking?

MULDER: My name is Mulder. I work with Assistant Director Skinner. I'd like to speak with him.

(Skinner is sitting in a chair in the room. Mulder's cell phone rings.)

DETECTIVE WALTOS: You can see him after he gives his statement. We're gonna finish up at the station house.

MULDER: Why don't you just get a statement here?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: It seems that the Assistant Director is suffering from a minor memory lapse.

(Waltos goes back into the room while Mulder answers his phone.)

MULDER: (to phone) Yeah.

(Scully is calling from her car. She is driving in a heavy rain.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. I just got your message. You said Skinner called in a homicide?

MULDER: Yeah, it appears to be a little more complicated than that. It seems like he had a front-row seat.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

MULDER: I don't understand it either. They're not letting me talk to him. Hold on a second.

(Skinner and Waltos are coming out of the room.)

MULDER: (to Skinner) Excuse me, sir?

SKINNER: I appreciate your concern, Agent Mulder, but there's no need for you to get involved in this.

(He continues down the hall, followed by Waltos. Waltos is reluctant to talk to Mulder.)

MULDER: Detective? Detective? Detective? (Waltos finally stops) Can you at least tell me what happened? What does he say happened?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Well, he claims he met the victim in the bar downstairs. After a couple of drinks, they decided to get a room together, which is all fine except when he wakes up, he finds her lying next to him with a broken neck. That's all he says he remembers.

MULDER: You don't believe him?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: He refused to take a polygraph test. It's not helping his credibility.

MULDER: What about the victim? Has she been identified?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Not yet. She had no purse, nothing with a name on it.

MULDER: Well, there must be evidence of an intruder of some kind.

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Uh, Agent Mulder, I've been on the job for eighteen years. I know the drill.

MULDER: Well, then, if you know the drill, then you should be canvassing hotel employees, housekeeping ...

DETECTIVE WALTOS: I appreciate that he's a colleague of yours, but I want you to understand something. He's also a suspect.

(Waltos starts to leave again.)

MULDER: Detective? (hands him his card) When you're done questioning him, I'd appreciate a call.

DETECTIVE WALTOS: All right.

(Mulder resumes his phone conversation with Scully.)

MULDER: Get any of that?

SCULLY: Most of it. Mulder, I'm on my way.

MULDER: No, no, I want you to take a look at that body. Get down to the coroner's. I'll meet you there.

(Mulder steps into the room and sees the outline of Carina's body marked on the bed.)

(Scully is at the coroner's, recording notes from her examination of Carina's body.)

SCULLY: (to recorder) The conspicuous absence of any contusions or lacerations would strongly suggest that the victim's injuries were sustained without a struggle. From my observations, I would have to concur with the county coroner's report that her murder was most probably a sudden and violent act (Mulder enters) in a vulnerable moment. Beyond this, I found nothing in my post-mortem examination to recommend further investigation.

MULDER: Beyond what?

SCULLY: Her spinal cord was crushed, Mulder. The cervical vertebrae was fractured in what appears to be manual trauma.

MULDER: Were Skinner's the only prints lifted from the body?

SCULLY: So far. They found no semen samples. There was some irritation, probably an allergic reaction to latex.

MULDER: At least they were having safe sex.

SCULLY: Have they learned anything more?

MULDER: Yeah. Her name was Carina Sayles. She was a legal secretary for one of the criminal defense firms here in town.

SCULLY: Have you talked to anybody she worked with?

MULDER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with one of the partners. She was fired a few weeks ago over an indiscretion.

SCULLY: An indiscretion?

MULDER: Yeah, she was doing some moonlighting. She was taking a little work on the side for one of the firm's clients.

SCULLY: What kind of work?

MULDER: This client operated an escort service. She was a prostitute.

SCULLY: Give me five minutes here.

MULDER: I'll get the car.

(Mulder leaves. Scully seems shocked by this news. She walks slowly to the light switch and turns off the lights. Looking back at the body, she notices a glow from the body. Walking back to it, she sees a glowing area around Carina's mouth and nose. She records an additional note.)

SCULLY: (To recorder) Addendum: observed what appears to be a residual phosphorescence around the victim's mouth and nose. Note to have this analyzed.



SCENE 4
1223 HANOVER STREET, GEORGETOWN

(In a stylish building, Mulder and Scully have knocked on the door of an office / apartment. A young woman answers.)

JUDY FAIRLY: Yes?

MULDER: (flashing his badge) Lorraine Kelleher?

JUDY FAIRLY: She's busy right now. Is there something I can help you with?

MULDER: Busy or not, we need to speak with her.

(They enter.)

JUDY FAIRLY: I'll tell her you're here. Lorraine?

(Judy goes to fetch Lorraine, leaving Mulder and Scully alone. The apartment is very expensively decorated.)

SCULLY: Business must be booming.

MULDER: I think you mean "banging."

(Scully gives Mulder a look as Lorraine Kelleher appears at the top of the stairs. She is a well-dressed, middle-aged woman.)

LORRAINE KELLEHER: Whatever this is about, can we do it later? I'm running late for an appointment.

SCULLY: We'd like to ask you some questions about an employee of yours - Carina Sayles. She does work for you, doesn't she?

LORRAINE KELLEHER: (coming down the stairs) I'm ten minutes late for a meeting with her.

MULDER: Oh, that's all right. I don't think she's gonna be making that meeting.

LORRAINE KELLEHER: Oh? Why not?

MULDER: She's dead. She was murdered last night.

LORRAINE KELLEHER: How?

MULDER: That's what we're still trying to determine.

LORRAINE KELLEHER: I, um, I don't know what to say.

SCULLY: Well, you can start by telling us if she was working last night, and if she was, who paid for her company.

LORRAINE KELLEHER: I'm afraid I can't do that.

MULDER: I guess that would hurt future book sales, huh?

LORRAINE KELLEHER: You'd be surprised who some of my clients are.

MULDER: No, I don't think I would be.

SCULLY: I also doubt that they'd want to get entangled in a homicide investigation.

MULDER: Look, we just need one name from you. Who hired Carina Sayles?

LORRAINE KELLEHER: Let's just say you both work for the government. And so do I.

MULDER: (sharply) Cut the crap. Who hired her?

LORRAINE KELLEHER: She called me last night. She said that she'd met someone in a bar who was interested in a transaction. I took his credit card.

MULDER: Then you have his name.

LORRAINE KELLEHER: Walter Skinner.

(Mulder closes his eyes for a moment and then nods.)

MULDER: Thank you.

(He leaves. Scully, also disappointed, lingers for a moment.)

(They are now leaving the building and walking toward their car.)

MULDER: What the hell was he thinking?

SCULLY: It just doesn't seem like him.

MULDER: You'd think he'd be a little more discrete.

SCULLY: Well, I think the lack of discretion is the least of his sins.

MULDER: Still, not enough to prove anything conclusively.

SCULLY: No, but that doesn't mean that we can discount the evidence.

MULDER: You really believe Skinner did this?

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, I feel the same way about Skinner as you do, but we were just shown a dated record with Skinner's credit card number on it.

MULDER: Credit card fraud happens every day.

SCULLY: Skinner was in bed with a prostitute at the time of her death, and he's offered us no explanation or alibi. (they get into the car) Truth is, we don't know very much about him. We don't know what he does off duty, who he really is.

MULDER: We know that he's put his ass on the line for us a number of times. We owe it to him to find out what really happened.

SCULLY: Even if it means proving his guilt?

(Mulder's cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Yeah, Mulder. Thank you. (hangs up)

SCULLY: Who was that?

MULDER: Detective Waltos. Skinner's been released on his own recognizance.



SCENE 5
SECOND DISTRICT POLICE STATION

(Skinner is walking out of the building as Mulder and Scully drive up. They run to catch up with him, but Skinner continues to walk away from them, crossing the street.)

MULDER: Sir? Sir?

SKINNER: This doesn't concern either of you.

MULDER: Of course it concerns us.

SCULLY: Why won't you tell us what happened last night, sir?

SKINNER: Read the police report if you're really that curious.

MULDER: Does it explain why you refused to take a polygraph test? Or why there's a prostitute in the morgue with your fingerprints all over her?

(Skinner stops and looks back at Mulder in surprise.)

SKINNER: You didn't know she was a prostitute, did you?

(Skinner looks at Mulder, then Scully. Beyond them, he sees an old woman, the same one he saw in the hotel room, standing on the steps to the police station and wearing a bright red, hooded overcoat. Skinner moves past Mulder and starts back across the street, nearly getting hit by several cars and prompting several horn honks and appropriate comments from motorists. As he gets to the other side of the street, the old woman is no longer where she was. He does see a woman walking toward the police station wearing a bright red coat. He runs after her, grabbing her by the shoulder and turning her around just as she reaches the door. She pulls off the hood, but it's not the old woman.)

SHARON SKINNER: Walter. I just heard what happened. I was coming to see you.

(Skinner looks at her, then turns and walks away without saying anything. Mulder and Scully approach the woman.)

SHARON SKINNER: Walter?

SCULLY: Do you know him?

SHARON SKINNER: I used to think so. I'm Sharon Skinner. I'm his wife.



SCENE 6

(Mulder, Scully and Sharon Skinner are talking at a table in the police station.)

SCULLY: We were just a little caught off guard. Neither of us even knew that he was married. I mean, he never told us.

SHARON SKINNER: Well, one of the things Walter has always been good at is keeping secrets. But the truth is, we haven't been together for almost 8 months.

SCULLY: Has he always been such a private person?

SHARON SKINNER: It's more than that. He lives under this misguided notion that silence is strength. He's built a wall to keep everyone out.

SCULLY: Including you?

SHARON SKINNER: Yeah, especially me.

SCULLY: Is that why you were separated?

SHARON SKINNER: I just realized one day that we were no longer married. We'd become roommates instead. We were paying the bills, taking out the garbage ... and I couldn't live like that any more.

(Scully's cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: Excuse me.

(She steps away from the table to answer. Mulder and Sharon Skinner continue to talk, while Scully takes the call in the background.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Scully.

SHARON SKINNER: You were one of the few people that Walter ever mentioned from work.

SCULLY: Yes.

SHARON SKINNER: Not that he said much, but from the way he talked, I could tell he respected you.

SCULLY: Where?

SHARON SKINNER: That's probably why I feel that I can ask you.

MULDER: Ask me what?

SCULLY: OK.

SHARON SKINNER: If Walter really killed that woman.

(Scully hangs up and rejoins them.)

SCULLY: Sorry. Mulder, we've gotta go. (to Sharon) You have our numbers if you need to reach us.

SHARON SKINNER: (to Mulder as he stands) You still haven't answered my question.

MULDER: No. I don't think he did it.



SCENE 7

(At FBI headquarters, Mulder and Scully enter Skinner's office to find a man sitting at his desk and reading his papers.)

SCULLY: What's going on here?

AGENT BONNECAZE: Agents Mulder and Scully?

SCULLY: That's right.

MULDER: Yeah.

AGENT BONNECAZE: I'm Special Agent Bonnecaze. I've been called up from the Norfolk field office to coordinate this inquiry.

MULDER: Well, I don't know what you do down in Norfolk, but last time I checked, rifling through a man's office was considered an invasion of privacy.

AGENT BONNECAZE: Well, we're operating under guidelines specified by the Office of Professional Conduct, a protocol I understand you've opted to disregard.

MULDER: What do you mean?

AGENT BONNECAZE: I want both of you to make yourselves available tomorrow afternoon.

SCULLY: Available for what?

AGENT BONNECAZE: A formal hearing regarding A.D. Skinner's case.

MULDER: What case? He hasn't even been charged yet.

AGENT BONNECAZE: The hearing is to assess and determine his ability to continue in his position as Assistant Director. (Mulder bites his lip and looks away, while Scully looks disgusted as well) In the meantime, we'll be appointing our own investigators to pursue any criminal case. And I must ask you to stop looking into this any further.

MULDER: For what? In case we might turn up any evidence that might support his innocence?

AGENT BONNECAZE: Any evidence you may have obtained, Agent Mulder, you'll be presenting tomorrow afternoon at the hearing.

(Mulder bites his lip again as Scully quickly leaves. Mulder lingers for a moment and then follows. Bonnecaze looks back at him as he exits.)



SCENE 8

(Mulder and Scully are in the X-Files office. Mulder is on the phone listening to ring signals.)

MULDER: Skinner's not answering his phone.

SCULLY: He's doing everything he shouldn't be doing.

MULDER: Yeah. Why? He knows better than that. The evidence is still circumstantial at best.

(Mulder hangs up.)

SCULLY: He's behaving like a guilty man, Mulder.

MULDER: The man's marriage is breaking up. He's stressed out, you know, he's ...

SCULLY: It's his irrational behavior that concerns me. It speaks to a state of mind. If, if a, if an otherwise stable man is compelled to go out and hire a prostitute, what else is he capable of?

MULDER: (shaking his head) Please. Give him the benefit of the doubt.

SCULLY: I *am*, Mulder, believe me. (puts her hand to her chest) I'm not trying to convince myself.

MULDER: When I mentioned that hooker to him, he didn't even seem to know.

SCULLY: Well, maybe he doesn't remember.

MULDER: What do you mean? Either he remembers or he's a liar.

SCULLY: Not necessarily.

(Scully is showing Mulder a videotape of a man sleeping in a hospital bed. The man is thrashing wildly.)

SCULLY: This man is running away from a train. He sees it coming straight at him. He hears its whistle. Several times a month, he ran away from that train. Until one night, he broke his wife's arm when he threw her to the floor.

MULDER: Night terrors?

SCULLY: No, night terrors and sleep walking occur doing slow-wave non-dream sleep. The clinical term for this is REM sleep behavior disorder. Although rare, dozens of cases of sleep-related violence have been attributed to it.

MULDER: It's fascinating, but what does it have to do with Skinner?

SCULLY: This video tape came from the Bethesda Sleep Disorder Center, where Skinner has been receiving treatment for the past three months.

MULDER: For running away from trains?

SCULLY: The same disorder, different dreams. (hands him a file) According to Skinner's psychiatrist, he's been experiencing a recurring dream in which he's confronted by an old woman. She speaks to him but he doesn't understand the words. Sometimes, she, she straddles his chest, suffocating him.

MULDER: So you think that Skinner may have killed the victim in his sleep?

SCULLY: Defending himself against this imaginary old woman. A lot of these patients have no recollection of their nocturnal activities, which might explain Skinner's amnesia.

MULDER: And it's not such a strange story.

SCULLY: It isn't?

(Mulder starts looking for a book in the office.)

MULDER: It's ancient, actually. You may have heard it, although not in such clinical terms. In the middle ages, a visitation like the one Skinner described would have been attributed to a succubus. It's a spirit that visits men in the night, usually in the form of an old woman.

(He finds the book on a shelf above the "I want to believe" poster and starts leafing through it.)

SCULLY: Visits them for sex?

MULDER: Usually. Though sometimes the succubus becomes so attached to the man that she would kill any woman competing for his affection. Here.

(He has pointed to a picture of a man sleeping with a naked woman standing over him. She has her outstretched hands on the man's chest, where there is a glow.)

SCULLY: (pointing to the glow) What's that?

MULDER: Reports of residual luminous phenomena have been associated with some succubus encounters, at least according to the mythology. Why?

SCULLY: I feel kinda strange saying this, but I found something during my post-mortem exam that I think you should see.

(They are at the morgue, pulling out the shelf with Carina Sayle's body.)

SCULLY: It's a circular patch around the victim's mouth and nose, approximately 11 centimeters in diameter. It retained light energy. It glowed in the dark.

(Mulder turns off the light, but there is no sign of the glow.)

SCULLY: I know what I saw, Mulder. It was here.

MULDER: This phosphorescence required no UV or infrared light?

SCULLY: No. It was definitely visible to the naked eye.

MULDER: Did you get a sample?

SCULLY: Yeah. I sent on over to Chem-Tox.

MULDER: And?

(Scully has pulled out her cell phone and is dialing a number.)

SCULLY: Well, my first hunch was that it was some kind of a fungal growth, but the only substance that they detected was amylase, which is found in saliva. So I had them send a sample to the elemental analysis unit. The results should be back. (to phone) Yes, this is Agent Dana Scully. I'm calling to find out the lab results on a tissue sample that I sent in earlier this morning. Thank you. (hangs up)

MULDER: What'd they say?

SCULLY: That there was no analyzable substance in the sample container.

MULDER: Are you sure you saw something?

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm afraid this isn't exactly something that I'd make up.

MULDER: (pushing the shelf back in) Maybe that's it. Maybe that's why Skinner's running. He's afraid.

SCULLY: That he did it?

MULDER: That he doesn't know he didn't do it.



SCENE 9

(Skinner is in his apartment, sitting on his living room sofa and pouring himself a drink. There's a knock, and he opens the front door.)

SHARON SKINNER: Hi. You didn't answer your phone. It just kept ringing.

SKINNER: Yeah, I unplugged it. I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

SHARON SKINNER: So, are you going to invite me in, or should I start building an ark?

SKINNER: Come in.

(She enters, seeing a number of cardboard boxes in the living room.)

SHARON SKINNER: You still haven't gotten around to unpacking.

SKINNER: Yeah, well, you know ... work. (sighs and crosses his arms) So what are you doing here, Sharon?

SHARON SKINNER: I'm not sure. After I saw you today, I didn't know what else to do.

SKINNER: If you're trying to satisfy some morbid curiousity about what happened ...

SHARON SKINNER: That's not why I came. I just ... I just want to make sure you're OK.

SKINNER: I'm OK. Except right now, company's about the last thing that I need.

SHARON SKINNER: I'm not company. I'm your wife.

SKINNER: Ex-wife. Remember, you're the one who asked for the divorce.

SHARON SKINNER: Only because you didn't have the guts to ask for one yourself. So don't put it on me.

SKINNER: Fair enough. So what else do you want me to say?

SHARON SKINNER: Nothing. I don't want you to say anything. (she moves close to him) I just want you to let me in. (strokes his cheek) Just this one time.

SKINNER: Why?

SHARON SKINNER: Because I know you. I know that you're scared and that you could use some comfort. (Skinner doesn't react) I also know that you'll never let me give it to you. (puts on her coat) Take care of yourself, OK?

(She leaves. Skinner returns to his sofa and drink. He reaches into a nearby box and pulls out their wedding picture.)

(Some time later, Skinner is napping on his sofa, with the framed wedding photo on his chest. He awakens to a screeching noise and stands quickly, and the photo falls. In a mirror he sees the old woman, again in the bright red overcoat, screaming. He looks around the apartment and no longer sees her. There is a pounding at the door. When he answers, Waltos and another detective are at the door.)

SKINNER: What's this about?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Come on, grab your coat and come with us. We'd like to ask you a few questions.

SKINNER: Why? What the hell is going on here?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: It's your wife. She's been in an accident.

SKINNER: Is she all right?

DETECTIVE WALTOS: Someone ran her off the road. You're gonna have to come with us. We'll also need to see the keys to your car, sir.

(Skinner picks up his glasses and leaves. The wedding photo is now on his coffee table, the glass broken.)



SCENE 10
SECOND DISTRICT POLICE STATION, 7:44 AM

(Skinner is in an interview room as Mulder enters. Skinner stands.)

SKINNER: How is she?

MULDER: The C.T. scan showed a subdural hematoma. She's in surgery right now to relieve pressure on her brain. Scully's trying to get more information.

SKINNER: (grabbing his coat) I have to see her.

MULDER: You can't do that, sir.

SKINNER: Why not? They said I wasn't being charged.

MULDER: Not yet. But they're building a pretty convincing case.

SKINNER: Do you think I did this to Sharon?

MULDER: No, I don't, but I'm in the minority.

SKINNER: What about Agent Scully?

(Mulder turns and walks across the room.)

MULDER: Scully ... (clears his throat) Scully doesn't understand why you're not trying to defend yourself.

SKINNER: (angrily) Defend myself against what? Don't you think if I knew what was happening to me that I would try to ... (pauses and collects himself, then sighs) I don't know what to believe any more.

MULDER: What about the old woman in your dream. Who is she? It's gonna come out. (Skinner doesn't respond) Look, if you don't start trusting someone, you don't stand a chance.

SKINNER: (sighs again) A few months ago, I started seeing her again.

MULDER: Again?

SKINNER: I told you once what ... what happened to me in Vietnam. (sits down against the wall) I was caught in an ambush.

MULDER: Yeah, you were the sole survivor. You also described what sounded like a near-death experience.

SKINNER: There was nothing "near" about it, Agent Mulder. I was a dead man.

MULDER: That's when you first saw her?

SKINNER: I saw lots of things over there. I didn't give much credence to any of them.

MULDER: And why not?

SKINNER: I got through that experience like most eighteen-year-olds ... by numbing myself with whatever was around. I was no choirboy, I ... I inhaled.

MULDER: (nodding) So you just dismissed her as another hallucination?

SKINNER: I tried.

MULDER: But you couldn't?

SKINNER: She was there with me. Watching me as I was watching myself dying, my blood spilling from a hundred different places. Until she lifted me up and carried me back ... away from the light.

MULDER: Well, maybe she was trying to protect you. Maybe she's trying to protect you now.

SKINNER: Protect me from what?

MULDER: That's a question only you can answer.

SKINNER: I don't know. I don't have a clue.

(Through a two-way mirror, CSM is watching Skinner and Mulder.)



SCENE 11
D.C. POLICE IMPOUND GARAGE

(Scully and Mulder are walking through the garage.)

SCULLY: Number 5.

MULDER: This is Skinner's car?

SCULLY: According to Woltos' report, the hood was still warm when they got to Skinner's apartment, even with the rain. Look at the left front panel. The matched the paint in the dent to Sharon Skinner's car.

(The panel is dented.)

MULDER: Woltos' people finish going over the interior?

SCULLY: The only prints they found on the steering wheel were Skinner's.

MULDER: Can I borrow your flashlight?

SCULLY: Sure. Why?

(Mulder opens the passenger door and gets into the car.)

SCULLY: I don't know what you're expecting to find, Mulder, but uh, Skinner's hearing is in half an hour.

MULDER: I'll meet you there.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

(Mulder is using a small knife to cut the deployed air bag free from the steering column.)

MULDER: Collecting evidence.



SCENE 12
FBI SCI-CRIME LAB

(Mulder is with Agent Pendrell.)

AGENT PENDRELL: You know how an airbag works?

MULDER: Your car hits something, a bag fills with air and you don't die.

AGENT PENDRELL: Not air. Nitrogen. Now, the latent image - the one we're interested in - is found in the byproduct of that explosion, in the finely dispersed sodium metal that coats the interior of the airbag. See this powder, here? It's created by whoever was behind the wheel when the airbag deployed.

(A scanning light is passing under the fabric. There are some darker marks on the fabric in the rough outline of a face.)

MULDER: It doesn't look like a face.

AGENT PENDRELL: Not yet. First, I'm scanning the fabric. Then I'm running it through software which translates its varying densities into a dimensionalized likeness. After that, it's a matter of fine tuning.

(The computer monitor is filling in the shape of a face.)

MULDER: How long does that fine-tuning take?

AGENT PENDRELL: You need this in a hurry, it sounds like.

MULDER: I'm not the only one who needs it.



SCENE 13
OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT HEARING

(Skinner, Bonnecaze, the Senior Agent and another agent are sitting around the table, with Skinner at one end. Scully enters.)

AGENT BONNECAZE: We're still waiting for Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SENIOR AGENT: We're finished waiting. We're going to begin without him. Have a seat.

(Scully sits at the table.)

SENIOR AGENT: Let's go over the physical evidence again. You say you found nothing damning.

SCULLY: No, sir. None of the physical evidence we recovered directly connects the assistant director to her death.

SENIOR AGENT: You re-examined the victim's body. Did you find anything of note?

SCULLY: I took a sample of an extraneous substance that turned out to be unidentifiable.

SENIOR AGENT: How's that?

SCULLY: A naturally occurring enzyme around her mouth and nose.

SENIOR AGENT: And do you have any idea why it was there?

SCULLY: No.

SENIOR AGENT: If you are withholding something from this committee ...

SCULLY: Sir, I feel reluctant to say or to speak for Agent Mulder.

SENIOR AGENT: To say what?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder had a theory that the substance could have come from a visitation.

SENIOR AGENT: But you have another explanation?

SCULLY: No. I'm sorry, I don't.

SENIOR AGENT: Do you believe in paranormal phenomena, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Whatever extreme cases I have encountered I have always viewed through the lens of science. I believe that is why I was assigned to the X-Files and to Agent Mulder.

SENIOR AGENT: And has A.D. Skinner always been as discriminating as you?

SCULLY: Excuse me, sir, I don't understand the question.

SENIOR AGENT: Would you say that, like yourself, your direct superior has been affected by, or enchanted by, Agent Mulder's notions ...

SCULLY: No, sir. Not at all.

SENIOR AGENT: And yet, he continues to sign off on whatever extreme cases you and Agent Mulder elect to investigate.

SCULLY: I believe the Assistant Director has protected us out of a respect for the work.

SENIOR AGENT: Just as you might protect him? By trumping up unidentifiable evidence?

SCULLY: No. That is not true.

AGENT BONNECAZE: Thank you, Agent Scully, that will be all.

SCULLY: Sir, if I may ...

AGENT BONNECAZE: That will be all.

SCULLY: I'm not finished.

AGENT BONNECAZE: Yes, you are, Agent Scully.

(Scully looks at Skinner, then leaves.)



SCENE 14

(Scully is in the hall at FBI headquarters, dialing her cell phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hello.

SCULLY: (to phone) Mulder?

(Mulder is coming down the hall toward her. He puts down his phone and calls to her directly.)

MULDER: Hello.

SCULLY: You missed it. Not that anything you said would have made a difference.

MULDER: What happened, where's Skinner?

SCULLY: Out of a job.

MULDER: They dismissed him?

SCULLY: He would have had a better chance against a firing squad.

MULDER: And they used us to do it, didn't they? They used the X-Files.

SCULLY: How'd you know?

MULDER: Because I think Skinner's been out-maneuvered, Scully. They found a weakness and they're exploiting it.

SCULLY: But why?

MULDER: To put us in check. You remove Skinner and you weaken us.

(He hands her a piece of paper.)

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

(The paper shows a pixelated image of a man's face.)

MULDER: This is the man that stole Skinner's car last night and tried to kill his wife.

SCULLY: I don't understand. Why would they orchestrate such an elaborate scheme just to set him up? Why not just kill him?

MULDER: Well, they already tried that once, and a second attempt would be too obvious, even for these thugs. Anyway, I think Skinner's probably worth more to them alive in disgrace than dead and buried.

SCULLY: Who is this guy?

(They start down the hall.)

MULDER: I don't know. Danny couldn't find anything on him. He's still running it.

SCULLY: So how are we supposed to find him?

MULDER: Well, this guy's a pawn. Pawns always make the first move.

SCULLY: So he must have hired the prostitute.



SCENE 15

(Scully and Mulder arrive at Lorraine Kelleher's apartment building. There are police vehicles and an ambulance there.)

MULDER: (to a policeman) What happened here?

POLICEMAN: Jumper. It happens whenever it rains two days straight.

(They come closer and see Lorraine Kelleher's body lying on a glass ledge above ground level.)

MULDER: He got to her first.

(Scully sees Judy Fairly, who answered the door earlier when they visited Lorraine Kelleher, standing nearby.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(Judy, Scully and Mulder are talking in a coffee shop.)

JUDY FAIRLY: Usually, there'd be something set up in the room. To get pictures, tape, whatever.

SCULLY: Judy, we need you to identify somebody.

(Shows her the paper with the image from the air bag.)

MULDER: Is this the man who hired Carina?

JUDY FAIRLY: (nods) He said that nobody would get hurt.

MULDER: He lied. Skinner's not the only person he set up.

JUDY FAIRLY: Are you saying he killed Carina?

SCULLY: And Lorraine. He's cleaning house.

MULDER: I need you to arrange a meeting.

JUDY FAIRLY: Wha? I can't. I mean, Lorraine's the only one who ever really talked to him.

MULDER: Unfortunately, Lorraine can't get to the phone right now.

JUDY FAIRLY: Please don't make me do this.

MULDER: Look what he did to your friends. We're your only chance of coming out of this OK.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder's right. I'll stay with you if you want, until we take him into custody.

MULDER: I want you to call him. Tell him you're scared because we questioned you. Tell him you want money to get out of town. (hands her his cell phone) You'll meet him at the Ambassodor Hotel bar. OK?

(She takes the phone and dials.)

JUDY FAIRLY: (to phone, in a shaky voice) Hello. Hi. This is Judy Fairly. You might not remember me, but I work for Lorraine.

(A man answers it in a car. The man appears to be the man from the air bag image.)

MAN: One moment, please.

(He hands the phone to a second man in the passenger seat of the car.)

GRAY-HAIRED MAN: Yes?

JUDY FAIRLY: Some FBI agents came to see me about what happened to Lorraine.

GRAY-HAIRED MAN: What did you tell them?

JUDY FAIRLY: Nothing. I didn't say anything. But they scared the hell out of me. Look. I need some money.

GRAY-HAIRED MAN: That can be arranged.

JUDY FAIRLY: Can you meet me?

GRAY-HAIRED MAN: Where would you like to meet?

JUDY FAIRLY: The Ambassador Hotel at ... (looks at Mulder, who holds up one finger and mouths the words "one hour") in an hour.

GRAY-HAIRED MAN: I'm close. I'll see you in an hour.

(The gray-haired man hangs up and looks out the window, into the coffee shop. They have been parked just outside it, watching them.)



SCENE 16

(Skinner enters Sharon's hospital room. She is unconscious. Skinner removes his glasses.)

SKINNER: I had to tell you, Sharon, before anything else happens. I'm not signing those papers ... for a lot of reasons, most of them I'm just realizing myself for the first time. (pauses) Some of the things I've seen - the violence and the lies that I've witnessed men inflict on one another - I could never tell you that. Not that I ever stopped believing in the work, but there were contradictions that I, that I couldn't reconcile, which meant shutting down part of myself just to do my job. (pauses) I never told you what I should have told you ... that what really got me through each day was knowing that I'd be sleeping next to you that night. Knowing that I had a reason to wake up in the morning. (pauses, then bends down close to her) I'm not sure if you can even hear me now, or if it even makes a difference to you any more, but I at least wanted you to know that.

(He kisses her on the forehead. Her eyelids move and she gasps. Her pulse rate increases, setting off a monitor in the room.)

SKINNER: Sharon?

(He runs out of the room and starts down the hall.)

SKINNER: Somebody ...

(He stops as he looks through the window into the room and sees the old woman lying in the bed in place of Sharon. She looks at him. He comes back through the door and into the room. A hand reaches out from the bed and he takes it. It is Sharon again, now conscious.)

SHARON SKINNER: Listen to me ...



SCENE 17

(Mulder, Waltos and another detective are in the hotel lounge, looking impatient.)

(The man from the air bag image is loitering around an elevator upstairs. A housekeeper passes and enters a suite. The man slips behind her and enters behind her.)

(Inside the room, the phone rings. Scully answers it, with Judy at her side.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Did you get him?

(Mulder is calling from the lounge.)

MULDER: No, he hasn't shown up yet.

SCULLY: He should have been here fifteen minutes ago.

JUDY FAIRLY: What's going on?

SCULLY: (to Judy) Nothing.

JUDY FAIRLY: Great.

(Judy walks into the next room.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder on the phone) Maybe it's the rain.

MULDER: This guy isn't about to let a little rain stop him.

(Scully sees that Judy is no longer there and hears an odd noise.)

SCULLY: Mulder, hang on a second. (calls into next room) Judy?

MULDER: Scully, what's going on?

(Judy doesn't respond.)

SCULLY: Mulder, get up here right now.

MULDER: He's upstairs.

(Mulder and the two detectives run out of the lounge.)

(With her gun drawn, Scully moves into the next room.)

SCULLY: Judy?

(She slowly moves through the suite, hearing the water running in the bathroom. She kicks open the door to find Judy at the sink.)

JUDY FAIRLY: What the hell are you doing?

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I called but you didn't answer.

(Judy's eyes shift to the right in fear.)

SCULLY: What's the matter?

(The man slams open the door, knocking Scully hard into the wall.)

SCULLY: Uhhh ...

(Scully sinks to the floor, stunned. The man points his gun at Judy.)

(Mulder and the detectives charge off the elevator, hearing gunshots from the suite.)

(In the bathroom, Scully is coming around. Over her stands a man with a smoking gun. It is Skinner. Mulder and the detectives charge in to find the man dead on the floor and Judy crying in the corner. Mulder crouches next to Scully.)

MULDER: You OK?

SCULLY: Mmm-hmmm ...

(Skinner glances at Waltos and leaves.)



SCENE 18

(Skinner is in his office, tearing off the seal on his desk. Scully knocks and enters, carrying a report. Mulder is behind her.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: Come in.

SCULLY: This is our report. You'll see, though, that several questions remain unanswered.

SKINNER: The identity of the man I shot?

SCULLY: We ran his face and fingerprints through every available database. There's still no matches. And we're doing a dental record search, but that'll probably be a dead end, too. And regarding the other man ... the telephone number that we had for him has been disconnected, and there's no record of an account.

SKINNER: Don't waste your time, Agent Scully. You won't find him. Just get whatever forensic evidence you need off the body you have and bury it.

(Mulder has been staring out the window while Scully gave her report. She starts to walk out but Mulder lingers.)

SKINNER: Is there a problem, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah, there's something else you'll find missing in there. (Scully stops at the door) An explanation for how you knew to be at the hotel last night. I was hoping you could fill in that line item yourself.

SKINNER: I'm afraid I can't do that, at least not at this point in time.

MULDER: Why not?

SKINNER: Because whatever I believe may have happened ... it has no place on an official report.

(Mulder steps toward him, pointing at his own chest.)

MULDER: Then why don't you tell me? Off the record.

(Skinner looks at Mulder, then at Scully, then back at Mulder. He then turns to the papers on his desk.)

SKINNER: If you'll excuse me, I've got some catching up to do. The O.P.C. did a number on my office. (he turns back to them) But I want to thank you for the quick turnaround on this.

(Mulder stares at him and nods. Scully leaves. Skinner starts to sort the papers on his desk, as Mulder very slowly turns and leaves, closing the door behind him. Skinner notices something in his desk drawer, and reaches into it and pulls out a small envelope. He opens it and removes his wedding ring. He reads the inscription, which says "Love forever Sharon." He puts the ring on his finger and resumes sorting the papers.)

SCENE 1
STRIKER'S COVE
HEUVELMANS LAKE
BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, GA

FARRADAY: (Picks up a frog) When I began our field research here, these frogs were thriving. Since then, the adult population's dropped to fewer than 200. If you don't take protective measures, in a few years, the perenhis cenesaphelo will be extinct here.

BAILEY: Frog populations are declining all over the globe, Dr Farraday. No one knows why. You can't possibly place them all on the endangered species list.

FARRADAY: You'd find a way for the cute, furry little mammals we were talking about.

BAILEY: Regardless, your study remains inconclusive. Speculative at best. You've provided no concrete evidence that frog depopulation is the exclusive result of human impeachment.

FARRADAY: A frog holocaust is currently being executed Dr Bailey and man is the executioner.

BAILEY: You're the biologist Dr Farraday. You've never heard of survival of the fittest? (He walks off, annoyed with Farraday).

FARRADAY: Don't forget that rule also applies to mankind. You can't turn your back on nature, or nature will turn her back on you!

BAILEY: (He walks back to his car, moves to open the door, but finds that his pager holder is empty.) Damn it, where could it be.... (He wanders off into the woods, looking amongst the bushes for his pager. A noise from the water is heard, and then there is silence. He bends down to retrieve the pager, and wipes it off. He is attacked from behind, by an unseen creature).

SCENE 2
COUNTY RD 33
RIGDON, GA.

(The car drives past a sign, 'What's Older Than the Hills?' Queequeg, Scully's pet Pomeranian is restless in the backseat).

SCULLY: Nature's calling. I think we should pull over soon.

MULDER: Did you really have to bring that thing?

SCULLY: You wake me up on a Saturday morning, tell me to be ready in five minutes, my mother is out of town, all of the dog sitters are booked, and you know how I feel about kennels. So unless you want to lose your security deposit on the car, I suggest you pull over.

MULDER: I think I'm lost anyway. I've got to stop and ask for directions.

SCULLY: I know I'm lost as to why you're so interested in this missing persons case.

MULDER: Dr Bailey works for the US Forestry Service. That makes his disappearance a federal case.

SCULLY: It's not jurisdiction that I'm questioning, Mulder.

MULDER: Dr Bailey's not the first person to go missing from Heuvelman's Lake recently. Two weeks ago, a Boy Scout Troop was out here, fox hunting, their troop leader wandered off to relieve himself, and hasn't been seen or heard from since.

SCULLY: So you think that there's a serial killer at large?

MULDER: The operative word being large.

SCULLY: (Sees a sign, 'What's Bigger Than the Sky?') What are you leaving out?

MULDER: What makes you think I'm leaving anything out?

SCULLY: Most missing persons cases are not that uncommon, Mulder. Why this one warrants us flying halfway across the country and driving for two hours is a total mystery. (Sees another sign). Oh, tell me you're not serious? (Car drives past a sign, 'Big Blue. The Southern Serpent. Spot Him at Heuvelmans Lake.')



SCENE 3
ECOLOGY SCIENCES LAB
HEUVELMANS LAKE

SCULLY: According to the Sheriff's report, you were the last person to see Dr Bailey alive.

FARRADAY: That's what they tell me.

SCULLY: I understand you argued over an endangered species petition.

FARRADAY: Bailey was the worst kind of hypocrite. Closest he ever came to commuting with nature was subscribing to National Geographic.

SCULLY: You sound bitter, Dr Farraday.

FARRADAY: Of course I'm bitter. The man wrote off three years of carefully collected data in a two hour inspection, which doesn't mean I plotted his demise. Well, that is what you are suggesting, isn't it?

SCULLY: Well, aside from having a motive, you don't seem too upset by any of this.

FARRADAY: You expect me to cry for one man when an entire species is perched on the brink of extinction?

MULDER: Dr Farraday, you know the wildlife living around this lake just as well as anybody, don't you?

FARRADAY: I'd say that's accurate.

MULDER: Are you aware of any indigenous species that's capable of attacking a human being?

FARRADAY: Yes. Another human being.

MULDER: Aside from that, is there a creature that comes to mind...

FARRADAY: Has anyone ever told you two you have a great problem coming to the point?

MULDER: Okay then. In your work have you come across any evidence that lends support to the existance of this creature they call Big Blue?

FARRADAY: See, this is what always happens. This is how it starts.

MULDER: What?

FARRADAY: The deflection, sleight of hand. See, whenever an issue requires any real thought, any serious mental effort, people turn to UFO's, and sea serpents and sasquatch. Afternoon talk shows and tabloid TV. They've reduced our attention span to the length of a sound byte. So that soon our ability to think will be as extinct as a ranas sanasephela frog.

MULDER: I'll take that rambling diatribe to mean that you don't believe in the existance of such a creature.

FARRADAY: I'm not even going to grace that statement with a reply.

MULDER: A prehistoric animal living in a lake is not without presidence. Last August they pulled a Bull shark from Lake Onaga in Massasteuchusts.

FARRADAY: An anomaly. Which proves nothing. It only serves as fodder for psuedo-scientists with nothing better to do than chase fairy tales. Excuse me.



SCENE 4
(Mulder and Scully walk across a muddy lot in the rain, and tie Queequeg up outside a souvenier shop. A giant inflatable Big Blue character is tied to the roof, above a sign 'Bait and Tackle').

MULDER: It's been reported for centuries in dozens of countries. From the monsters in Loch Ness, Nessie, to the Ogopogo in Lake Okonagan.

SCULLY: And Lake Champagne, Lalavack Iceland...

MULDER: Sounds like you know a little something about the subject.

SCULLY: I did as a kid. But, then I grew up, and became a scientist.

MULDER: Well some very grown up crypto-zoologist believed it could be an evolutionary throwback, quite possibly prehistoric.

SCULLY: An aquatic dinosaur.

MULDER: A pleosaur, acutualluy. Though admittedly, there's not a lot of hard evidence to back that up.

SCULLY: You know why? Because those creatures don't exist, Mulder. They're folk tales born out of some collective fear of the unknown.

MULDER: Well how many folk tales do you know that could eat a boy scout leader and a biologist?

(Mulder and Scully go into the shop. Mulder looks at a framed object, with a note: Scale From Big Blue Found February 10 1965)

MULDER: Check this out, Scully.

SCULLY: It looks like an insect casing or Scarab or something from a beetle.

TED: Can I help you people?

MULDER: We're looking for the Lake View Cabins. Flipper Road?

TED: You passed the turnoff a few miles back. It's uh, pretty tough to find. Uh, a map might help. (Ted pulls out a map. Mulder reaches out for it, but Ted holds it away.) Uh, they're two-fifty each, plus Uncle Sam.

MULDER: Fine. (He grabs it.)

TED: If you don't mind my saying, you folks don't look like you're here for the trout.

SCULLY: No, we're with the FBI. We're investingating a pair of missing persons reports.

TED: Oh, yeah. It's big news around here. Everyone's been talking about it.

MULDER: What are they saying?

TED: The same thing they've been saying for years. Now I'm not one for spreading rumours, but the truth is, I've heard the story since I was a kid.

MULDER: About Big Blue? What kind of stories?

TED: Well, I was ten years old. Fishing with my daddy, when I heard a... big commotion. Clear across the lake. A wailing sound, the likes of which I had never heard before, never heard since. My daddy told me later that a cow had escaped from the Rockdale ranch and was drinking by the lake. When, old Big Blue came right up and snatched her from the bank.

SCULLY: That's quite a story.

TED: That's just one.

SCULLY: Those stories must sell a lot of T-shirts.

TED: Well, a man's gotta survive.

MULDER: What about you? Do you believe those stories?

TED: Well, a man's got to look at the evidence, decide for himself. (Ansel Bray enters the shop.) But if you want to ask a real expert, should probably talk to Ansel here. He's out there practically every day. (Leans in and whispers to Mulder and Scully). It was his daddy's cow that got eaten.

ANSEL: Can you get these developed by tomorrow, Ted? And another five rolls while I'm in town? (He puts a pile of camera films on the table.)

TED: These folks are with the FBI, they've been looking into that unsolved mystery about how those two people disappeared.

ANSEL: Unsolved mystery? Since when is there a mystery?

MULDER: So you think Big Blue's responsible for what's been happening?

ANSEL: Don't you?

MULDER: Have you ever actually seen it?

ANSEL: Not directly, no. But I aim to. Someday, I'll be in the right place at the right time, and I will snap a shot of that monster.

ANSEL: (Is out fishing, when he catces something large. He struggles to reel it in, but is shocked by what he catches, a body.)

TED: (Indicates to Mulder and Scully on the map.) Now if you hit Striker's cove, you've gone too far.

ANSEL: Call the Sheriff. We've got a floater. (All of them walk out to the pier. The bottom half of a body is drifting in the water. Mulder pulls a wallet out of the back pocket, then Scully uses a pen to turn him over.)

MULDER: It's Scout Woolsley. The boy scout troop leader.

SCULLY: Well, his fly's undone.

MULDER: Are you insinuating something?

SCULLY: No, most drowning victims are found with high levels of alchohol in their blood and their fly's unzipped. While urinating over the sides of boats, docks or whatever, they lose their balance, fall in and drown.

MULDER: Still doesn't explain why half of him is still missing. Looks to me like something took a big bite.

SCULLY: Maybe not so big.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Well, fish eat decomposing matter, any body that 's been suspended in this environment for a period of time is going to become a food source. We eat fish, and fish eat us.

MULDER: But are fish also known for eating half and saving half for later?



SCENE 5
(That night, Ted is making prints in the mud with boots that have a monster-like shape. His foot is caught in some reeds. While he tries to pull it free, something comes up behind him, and attacks him.) Someone help me! No, no! Someone help me!

(At the crime scene, the next day.)

ANSEL: Like I said, I recognize his hat.

MULDER: (Picks it up. It says: 'Show Us Your Bobbers') How could you not?

ANSEL: So Ted's Ford is parked about a half a mile back. Here's his hat, and here's these tracks. Know what I'm saying? I mean, look at the size of these tracks.

SCULLY: Mulder? This is Sheriff Lance Heads.

MULDER: Careful, watch out where you're walking. Watch out...watch out for those tracks.

SCULLY: (Her dog tugs at the leash.) Queequeg.

SHERIFF: Ansel, why don't you go check the woods?

ANSEL: Today's the day. I'm going to get him.

MULDER: Any sign of Ted Bertram?

SHERIFF: No. And I'm not jumping to any conclusions either. Speaking of which, what's this I hear about you wanting to close the lake?

MULDER: Just until we figure out what's going on here.

SHERIFF: I think I can tell you what's going on. Same thing that goes on every year. Fishermen get drunk, they drown, men get run over by power boats. Hell, on a lake this size, you're going to have eight, nine deaths in a season. That's just statistical fact.

MULDER: But you've got two or three in as many weeks, I'd say you're a little outside your bell curve, Sheriff.

SHERIFF: Agent Mulder? Mulder, this lake has 48 miles of shoreline. I got four deputies full time. To close down a lake this size, hell, you'd have to call out the National Guard something like that...

SCULLY: We'd need irrefutable proof.

MULDER: What about these tracks?

SCULLY: Mulder, a creature as large as the one you're looking for would have left considerably deeper impressions. (The dog yanks so hard on the leash, Scully is pulled with it, and Queeqeg runs through the woods, right to Ted's boot.) Queeqeg! Queequeg come back here! Queequeg! Mulder? Sherrif, come take a look at this.

SHERIFF: What you got?

SCULLY: There's your lake monster Mulder.

MULDER: That's what it looks like.

SCULLY: It's all a hoax?

SHERIFF: I'll be dammed.

MULDER: Yeah, but what happened to the hoaxer? (He swipes a finger around the boot, then holds it up to reveal blood.)



SCENE 6

DUDE: (Out on the pier.) Saw this, you know on the Discovery Channel? They got like this, you know, cult built up around these toads. The skin's got these, hallucionogenic properties. Lets you see all these visions. It's really spiritual.

CHICK: Yeah? I don't know.

DUDE: It's 'sposed to take the doors of perception, and swing them so wide open, you know, plus you get to see all these cool streaks and trails and crap. (Dude licks the toad, and shudders.)

CHICK: Well? Are you sure that's even a toad?

DUDE: (The diver comes out of the water.) Dude, what's wrong with you? You made me drop my toad.

DIVER: It's okay, man. I'll get you another one.

DUDE: (Chick looks at the map.) How long till we get down to Lauderdale? (The diver is suddenly attacked, then he surfaces, his head bobbing on the water without the body.) Oh, no.. Dude?



SCENE 7

MULDER: Well, if this is a hoax, it's quite elaborate. (He looks at the head, encased in a plastic bag.)

SHERIFF: I got zip out of Freebird and Moon Unit over there, there's no telling what they're been smoking. What's it looking like?

SCULLY: Well, it's hard to tell without an autopsy, but it looks like propellor damage from a motor boat.

SHERIFF: Well, this is a designated boating area!

MULDER: Twenty feet from shore, and twice in one day?

SCULLY: Mulder, look at it out there. It's like rush hour.

MULDER: What about Ted Bertram?

SCULLY: For all we know, he stepped in something and bled into those funny shoes of his. He's probably so embarrased right now, he doesn't want to show his face.

MULDER: Oh, is that the psychological approach to crime solving? He's too embarrased?

SCULLY: Regardless of what I believe, there's no hard evidence to what you believe.

ANSEL: (Ansel is singing "True Colors" as he sets up his camera. He focuses it on a rubber ring, with meat tied to it. As he sets up another camera, the ring starts to move, and something appears to be moving through the water towards the shore. Ansel picks up a camera, starts shooting frantically, but forgets to remove the lens cap.) Crap! (He is attacked by the unseen monster.)

MULDER: This roll's been exposed, can you get that developed? (Hands a camera to a deputy.) That's three in one day, Sheriff. All this driving from crime scene to crime scene's giving me highway hypnosis. Close down the lake.

SHERIFF: I tell you, it ain't that simple. I just ain't got the manpower. Further more, I'm not at all convinced we're dealing with an acquatic menace.

SCULLY: He's right, Mulder. Those two sets of remains we found so far are inconclusive. We really need to find this body.

SHERIFF: My thoughts exactly, ma'am. If you just give us a couple more minutes... whoa! (The Sheriff is pulled into the water, then quickly swims back to shore.)

SCULLY: Are you okay, Sheriff?

SHERIFF: Something brushed up against me out there. Close the lake! Close it down! I want you call the state police, and the Wildlife, Fish and Game! You tell them we got an emergency situation! (In the motel room that night, Mulder is looking through piles of photographs.)

SCULLY: I agree with you, I just wish that he gave us something more.

MULDER: Look at this, could this be a tooth?

SCULLY: Yeah, it could be a lot of things, Mulder. Fifteen years of fruitless hinting and the only thing the guy comes up with is a blurry picture of the monster's tooth?

MULDER: There's thousands of pictures here, Scully. There's got to be some evidence here somewhere. Take a look at these.

SCULLY: Mulder, they're just a bunch of poorly composed tory shots.

MULDER: That could be something.

SCULLY: A tooth? I'm taking Queequeg for a walk.

MULDER: Want me to come with you?

SCULLY: I'm fine. (Revealing her gun.) Goodnight, Mulder.

MULDER: Goodnight, I'll see you in the morning.

SCULLY: (Tugs at the leash while Queequeg is barking frantically.) Come on, Queequeg. Queequeg, we're not going to go into the woods. Come on, do your business. I thought you had to go. Queequeg! What is it? Queequeg! Where are you going? (The dog breaks free and runs into the woods, Scully follows the leash with a torch.) Queequeg! Come back here! Queequeg! Queequeg? Queequeg! Quee... (The leash returns, and to Scully's horror, Queequeg is gone.)



SCENE 8

(Back at the motel, Scully looks distressed.)

MULDER: I'm sorry about Queequeg. You know, I think I've learned something from these photos.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: (Goes over to her, and points out sighting locations on a map.) They're not pictures of the lake monster, they're pictures of the lake. Locations where the fish has been sighted over the past several years. Look, five years ago, all the sightings occured in the centre of the lake. But progressively the sightings have moved closer and closer to shore, until this year, they're practically on the shore.

SCULLY: Could you repeat the last part again? I kind of faded out.

MULDER: Which part?

SCULLY: After you said I'm sorry?

MULDER: Can you drive a boat?



SCENE 9

SCULLY: (On the boat.) It's too bad we're not out here fishing. (Looking at a fish radar, showing many fish near the boat.)

MULDER: We are fishing.

SCULLY: You really expect to find this thing, don't you Mulder?

MULDER: You want to head right...here. (Points at the map.)

SCULLY: I'll take that as a yes.

MULDER: I know the difference between expectation and hope. Seek and ye shall find, Scully.

SCULLY: You know, on the old mariner's maps, the cartographers would designate uncharted territories by writing 'Here Be Monsters'.

MULDER: I got a map of New York City just like that.

SCULLY: What was that? (A huge blob appears on the radar screen.)

MULDER: It ain't low gas.

SCULLY: What is that? What is that, Mulder?

MULDER: Here be monsters, Scully.

SCULLY: It looks like it's coming straight at us.

MULDER: Yep, that's what it looks like. (A huge crash is heard, then water pours in through a hole in the boat's stern.)

SCULLY: (Talking on the radio.) Mayday! Mayday! Can anybody hear me? This is the Patricia Rae. CA78327. Mayday! Mayday!

(They pull on life jackets, then swim out from the boat. As the boat sinks, they stand on a nearby rock, watching.)

SCULLY: There goes our five hundred dollar deposit.

MULDER: I say we swim to shore.

SCULLY: Swim?

MULDER: Yeah, the shore can't be too far from here.

SCULLY: In which direction? (Swings here lantern around)

MULDER: When you're living in the city you forget that night is actually so...dark.

SCULLY: Living in the city you forget a lot of things. You know what I was just thinking about, being mugged or hit by a car, It's not until you get back to nature that you realize that everything is out to get you. So my father always told me to respect nature, because it has no respect for you. (A ripple moves through the water.)

MULDER: That was him Scully, that was Big Blue.

SCULLY: So what if it was. Mulder, what are we doing here?

MULDER: What do you mean, what are we doing here?

SCULLY: What are you hoping to accomplish?

MULDER: Scully, some of the things that we investigate are so intangible but this creature it exists within the specific earthly confines of this lake, and I want to find it.

SCULLY: What for?

MULDER: You're a scientist, why do you ask that question? I mean, it would be a marvelous discovery, it could revolutionize our evolutionary biological thinking.

SCULLY: Is that really the reason why? You know when you showed me those pictures the photographer took, you want to know what I really saw in them?

MULDER: A tooth?

SCULLY: No, you. That man is your future. Listening only to himself, hoping to catch a glimpse of the truth, for who knows what reason.

MULDER: I heard him joke that he was hoping to live off the copyrights fees of a genuine Big Blue photo.

SCULLY: Well, as dumb as it sounds, at least it's a legitimate reason.

MULDER: You don't think my reasons are legitimate?

SCULLY: Mulder, sometimes I just can't figure them out.(A noise is heard, they jump up, their guns aimed, but it is only a duck. Scully lets out a sob.)

MULDER: I'm still tempted to fire. Hey Scully, you think you could ever cannibalize someone? I mean if you really had to.

SCULLY: Well as much as the very idea is abhorrent to me, I suppose under certain conditions a living entity is practically conditioned to perform whatever extreme measures are necessary to ensure its survival. I suppose I'm no different.

MULDER: You've lost some weight recently haven't you?

SCULLY: Well, actually I have, thanks for...(she glares at him.)

MULDER: Though it is amazing what some animals will do to guarantee the continuation of a species isn't it? A creature of this size must have adapted its behavior over the years to minimize its chances of being seen by its only predator, us. Its coming closer to shore must have been an act of desperation on its part.

SCULLY: Poor Queequeg.

MULDER: Why did you name your dog Queequeg?

SCULLY: It was the name of the harpoonist in Moby Dick. My father used to read to me from Moby Dick when I was a little girl, I called him Ahab and he called me Starbuck. So I named my dog Queequeg. It's funny, I just realized something.

MULDER: It's a bizarre name for a dog, huh?

SCULLY: No, how much you're like Ahab. You're so consumed by your personal vengeance against life, whether it be its inherent cruelties or mysteries, everything takes on a warped significance to fit your megalomaniacal cosmology.

MULDER: Scully, are you coming on to me?

SCULLY: It's the truth or a white whale. What difference does it make? I mean, both obsessions are impossible to capture, and trying to do so will only leave you dead along with everyone else you bring with you. You know Mulder, you are Ahab.

MULDER: You know, its interesting you should say that, because I've always wanted a peg leg. It's a boyhood thing I never grew out of. I'm not being flippant, I've given this a lot of thought. I mean. if you have a peg leg or hooks for hands then maybe its enough to simply keep on living. You know, braving facing life with your disability. But without these things you're actually meant to make something of your life, achieve something earn a raise, wear a necktie. So if anything I'm actually the antithesis of Ahab, because if I did have a peg leg I'd quite possibly be more happy and more content not to be chasing after these creatures of the unknown.

SCULLY: And that's not flippant?

MULDER: No, flippant is my favourite line from Moby Dick. 'Hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling', huh?

SCULLY: What was that? (A ripple in the water is heard)

MULDER: I don't know, but it ain't no duck. (The lamp goes out.)

FARRADAY: I thought I heard voices. what are you two doing out here?

SCULLY: Dr Farraday?

FARRADAY: Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

SCULLY: No, no. we had a little trouble with our boat.

MULDER: Actually it sank.

FARRADAY: How'd that happen?

SCULLY: It was my fault. We would have been out here all night if you hadn't answered our distress call.

FARRADAY: Oh, I didn't. I was walking by, I heard you talking.

SCULLY: Walking by?

FARRADAY: Yeah, the shore is just a stone's throw from here. Come on, I'll take you back. It's just out of fuel. The sherrif will be around in a couple of minutes. I'd do it myself, but I've got work to do.

SCULLY: What exactly is it that you're doing out here Dr Farraday? It's well after midnight.

FARRADAY: Night is the ranas panasephalas's most active period, and this is its primary breeding ground. Or at least it used to be. Thousands of eggs used to cling to these reeds, beautiful jelly clusters. Now one must turn over many a leaf in order to find potential offspring.

MULDER: What's in the sack?

FARRADAY: Adult frogs, I've been breeding them in captivity, and releasing them into the wild.

SCULLY: This is Striker's Cove?

MULDER: The frogs.

FARRADAY: I beg your pardon?

MULDER: The unexplained depletion of frogs originates from this cove. It's the food chain.

FARRADAY: What about it?

MULDER: Food chain. If you alter one life form in an ecosystem, the rest is necessarily affected, either by an increase or decrease. So if an aquatic dinosaur's diet consisted primarily of frogs, then if those frogs suddenly became scarce, it would have to search for an alternative food source.

SCULLY: A human?

FARRADAY: Agent Mulder, you are taking my legitimate research and basic biological principle, and stretching them both way out of proportion, in an effort to give some kind of validity to an entirely ludicrous theory. There is no prehistoric lake monster.

MULDER: This creature lives here in this cove. That explains the disappearance of these frogs, for which you have no explanation, ludicrous or not. As well as the recent human attacks.

FARRADAY: That's crazy. If something was living in these waters, you don't think I would have seen it? I've been conducting research here for three years.

MULDER: I'm talking about a prehistoric creature that's gone unnoticed for virtually thousands of years. If it knows how do anything, it knows how to hide. They say that the Loch Ness monster doesn't even live in the water, that it lives in the surrounding cliffs. Maybe Big Blue has an inland habitat, somewhere in the rocks, or in this dense forest here.

FARRADAY: I have no time for these absurdities. If you'll exuse me, I have some amphibians to release.

SCULLY: Well captain, what now?

SHERIFF: Agent Scully! Agent Mulder! Tehre's been another death, and this time it does appear to be some kind of animal. Bit a fisherman's arm clear off.

MULDER: Where'd this happen?

SHERIFF: On the other side of the lake, a couple of hours ago. My department has the cooperation of the state police, plus the full use of all the Wildlife, Fish and Game's department vessels, and I've got a full scale search already under way.

MULDER: No, we need those men here, searching this cove and these woods.

SHERIFF: But I got thirty boats on the water already, now if we're going to capture this thing...

MULDER: Sweep this cove. It's here in Striker's cove.

SHERIFF: The boats are searching the area of the latest attack, and I'm not going to move them. Now if you're going to waste your time, conducting a search of these woods, you go right ahead. I got me a lake monster to catch.

SCULLY: Sheriff, Agent Mulder and I would appreciate it if you could spare two or three of your men to assist us here.

SHERIFF: Alright, I'll send them on down. (He wanders off through the woods.)

MULDER: (Turns to Scully.) Thanks.

SCULLY: What was that?



SCENE 10

MULDER: Dr Farraday. (They run through the woods, and spot Farraday lying on the ground.) What happened?

FARRADAY: Something grabbed my leg.

MULDER: Did you see it?

FARRADAY: It came from behind me. Before I knew it it had me. Moved me back and forth. Then it just let go.

SCULLY: I think you nipped an artery. We've got to get him to a hospital, he's losing blood. Give me your belt.

MULDER: Where'd it go?

FARRADAY: I didn't see it, I didn't see it. It went through those reeds there.

SCULLY: Mulder, help is coming. Mulder!

SHERIFF: (Tapping on the ambulance doors) All right, go ahead.

MULDER: How's Dr Farraday?

SCULLY: He'll be fine. How are you?

MULDER: I'm fine.

SCULLY: Well, you slued the big white whale, Ahab.

MULDER: Yeah, but I still don't have that peg leg.

SCULLY: How can you be disappointed? That alligator would have gone through half the local population if you hadn't killed it.

MULDER: I know. I guess I just wanted Big Blue to be real. I guess I see hope in such a possibility.

SCULLY: Well, there's still hope. That's why these missing stories have endured. People want to believe. (As they turn away, they miss a creature moving through the water - Big Blue)

SCENE 1
BRADDOCK HEIGHTS, MARYLAND; APRIL 27; 10:16 PM

(A nice clear night. In the forest, Joseph Patnik toils with his shovel, digging a hole. Light shines dimly through the trees. He grunts with every dig, then looks at the body in front of him.)

JOSEPH PATNIK: All right, you bastard.

(He starts to drag the man towards the hole. The man has a massive gash on his head.)

Evil... rotten... son of a...

(The man slides into the shallow grave Patnik has made. Patnik picks up the shovel and starts to cover him with dirt.)

There you go! Your killing days are over!

(Back at his house, Patnik struggles to wash the blood off his hands and arms. He hears a noise and looks behind him to see the same dead man walking towards him. Patnik gasps.)

No... no!

(The man smirks.)

No!

(Patnik picks up the shovel and smashes the man in the head with it. The man is shoved into Patnik's trunk as a dog barks. Hearing a car pull up, Patnik turns to see a police car pull up and stop. Two officers get out, their faces not shown.)

OFFICER #1: Put your hands in the air. Keep them where I can see them.

(Patnik does so. The officers approach him.)

We got a call. You want to tell us what you're doing out here?

(The first officer steps into sight. He is the same dead man. Patnik looks at the second officer, who is the same man as well, smirking.)

Sir?

(Patnik angrily rushes the first officer, tackling him. They grunt and the second officer runs towards them. Patnik stands and goes to punch the second officer but is hit in the gut with a taser. He screams from the charge and falls, holding his chest and grunting. Looking up at the first officer, who is holding a gun on him, the officer's face "shorts out" like an electronic holographic device. Eventually, the officer's real face is shown to be a heavier mustached man as Patnik looks on in horror. The second officer, also looking differently in Patnik's eyes now, kneels over Patnik.)

OFFICER #2: Turn over.

(Patnik does so and is handcuffed.)

Damn amp-head.

(He stands Patnik up. The first officer opens the trunk.)

OFFICER #1: Oh lord... Jimmy, check this out.

(The officer, with Patnik in tow, looks in the trunk. The man is no longer there, his true identity that of a beautiful blonde woman, dead.)

JOSEPH PATNIK: Sarah?

(Patnik recognizes her as his wife.)

Sarah!

SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.; APRIL 29; 2:12 AM

(Mulder sits in his car, watching two men talk. One of the men walks off. A man in a suit gets in the car.)

MULDER: Our blind date's not off to a good start. I've been waiting here nearly two hours.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: I was asked to make sure you weren't followed.

MULDER: It's just you, me, and the drug dealers.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: This area's always been known for it's criminal element.

MULDER: Especially when Congress is in session.

(The man hands Mulder a newspaper with an article in the front with the headline "Braddock Heights Man Kills Wife, Four Others." Underneath is a picture of Joseph Patnik in a prison photo.)

What's this?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: Something you'll want to follow.

MULDER: Follow where?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: That's all I have for you.

MULDER: What do you mean, that's all you have for me? I get an anonymous e-mail to come meet you here in the middle of the night, I don't know who you are or what you want.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: I don't have any obligation or desire to give you any answers. I'm not one of your sources.

MULDER: Then you're just a messenger boy?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: It's late, Agent Mulder. Go home. Get some sleep.

MULDER: Who told you to contact me? How do I know I'm not being played?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: I guess you don't.

(He gets out. Mulder crumples up the newspaper and throws it at him.)

MULDER: Well, then you can go ahead and recycle that, then.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: I've been asked to tell you... you walk away from this, more people will die.

(He closes the door and walks away. Mulder stares down at the paper.)



SCENE 3
FREDERICK COUNTY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL; BRADDOCK HEIGHTS, MARYLAND

(Joseph Patnik sits in a basically empty room, staring blankly at the television hung from the ceiling. Mulder watches him through the room's window. Scully walks over to him.)

SCULLY: Sorry, I would've gotten here sooner but the Beltway was a parking lot. What's going on?

MULDER: Multiple homicide, a bizarre one. That's Joseph Patnik. He murdered five people, all of whom he insists was the same man.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Well, he claims to have been killing the same man over and over again, that he wouldn't die.

SCULLY: Does he have a history of mental illness?

MULDER: Not that I know, but I only just got this case yesterday.

SCULLY: So, what's the X-File?

MULDER: In Patnik's neighborhood two weeks ago, a baby-sitter attacked the two children she was minding. She told the police she thought they were wolves.

SCULLY: And police found no other motive for either of these attacks?

MULDER: Not so far, no.

(Doctor Stroman walks up to him.)

STROMAN: Agent Mulder? Hi, I'm Doctor Stroman.

(Mulder turns around and shakes his hand.)

MULDER: Doctor Stroman, this is my partner, Special Agent Scully.

(Scully shakes hands with him.)

SCULLY: Hi.

STROMAN: Hello.

SCULLY: You're the physician in charge?

STROMAN: Yeah, they called me in from D.C. to try and develop a clear diagnosis for the court.

MULDER: Have you?

STROMAN: I wish I could say "yes."

SCULLY: Has he been sedated?

STROMAN: I've got him on heavy thorazine, but it only seemed to knock him back a notch or two.

MULDER: He seems pretty manageable to me.

(Stroman looks at Patnik briefly.)

STROMAN: It may be some form of organic delusional syndrome, possibly due to chronic metamphetamine abuse. I don't know, but, uh, he is prone to outbursts.

MULDER: Who called you down on this case?

STROMAN: A Doctor Kahn from the, uh, Department of Social Health Services.

MULDER: Could we speak to him?

STROMAN: I don't think he's in today, but I can certainly check for you.

(Patnik screams loudly.)

Orderly!

(Stroman runs towards the room. Patnik screams again and throws over his chair, then throws over a chair in the corner and sits down as Stroman runs in with two orderlies, who grab him.)

ORDERLY #1: Take it easy...

ORDERLY #2: Calm down, Mister Patnik.

(Mulder and Scully walk in.)

JOSEPH PATNIK: No! No! No, no, no! He's here!

(The agents look up at the screen.)

TELEVISION NEWSCASTER: ...Miriskovic personally ordered the rape and murder of thousands of innocent civilians in wartorn regions of the former Yugoslavia. Reporting...

(On the screen is a dictator names Miriskovic. He is also the man that Patnik thought he was killing.)



SCENE 4
JOSEPH PATNIK'S HOUSE

(Mulder and Scully pull up to Patnik's house. A cable van drives by as they make their way to the house.)

SCULLY: You said you got this case last night, where did it come from?

MULDER: Came from an outside source.

SCULLY: Who?

(Mulder does not answer, looking down at the floor as he walks.)

This outside source, Mulder, what's his interest in this case? What does he want us to uncover?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: And you're not suspicious that we're being used?

MULDER: We've got dead bodies and confessed murderers. If we're being used, it's to find out the connection. That's what I'm interested in.

(Mulder lifts the yellow tape and the two walk to the door. They enter the house. A woman screams and they whip out their guns, prepared to walk into the main room. Mulder peeks in and frowns at Scully. The two then put their guns away and walk in nonchalantly. On the couch are two kids watching television on the wide-screen.)

Isn't this a school day?

(The two children stand up, startled, and look at him.)

BOY #1: We didn't cut.

BOY #2: We got a pass.

MULDER: You got a pass to come in here and eat these people's food and watch their TV?

("Die Hard" is on TV. Bruce Willis jumps off the roof and screams as the onlookers watch from the ground. The roof bursts in explosions.)

BOY #1: No.

BOY #2: Are we in trouble now?

(Mulder nods slightly.)

SCULLY: How'd you get in here?

BOY#1: Through the window. They leave it open for the cat.

MULDER: Well, maybe you should head back to school.

(The two boys start to the window.)

No, no, no, use the front door.

(The two boys walk past Mulder and Scully. Mulder pats the second boy on the head as they do. Mulder watches the mayhem on television until the picture suddenly shorts out. He looks out the window to see a cable technician working on the pole, then climbing down.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(He walks over to her.)

Look at this, there must be hundreds of videos here.

(Mulder looks at the racks of videotapes.)

MULDER: Anything good?

SCULLY: All I see are recordings of cable news shows. They're all dated and in chronological order. You know, that's what Patnik was watching at the hospital when he went all wiggy.

(Mulder nods.)

What if there's some connection?

MULDER: Between what he saw and what he recorded and what he did?

SCULLY: You're the one who's interested.

(She pulls out a videotape.)



SCENE 5
2400 COURT MOTEL

(Mulder is watching a videotape in fast-forward of a trial. On the table is a can of soda and a large pile of sunflower seed shells. He puts two more shells down and turns off the television. He then gets up and drops the videotape down onto a very large pile of others. Scully opens the door to her hotel room and Mulder walks in.)

MULDER: I just watched thirty-six hours of Bernard Shaw and Bobbie Batista. I'm about ready to kill somebody too.

(He lays down. Scully starts over to her television.)

SCULLY: I'm going to show you something.

(She puts her hand on a pile of tapes. On the floor, there are more stacks, as well as another stack on top of the television. Another tape is playing as well.)

These tapes are dated April nineteenth, April twenty-first and April twenty-third. Each corresponds to a night that Patnik committed a murder.

MULDER: What's on the tapes?

(Scully sits.)

SCULLY: Among other things, a one-hour special report on the atrocities in Bosnia, a report that prominently features Lladoslav Miriskovic.

MULDER: The same guy that started Patnik screaming in the psych ward?

(She nods.)

SCULLY: And my guess is that once I review the tapes for the night that Patnik killed his wife, that I'll find that report there as well.

MULDER: So you think that because Patnik saw this war criminal on television, he was somehow inspired to go out and murder these people?

SCULLY: Well, recent studies have linked violence on television to violent behavior.

MULDER: Yeah, but those studies are based on the assumption that Americans are just empty vessels ready to be filled with any idea or image that's fed to them like a bunch of Pavlov dogs and go out and act on it.

SCULLY: But they believe that the causal connections are there, Mulder.

MULDER: They, studies have also shown causal connections between cow flatulence and the depletion of the ozone layer. What you're talking about is pseudo-science used to make political book.

SCULLY: All I'm saying is that I think it's clear that, that the programs that Patnik watched somehow triggered his violent behavior.

MULDER: How?

SCULLY: The doctor suggested amphetamine abuse. Maybe that coupled with, with the disturbing images he was watching, pushed him over the edge.

MULDER: All I know is television does not make a previously sane man go out and kill five people, thinking they're all the same guy. Not even "Must-See TV" could do that to you.

SCULLY: Okay, then how do you explain it?

MULDER: I can't. Not yet.

(He stands and heads for the door.)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: I'm going to get some sleep. Looks like you could use some too.

SCULLY: No, I'm going to... watch the rest of these tapes. Just out of curiosity.

MULDER: You have fun.

(He leaves. Scully sits down in her chair and presses play. Much later, Scully continues to watch the tape in fast-forward mode. The phone rings three times but not in Scully's room. Someone picks up the phone. She hears Mulder talking through the wall from a good distance away.)

Yes. I understand. All right. I've just been watching the tapes. I'll come outside. Right. Okay. No, she doesn't. No. Goodbye.

(Scully presses stop on her tape and takes a drink of something slowly. She crunches the ice, staring blankly at the television. Going to the ice machine, she takes a fresh scoop and puts some change into the soda machine. Curiosly, she looks around the side and sees Mulder sitting in his car, laughing slightly. A match flares and the Cigarette-Smoking Man, sitting next to him, lights a cigarette. Scully watches on in horror as Mulder hands him a videotape. A large van drives by and Scully ducks behind the soda machine. Looking back out, she sees Mulder and his accomplice drive off.)



SCENE 6
APRIL 20; 9:48 AM

(Helene Riddock is doing the dishes, listening to music most commonly used by Richard Simmons. She looks over to her television and sees a game show. She smiles.)

GAME SHOW HOST: Before we go any further, I'd like to...

(She looks down at the dishwater and the picture of it "shorts out." She frowns, unsure of what just happened. The water turns to green lines at points, then forms a sort of face as she looks on in horror. She turns around to see her whole kitchen is being invaded by green and red lines in the spectrum. She looks outside to see her bearded husband on a hammock with a beautiful young woman on top of him. As she watches, she leans down and kisses him. Helene runs over to her closet, pulls out her rifle and goes towards the back door. The game show continues to play.)

This beautiful washer-dryer! Tell them about it, Colonel.

GAME SHOW ANNOUNCER: This beautiful washer-dryer...

(A shot rings out from the backyard.)



SCENE 7
2400 COURT MOTEL

(Scully sits, thinking. Mulder knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: I just got a call. There's been another murder.

SCULLY: Yeah, I'll be right there.

(She doesn't move, thinking about what she saw. Slowly, she makes her way to the car and gets in, then pulls open the ashtray. It is empty. Mulder gets in.)

MULDER: It happened just less than an hour ago. It seems to match our pattern, a housewife gone berserk.

SCULLY: The car's been moved. Did you take it out last night?

(Mulder buckles his seatbelt.)

MULDER: No. Uh, I went out, and I got a paper this morning. Why?

SCULLY: Nothing. Nothing, let's go see the crime scene.



SCENE 8
HELEN RIDDOCK'S HOUSE

(Officials have swarmed the backyard and the man in the hammock, who no longer has a beard and whose facial features are different, is now a bloody mess on the hammock. Scully walks over and looks at the body.)

MULDER: Okay, thanks, Detective.

DETECTIVE: You're welcome.

(Mulder, carrying an umbrella, walks over to Scully.)

I just talked to the detective in charge. The shooter is Helene Riddock, age forty-two. They took her to lock-up.

SCULLY: What happened?

(They start walking.)

MULDER: She looked out the window and claims she saw her husband in the hammock... with a blonde.

(They stop as he points over to a dog barking at them with blondish fur.)

SCULLY: That blonde?

MULDER: Yeah, apparently, he was only taking a nap with his dog...

(They start walking again.)

But Mrs. Riddock swears she looked out the window and saw her husband in the hammock with a blonde woman.

(They stop walking on the other side of the hammock.)

SCULLY: So, this woman killed her husband because she thought he was cheating on her?

MULDER: This is not even her husband. Her husband's a long-haul trucker. He's been out of town for the last ten days. Mister John Gillness, it's her next-door neighbor. She didn't even have the right backyard. Helene Riddock lives over here.

(He points to the house and starts walking as Scully stares at the body. Scully watches Mulder suspiciously as Mulder looks back at her.)

Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah, let's check it out.

(Inside the house, the television still plays. This show is part of the "The Home Value Network." A porcelain knick-knack is being showcased. The statue is also sitting on the table next to the couch.)

TELEVISION ANNOUNCER: One of my favorites, he is so cute. "The Little Traveler," normally a hundred-and-twenty-nine and that's what you're going to pay at the department stores, but here at Home Value Network...

(Mulder picks up the porcelain statuette and starts to walk to the back.)

MULDER: "A thing of beauty is a joy forever..." what do you think, Scully?

SCULLY: I think television plays a large part in both of these murderers' lives.

(She walks over and picks up a few pictures.)

MULDER: As it does in almost every American home, but television does not equal violence. I don't care what anybody says...

(He picks up an ugly statuette.)

Unless you consider bad taste an act of violence.

(Scully pulls open a drawer and finds many more videotapes.)

SCULLY: More tapes.

(Mulder walks over to her. Scully puts a videotape into the VCR.)

MULDER: Hang on a second.

(He walks to the window and looks outside. The cable van pulls up and the technician gets out.)

I'll be right back.

(As Scully flips through the tape, Mulder runs out the door. He runs towards the cable van.)

Hey! Hey!

(The technician gets in the van and drives off as Mulder gives chase.)

Hey!

(Mulder stops and looks back at the pole. Inside, Scully watches the tape with a blank expression. She looks out the window and sees Mulder start to climb the pole. She then walks out as Mulder opens the cable box on the pole and sees four transmitters. One is gold, the rest are silver. He takes the gold one and looks at it as Scully runs over with two police officers.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?

MULDER: I'm coming down.

(He starts to climb down.)

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: I found a cable trapper scrambler running from the pole into the house.

SCULLY: Maybe it's a job for Special Agent Pendrell and the Sci-Crime lab.

(Mulder jumps down onto a car. Scully reaches for the device.)

You want it analyzed?

MULDER: Yeah, I'll do it.

(He starts off. Scully is dismayed and puts her hand down.)

It makes more sense for you to go down and interview Helene Riddock. Get her version of the story. Maybe she knows what this thing is.

(Scully stares at her, very suspicious of Mulder's actions.)

Is there a problem with that?

SCULLY: No, that's, that's fine, I'm...

MULDER: Stay in touch.

(He gets in the car and drives off as Scully's fear grows.)



SCENE 9
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and his informants are gathered around a table where the device lay on a green board with a device hooked through it.)

BYERS: It looks a lot like a standard video trap for blocking premium cable channels.

MULDER: What does this one block?

LANGLY: Amazingly, it doesn't seem to block anything.

MULDER: Then what does it do?

FROHIKE: Glad you asked.

(He clears his throat as he and Langly walk over to two carts with televisions and VCRs. Byers slides over on his chair and takes a channel changer from Frohike.)

MULDER: I bet all you guys were officers in the audio-visual club in high school, huh?

LANGLY: Mm-hmmm.

(The two televisions are turned on and identical test patterns comes up.)

BYERS: This is the straight feed off our bars and tone generator...

(He points to the first one.)

And here are the bars and tone as attenuated through the device.

(He points to the second television.)

MULDER: Looks the same.

FROHIKE: Well, that's what you'd think.

LANGLY: We couldn't discern any difference between the feeds, not until we compared them on the oscilloscope.

(He and Frohike turn on two small monitors on top of the televisions. Two lines come up.)

MULDER: Still looks the same.

FROHIKE: Hold onto your hat, dude.

(He throws two switches and the lines become square blocks. The two monitors then scroll down to two more lines. The first is straight, the other is thick and shaky.)

We have touchdown.

MULDER: So they're different.

(Langly nods.)

So... they're different.

BYERS: You know the way television works?

MULDER: Yeah, you click it on, you have a picture.

LANGLY: It's a rapid series of still pictures fired against the tube.

BYERS: There's something non-standard here...

(He points to the second television, which also now has the distorted lines at the bottom.)

...in the vertical blanking interval, information that's being added into the spaces between the still pictures.

MULDER: What kind of information?

BYERS: We don't know.

LANGLY: This is as far as we could get with this equipment.

MULDER: Well, can you take it apart?

LANGLY: Not without destroying it completely. That's by design.

(They all look at the strange device.)

BYERS: An amazingly sophisticated design, but all we can say for sure is...

MULDER: This device is emitting a signal.



SCENE 10

(Mulder is driving down the road. He picks up his phone and starts to dial when the phone rings. He clicks another button and puts it to his ear.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully, who is sitting in her hotel room with the lights out, watching a videotape from the crime scene.)

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I was just about to call you.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

Look, I'm on my way back. You may have been right, Scully, at least partly. I think there is a foreign signal being introduced into these people's homes through the television set.

(Cut to Scully, who sits in silence.)

Scully, are you there?

SCULLY: I'm here.

MULDER: I think they may be running some kind of test.

(Cut back to Mulder, who receives no answer.)

Scully, did you hear what I just said?

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: So, you had it analyzed?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Scully nods.)

SCULLY: I just talked to Agent Pendrell, he said that you never showed up.

MULDER: I didn't take it over to Pendrell.

SCULLY: Then where were you?

MULDER: Look, I'd, I'd rather talk about it when we get on the land line, okay? We've dealt with these kind of people before. We know what they're capable of.

(Scully hears a click.)

SCULLY: What was that?

MULDER: What was what?

(Another few clicks sound off.)

SCULLY: There, that noise.

MULDER: Scully, is there something wrong?

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Another few clicks.)

Mulder, who's listening to...

(She pulls the phone away from her ear and looks at it.)

MULDER: Scully, look, I'm going to be right there, okay? Don't go anywhere. Don't...

(She slams the phone down. Cut to Mulder, who starts to dial another number. The hotel phone rings and Scully stares at it. She grabs the wall cord and rips it out of the wall. She then unscrews the receiver and looks for something suspicious. After hearing a few clicks, she gasps and looks around the room. Her eyes move to the lamp, which she looks under, ripping the bottom cushioning off. She then reaches under the table and feels around. Finding nothing, she looks over to the wall and rips off sheet after sheet of paper on the ironing board, desperately searching for the wiretap. She then unscrews the wall socket and looks inside of that. As her agitation and fear grows, she throws over another table, breaking various things and knocking over the phone, and looks under it. Then, she rips off the heat control and looks in that. Going into the bathroom, she stands on a chair and undoes the giant light bulb. Fining nothing, she searches behind the television and yanks out the cord. As she stands, she knocks over piles and piles of recovered videotapes. Looking around, the room seems shaky. The curtains repeatedly "short out." Outside, she hears a car pull up and the headlights shine through the window. She gasps and ducks, then goes to the door and listens in, hearing two men talking outside.)

MULDER: Here, she's in here. Ready?

(The proprietor unlocks the door.)

PROPREITOR: Ready. On the count...

(Scully chain-locks the door.)

MULDER: Wait...

(Mulder bangs on the door and Scully stumbles back, startled. Breathing heavily, she walks over, picks up her gun and aims it at the door. As the proprietor opens the door, he is stopped by the chain-lock. Scully fires six shots at him. She then runs the other way as Mulder kicks open the door.)

Get back, call the police.

(The proprietor runs off to do so. Mulder looks around the disheveled motel room.)

Scully! Scully!

(He kicks open another door to find that the back door is wide open and Scully is nowhere to be found.)



SCENE 11
MAY 1; 6:04 AM

(Pictures of all of Margaret Scully's children sit on a table. The phone rings, and Margaret wakes up, turns on the lamp and answers it.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Hello?

(Cut to Mulder, who stands in the motel room, which is being scoured by F.B.I. agents.)

MULDER: Mrs. Scully, hi, it's Fox Mulder.

(Cut back to Margaret.)

MARGARET SCULLY: What is it, what's the matter?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I was hoping that you'd heard from Dana.

(Cut to Margaret.)

MARGARET SCULLY: No. Has something happened?

MULDER: I'm... I'm not exactly sure.

(Cut to Mulder.)

There's... there's some confusion here. She's missing.

(Cut back to Margaret as she sits up in bed.)

MARGARET SCULLY: What do you mean, "missing?"

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, she ran off last night. Um... we, we, we're looking for her as best we can...

(Cut back to Margaret.)

...but we are a little concerned.

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh my God...

(Cut to Mulder. He hears a car pull up and turns around. He starts in that direction.)

MULDER: Look, Mrs. Scully, I hate to do this to you, but I got to hang up on you right now.

(Cut back to Margaret.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Fox, would you please tell me what's wrong?

(Cut to Mulder, who is walking towards Skinner.)

MULDER: Hang by the phone. I will call you as soon as I know something.

(He hangs up.)

Sir, can I have a word with you?

(The two men talking to Skinner walk off.)

This manhunt is being conducted as if we're searching for an escaped convict.

SKINNER: Mulder, I share your concern for Agent Scully, but the fact remains she fired four rounds at you and an unarmed civilian last night.

MULDER: I appreciate that, but these officers should be instructed not to confront her once they find her.

SKINNER: What would you have them do?

MULDER: Just to keep an eye on her till I can get there. I think I can get her to listen to me.

SKINNER: She didn't listen to you last night.

MULDER: That's because she's not responsible for her own actions. She's suffering from some kind of paranoid psychosis.

SKINNER: Brought on by what?

MULDER: I can't explain the exact mechanism, but it has something to do with certain videotapes we watched that we recovered from a crime scene.

SKINNER: Videotapes?

MULDER: Videotapes that contain an electronic signal that somehow induces violent behavior.

SKINNER: Do you have any proof of this?

MULDER: I'm working on that.

SKINNER: Whatever prompted her behavior, the fact remains that Scully is armed and obviously dangerous so I suggest you Marshall whatever resources you have to make sure that you find her first.

(Mulder nods slightly and Skinner walks away.)



SCENE 12
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder slowly tapes an "X" to his window and starts dribbling his basketball. The phone rings and Mulder sits down and picks it up.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to the Lone Gunman's office, where Frohike is on the phone and Byers is in the back. Langly is standing next to Frohike.)

FROHIKE: Mulder, we pulled something off that videotape you found in Scully's room.

(Byers walks towards his compatriots. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: What is it?

(Cut to Frohike. Byers starts to flip through a file.)

FROHIKE: Something interesting... but we don't want to talk about it...

(Cut to Mulder.)

...over the phone. "Big Brother" may be listening.

(Frohike hangs up, then Mulder does. He taps the phone on the table, staring at the "X" on his window. He then picks up his coat and walks out.)



SCENE 13
THE LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Frohike, Byers, Langly and Mulder congregate around a videotape player. Frohike speeds through the videotape while it is playing on fast-forward, showing a psychic network commercial.)

FROHIKE: Here's the tape Scully was reviewing last night. We scanned samples of the tape onto disk.

LANGLY: Digitized it.

BYERS: Using some interpolating freeware we pulled off the net, we were able to blank out visible frames.

MULDER: What am I looking at?

(The picture of the woman on the screen fades into green and red lines.)

LANGLY: Well, this is the actual signal your cable trap device was emitting.

BYERS: Of course, we slowed it down significantly. It's designed to cycle at fifteen flashes per second to induce what is known as the "photic driving response."

MULDER: Bring it home, boys.

LANGLY: This device is stimulating electrical activity in the brain.

BYERS: Studies into subliminal influence have shown a correlation between heightened suggestibility and the manipulation of this response.

MULDER: Mind control?

LANGLY: Fifty-seven channels of it.

BYERS: Tachistoscophic images, like they used to sell popcorn at the movies. Both Russian and American scientists have been working with it for decades.

FROHIKE: Not to mention Madison Avenue.

MULDER: The naked lady in the ice cube.

FROHIKE: Ah, one of my personal favorites.

MULDER: Why wasn't I affected?

(The Lone Gunmen turn to face him. Langly sighs.)

FROHIKE: That's the one thing we haven't figured out yet.

MULDER: This, uh... subliminal signal, could color be a factor in it?

(Everyone looks at Byers.)

BYERS: Maybe.

MULDER: I'm red-green color blind.

BYERS: His inability to perceive the color red could render him immune to the psychotropic effects.

(Mulder's phone rings.)

LANGLY: But why design a color-dependent signal?

FROHIKE: Why not? Red-green color blind...

(Mulder answers his call.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Mulder listens in as his confidants continue to talk amongst themselves.)

...affects only a small percentage of the male population.

BYERS: Which still leaves the vast majority of the American public vulnerable to it's effects.

MULDER: I'll be right there.

(He hangs up and starts to the door.)

FROHIKE: What happened?

MULDER: Maryland State Police. They think they've found Scully.

(He opens the door.)

FROHIKE: Is she okay?

MULDER: No, um... they think maybe I should come down and I.D. the body.

(He walks out. The Gunmen look at each other with concern for Scully.)



SCENE 14
FREDERICK COUNTY MORGUE; 6:21 PM

(Mulder pulls up in the parking lot and stops the car. He rubs his forehead, then slowly unbuckles his seatbelt and gets out. He starts towards the coroner's office when the Plain-Clothed Man pulls up.)

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: Get in.

MULDER: I can't talk to you right now.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: They're watching you. Now, get in before you get us both killed.

MULDER: That's an interesting choice of words. My partner may be dead.

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: It's not my concern.

MULDER: The hell it isn't! We're here because of you!

(The Plain-Clothed Man looks around.)

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: Keep your voice down.

MULDER: Who are you, who do you work for?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: You're wasting time. While you're chasing your partner, they're destroying the evidence.

MULDER: Who?

PLAIN-CLOTHED MAN: Just follow the evidence. If you don't, by tomorrow, the responsible parties will be out of your reach.

(Mulder kicks the door and walks towards the coroner's office as his erstwhile informant drives off. Mulder makes his way towards the coroner, who stands next to a set of blinds.)

CORONER: State highway patrolman found the body off a rural highway at 2:00 P.M. Nude, shot in the forehead.

(Mulder closes his eyes. The coroner grabs the blind drawstring.)

Are you ready?

MULDER: Let me do that.

(The coroner steps back and Mulder pulls open the blinds and looks inside at the redhead on the table. He stares at the body.)

It's not her.

(He starts off.)

Somebody has to call her mother.

CORONER: We already tried.

(Mulder turns around.)

We weren't able to reach her.

MULDER: She's not answering her phone?

(The coroner shrugs slightly. Mulder walks off.)



SCENE 15
MARGARET SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Mulder taps the knocker three times, waits, then does it again louder. Having no response, he looks at the window, peers in, then bangs the knocker four times. Margaret answers the door, but only enough so that her face is shown.)

MULDER: Mrs. Scully, is she here?

MARGARET SCULLY: Uh, no.

MULDER: You haven't been answering your phone.

MARGARET SCULLY: Well, when I hear from her, I'll call you, okay?

(She tries to close the door, but Mulder holds it open.)

MULDER: I need to see her.

MARGARET SCULLY: Fox, please, go away...

(He pushes his way past her.)

Go away!

MULDER: Sorry.

(She closes the door and he walks down the foyer and looks in the main room. Seeing no one, he turns to Margaret.)

Where is she?

(Scully steps out from behind the wall in the main room, aiming her gun at Mulder. Mulder turns around.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana, put down the gun!

MULDER: I'm here to help you, Scully.

(Margaret walks over and stands next to Mulder.)

SCULLY: I told you, Mom. He's here to kill me.

MULDER: I'm on your side, you know that.

MARGARET SCULLY: Put it down, Dana.

MULDER: Scully, listen to me very carefully. You don't know it, but you're sick with the same thing that drove those other people to murder... and whatever you think may be happening...

(He takes a step forward.)

SCULLY: Just step back.

(She cocks the hammer. Margaret steps up next to Mulder.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana, you're not yourself. He's telling you the truth.

SCULLY: It's not the truth, Mom. He's lied to me from the beginning.

(Mulder shakes his head slightly.)

He's never trusted me.

MULDER: Scully, you are the only one I trust.

(Scully is about to cry.)

SCULLY: You're in on it. You're one of them. You're one of the people who abducted me. You put that thing in my neck. You killed my sister!

MARGARET SCULLY: That's not true, Dana.

SCULLY: It is.

(Margaret steps in front of Mulder.)

MARGARET SCULLY: I want you to listen to me...

SCULLY: Mom, just get out of the way!

MARGARET SCULLY: You trust me, don't you?

(Scully is fighting back tears, her gun trained on her mother now.)

You know that I would never hurt you. That I would never let anybody hurt you. That's why you came here, isn't it? You're safe here. Put the gun down, Dana.

(Scully stares at them, very distraught. They look very concerned. Margaret steps towards her daughter.)

Put it down. Put the gun down, Dana. Put it down.

(Scully points her gun away as she and her mother press their foreheads against one another. Scully falls into her mother's arms, sobbing. Margaret and Dana kneel down to the floor as Dana cries.)



SCENE 16
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MEDICAL CENTER; MAY 2; 1:43 PM

(Mulder walks down the hallway as people walk past him. He gets to the door to a hospital room, knocks and opens it. Margaret, standing next to the hospital bed where Scully is laying, looks at him and smiles. He puts his hands up as if having a gun pointed at him and smiles. Margaret walks past him, smiling.)

TELEVISION NEWSCASTER: ...runway 12-H. The runway generally reserved for...

(Mulder turns off the television and sits down in a chair next to Scully.)

MULDER: How you feeling?

SCULLY: Ashamed.

(Mulder crosses his legs.)

I was so sure, Mulder. I saw things and I heard things, and... it was just like world was turned upside-down. Everybody was out to get me.

MULDER: Now you know how I feel most of the time.

SCULLY: I thought you were going to kill me.

MULDER: I'm not surprised.

(She looks at him, confused. He leans in.)

I did some checking. Joseph Patnik thought he was murdering a Bosnian war criminal, a man the media described as a modern-day Hitler. It turns out both Patnik's parents were Holocaust survivors.

SCULLY: I'm not following.

MULDER: Helen Riddock was scared her husband was going to be unfaithful to her. You see a pattern developing here? What if this, this video signal somehow turned these people's anxieties into some kind of dementia? Yeah, a, a virtual reality of their own worst nightmares?

SCULLY: Like me thinking that you'd betray me. I was so far gone, Mulder, I thought that you had gone to the other side.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: That Cancer Man, the man who smokes all those cigarettes, I was sure that I saw the two of you sitting in your car in the motel parking lot. You were reporting to him, you handed him a videotape. I'm... it was crazy.

MULDER: Ah, maybe not.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Well, somebody's behind this, we just don't know who.

SCULLY: You think it could be him?

MULDER: I don't know.

(They look at each other for a second.)

Why don't you try to get some rest?

(He stands and walks out. Looking around outside the room, he sees Doctor Lorenz at the nurse's desk and starts over.)

Doctor Lorenz?

LORENZ: Agent Mulder. I was just about to check in on your partner.

MULDER: What, uh, course of treatment have you outlined for Agent Scully?

LORENZ: At this point, nothing more than bed rest. We still haven't been able to determine what brought this on. As far as I can tell, there's nothing medically wrong with her.

MULDER: That didn't seem to be the case last night.

LORENZ: No, it wasn't. It's got me puzzled. Her M.R.I. was negative, but the spinal tap revealed high levels of serotonin in her brain.

MULDER: You think that would account for her strange behavior?

LORENZ: High serotonin levels have been associated with mania. But the good news is, as of this afternoon, her levels are pretty much back to normal.

(She smiles and walks past him. Mulder thinks for a second, then turns around.)

MULDER: Doctor Lorenz, uh...

(She stops and turns around.)

Would you have made a diagnosis of amphetamine abuse for someone in Agent Scully's condition?

LORENZ: Not given her serotonin levels, no. That wouldn't make any sense.

MULDER: Thank you.

(Mulder turns and starts walking as he pulls out his cellular, then dials.)

Braddock Heights. Yeah, I need the number for Frederick County Psychiatric Hospital, please.

(He stops walking. Cut to the psychiatric hospital, where the phone rings at a clerk's desk. She picks up the phone.)

NURSE: Ward three.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, this is Fox Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I need to talk to Doctor Stroman, please.

(Cut back to the nurse.)

NURSE: I'm sorry, Doctor Stroman's no longer here. I believe he's returned to Washington.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: You know where I can reach him?

(Cut to the nurse.)

NURSE: Um, I'm not sure... he left us a local number.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

It's around here somewhere...

(Mulder pulls out a pack of matches from the 2400 motel and looks at it. On top, he sees a phone number.)

MULDER: Is it 555-0135?

(Cut to the nurse.)

NURSE: That's it.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Thank you.



SCENE 17
2400 COURT MOTEL

(The proprietor unlocks the door to the motel room.)

MULDER: You want me to go first this time?

PROPRIETOR: You're damn straight.

(Mulder takes out his gun, waits for a second, then kicks open the door. He walks in, pointing his gun. The room is a mess. The proprietor walks in behind him as he puts his gun away and starts looking through the covers.)

I haven't had a chance to clean the room yet. He just checked out. What with all the excitement, I don't blame him.

(Mulder walks around the bed and looks through the drawers of a dresser when he sees the phone and stands up.)

MULDER: You charge for local calls?

PROPRIETOR: Of course.

MULDER: You'd have a record of all calls made...

PROPRIETOR: I'll get it for you.

(He walks out. Mulder looks into the kitchen and sees an ashtray. Walking in, he looks down at the ashtray and sees a lone cigarette butt. Picking it up, he sees it is Morley's. He throws it down into the ashtray in disgust as the proprietor walks in with a sheet.)

Here you go.

(Mulder walks back over to the front door and takes it.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He reads it over.)

Thank you.

(The proprietor walks out. Mulder takes his phone out and makes a call.)

Hey, Danny, it's Mulder. I need you to check a number for me.



SCENE 18
5:17 PM

(Mulder pulls up to a house, parks the car and gets out. He starts towards the house, but stops and puts his hand on a blue car parked out front, then goes over to the door. He hears a car behind him and sees the cable van pulling up. Mulder quickly goes into the bushes directly in front of the house and watches as the cable technician walks into the house. Mulder, kneeling, makes his way over to the other side of the window and looks in to see Stroman and the technician talking.)

CABLE TECHNICIAN: That's what he told me, Stroman.

STROMAN: Then where is he? He said he'd be here by now.

CABLE TECHNICIAN: He'll be here.

(Stroman looks at his watch.)

STROMAN: It's almost seven o'clock.

(He walks over to the window and peers out as Mulder leans back against the wall adjacent to it so as not to be seen. Stroman looks around, then walks back over to the technician.)

There's no sign of him.

(Mulder scurries around to the back of the house, skulking quietly. As he approaches the back door, two shots ring out. He quickly takes out his gun and breaks open the door with his shoulder, gun pointed out. He makes his way to the main room and sees that Stroman and the technician are both dead. Stroman was shot in the forehead. He bends down and next to the body and checks the pulse, then the technician's. X steps out.)

X: You're too late, Agent Mulder.

(Mulder aims his gun, but, seeing who it is, points it away, disgusted.)

MULDER: Now that you've destroyed all the evidence.

X: You were told this would happen. You made your choice.

MULDER: I just didn't know I was working for you.

X: I had no alternative. I was being watched too closely. I couldn't risk compromising myself.

MULDER: Why kill them if you wanted me to expose them?

(X steps closer.)

X: Those were always my orders, Agent Mulder. I was just hoping you'd get to them first.

MULDER: And uncover what? What were they trying to do, manipulate people's behavior? Alter their decision making-process? What to buy, who to vote for?

X: You think they'll stop at commerce and politics?

(X bends down and puts the murder weapon into the technician's hand.)

MULDER: Where will they stop?

(X stands and looks at him.)

X: That's where you failed, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Don't lay this off on me, you sneaky son of a bitch. You pulled me into this situation because you didn't have the courage to reveal the truth yourself.

X: Feel better now?

MULDER: You're a coward! You work in the shadows, you feed me scraps of information, hoping that I can piece it together. You make me risk my life, you risk my partner's life and you never risk your own!

(X smirks, knowing that Mulder does not know about the boxcar. Mulder stares at X in disdain. X turns and walks to the door, opening it. Mulder aims and cocks the hammer.)

You're not walking away from this.

(X's body stiffens at the sound of the gun loading.)

X: You're risking your life right now.

(He turns around.)

You failed. This is your success? Killing me? The truth is... you need me, Agent Mulder.

(He walks out, closing the door behind him. Mulder waits, then lowers his gun and uncocks it, righteously angry.)



SCENE 19
FBI HEADQUARTERS; MAY 10

(Mulder sits across from Skinner in Skinner's office. Skinner is reading over a document.)

SKINNER: This is your final report, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: I see more questions than I do answers. You don't know who manufactured the device you found or what its purpose was.

MULDER: No, sir.

(Scully knocks on the door and walks in.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, welcome back.

(She walks over to the desk.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry I'm late, I just got back from the document section.

SKINNER: What did you find out about the two men Mulder found executed?

SCULLY: The cable company employee had no criminal record. In fact, there was nothing remarkable about him whatsoever. We found a medical license under the name "Doctor Stroman" in Falls Church, Virginia. He died in 1978.

SKINNER: What about their killer?

(Scully shrugs and is about to speak when Mulder cuts her off.)

MULDER: He remains an unknown subject.

(Skinner looks at him, slightly suspicious of Mulder's answer.)



SCENE 20
ALLEY

(X walks down a dark alley over to a car. He looks around then gets in the passenger side as the car turns on. In the driver's seat is the Cigarette-Smoking Man, smoking. They do not look at each other for a few seconds.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Have you completed your work?

X: All the personnel and hardware have been removed, but Mulder still has one of the devices.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Oh, it proves nothing. What about, uh... Mulder's source?

X: He's been eliminated.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: And his source? Who's he working with?

X: That person remains unknown.

(They stare at each other, the employer suspicious of his henchman. Then they turn away as the Cigarette-Smoking Man takes another drag off of his cigarette.)

SCENE 1
ARLINGTON, VI
[a fast food restaurant filled with people]

MUNTZ: [speaking alone, spooking out the other people in the restaurant] A lot of consideration...yeah a lot...don't think you're not expendable, no...he never once said I was doing a good job...all my hard work...nobody ever stuck up for me...they were all treated special [stands up, and pulls a gun] Nobody moves! [a woman screams] Everybody stays! Shut up! I said shut up! Now you listen to me...everyone listen to me...ok the children can go [one of the waitresses calls the police] Everybody else, nobody move...I said nobody else move [children are leaving]

SMITH: [stands and walks up to Muntz] Please don't harm anyone.

MUNTZ: Stay away, or I'll shoot.

SMITH: You're frightening these people.

MUNTZ: I'll do it! Hey! I will do it.

SMITH: They've done nothing to you.

MUNTZ: Oh you don't know.

SMITH: Give me the gun.

MUNTZ: I am not a loser.

SMITH: No you're not.

MUNTZ: They made me do it. They made me.

SMITH: [putting his hands on Muntz' hands] But you're not going to do it. You're gonna show them. You're gonna show them.

[outside, a police shooter is in position]
[2 people are at the door, try to get out]

MUNTZ: No! [shoots 3 people] [he's shot at from outside by the police] [he collapses] I'm gonna die [Smith kneels]

SMITH: Nobody's going to die. [reaches for Muntz' wound and heals it]

SCENE 2

[Mulder and Scully arrive at the restaurant, driving a Cadillac] [lots of cops around]
[they get out of the car]

SCULLY: Where are the wounded?

PARAMEDIC: What?

SCULLY: I'm FBI, where are the people who were shot?

PARAMEDIC: Everybody's inside, but you're not gonna find anybody who's wounded.

[Scully goes inside]

MULDER: You're the 1st medic on the scene?

PARAMEDIC: Yes sir.

MULDER: Can you tell me what happened?

PARAMEDIC: Well it doesn't make any sense. We got a call, there had been a shooting, at least one man was down, but when we got here there wasn't a damn thing to do.

[inside]

SCULLY: Excuse me, I'm Special Agent Scully, FBI. I wanna talk to somebody who can tell me what happened.

DETECTIVE: Well I can tell you what I saw but I don't think there's a man here who can tell you what happened.

SCULLY: What did you see?

DETECTIVE: Maybe you should talk to this man, he was one of the one shot. [pointing at a guy who's standing and who is well]

SCULLY: You were shot?

MAN: Right here, right in the stomach. I felt the bullet enter me, and the next thing I remembered was being on the floor, my legs and arms were numb and I could taste blood in my throat then I see the man's face.

SCULLY: What man?

MAN: The same guy who tried to talk the gun guy out of hurting anyone.

SCULLY: What did he do?

MAN: He touched me, and he said I was gonna be ok. And then all of the sudden, I could feel my legs and arms again.

[outside] [Mulder gets in the car where Muntz is]

MUNTZ: Who are you?

MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder, I'm an FBI Agent. I understand you've been read your rights will you talk to me Mr Muntz? Can you tell me what happened?

MUNTZ: God.. spared my life today. He took pity on my soul and he washed away my sins.

MULDER: How do you mean?

MUNTZ: He reached down and he healed me with his hand. A man, a holy man. All I can think is.. it must have been the good Lord himself [Mulder gets out]

MULDER: Talked to him?

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: The shooter described a man, a man who reached down and healed with the palm of his hand.

SCULLY: He's gone.

MULDER: They let him leave the scene?

SCULLY: Well nobody let him leave, he was in custody, and they were talking to him and then somehow he just disappeared.

MULDER: He's vanished?

SCULLY: Without a trace.



SCENE 3
QUONOCHAUTAUG, RHODE ISLAND

[Mrs Mulder arrives at a house, she walks towards it, gets in]
[she goes through the house, to the back yard, there's a view of the sea]

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It struck me as I was sitting here.

MRS. MULDER: What?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Everything changes but the sea.

MRS. MULDER: What do you want from me?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I thought we might at least allow ourselves to reminisce.

MRS. MULDER: I have nothing to say to you.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Really? We used to have so much to say to each other, so many good times at the Mulder's summer place [smiling]. Your kids.. young and energetic. I remember water-skiing down there with Bill. He was a good water-skier your husband, not as good as I was but then that could be said about so many things...[Mrs. Mulder looks angry] couldn't it?

MRS. MULDER: I've repressed it all.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Well, I find that hard to believe, particularly since I came here today to ask you to remember something. Something I'm gonna have to ask you to try very hard to recollect.

[they're arguing but we can't hear them]
[someone is taking pictures of them from not too far away]



SCENE 4

DETECTIVE: He gave a name as Jeremiah Smith, of Suitland, Virginia, he gave a PO box that turned out to be phony, he had no driver's license.

MULDER: All the cars in the parking lot have been accounted for?

DETECTIVE: Which means he must have walked from somewhere nearby. We've got a canvass out.

SCULLY: And you talked to him personally?

DETECTIVE: Yeah, damnedest thing, and I swear this is how it happened, I looked down to my notebook to write something, I look up, the guy's not standing there anymore. It's like he just disappeared.

[Mulder see news camera crews packing and leaving in a van] [Mulder's phone rings]

MULDER: Mulder.

WOMAN'S VOICE: Agent Mulder, this is Assistant Director Skinner's office, would you hold for a moment?

MULDER: Yeah.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, we've just received a call here that might cause you some alarm.

MULDER: What is it?

SKINNER: Your mother has been admitted in a hospital in serious condition, a small coastal town on Rhode Island called.. Quono..

MULDER: Quonochautaug? I'm on my way.



SCENE 5
THE HOSPITAL
11:21 PM

[Mulder discovers his mom in a bed with tubes in her mouth]
[he gets close, puts a hand on her forehead]

SCULLY: The nurse said she had a stroke. They don't know yet the nature of severity, but the doctor's on his way down.

MULDER: She's cold. [pulls a blanket and puts it over her]

SCULLY: Mulder I don't wanna jump to conclusions. I don't want you to think the worst, people recover from those situations all the time.

MULDER: Mom..

NURSE: She hasn't been able to speak, she's been in and out of consciousness.

MULDER: How did she get here?

NURSE: A 911 came in, the paramedics from Shelter Harbor found her on the floor of the house. [leaves]

MULDER: Mom. [she wakes up] Hi. It's ok, everything's gonna be ok. [she makes a gesture like she wants to write] What what is it? What do you want?

SCULLY: I think she wants something to write on. [Scully hands her note pad and a pen] [she writes PALM]

MULDER: Palm?
[Mulder's mom is loaded up in an ambulance that leaves the hospital]

SCULLY: She's had what's called a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but they're very hopeful because the circulation was restored so quickly. She's gonna be under constant supervision at the Best Care up in Providence. It could be a lot worse.

MULDER: Thanks.

SCULLY: Are you ok?

MULDER: Yeah. I'm.. I just can't help thinking there's a correlation.

SCULLY: Correlation?

MULDER: A connection to the shooting at the fast food restaurant.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, I.. I don't understand.

MULDER: My mother wrote the word palm, that's what the man who healed the victim, that's what he used, the palm of his hand. [Scully gives a look]You..you think it's a leap?

SCULLY: Mulder, there's no deep mystery here. Your mother is at the.. the right age for something like this to happen.

MULDER: Why the word palm?

SCULLY: Well there could be several reasons huh..but to be honest, I don't think it means anything, her brain and her thought processes have been.. have been radically changed by what's happened. It could have very well affected her center of speech, her language.

MULDER: But you can't explain it exactly, nor can it be explained how the wounded were miraculously healed or how the man who healed them just vanished into the air, can it?

SCULLY: I'm sure it can, and will be Mulder, I'm gonna drive you to the nearest motel, it's been a very long day.

MULDER: I'm gonna go back to D.C..

SCULLY: To do what?

MULDER: I wanna find out who this miracle man is.



SCENE 6

WASHINGTON, D.C.
8:25 AM

MULDER: This is everything shot by the 1st news crews at the scene. [slips a tape into a VCR] Outtakes and unedited footage.

SCULLY: Did they get anything on the man on question?

MULDER: Yes it's supposed to be about 8:22 [shot at the VCR counter, fast forwarding] [Mulder hit the PLAY button] [video footage playing] There, that must be him. [Smith, questioned by the Detective] [a person passes in front of the camera, and Smith isn't there anymore after, instead of him, another guy wearing the same suit, the Detective looks up and realizes Smith isn't there anymore]

SCULLY: Whoa what happened there?

MULDER: Hey he's gone.Where did he go? [hits the REV button and plays it again] You see that?

SCULLY: Yeah..

MULDER: Looks like he's gone but there's..somebody else in his place, wearing the same clothes.

SCULLY: Could that be another detective?

MULDER: Why don't you find out ? [hands the remote control to Scully]

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: If I told you, you'd never let me go.

SCULLY: Mulder you haven't slept in almost 24 hours.

MULDER: Call me if you find anything . [leaves the room]



SCENE 7
SOCIAL SERVICE ADMINISTRATION
WASHINGTON, D.C.

[large room with a lot of desks and people working on computers]
[a lot of Men In Black pour in the room, looking for someone]
[among the MIB's is the Cigarette Smoking Man]
[Smith is there and notices all the men, he stands up and tries to leave by the back exit]
[he opens the door and is arrested by other MIB's there]
[the MIBs and the Cigarette-Smoking Man all leave]

SCENE 9
QUONOCHAUTAUG

[Mulder gets in the house and notices the back door is open, he goes out]
[there's a man behind him] [it's X]

X: He was here with her.

MULDER: What?

X: With your mother, the Cancer Man.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

X: Maybe I can bring you up to speed Agent Mulder [hands him the pictures]

MULDER: Did you take this?

X: They had quite an argument, as you might gather from the snapshots. You seemed surprised. I'm sure you were aware they knew each other or what brought them here together?

MULDER: I don't know. Did he hurt her?

X: No, no she collapsed after he left. I dare say if I hadn't been there to make the call, she might not have survived.

MULDER: What did they argue about?

X: I don't know, I was forced to keep a discreet distance.

MULDER: You must have some idea or else you wouldn't have followed them here.

X: He wants something from her, something she may have kept in this house unless you know another reason they would have chosen to meet here.

MULDER: On the day my parents divorced, my mother vowed never to set foot in the summer house again, I know my mother, she kept her word.

X: It could be something very old, certainly, something very important.

MULDER: I have no idea what that could be.

X: No idea at all?

MULDER: No.

[Mulder leaves, close-up in X' face]



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

[Smith is walking in] [Scully recognizes him]

SCULLY: Sir? Excuse me but..

SMITH: Yes?

SCULLY: Are you Jeremiah Smith?

SMITH: Yes, I'm afraid there's been some mistake, I saw my photo on the news saying I fled a scene of a crime, I'm here to turn myself in.

SCULLY: Huh, would you come with me sir.



SCENE 11
IN AN OFFICE

SMITH: From the moment I stepped from the crowd and asked the man to put down his gun, it seemed like .. a dream, as if I was out of my body.

SCULLY: There were reports, somewhat fantastic reports about what happened next.

SMITH: I know, I saw the news reports. [a man is taking notes] I'll have to say that I don't remember any of it, nothing.

DETECTIVE: You gave me a wrong address sir, then you left the crime scene during the interview

SMITH: I don't remember that, I'm sorry.

SKINNER: What *do* you remember, Mr Smith?

SMITH: I remember showing up for work at the next day, being at my desk. [another man is taking notes] That's my 1st recollection.

SKINNER: At the Social Security Administration?

SMITH [nods]: I'm not sure.. what I've done wrong.

SCULLY: You haven't done anything wrong, sir

SMITH: May I go?

[Scully looks at Skinner]

SKINNER: Yes, but until this matter is resolved completely, I'll ask you to notify us if you'll be outta town for any reasons

[Smith nods, smiles, and leaves]

SKINNER: Agent Scully?

[Scully sighs]



SCENE 12
QUONOCHAUTAUG
NIGHT

[Man gets in the house, it's Mulder with a tiny flashlight, he turns on the lights, and begins to look everywhere, cupboards, closets, drawers.. finds nothing, it takes a good 2 minutes]

[exhausted, he sits on a couch.. takes a note from his pocket, with The word palm his mother wrote. He then takes a pen and writes: LAMP]

[Mulder takes a lamp and smashes it against the wall.. nothing]

[he does the same with another one, and finds a strange device.. pushes the button and a pick comes out and startles Mulder, it's the same weapon of the alien bounty hunter also known as the alien hitman from the episode Colony]



SCENE 13

[the Cigarette-Smoking Man opens a tiny window and looks though it]
[it's the prison, and the door of cell B18 opens]
[the Cigarette-Smoking Man enters, takes off the head restraint of Smith, takes a chair, lights a cigarette, takes a puff and sits]

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: This becomes a responsibility. The thing I am now called upon to put right and put down. Certainly you expected nothing less.

SMITH: I'm not ashamed of my actions.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Ashamed? You're not allowed the luxury of human weakness in penitence. You're not allowed to put your indulgences ahead of the greater purpose.

SMITH: I no longer believe in the greater purpose.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Then your fate is just.

SMITH: My justice is not for you to mete out. You may have reasons, you have no right, you have no means.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You presume to dictate duty to *me*? Have you any idea what the cost of your action is? What their affect might be? Who are you to give them hope?

SMITH: What do you give them?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: We give them happiness, and they give us authority.

SMITH: The authority to take away their freedom in the guise of democracy.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Men can never be free, because they're weak, corrupt, worthless and restless. The people believe in authority, they've grown tired of waiting for miracle or mystery. Science is their religion, no greater explanation exists for them. They must never believe any differently if the project is to go forward.

SMITH: At what cost to them?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: The question is irrelevant, and the outcome inevitable, the date is set.

SMITH [morphs into Deep Throat and it freaks the Cigarette-Smoking Man out]: At what cost to them for your own selfish benefit? How many must die at your hand to preserve your stake in the project?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN [stands up and pounds on the door]: I'm not impressed by your miracles or moved by your trickery. Your justice will be meted out.

SMITH: By whom this time, and by what tool?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: By those who possess the tool of your destruction.

[door closes]



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS

Mulder storms in Skinner's office

MULDER [to the secretary who stands up]: Hold his calls. [to Skinner] I want his name, I wanna know everything about him.

SKINNER: Excuse me?

MULDER: I want the smoking man smoked out, I want him exposed as the murdering son of a bitch that he is.

SKINNER [stands up]: What's your problem Mulder?

SCULLY: Where have you been?

MULDER: To our summer house, he was there with my mother. [shows them the pictures] He's the reason for what happened to her.

SKINNER: Where did you get these?

MULDER: It *doesn't* matter where I got those, the only thing that matters is that *that* man is called to answer, now I want his name!

SKINNER: I don't know his name.

MULDER: You know how to get it.

SKINNER: These men don't have names.

MULDER: Well then you tell me how to find him.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, there was a time when I might have been able to tell you, but that time is passed.

MULDER: He knows about the man who disappeared from the restaurant shooting.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: He's trying to kill him.

SCULLY: Mulder he just came in yesterday, he just turned himself in.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: He.. he gave a statement.

MULDER: Where is he now?

SCULLY: He works for the social security administration.

[Mulder leaves, followed by Scully]



SCENE 15
SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION

[Mulder is pointed out to Smith by one of the people working]
[Mulder and Scully walks to him]

MULDER: Mr Smith?

SMITH: Hello.

MULDER: I'm with the FBI. I'd like you to come with me

SMITH: For what? I told you everything I know. I thought they said you'd call if there was anything.

MULDER: I'm sure you don't want to cause a scene at work, sir.

SMITH: No of course not [stands and they walk out] I'll come along.

[walking out of an elevator] [there are lots of people]

SMITH: Where are you taking me? Can you tell me where you're taking me?

MULDER: We'll have plenty of time to talk sir.

[Smith rushes and falls down with other people ahead]
[when Mulder thinks he grabbed him, it's a beard man, the man next isn't Smith either]

MULDER: You see him?

SCULLY: No I lost him.

[outside, close up on the beard man]



SCENE 16
PRISON
CELL B18

[The Cigarette-Smoking man walks in, holding a cigarette]

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It's only a matter of time now.

SMITH: You put me in a cage, within a cage, why are you so afraid of me?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'm not.

SMITH: Yes you are, you *live* in your fear, that's your whole life.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You don't know anything about me.

SMITH: I know everything about you. You think the miracles I perform.. are the extent of my power.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You think you're god. You're a drone, a cataloger, chattel!

SMITH: What you're afraid of is.. *they'll* believe I'm God.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It doesn't matter, most of them have ceased to believe in God.

SMITH: Why?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Because God presents them with no miracles to earn their faith.

SMITH: You think when men ceases to believe in miracles, he rejects God?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Of course.

SMITH: You rule over them in God's name.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: They don't believe in him but they still fear him. They're afraid not to because they're afraid of freedom.

SMITH: And you give them happiness.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: We appease their conscience, anyone who can appease a man's conscience can take his freedom away from him. [looks down as he steps on one of his cigarette, he looks up]

SMITH [who has taken the form of Bill Mulder]: And if you can't appease their conscience, you kill 'em but you can't kill em all. You can't kill their love, which is what makes them who they are, makes them better than us, better than you.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You talk, I'm not one of you.

SMITH: No. All you want is to be part of it, is to be one of the commandants, when the process begins. [morphs back to himself] But you are wrong.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Oh, am I?

SMITH: Yes, you are dying of lung cancer.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It's a lie.

SMITH: You think it's a lie?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You wanna save your life.

SMITH: And you?



SCENE 17

[the beard man is just outside the prison now, morphs into the alien hitman]
[camera rolls down to his hand, he's got his weapon]

[he's in the prison facility now, a guard lets him in, and walks him to cell B18... the hitman makes a face, the cell is empty]



SCENE 18
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

[Mrs Mulder is lying on a bed]

DOCTOR: We have been helpful but there was susbstancial blood loss during the stroke event, which has put a lot of pressure on the brain.

MULDER: Will she regain consciousness?

DOCTOR: I know it's hard, but she may not. I can be paged if you need me. [leaving]

MULDER: Thank you.

[Mulder shuts the door]
[he sits at his mother's bed side, and starts to cry. He takes her hand and puts it on his face.. he's crying and put his head on the bed]

Mulder gets out of the room and closes the door: 128]
[Mulder sees the Cigarette-Smoking Man, and runs over him, shoves him against the wall, stick his gun on his face]

MULDER: You wanna smoke that, or do you wanna smoke on this?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Are you giving me a choice?
[Mulder takes the cigarette and throws it]

MULDER: I should shoot you right here, but they probably would be able to save you.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Do it, do it Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Or maybe shoot a bullet through your brain so you'd be bedridden on a bed for the rest of your life.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: How is she?

MULDER: What do you care?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I've known your mother since before you were born, Fox.

MULDER: I don't care.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I've gone to see her recently.

MULDER: And I know what you are looking for.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I wasn't looking for anything. It's what she was looking for actually. She contacted me.

MULDER: Liar!

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I had information, possibly..on the whereabouts of your sister.

[nurse comes in the hallway, forces Mulder to release Cancer Man and to put his gun down]

MULDER: Where is she? Where is she?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: It seems the..the man who has the information has disappeared.

MULDER: I have what you want.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: There's nothing I want Agent Mulder, except to see how your mother's doing.
[goes to a nurse in the background, we hear "how's Mrs Mulder"]



SCENE 19

Close up on mulder's phone: no service, it's off-line]
[Mulder is sitting in his car in a parking lot]
[sees something and gets out]
[as he's walking]

X [from behind, as usual]: Do you have it? Do you have it?

MULDER: Yes.

X: Give it to me.

MULDER: I can't do that.

X: It's of no value to you.

MULDER: And to you?

X: When the time comes, when the truth is finally determined, its value will soar.

MULDER: Why?

X: I think you know why Agent Mulder.

MULDER: It's a weapon, isn't it? Used to pierce the back of a neck. It's the only way we can kill them.

X: A simple gunshot won't do.

MULDER: Why do you want it ?

X: They will kill you for it Agent Mulder, that's a fact. They'll stop at nothing for it, nothing. If they have to martyr you at risk of turning your work into a crusade.

MULDER: Let me get clear on something here, what we're talking about is colonization. The date is set, isn't it?

X: Give me the weapon Agent Mulder.

MULDER: No. [walks away]

X punches mulder and they get into a fist fight, pretty nasty, Mulder bleeds, they finally both reach for their guns and are holding each other at gun point]

MULDER: You shoot me and you'll never find it.

X: I oughtta shoot you anyway after everything I've given you.

MULDER: I'm walking, away.

X: You're a dead man Agent Mulder. One way, or the other.

[Mulder leaves]



SCENE 21
SCULLY IS BACK HOME
1:12AM

[she switches on a lamp and begins to dial a number] [knock on door]

SCULLY: Who is it?

SMITH: Jeremiah Smith. Please let me in.

SCULLY [she reaches for her gun, and slowly approaches the door, it's him alright] I want you to put your hands up where I can see them. [he does it] Ok, I want you to keep your hands up, I'm gonna unlock the door. I want you to count to 5, come in, close the door and lock it behind you. [she unlocks delicately and gets back, away from the door]

[Smith enters, the lights are off]

SCULLY: Keep your hands up please.

SMITH: I have important information for you, something your partner has been seeking. It concerns an elaborate plan, a project, and his sister.

SCULLY: Why didn't you tell me before?

SMITH: I've never spoken to you before, the man you spoke to was an impostor, he was sent here to kill me.

SCULLY: Who are you?

SMITH: I'll explain everything.

[phone rings, she answers]

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Scully it's me.

SCULLY: Mulder where are you?

MULDER: I've been up with my mother, listen to me.

SCULLY: Mulder listen to me, there's somebody here, somebody you need to talk to.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Jeremiah Smith.

MULDER: Alright Scully, you gotta get out of your apartment, they're gonna be looking for him, I want you to meet me.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: Off the I-95, uh Bond Mill Road.



SCENE 22
EXTERIOR, NIGHT, CAR ARRIVES AND STOPS
SCULLY AND SMITH GET OUT OF THE CAR

MULDER: Scully! Scully move away from him, come stand behind me.

SMITH: I've come to you at great risk, I mean you no harm. [Mulder holds the alien weapon] I have a long and complicated story to tell you.

SCULLY: Mulder, he knows about your sister.

MULDER: How do I know you're for real?

SMITH: I was at that restaurant, I healed those people.

SCULLY: But how?

SMITH: I can explain everything to you.

MULDER: First I want you to come somewhere with me. I want you to come with me to see my mother.

[another car arrives, it's the alien hitman] [he's approaching]

SMITH: He's here to kill me.

[Close up on Mulder]

[Fade to black]

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                             HERRENVOLK



SCENE 1
CANADA

(A van pulls up to a pole in the middle of nowhere. The repairman gets out of his van and attaches two special additions to his boots, two spikes on the insides. He then clips a strap onto a clamp on one side of him, then throws the strap around the tree and clamps it on the other side. Digging the spikes into the wood, he makes his way up the pole, using the strap for support. He opens up the box on top and starts using a screwdriver when a bee approaches him. He goes to swat it away, but it comes back. He tries to swat it again.)

REPAIRMAN: Get away.

(The bee lands on his neck and stings him.)

Oh, damn it!

(He smacks the bee and it falls down to the ground, laying on its back and buzzing wildly. Five boys walk up to the pole. Five identical boys. The repairman acknowledges their presence but doesn't look directly at them.)

A bee stung me, ay?

(He looks at them and sees that they are identical.)

Well, now... don't you all take the cake?

(He chuckles.)

Does your mom ever mix you up?

(The boys don't answer. He laughs to himself, then gets cottonmouth, He starts to gag and choke, clutching his throat. The boys step back as the man shakes violently, jarring loose the spikes and straps. He falls, screaming, then rolls over on his back. The boys walk over to him as his last breath escapes him. One of the boys nudges his head with his foot, then the boys head back in the direction that they came from.)



SCENE 2
BOND MILL ROAD; RURAL MARYLAND

(Jeremiah Smith walks towards Mulder, followed by Scully.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: I've come to you at great risk... I mean you no harm.

(Mulder aims his gun nonetheless.)

SCULLY: Mulder, he knows about your sister.

MULDER: How do I know you're for real?

JEREMIAH SMITH: I can explain everything to you.

MULDER: First I want you to come somewhere with me. I want you to come with me to see my mother.

(Smith nods. A bright light shines upon them and they look over to see headlights quickly approaching. The car stops as Mulder and Smith look at each other. The bounty hunter steps out of his car and draws the blade out of his icepick. Smith turns and runs.)

MULDER: Stay out of his way, Scully, he doesn't want to hurt you. You can't use your gun!

(Mulder runs after Smith. Scully aims her gun at their attacker.)

SCULLY: Stop right there, sir!

(The bounty hunter runs towards her and slams into her, knocking her down. She groans as the bounty hunter continues along his way. Everybody is searching for everybody now. Mulder sees Smith run up a flight of stairs and follows. The bounty hunter enters the building next and runs up the stairs. Mulder catches a quick flash of Smith in a level above him. The bounty hunter seems instinctively drawn to his prey. Scully looks to be completely lost. The bounty hunter runs a level under Smith and, seeing his chance, jumps up a ladder and grabs Smith's foot from the lower level, but Smith wrestles free and keeps running. As the bounty hunter jumps down from his short perch, Mulder runs in. The two stare at each other tensely for a few moments, waiting for the other to do something. They turn in the opposite direction from each other and start to run for their objectives. Smith, nervously, looks around and finds an exit door on the roof. As Scully continues to search, the bounty hunter finds the exit door. Smith comes to the end of the roof and looks back to see the Bounty Hunter quickly approaching. Faced with no other choice, he jumps down to the ground. Mulder runs out to see Smith on the floor across the way from him. He runs over and helps him up.)

MULDER: Come on.

(As they start to run, the bounty hunter jumps down and lands on his feet. Slowly stalking them, he walks after them but is stopped when Mulder locks the door behind him. The bounty hunter tries the handle, but to no avail. Mulder runs down a flight of stairs, Smith close behind. Scully looks up at them from a lower level as they run by.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully, get the car!

(She runs off to do so. Mulder and Smith continue to run.)

This way.

(They run down a flight of stairs. Scully gets in the car and the tires screech as she speeds towards the entrance. Before she can reach it, however, the bounty hunter jumps down onto the hood. Scully stares at him for a second before pressing down on the horn. The bounty hunter starts to climb off the hood. Mulder and Smith hear the noise inside.)

Damn.

(After looking out the window, they start in the other direction as the horn stops.)

This way.

(Hurrying down a steel walkway, the bounty hunter runs inside and up a flight of stairs after them. The door closes outside and he walks over to a window. Rubbing off the fog, he sees Mulder and Smith start towards a pile of wood chips. The bounty hunter runs up the pile of wood chips and looks down into the harbor below. Mulder slides out of the wood chips, having hidden himself in them. He clicks the button on the icepick and the blade shoots out. With a grunt, he jams the weapon into the back of the bounty hunter's neck. The bounty hunter winces in pain, as does Mulder from the fumes. The assassin rolls down the hill, apparently dead. Green ooze typical of his species leaks from the wound. Mulder picks up the assassin's stiletto and slides down the other side of the wood pile towards the harbor. There, Smith starts up a motorboat and starts off.)

MULDER: Hey! Jeremiah!

(He runs down the dock towards him.)

Jeremiah, stop! What are you doing?

JEREMIAH SMITH: There'll be more right behind him!

MULDER: You can't leave here!

JEREMIAH SMITH: They'll kill me!

MULDER: I need your help!

(Smith stares at him.)

My mother is dying!

(The green bubbling liquid on the back of the bounty hunter's neck dissipates as the wound closes. Scully runs towards the wood chips.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!

(She walks tentatively around the body of the bounty hunter as she walks up to the top of the wood pile to see Mulder and Smith speeding off in the motorboat. She screams at the top of her lungs.)

Mulder! Mulder!

(Getting no response, she turns around and looks down at the body. She leans over and pulls open one eyelid to check for a sign of life. Much to her regret, the bounty hunter grabs her by the throat and starts to crush the life out of her. He forces her down as he sits up. She gags and chokes.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Where are they going?

SCULLY: Uh... I don't know...

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: I need to know.

SCULLY: Please, I don't know.

(With a grunt, he rips the stiletto out of his neck. Looking down upon Scully, he releases his death grip. Down the river, Mulder and Smith tie the boat to a wood dock and get out.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: They know where to find us. They'll be waiting for us.

MULDER: Who?

JEREMIAH SMITH: Your government men. They'll be waiting at the hospital with your mother.

MULDER: What can they do? We're working in the light. They, they can't stop us without exposure, without consequence.

JEREMIAH SMITH: You have to understand something. I must perish. Whatever the consequences to that end, they are incalculable to the preservation of the larger plan.

MULDER: The larger plan?

(Smith stares at him.)

You mean colonization.

JEREMIAH SMITH: Hegemony, Mister Mulder. A new origin of species.

MULDER: I don't understand...

JEREMIAH SMITH: I can show you.

MULDER: My mother is dying. I need to take you to see her right now.

JEREMIAH SMITH: And if they are waiting for us? If they're willing to kill me and then face the consequence of their actions and stand before your ineffectual justice system, I will be dead. I won't be able to save your mother. The work will go on. The plan will continue to be executed. Or you can stop it.

MULDER: How can I stop it?

JEREMIAH SMITH: I can take you to a place, show you the work in progress, where you can see...

MULDER: No, look, there's no time!

JEREMIAH SMITH: Where you can see your sister!

(Mulder stares at him, aghast.)

SCENE 3
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND; 4:55 AM

(Mrs. Mulder is hooked up to a respirator. The Cigarette-Smoking Man lets go of her hand as the Elder walks in.)

ELDER: He isn't coming.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I told you.

ELDER: Then where is he?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I don't know. Certainly, he anticipated we'd be here, waiting.

(The bathroom door opens and the Gray-Haired Man walks in. The Elder closes the door.)

ELDER: Unless we have a security leak.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Who?

ELDER: I've come in receipt of some pictures... of your visit to Mrs. Mulder's summer house.

(He hands Cancer Man a picture of him and Mrs. Mulder fighting on the porch.)

Were you aware you were being photographed?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: By whom?

ELDER: I believe that can be determined by a simple planting of information... to see where that information flows.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What information?

ELDER: That Mrs. Mulder's life is in danger... that left unprotected... she may come to an unnatural end.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks down at Mrs. Mulder with sorrow.)



SCENE
7:05 AM

(Scully sits in her car next to the plant. The sun shines brightly. Her phone rings.)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: Scully, it's me.

(Cut to Mulder, driving with Smith.)

Where are you?

SCULLY: I'm right where you left me, Mulder.

(Cut to Scully.)

I'm sitting here in my car.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: Because you wouldn't answer your phone and because I didn't know what else to do.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Are you okay, Scully?

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yes, I'm fine.

(She seems very tense. Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Listen to me, there's going to be... there's going to be people looking for me. They're going to think they can get to me through you.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: No, no, no, hold on, just, just listen for a second, Scully. I need you to do something for me. I had to steal a car from an airport in Alberta.

(The bounty hunter, sitting behind Scully, places his hand on her shoulder and draws the extended icepick near to her head.)

There's going to be a record of me going through Canadian customs and I need you to cover my tracks.

(Cut to Mulder.)

I also need you to know that I'm okay, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully.)

I'm fine. Okay?

(The bounty hunter gets out of the car and goes to his, which is next to Scully's.)

SCULLY: Mulder, he's coming after you.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: The man you left for dead.

(Cut to Mulder.)

He's alive.

(Mulder and Smith look at each other. Later, Smith and Mulder drive down a dirt road until the car comes to a sudden halt.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: That's it for the gas.

(They get out of the car.)

MULDER: How much further from here?

JEREMIAH SMITH: About twenty miles. Maybe half that... on foot over those hills.

(He points to some hills.)

MULDER: Let's go.

(They start walking.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is looking at papers with his secretary at her desk when Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: Sir.

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I heard that you were looking for me.

SKINNER: There's been some concern about you and Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: We're fine, sir. We've been searching for this man, Jeremiah Smith.

SKINNER: Did you find him?

SCULLY: No.

(Skinner stares at her, half-believing her.)

SKINNER: I received a memo from you that there's more confusion about this man... that the Social Security administration has five men with this name working in branch offices around the country... with identical photo I.D.s. I ran a check on these men. All five have not reported to work in three days. Now, would you or Agent Mulder like to let me in on what it is your suspicions are?

SCULLY: I'm afraid we haven't exactly formulated any clear suspicions, sir.

SKINNER: Well, we have, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Sir?



SCENE 5
SCI-CRIME LAB; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Pendrell sits at his computer, typing. Skinner and Scully stand behind him.)

PENDRELL: We were able to download the hard drive data from each of the five missing men's social security workstations, and in each case, we found an enormous amount of files and data that cannot be identified. Do not correspond with any kind of accounting or document collection done as normal departmental business.

(He brings up a seemingly infinite list of numbers and letters.)

The data was all locked in password files.

SCULLY: How much of it is there?

PENDRELL: Enough to fill seven ten-gigabyte hard drives, roughly, uh, a billion entries.

(Scully looks at him in shock.)

SKINNER: It appears to be some kind of personal record-keeping or accounting.

(The file on the monitor scrolls down the list.)

SCULLY: Could it be some kind of cryptograph?

PENDRELL: If it is, I can't crack it.

SCULLY: I'd like to get a copy of a portion of this. I might be able to figure it out.

(Pendrell types a few keys and the printer gears up.)

PENDRELL: Seriously?

SCULLY: Maybe. There's somebody I want to run it by.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: No. I think, sir, this is more along my field of expertise.

(She takes the paper out of the printer and walks out.)



SCENE 6
CANADA

(Mulder and Smith trod through the grass fields. Seeing a body by a large pole, they run over to find the dead repairman covered in maggots. Other than that, the scene has been untouched.)

MULDER: What happened to this man?

JEREMIAH SMITH: I wouldn't touch the body, Mister Mulder.

(Mulder leans down and looks over the body as Smith goes to the open back doors of the truck. Mulder pulls out a pink piece of paper from the body's pocket.)

MULDER: There's a work order here. It's for yesterday. He's only been here a little more than twenty-four hours.

(Smith walks over to him.)

You know what killed him, don't you?

JEREMIAH SMITH: It's not much further.

(Smith starts to walk again. Mulder reluctantly follows. Walking up a hill, they see giant black sheets covering miles of earth.)

You're looking at the future, Mister Mulder.

MULDER: What is it?

JEREMIAH SMITH: A flowering shrub. But it's specific epithet can't be found in any of your taxonomic charts.

(He hands Mulder a pair of binoculars, which Mulder looks through.)

MULDER: Being grown for what?

JEREMIAH SMITH: Pollen.

(Mulder sees a boy, the same kind as the ones that watched the repairman die, and a girl walking, each carrying buckets. Mulder immediately recognizes the girl.)

MULDER: What is this? What's going on here?

JEREMIAH SMITH: What did I tell you, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: That looks just like my sister.

(He looks through the binoculars again.)

But that's not possible. She's no older than the day she was taken.

(They start down the hill.)

Samantha?

(Bees buzz in the flowers beneath the sheets.)

Samantha! Samantha?

(The boy and the girl turn around to see Mulder running towards them.)

Samantha? Samantha?

(Reaching his sister, he gets down on his knees and puts his hands on her arms.)

Samantha, it's me. It's me, Fox, your brother.

(She shows no response. Smith runs up to them.)

Do you remember me?

(Mulder looks back at Smith.)

What's wrong with her?

JEREMIAH SMITH: She has no language.

MULDER: What do you mean?

JEREMIAH SMITH: She's a drone, Mister Mulder. A worker.

(Samantha glances up at Smith, then stares back at Mulder.)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

JEREMIAH SMITH: There's more you should see so that you might understand.

(The four of them walk along a dirt road in a beautiful, almost picture-esque area to a collective small farm town. The boy and girl leave their buckets on the front steps to their green house as they walk inside.)

MULDER: How'd they get here?

JEREMIAH SMITH: They're stationed here. They're part of an agrarian work force.

(Mulder looks around.)

MULDER: Who takes care of them?

JEREMIAH SMITH: They take care of themselves. Parenting is unnecessary... a needless division of energy.

(Almost all simultaneously, many boys and girls come out of their homes and look at the two newcomers, each wearing different clones. Mulder looks around in slight horror.)

MULDER: They're clones.

JEREMIAH SMITH: Serial ovotypes. Have you seen enough, Mister Mulder? We can't stay around here much longer.

(Mulder looks to be more confused than anything else.)

I'll go see if I can find some gas.

(He walks off. Mulder looks at the original pair.)



SCENE 7
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully walks in and immediately tapes an "X" to Mulder's window then looks at her watch. Time passes as she sits, waiting, going over the list. There is a knock on the door. She picks up her gun out of the holster and goes to the door, listening.)

X: Open the door, Agent Scully.

(She unlocks it and X, looking around, walks in and goes to the main room.)

SCULLY: How did you know I was here?

X: I've been trying to reach Agent Mulder. I watched you enter the building. Where is he?

(She walks over to him.)

SCULLY: I don't know.

X: I have information for him. A matter that would concern him greatly.

SCULLY: Concern him how?

X: Concerning his mother.

SCULLY: Has something happened to her?

X: No. No, not yet.

SCULLY: Is she in danger?

X: I prefer to speak with Agent Mulder directly. Let me just say she is unprotected.

SCULLY: From whom?

(He walks past her, but she grabs his arm and spins him around to face her.)

From whom?

X: If you want to involve yourself, Agent Scully, you might do well to give this information to your partner.

SCULLY: Not until you give me some information first.

(X glares at her. Scully picks up the list and brings it over to him.)

These are data entries taken from social security records...

X: You're going in the wrong direction, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: All beginning with the letters S-E-P. You know what these are. Confirm or deny.

X: Smallpox eradication program.

SCULLY: Smallpox?

X: Don't unlock doors you're not prepared to go through, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: What's that supposed to mean?

X: Leave it alone. Protect the mother.

(He walks out.)



SCENE 8
PLANTATION; CANADA

(Smith starts back with a can of gasoline. He sees Mulder walking with a Samantha.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: What are you doing?

MULDER: She's coming with us.

JEREMIAH SMITH: You can't do this. She's not your sister.

MULDER: Well, then who is she?

JEREMIAH SMITH: You have a chance here to understand something so much greater, to comprehend it, to expose it.

MULDER: Well, then explain it to me. Explain it to me now!

(Tires squeal as the bounty hunter races down the dirt path. Mulder and his compatriots start to run. The bounty hunter pulls onto the road, giving chase. Mulder, Samantha and Smith run through the grass fields until they stop, looking for a place to hide. Samantha runs off towards a building and the men follow. Samantha looks back at them, then pulls open a door to reveal a beehive.)

Bees.

JEREMIAH SMITH: It's an apiary.

MULDER: Are bees what killed that man we found?

JEREMIAH SMITH: Yes.

MULDER: It's probably not a good idea to hide in there.

JEREMIAH SMITH: No, you have no immunity to them.

MULDER: But you do?

(Smith looks back in the direction that they came from, then at Mulder. Mulder takes the gas can out of Smith's hand and douses himself with it, covering himself in gasoline. He groans and holds his eyes.)

Somebody lead me, I can't see anything.

(Smith takes the can and Samantha and Smith both take his hand. Together, they walk into the beehive as Mulder breathes heavily, the gasoline burning his eyes. Bees are flying everywhere, giant honeycombs dangling from the ceiling. Recovering, he looks around the room and sees a staircase.)

Is that the only way out?

(Samantha looks up to see a small hole in the ceiling, the only other way of egress. They all look up at it.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: We've walked into our own trap.

(The bounty hunter drives up to the beehive building and gets out. Hurrying down the stairs, his targets are nowhere to be found. He kicks the gasoline can on the ground lightly as the bees swarm around him, one landing on the tip of his icepick as he arms it. He looks at a honeycomb and sees a hole, but cannot prevent it from tumbling over on top of him. He grunts as it lands and Smith and the Mulders race out from behind the honeycomb and over to the stairs.)

MULDER: Come on!

(The bees are furious and swarm around the bounty hunter, stinging him crazily as the Mulders and Smith watch. The bounty hunter screams as he desperately tries to swat off the bugs. He gasps as he slowly falls.)



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Pendrell is sitting at his desk, reading, when Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: Are you busy, Agent Pendrell?

(Pendrell is surprised by Scully.)

PENDRELL: No, I was just, uh...

(He straightens his tie as Scully closes the door.)

SCULLY: Good, because I think I've made some headway on this data. Can you call up the files?

PENDRELL: Yeah. I got to tell you, I've gotten nowhere.

(The files are called up. Scully points at the letters "SEP.")

SCULLY: "SEP." Smallpox Eradication Program.

PENDRELL: Smallpox? How'd you figure that?

SCULLY: I got lucky, but the key is in this first string of letters.

(She points to the scrolling lines of letters on the screen.)

PENDRELL: Twenty-letter strings. Thirty different variations.

SCULLY: You say "a twenty-letter code" to any scientist, and they immediately think "protein amino acid sequence..." which is what this turned out to be.

PENDRELL: Protein sequence for what?

(She starts to type.)

SCULLY: Cowpox virus... the virus used to inoculate humans against smallpox.

PENDRELL: Okay, right. These guys were keeping records of smallpox inoculations. Why?

SCULLY: I haven't worked that out yet, but the big question is this second alphanumeric string.

(She points to a scrolling list of numbers and letters.)

Fifteen digits.

PENDRELL: Yeah, I checked. Each one is different... an infinite number of variations.

SCULLY: An inventory.

PENDRELL: Of what?

SCULLY: Of us.

(She takes off her jacket to reveal a patch on her arm where blood was taken.)



SCENE 10
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR WALTER SKINNER'S OFFICE; FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(A clear diagram is up on a light wall of a large glowing blue mass against a dark blue background with small white dots. The second senior agent is standing. Skinner, a woman, the senior FBI agent and another man are sitting. Scully is standing by the slide.)

SECOND SENIOR AGENT: With all due respect, Agent Scully... it looks like something from the Hubble telescope.

SCULLY: Actually, it's an image created by what's called a confocal microscope. You're looking at a three-dimensional picture of the location of a protein. In this case, cowpox structural protein number six. It's one of the inoculants used in smallpox vaccines.

SENIOR FBI AGENT: Where'd it come from?

SCULLY: From me. I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox vaccination scar on my upper arm. Through a process called immunohisto chemical staining and through the addition of an antibody for the cowpox virus six, I was able to get this picture of the location of a protein... a single, non-random, protein pattern.

SKINNER: I'm not a scientist, Agent Scully, and I don't know that many people in this room...

SCULLY: What I'm saying is that I think this protein is a tag... some kind of genetic marker that was applied to me when I was inoculated against smallpox as a child.

SENIOR FBI AGENT: Why you?

SCULLY: Not just me... all of us... quite possibly anybody who's been inoculated over the past fifty years.

(The group murmurs.)

SECOND SENIOR AGENT: Agent Scully... frankly, this sounds like something we would might have expected from Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: I had my doubts... and I'm still not certain. But I performed the same procedure on Agent Pendrell.

(Pendrell, who is standing more off to the side, hands Scully another see-through diagram, which Scully posts.)

The location of the protein from his biopsy should be identical to mine, but it's slightly different, which might correspond to the alphanumeric entries collected by the men at the, uh, social security administration.

SKINNER: So what you're saying, Agent Scully, is we're being tagged, catalogued and inventoried? By who?

SCULLY: I don't know, but it would have to be a government agency.

SENIOR FBI AGENT: And to what purpose?

SCULLY: I don't know that either, and I think the only man who might be able to give us that information is Jeremiah Smith.

(Skinner stands and sighs.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, can I see you outside for a moment? Alone.

(They walk out of the office and into the outer room.)

Do you realize what you're promoting in there? You're rounding these people up  in the middle of the work day to imply that there's...

SCULLY: I am a scientist, sir. What I'm promoting in there is reductive evidence. It's the reason I believe I was assigned to the X-Files in the first place, is it not? To put Agent Mulder's work to the test of science?

(Scully's cellular phone rings. She takes it out.)

Excuse me.

(She presses a button. It beeps as she raises it to her ear.)

Scully.

(Cut to a phone booth on the beehive farm, where Mulder is on the phone. Jeremiah is in the passenger's seat, Samantha is in the back seat.)

MULDER: Scully, where are you right now?

(Cut to Scully. She turns around.)

SCULLY: I'm in Skinner's office, where are you?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm still in Canada, but I'm catching a plane soon. I need you to meet me on the other end.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Just tell me where.

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: At the hospital where my mother is.

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't...

(Mulder looks at his passengers.)

MULDER: Her life depends upon me and my party getting there safely.

SCULLY: Who?

(Cut to Scully.)

MULDER: Jeremiah Smith... and someone else.

(Scully looks at Skinner. Cut to Mulder.)

I'm going to need some protection, Scully.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: Oh, believe me, Mulder, you're going to have it.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: There's a lot of people who want to talk to Jeremiah Smith.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: They'll get their chance.

(He looks at Smith. In the distance, tires screech. They look behind them to see the bounty hunter racing towards them in the cable van. As the alien aims for the phone booth, Mulder gasps and jumps out. The phone booth shatters as the assassin collides with it and hits the front of the car. Mulder, hurt slightly, is picked up by the bounty hunter and groans. The bounty hunter has bee stings over most of his face and hands.)

MULDER: Please, you can't kill him...he can't die.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: He must.

MULDER: That girl is my sister.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: He shows you pieces, but tells you nothing of the whole... because he's inconsequential... a traitor to the project.

(Smith gets out of the car and starts to limp away, having been hurt in the crash.)

MULDER: Kill me, let them go.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: You'd trade your life for his?

MULDER: For my mother's.

(The bounty hunter nods slightly. They stare at each other, Mulder seeming very off.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Everything dies.

(As Smith limps away, the bounty hunter raises Mulder over his head and throws him into the back of the cable van. Mulder starts to drift into unconsciousness as the Bounty Hunter picks up his stiletto. Samantha looks at Smith limping off, then at the bounty hunter. As Mulder blacks out, he sees the bounty hunter stepping over him and hears Samantha scream.)



SCENE 11
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

(Skinner walks away from an agent and looks inside Mrs. Mulder's room. Scully looks back and walks out, shutting the door. Agents and the hospital staff are also present.)

SKINNER: Five hours we're out here swinging in the wind, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Something's wrong. Something happened.

SKINNER: You don't have any way of getting hold of him?

(A nurse walks up to them.)

NURSE: This is beginning to seriously compromise our ability to treat patients.

(Scully nods, Skinner sighs. Agents start to murmur louder as Mulder walks down the hallway towards them.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God... Mulder...

(She runs over to him.)

MULDER: I can't... there's nothing.

(Scully walks with him, hand on his shoulder, concerned. Skinner looks on, concerned as well.)

SCULLY: Oh, dear... no... he's freezing. He's in, you're in shock, Mulder.

SKINNER: What happened?

(Mulder walks past him into his mother's hospital room and stands over her. Scully walks over beside him. Skinner stands in the doorway.)

MULDER: She'll never know.

(Scully drapes a blanket over his shoulder. Skinner, sensing the severity of the moment, walks away.)

She'll never know...

(He starts to cry. Scully holds him as he cries into her shoulder.)



SCENE 12
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The "X" on Mulder's window still is evident in the night. A man walks around inside of Mulder's apartment. X knocks on the door and it swings open. Realizing what is happening, he slowly backs out of the doorway and heads for the elevator, looking behind him every few feet. He presses the button, staring behind him. As he reaches for his gun, the door opens. He turns around to see the Gray-Haired Man waiting for him. The bullet races out of the chamber, hitting X in the stomach. X drops to the ground, gagging and groaning. The shadow of the man inside Mulder's apartment brushes over him and into the elevator as X writhes in pain slightly on the ground.)



SCENE 13
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

(Mulder and Scully sit at Mrs. Mulder's bedside.)

MULDER: I could have saved her, Scully.

SCULLY: As long as she's lying here, you can't give up on her. I don't care what the doctors say.

(He sighs.)

MULDER: I had one chance... and I let it slip away.

SCULLY: We don't know that, Mulder. You can't blame yourself for what you could only hope.

MULDER: He took me to a place with green fields. And I saw my sister. She was just a little girl. I've seen too many things not to believe.

SCULLY: I've seen things too. But there are answers to be found now. We have hope that there's a place to start. That's what I believe.

MULDER: You put such faith in your science, Scully. But... the things I've seen, science provides no place to start.

SCULLY: Nothing happens in contradiction to nature, only in contradiction to what we know of it. And that's a place to start. That's where the hope is.

(Mulder stares at his mother, then shakes his head.)

MULDER: I feel like I came so close.

SCULLY: I feel it too. I know it.

MULDER: How?

SCULLY: I was warned...

(Cut to the hallway near Mulder's apartment. X drags himself along the floor towards Mulder's apartment on his stomach, leaving a wide trail of blood as he slides. Scully speaks over the scene.)

By a man we both know... who I believe knows the truth... who can lead us to a place to start.

(X finally reaches Mulder's apartment, gasping and grunting. He pulls himself in front of the door and starts to write something out in blood as he chokes on his dying breaths. Finishing, his body goes limp, his eyes dead. X dies in front of Mulder's apartment, leaving a message in blood. "SRSG.")



SCENE 14
UNITED NATIONS BUILDING; NEW YORK CITY; ONE MONTH LATER

(The door is marked "Special Representative to the Secretary General." Marita Covarrubias opens it and walks into the room. Mulder looks up at her.)

COVARRUBIAS: Mister Mulder. My name is Marita Covarrubias. I'm the assistant to the Special Representative.

(She walks over to him and they shake hands.)

MULDER: Hi, was he able to review the material that I sent him?

COVARRUBIAS: Yes.

MULDER: And will he see me?

COVARRUBIAS: I'm afraid he's been called into something important.

(Mulder nods, frustrated.)

Can I ask who sent you here, Mister Mulder?

MULDER: A friend. You know, I've been inquiring with each of the special representatives all month about the farmland in Canada. I've been trying to get some answers and all I've gotten are dead ends.

COVARRUBIAS: Well, I can tell you that farm has been abandoned. The crops you described were left to die, but they have been identified as ginseng. No evidence of beehives or bee husbandry was found.

(Covarrubias seems concerned of Mulder.)

I know it's not the answer you wanted.

(Mulder shakes his head.)

No, I, uh...

COVARRUBIAS: Can I ask why this is so important to you?

MULDER: I've suffered... I've suffered some very personal... losses recently, and... I was... I was hoping...

(He straightens up, trying to reform his resolve.)

That, um...

(She hands him a folder and he nods. He opens the folder to find pictures of the young boys and girls of the beehive farm in Canada toiling over the crops. He looks back at her.)

COVARRUBIAS: Not everything dies, Mister Mulder.

(Mulder stares at her, wondering about her allegiances.)



SCENE 15
PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND

(The alien bounty hunter walks down the hallway, dressed in a black suit and tie. He opens the door to Mrs. Mulder's room and walks over to the bed, looking at the respirator. He looks over to the Cigarette-Smoking Man on the other side of the bed.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: I need to know the reasons why this should be.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: So that the work may continue.

(He takes a few steps over to the bed.)

So that the project may proceed unabated by removing an unnecessary obstacle.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: What obstacle?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Agent Mulder, actually.

(He fiddles around with the unlit cigarette between his fingers, looking down at Mrs. Mulder.)

If his mother were to die, he would...

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: He what?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You see... the fiercest enemy is the man who has nothing left to lose.

(They stare at each other.)

And we both know how valuable Agent Mulder is to the equation.

(The bounty hunter nods slightly, then closes the door. After them mentally preparing for the upcoming task, the Cigarette-Smoking Man tenses up as his cohort places his hand on Mrs. Mulder's forehead. The bounty hunter closes his eyes and Mrs. Mulder's begin to flutter open, slowly. She looks over to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who is transfixed on her.)

SCENE 1
PEACOCK RESIDENCE

(It is a dark and stormy night. The rain is hitting hard and the thunder and lightning crackle. The yard is an absolute mess, field hoes and barrels scattered. The grass only grows in patches. The house looks no better. A woman screams in labor pains. The room is very dark, and we can barely make out a man standing between her legs, preparing to take the baby. Another man stands over her. She pants and groans in pain. The second man, long-haired George Peacock, hands the other man, bald-headed Edmund Peacock, a fork. There is a splattering sound and a baby starts to cry. George takes a pair of scissors and cuts the umbilical cord. The woman groans in pain, smiling slightly. The baby is taken outside by George, Edmund, and their brother Sherman. One can barely make out that the boys don't look quite right. They are deformed grotesquely, their skin a wrinkly gray. They walk out into the next field, George carrying a shovel. He starts to dig as the baby cries. Edmund stands off to the side. Sherman lowers the baby, wrapped in a cloth, into the hole. Edmund starts to cry as George starts to cover the baby. Edmund moans, Sherman consoling him. Dirt is thrown onto the baby, but George hesitates before completely covering the baby. The three brothers stand out in the rain. Edmund's moans are just as loud as the thunder.)

SCENE 2
HOME...

(A young boy throws down home plate and readies his stance. The catcher crouches behind it.)
HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

BATTER: All right, let's play some ball.

CATCHER: Swing it in here.

(The pitcher throws, the batter doesn't swing.)

Strike!

BATTER: In what league?

(The catcher throws it back.)

PITCHER: Hey, quit complaining. You know, we already had to move home plate 'cause you bitched about the mud.

BOY #1: Nice pitch!

CATCHER: Come on, let him hear some chin music!

(The batter, catcher and pitcher all ready their stances.)

BOY #1: Throw a fastball!

(The pitcher throws and the batter nails it.)

BOY #2: Whoa!

BOY #1: Nice hit!

BOY #2: Go get it!

(The ball sails over the fence and into the yard of the house belonging to the Peacocks. The right fielder watches it fly over.)

PITCHER: Hey, come on!

RIGHT FIELDER: It went on the Peacocks' property.

(All of the children hold their breath a little, none of them wanting to go out there.)

CATCHER: Here's another one!

(The catcher goes into his bag and pulls out a ball. The right fielder walks away from the fence, staring at the house.)

PITCHER: All right, come on, let's play!

BATTER: All right, come on...

CATCHER: Come on, baby, bring it home to Mamma.

(All three assume their stances. The batter kneels and scoops up some dirt, rubbing it on his hands to get a better hold.)

Put it there, put it there. Come on, right here.

(The batter stands and digs his foot into the dirt repeatedly, trying to get a good hold.)

Come on, baby, bring it home. Come on. Right here. That's it. Ease up.

(The pitcher checks the runners like a major league pitcher. The batter keeps digging his foot in and looks down. He's stepping in blood. He drops the bat and backs off.)

BOY #2: What are you doing?

(The catcher looks down and sees the blood. A small hand is sticking out of the mud. The pitcher throws the ball, but no one catches it. The catcher is walking backwards as well, away from the newfound body. Later, Mulder bends down and picks up the ball. He rolls it around, smells it, stands and pretends to pitch it. Scully, meanwhile, is doing real work, measuring the hole where the baby was taken from. She puts the tape measure away, writes it down, and stands. Mulder works on his grip, watching the Peacock brothers, who are watching them from the porch.)

SCULLY: Compression marks indicate the shovel blade to be approximately six and three-quarters inches. Uh, the angle of movement and deeper indentation on the right side of the mark suggests a left-handed individual.

(Mulder continues to throw the ball up in the air, barely paying attention.)

I've collected soil specimens and, uh, although numerous shoe impressions were made from the sandlot game, I think a, uh, a couple of dental stone casts will prove invaluable to the investigation.

(Scully watches as Mulder inspects the ball, then throws it up in the air.)

Meanwhile, I've quit the F.B.I. and become a spokesperson for the Ab-roller.

MULDER: Smell that.

(Scully smells the ball.)

It's perfume. Eau de ball. God, this brings back a lot of memories. My sister... all day pick-up games out on the vineyard, ride your bikes down to the beach, eat bologna sandwiches. Only place you had to be on time was home for dinner. Never had to lock your doors. No modems, no faxes, no cell phones.

(He continues to toss the ball around.)

SCULLY: Mulder, if you had to do without a cell phone for two minutes, you'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia.

(A pick-up truck drives up.)

MULDER: Scully, you don't know me as well as you think you do. You know, my work demands that I live in a big city, but if I had to settle down, build a home... be a place like this.

SCULLY: Be like living in Mayberry.

(A sheriff gets out of the truck.)

ANDY TAYLOR: Agents Mulder and Scully?

(Mulder nods to him. The sheriff walks under the yellow tape and shakes Scully's hand.)

Hi, I'm Sheriff Andy Taylor.

MULDER: For real?

(They shake hands.)

ANDY TAYLOR: Can't thank you or the bureau enough for coming out. It's just me and my deputy, and... hell, we never had anything of this nature.

SCULLY: Do you have any thoughts or, uh, suspects?

ANDY TAYLOR: Population of Home is only a few hundred. Everybody knows everybody, pretty much.

(Mulder watches the boys on the porch.)

SCULLY: Well, were there any local women who were pregnant and now suddenly aren't?

ANDY TAYLOR: No. I just saw Mary Ellen and Nancy. They're both doing fine.

MULDER: Hey, Sheriff, who lives in that house there?

(Mulder points to the Peacock residence. Taylor gives no response, staying silent for a while.)

Did you question them?

(Still no answer.)

'Cause they've been watching us the entire time.

ANDY TAYLOR: That farm belongs to the Peacock family. Three boys now. Well, men. Guess you could call them human. Their folks were in a bad car wreck and we suppose they died.

SCULLY: You suppose?

ANDY TAYLOR: Well, we tried to administer medical attention, but the boys hauled the bodies away. Took them home. They haven't been seen in ten years, so... we suppose they died.

SCULLY: Have you questioned the men?

ANDY TAYLOR: The Peacocks built that farm during the Civil War. It still has no electricity, no running water, no heat... they grow their own food, they raise their own pigs, the breed their own cows... raise and breed their own stock... if you get my meaning.

SCULLY: It is, however, the closest residence to the crime scene.

ANDY TAYLOR: Those boys are feeble, Agent Scully... and sad. They wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about.

SCULLY: Well, they could've witnessed...

ANDY TAYLOR: Look, this town is my home. I love it. It's quiet... peaceful. I don't even wear a gun.

(Mulder nods.)

I've seen and heard some of the sick and horrible things that go on outside my Home. At the same time, I knew we couldn't stay hidden forever... that one day, the modern world would find us and... my home town would change forever. And when I saw... it... in the ground... I knew that day had come. Now, I want to find whoever did this... but in doing so, I'd like it if the way things are around here didn't have to change. I know this is iffy bureau jurisdiction...

(Mulder nods again.)

...but I didn't know where else to turn. So I called the bureau in Pittsburgh, and when I described the victim... they said I should see you.

MULDER: Well, maybe we should take a look at the victim then.



SCENE 3
POLICE STATION; HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(The refrigerator door is pulled open, where the baby is sitting on a tray, a washcloth draped over it. Taylor pulls it out and walks over to Mulder and Scully.)

ANDY TAYLOR: We don't have a lab or a morgue. I've got a room down here, might be a bit cleaner.

(Taylor's deputy walks out from the back.)

By the way, this is my deputy, Barney.

MULDER: Fife?

BARNEY PASTOR: Pastor!

(He walks away angrily. The phone rings. Mulder, Scully and Taylor head into the washroom. It is highly cramped and the three barely fit as the tray is put down on the toilet.)

SCULLY: Uh, I could use a little more elbow room.

ANDY TAYLOR: Thing is, see, folks have been dropping in to ask about the case and I wouldn't want anybody to pop in and see this.

MULDER: Well, you could just lock your door to the office.

ANDY TAYLOR: Oh, folks know I never lock the door. They'd start rumors.

(He closes the door. Scully puts on rubber gloves and pulls up the covering, revealing the most deformed baby in history. Mulder gasps and looks away.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God... Mulder... it looks as if this child has been afflicted by every rare birth defect known to science. I mean, I, I'm going to have to order DNA typing from the crime lab, but... there appears to be abnormalities associated with Nev-Laxova Syndrome, Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, estrophy of the cloaca, I mean, I don't even know where to begin.

(It still has some dirt on it and is bright pink, almost red. There appears to be some branch-offs. It's face is distorted. It's legs are bent horribly out of shape.)

MULDER: I guess we can rule out murder as the cause of death, huh?

SCULLY: Well, I don't know about that.

(She pulls out some tweezers and probes the baby's mouth with them.)

There's evidence of occlusion due to dirt in the nose and mouth... indicating the dirt has been inhaled.

MULDER: There's something rotten in Mayberry.

(They walk outside. A baby is crying as it is pushed by in a stroller.)

SCULLY: Imagine all a woman's hopes and dreams for her child and then nature turns so cruel. What must a mother go through?

MULDER: Apparently not much in this case if she just threw it out with the trash.

(They sit on a bench.)

SCULLY: I, I guess I was just projecting on myself.

MULDER: Why, is there a history of genetic abnormalities in your family?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Well, just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic make-up and a really high tolerance for being second-guessed and start pumping out the little Uber-Scullies.

(She smiles. He rubs her back a little.)

SCULLY: What about your family?

MULDER: Hmm? Well, aside from the need for corrective lenses and a tendency to be abducted by extraterrestrials involved in an international governmental conspiracy, the Mulder family passes genetic muster.

(They both smile. The smile soon fades from Mulder's face.)

Now, Scully, that child inside is a tragedy. Some young parents, probably scared kids, disposed of an unwanted birth... in a very certain sense, infanticide is involved, but this is not an F.B.I. matter.

SCULLY: But from what I know from about genetic defects, Mulder, it's unlikely that child is a result of a single polygenic mating.

MULDER: We should let local authorities investigate that.

SCULLY: Those defects, Mulder, are autosomal dominant disorders, and from the degree, I'd say, mutations that go back many generations.

MULDER: Scully, uh, Sheriff Taylor, uh, implied that the boys in that family were not really the type that could easily get dates.

SCULLY: But he also implied that they practice inbreeding. Now we all have a natural instinct to propagate...

MULDER: Do we?

SCULLY: There are theories which pose that our bodies are, are simply vehicles for genes needing to  replicate.

MULDER: Yeah, yeah, but there's no sister. The mother's been dead for ten years.

SCULLY: But if the instinct and the need is strong enough, they will answer it any way that they can.  Now a woman gave birth to that child, Mulder, and my guess is, against her will.

MULDER: And kidnapping is a bureau matter.

(She starts to the car.)

Scully....

(She looks back at him.)

I never saw you as a mother before.

(She smiles slightly and walks off. He follows.)



SCENE 4
PEACOCK RESIDENCE; HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder and Scully approach the front steps. They walk over to the white Cadillac sitting on the lawn. No license plate. On their way up the steps, Mulder points out a pig's head with flies swarming sitting on the side. Mulder knocks on the screen door, but there is no answer. He goes to open it.)

SCULLY: No, there's no probable cause.

(Mulder takes out his flashlight and shines it around inside. More flies buzz. The house is a mess. They finally see what they're looking for: blood on the floor. Taking out their guns, they step inside carefully and quietly. Mulder puts his hand in an evidence bag inside out, picks up the scissors in the pool of blood, then turns the bag inside out, enclosing the scissors. He shoves the bag in his pocket as they look at the bloody footprints on the floor. Scully takes out a picture of a footprint taken off the field.)

They match.

(They spot a shovel off to the side. Mulder picks it up and they look at the blood on it.)

This room alone should convict them.

MULDER: Yeah, if we can find them. They probably bolted when they saw us coming.

(They walk down a hallway.)

We'll alert Sheriff Taylor to issue a warrant for the brothers' arrest, put out a county-wide A.P.B.

SCULLY: And check any prior missing-persons for a woman, and check the vehicle identification number on that Cadillac.

(They walk into a room with many small holes in the wall. Light shines through them.)

MULDER: If the mother is alive, they probably took her with them.

(Flies continue to buzz around. Unbeknownst to the agents, a set of eyes watch them from a dark corner, breathing raggedly.)



SCENE 5
SHERIFF TAYLOR'S RESIDENCE; 3 SWEETGUM LANE

(It is a peaceful night. The crickets are chirping and an owl hoots. Taylor is on the phone with Scully.)

ANDY TAYLOR: I've issued descriptions and arrest warrants for George Raymond Peacock...

(Cut to Scully, who covers her other ear as Mulder bangs on the side of the television set, getting static.)

Approximate age thirty...

(Cut back to Taylor.)

Sherman Nathaniel Peacock, approximately age twenty-six and Edmund Crieghton Peacock, forty-two.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: What about missing persons reports?

(Cut back to Taylor.)

ANDY TAYLOR: Deputy Pastor's on it right now.

SCULLY: Sheriff...

(Cut back to Scully.)

...do you recall over the last eight to ten months any vehicles you found and considered to be abandoned, but which might actually belong to kidnap victims?

(Cut to Taylor.)

We saw a white Cadillac in the Peacocks' front yard.

ANDY TAYLOR: We get so many of those, Agent Scully.

(Cut to Scully. Mulder fiddles with the knobs.)

A car breaks down, they move on.

SCULLY: Well, uh, we'll check on those in the morning. You get some sleep, Sheriff.

(Cut to Taylor.)

ANDY TAYLOR: You too, Miss Scully. Good night.

(He hangs up and sits down at his desk. He sighs and pulls open a drawer. Taking out a metal box, he opens it and looks at his revolver. Checking the bullets, he listens as a car drives by, then puts it away.)



SCENE 6
PEACOCK RESIDENCE; HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(The brothers get out of their house and walk over to the Cadillac. They proceed to throw some blunt objects, such as clubs and bats, into the trunk. Sherman siphons some gas, but ends up coughing a lot up.)



SCENE 7
MULDER'S HOTEL ROOM

(Scully sits at the table. Mulder is now trying to rework the antenna. He twists and turns it, trying to get a position. Scully smiles and packs her things up. She walks towards him and the reception improves, sound clear.)

MULDER: Whoa! Don't move, don't move.

(She stops. The improvement quickly disappears.)

Damn.

SCULLY: You still planning on making a home here?

MULDER: Not if I can't get the Knicks game.

SCULLY: Well, just as long as a brutal infanticide doesn't weigh into your decision. Good night, Mulder.

(She walks to the door.)

MULDER: Good night, Mom.

(She looks back, smiles slightly, then tries the doorknob.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this lock is broken.

MULDER: Oh, you don't have to, uh, lock your doors around here.

(She goes into the next room. Mulder stretches out the antenna, then takes a chair and jams the back under the door.)



SCENE 8
PEACOCK RESIDENCE; HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(The brothers load into the car. Edmund starts it and the radio turns on. "Wonderful, Wonderful" by Johnny Mathis starts up. The Cadillac pulls out.)



SCENE 9
SHERIFF TAYLOR'S RESIDENCE; 3 SWEETGUM LANE

(Andy sits out on the porch. His wife comes out.)

BARBARA TAYLOR: Andy? What are you doing?

ANDY TAYLOR: Taking one good last look around before it all changes.

(She kneels and puts her hands on his shoulders.)

BARBARA TAYLOR: Oh, honey, come to bed, huh? It will still be here in the morning.

(He sighs and stands.)

Come on, honey.

(They walk inside and she flicks off the lights. The door is unlocked. The Peacock brothers continue on the way down the road, the song still blasting.)



SCENE 10
MULDER'S HOTEL ROOM

(In the next room, Scully sleeps soundly. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in bed, having managed to pick up the nature channel. He can barely make out wolves or jackals moving in for the kill.)

MAN ON TV: The eldest dominant male in the pack moves in to ensure that the prey has been killed, and circling the prey is a signal to the others it is safe to a...



SCENE 11
SHERIFF TAYLOR'S RESIDENCE; 3 SWEETGUM LANE

(Sheriff Taylor isn't sleeping well. He rolls over, sighing, trying to get comfortable. A car slowly approaches. The song "Wonderful, Wonderful" can dimly be heard. He sits up as he hears the car pull up to the house. Getting out of bed, his wife wakes up. Taylor looks outside to see the Peacock brothers sitting in their car.)

BARBARA TAYLOR: Andy, what is it?

ANDY TAYLOR: Hide. Under the bed.

BARBARA TAYLOR: What?

ANDY TAYLOR: I'm going for the gun.

(She gets under the bed. Taylor walks out and down half the flight of stairs when he sees the shadow of Edmund approaching the door in the door window. Taylor barely breathes as the door slides open. He goes to his closet and gets his bat, then heads back to his room. He goes to the left of the door, poised to strike. Barbara gasps as the sound of footsteps approach. The couple shares one last meaningful look. The door creaks open. Taylor slams the bat into the chest of Edmund, who growls and tosses Taylor down. Taylor sits up and whacks Edmund in the leg, who looks down, not affected. He grabs the bat from Taylor, who cowers. Edmund kicks him in the ribs. George and Sherman walk in, carrying clubs. The grunt as they swing down upon Taylor. Barbara's eyes widen as she hears a dull thudding and hears her husband groaning. They grunt with each blow. Barbara does not look until she hears her husband's hand fall to the floor in a pool of blood. The blood starts to inch towards her fingers as the brothers groan. George sniffs the air. Barbara watches as they near the bed. They look down to see a set of fingers trying to avoid the blood. The bed is flung out of the way. Outside, the crooning of Johnny Mathis is intermingled by the sounds of dull thudding and both the brothers and Mrs. Taylor groaning. The boys nonchalantly walk to their car and drive off. In the morning, Deputy Pastor nervously smokes a cigarette as a car pulls up. He looks over to see Mulder and Scully get out. Mulder looks down at the tire treads on the grass left by the Cadillac as he walks by.)

MULDER: Big American car.

(The agents walk over to the deputy. The deputy holds up a folder.)

BARNEY PASTOR: I, uh... I came over to give him these reports and, uh... and found them. The, uh... the owner of the Cadillac was, uh... was found and contacted in Baltimore, she, uh... she ran out of gas and just left the car on the one-nineteen.

(Scully nods, seeing how troubled Pastor is by this.)

Other, uh... possible missing persons are in the file, and, uh...

(He hands her a Federal Express package.)

This came from the federal crime lab overnight.

MULDER: Where are they?

BARNEY PASTOR: They're, uh... they're inside.

(Inside, Scully puts on rubber gloves. Mulder already has his on, and he looks at what's left of Andy Taylor.)

MULDER: His chest is one big hematoma. There's wood shavings embedded in what's left of the cranium.

(They look over to a collapsed bed draped with blood. The feet of Barbara Taylor stick out.)

They really went caveman on them.

(He stands. Scully looks through the contents of the package.)

SCULLY: Damn it. The lab screwed up the DNA test on the infant.

(He looks at it.)

Multiple maldistribution, chromosomal breakage, maldivision of the centromere...

MULDER: You suspected these abnormalities.

SCULLY: Yeah, but this shows far too many gene imbalances. It would have to be a lab error.

(She shows him two slides of the DNA strands.)

This child's cells would have had to divide triple-fold in cell metaphase.

MULDER: Triple?

(He starts to pull off his gloves.)

Hey, Scully, what if... each of the Peacock brothers was the father of that child?

(Scully stares at him incredulously.)

SCULLY: Mulder... only one sperm in thousands from a single individual can penetrate an ovum membrane, let alone from three separate males.

MULDER: What if generations of autosomal breeding could produce such a mutation?

(Scully shakes her head.)

SCULLY: No. For that to be even remotely possible, there'd, there'd have to be a weakening of the ovum, and that would have to come from a female member of the Peacock family, and there aren't any left.

MULDER: Well, in any case, they haven't ventured too far from home. We should request back-ups from Pittsburgh and go pick them up.

SCULLY: Mulder, that would take a whole day. I think they, they may have a woman captive up there who may have sustained life-threatening injuries while giving birth. Who knows what those men have done to her. I think that we should go up there right now.

MULDER: Yeah, but we're outnumbered. We could further endanger the victim in doing that.

(Pastor walks in.)

BARNEY PASTOR: I'll take you out there. Then it's three against three... and this...

(He takes out his gun.)

This should give us the advantage.

(He walks out.)

MULDER: Oh, that was just a little bit too Chuck Bronson for me, Scully.

(They start out, but stop.)

SCULLY: Hang on a second, Mulder. Why... why would the Peacocks kill Sheriff Taylor? He didn't even question them about the buried child.

MULDER: Ah, they probably heard about the warrants issued for their arrest.

SCULLY: But how would they know? He, he issued the warrants by phone. Unless they overheard us talking about it, how would they know?

MULDER: No, we searched the house, Scully, they weren't home.

SCULLY: Exactly. How could they know?

(Mulder shakes his head.)



SCENE 12
PEACOCK RESIDENCE; HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(The room from before is barely lit with candles. The set of eyes continue to watch the boys as they seem to be preparing for war.)

SHERMAN PEACOCK: I'm hungry.

(George watches as Sherman rips off a piece of bread from a loaf and eats it. Their breathing is ragged. Edmund leans over to listen as Sherman seems to be gagging and throwing up. Sherman stands.)

All right. I'm ready.

(Edmund stands. The boys get undressed, their hideous bodies reflected in the few mirrors. They look down at the woman.)

You look fine.

(They turn around.)

They'll be coming now. We knew this day was going to happen. That they'd try to change the way things are. All we can do about changing things... is be ready for it... be ready for them. Let them know, this is our home and this is the way it's going to stay.

(Sherman leans down over the woman as the other two walk out. After a few seconds, he follows.)

Mulder, Scully, and Pastor ready themselves outside, putting on headsets. Pastor starts to put on a bulletproof vest. Scully looks through the binoculars and sees Sherman walking around, carrying a blunt object.)

SCULLY: Yup, they're up there.

BARNEY PASTOR: I'll take the front. Their attention will be taken by the uniform. You can approach around back.

SCULLY: Are these vests absolutely necessary, deputy?

BARNEY PASTOR: I've seen them fire muskets before. I, for one, am not getting taken out by some antique.

(He skulks off. Scully takes a vest and starts to slink along, Mulder following, carrying his own vest. Pastor slowly makes his way to the house, hiding behind an abandoned truck. Mulder and Scully, wearing their vests, walk through the field of wheat. George walks up the steps to his house and walks inside. Pastor ducks behind the white car. He whispers into his headset.)

This is Pastor. I'm at the front of the house.

(Cut to Mulder and Scully, who continue to make their way along.)

MULDER: We're getting into position.

(Pastor pants and slowly starts to the front door, keeping his gun aimed. Mulder and Scully get behind a rusted chicken coop. Scully uses her binoculars to look through a window. She can see the back of the door clearly.)

SCULLY: I don't see anybody inside.

BARNEY PASTOR: I'm going in.

(Pastor makes his way up the stairs as Scully continues to look. The screen door creaks as Pastor pulls it open. He opens the main door. Scully sees him and looks towards the top of the door. She sees a cord.)

SCULLY: Pastor, no!

(An ax swings out, decapitating Pastor. George walks over to the body. Scully, horrified, takes out her gun and walks over to Mulder.)

Pastor's dead. The brothers moved in like a pack of animals.

MULDER: The eldest will move in to ensure the prey has been killed, and circling the prey signals to the others that it's safe to approach.

(Scully looks through her binoculars to see the brothers starting to beat Pastor's carcass. They snarl.)

What we're witnessing, Scully, is undiluted animal behavior. Mankind, absent its own creation of civilization, technology and information, regressed to an almost prehistoric state, obeying... only the often savage laws of nature.

(Scully shakes her head.)

We're outsiders invading the den, trying to take away their one chance at reproducing, which we're going to do.

SCULLY: Even though we have the firearms, I imagine the place is rigged with traps.

MULDER: Yeah, but we can try and divert them out of the house.

(He points to the pigpen and they go. Mulder tries to push the pigs towards the door as Scully unlocks it. The pigs squeal. Scully sighs as she goes over to Mulder and tries to push as well.)

Scully, would you think less of me as a man if I told you I was kind of excited right now?

(He grunts.)

Is there some secret farmer trick to get these things moving?

SCULLY: I don't know... "nah-ram-ewe."

(She bleats as she talks.)

"Nah-ram-ewe!"

MULDER: Yeah, that'll work.

(They start to slowly push them out. Scully grunts.)

SCULLY: I baby-sat my nephew this weekend. He watches "Babe" fifteen times a day.

MULDER: And people call me "Spooky."

(They hear a door slam and look up to see Sherman walking out of the house as the pigs squeal, starting to run out. Sherman goes over to the water pump and washes the blood off his hands, then looks up to see the pigs running rampant. Mulder and Scully, ducking behind the bars to the pen, watch as Sherman grunts and runs into the house. All three brothers run out and start to chase the pigs. Seeing their chance, Mulder and Scully sneak their way towards the house. Reaching the door, Mulder picks up a board. He pushes the door open and a spear shoots through it and the window behind it. Scully goes in, then Mulder resets the trap and closes the door.)

SCULLY: Federal agents! Is anybody in here!

(Armed with flashlights and their guns, they make their way down the hallway.)

F.B.I.! Is anybody in this house? Is there anybody in here?

(They reach a door and Mulder kicks it open. There are piles of old newspapers, flies swarming. Mulder looks down.)

MULDER: Oh, no.

(He holds up a paper with the headline "Elvis Presley Dead at 42." There is a picture of Elvis under it. Mulder makes a sad face and Scully looks at him strangely. Mulder drops the paper as the two hear a squeaking. They go into the next room, the Peacock's bedroom/den. Scully looks at the pictures on the wall of past Peacocks, all deformed. One particular picture catches her eye, of a man and a woman sitting on the porch. Mulder notices marks on the floor and looks under the bed. A deformed woman looks away, screaming.)

MRS. PEACOCK: No! Get out, get away!

MULDER: It's all right, ma'am!

MRS. PEACOCK: Get away!

(Scully looks under the bed.)

MULDER: We're federal agents! We're here to help you!

MRS. PEACOCK: Go! Get out of here! Go away!

MULDER: Ma'am.

SCULLY: Let's move the bed.

MRS. PEACOCK: Get away! Ah! Get away!

MULDER: They've got her strapped to some kind of board or something.

MRS. PEACOCK: Get away! Get away! Go!

(They pull out the board. The woman is a quadriplegic. The wounds don't look surgical.)

MULDER: Ma'am, we're here to help you. Calm down. Ma'am, we're here to help. We're from the F.B.I.

(The woman screams.)

Take it easy, ma'am, take it easy. It's all right, it's all over.

(He and Scully look at her amputated limbs, giving them pause.)

We're from the F.B.I., we're...  we're here to help... w, we're going to make sure that you're safe. We're g, we're going to make sure that you get home.

(Scully looks back at the picture of the man and the woman on the porch. They are the same woman. The woman sobs.)

SCULLY: Mulder, she already is home. It's Mrs. Peacock. She's their mother.

(Mrs. Peacock looks at Mulder and hisses. Her deformed face makes Mulder wide-eyed. She slides back under the bed, sobbing, as Mulder and Scully stand. Mulder looks particularly hurt. Outside, the boys struggle with the pigs. Mulder starts out of the room.)

Mulder, where are you going?

MULDER: The others may have heard the screams. I'm going to check on their position.

SCULLY: Well, what about her?

(He closes the door.)

MULDER: She's not going anywhere.

(They start walking.)

SCULLY: I mean, we, we may not be able to move her, Mulder. She doesn't appear to be held against her will. I mean, she appears to be, but I don't believe she is.

(Mulder looks out the window at the Peacock Brothers.)

MULDER: I'm sure she's an accessory. At least she aided and abetted.

SCULLY: We're only assuming. We can't prove anything.

(Mulder shrugs slightly. The brothers continue to try to regain control of the pigs.)

The way I think it goes here is that Edmund is the... the brother and father of the other two.

MULDER: Which means that when Edmund was a kid, he could ground the other two for playing with his things? The brothers killed three people, Scully. Tell her we're going to bring them in... and try convincing her that she's the one way they can get out of this without any of her boys getting hurt. All right, I'm going to keep an eye on them.

(Scully starts back to the room.)

Scully, w, watch your step. This place is rigged.

(Scully carefully makes her way back into the room. Down the hallway a little farther, a cord is strung across the hallway near the floor, triggering a large pointed object to come crashing down. Mulder watches as the brothers start to round up the last of the pigs. He sighs. Scully kneels under the bed and looks at Mrs. Peacock.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Peacock?

(She doesn't acknowledge Scully.)

Mrs. Peacock? You are in immediate need of medical attention. Agent Mulder and I are here to help you.

(Mrs. Peacock looks at her.)

MRS. PEACOCK: This is our home. Why leave it?

SCULLY: Whatever pain you may be...

MRS. PEACOCK: Don't feel pain. Runs in the family. Have to check the boys, see if they hurt themselves.

SCULLY: What about you? Even after the accident?

MRS. PEACOCK: Right arm was torn off. Saw it sitting there across my dead husband's lap. Boys took me home... sewed me up just like the family learnt in the War of Northern Aggression. Whole time, felt the same as if been making breakfast.

(Scully sighs slightly, a bit disgusted.)

They're such good boys.

SCULLY: Mrs. Peacock, they murdered Sheriff Taylor and his wife. And Deputy Pastor.

MRS. PEACOCK: I can tell you don't have no children. Maybe one day you'll learn... the pride... the love... when you know your boy will do anything for his mother.

(She pants raggedly. Mulder watches wide-eyed as the brothers inspect the dirt, having gotten all of the pigs in the pen. They start back to the house.)

MULDER: Scully!

(He takes a desk and slides it in front of the door. Sherman starts to bang on the door with his shoulder. Mulder aims his gun.)

Federal agent! I'm armed!

(Scully runs into the room to see Sherman banging. Mulder fires his gun at the ceiling, giving Sherman pause.)

Stop, or I'll fire!

(Sherman continues. Behind Mulder, George raises a chair to hit Mulder.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Scully shoots George. Mulder turns around to see George fly back. Sherman continues to hit the door, making Mulder turn. George rushes Mulder as Sherman breaks through, pushing the table out of the way. Sherman helps George, trying to get Mulder's gun away as Scully tries to get a clear shot. She takes it, firing eight times, hammering George. George drops the gun to the floor as he flies back, but quickly stands. Scully is out of bullets and incredibly confused. Sherman has Mulder in a chokehold as George rushes him, but Mulder kicks him away. He then picks up a glass on the table and smashes it over Sherman's head, forcing him to release the hold. George nails Mulder and Sherman goes to get a weapon. Scully watches, horrified.)

I've got the mother!

(Sherman looks back and chases after Scully, swinging his jagged board. George throws a right hand, but Mulder ducks under it and jumps on his gun. George goes to pounce on Mulder. As Scully runs away from Sherman, she hears a gunshot and George screaming. As Sherman swings the board, she ducks. The board digs into the wall and Sherman tries to stop running, but trips over the wire on the hallway. The trap is sprung and Sherman groans as the point drives into Sherman's back. Mulder stands and goes over to Scully. They look down at Sherman.)

MULDER: Where's the other brother... Edmund?

SCULLY: Mulder, look.

(They kneel and see scratch marks on the floor leading from the bedroom.)

Marks on the floor.

(The agents walk back into the bedroom. Mulder looks under the bed to see that Mrs. Peacock is gone. Later, outside, Scully is on the phone.)

Okay, thank you.

(She hangs up. Mulder walks over to her.)

MULDER: I looked everywhere, they're both gone.

SCULLY: I've notified the state police and the highway patrol, they've put out an A.P.B. on the Peacocks and they're setting up a roadblock over a thirty-mile radius. In time, we'll catch them.

MULDER: I think time already caught them, Scully.

(He heads back to the car. She follows.)



SCENE 13
HOME, PENNSYLVANIA

(The old white car sits out on an abandoned road, engine running. "Wonderful, Wonderful" continues to play. We hear Mrs. Peacock consoling Edmund from an unknown location.)

MRS. PEACOCK: There, there. Sherman and George were good boys. We should be proud. And you got to know, Edmund, you can't keep a Peacock down. There'll be more. One day, there'll be more. Now we have to move on... start a new family... one we'll be proud of. Find a new place to call ours. A new home. A brand new home.

(The trunk opens and Edmund gets out. He closes the trunk and walks around to the driver's side, then gets in and pulls out to find a new destination. The song slowly drifts off and ends.)

[THE END]

PLANE INTERIOR
MAY 17, 1996

MAN: AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

(Shot of exterior bathroom door shows door lock switch from "libre" to "occupe.")

(Plane lands at Kennedy National Airport)

FLIGHT ATT: (To MANS SEATMATE in French) Excuse me, Sir. Where is the passenger who was sitting here?

SEATMATE: (in French) Hes been gone since I woke up. I assumed he was in the restroom.

(In restroom we see man who was pale now normal black skin tone looking in mirror. African tribal music. He exits restroom and pulls aside curtain startling the FLIGHT ATT)

FLIGHT ATT: (in French) Please take your seat, Sir. Were about to land. (He nods and enters main cabin. FLIGHT ATT knocks at restroom door.) Sir, were landing any minute now. Sir? (She opens door) Sir? (Sees MAN slumped against toilet. He is very pale and very dead.)

FLIGHT ATT: AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
5:17 AM

(SCULLYS feet in beige pumps. She knocks at SKINNERS office door.)

SKINNER: Come in. (She does) Thank you for getting here so quickly.

SCULLY: Theres not much traffic at this hour.

SKINNER: Agent Scully, this is Dr. Simon Bruin. (BRUIN rises from chair and offers his hand.) Hes with the Philadelphia office of the Centers for Disease Control.

BRUIN: A pleasure, Dr. Scully. (They shake. SCULLY sits.)

SKINNER: How familiar are you with the series of kidnappings that have taken place in Philadelphia?

SCULLY: Only what Ive read in the Herald. Uh, that four young men have gone missing over the past three months --- all of them African-American.

SKINNER: A joint FBI-Philadelphia PD task force has been working around the clock ----- but there have been no leads to speak of... until last night.

SCULLY: What happened last night?

SKINNER: Owen Sanders, then man most recently reported missing, was found dead near a construction site.

SCULLY: How was he killed?

SKINNER: Thats just it, Agent Scully. He wasnt. There was no evidence indicating homicide.

SCULLY: Has a cause of death been determined.

SKINNER: No. But Ill let Dr. Bruin give you his thoughts on that.

BRUIN: This was taken last night less than an hour after Sanders body was found. (Shows her photo of very pale dead young man. No MJ jokes.)

SCULLY: Im sorry, I thought you said that Owen Sanders was black.

BRUIN: He was.

SCULLY: Im not sure I follow.

BRUIN: See for yourself. (Hands her newspaper clipping of young black man with headline *Fourth Man Missing*) Owen Sanders was a perfectly normal young black man.

SCULLY: I assume youre going somewhere with this.

BRUIN: The depigmentation we are seeing may actually be characteristic of a disease ... an apparently fatal one.

SCULLY: So you dont think these men are victims of a crime at all.

BRUIN: Its my opinion, Dr. Scully, this investigation should begin and end under a microscope.

SKINNER: Dr. Bruins hope was that someone with a solid medical background like yourself could make a quick and decisive analysis.



SCENE 3
FBI PATHOLOGY LAB
7:25 AM

(SANDERS on table.)

SCULLY: Case number 2139318537. Subject is a black male, 19 years old, Cause and time of death unknown. Note: total lack of pigment in his skin, hair and eyes. The appearance of which suggests albinism, though the bleaching of the irises indicates a violent and unexplained cellular reaction to a vector or an environment. (Door opens, MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Hey. I heard you were down here slicing and dicing. Whos the lucky stiff?

SCULLY: His name was Owen Sanders. He was reported as the fourth kidnap victim in Philadelphia until his body turned up last night looking like this.

MULDER: Theres a Michael Jackson joke in here somewhere, but I cant quite find it. (Thank you, Mulder.)

SCULLY: (tight smile) I have been requested to determine what leeched the pigment from his body.

MULDER: Requested by whom?

SCULLY: The Centers for Disease Control.

MULDER: The CDC in a kidnap case?

SCULLY: Well, they believe that the uh, the case has been mislabeled. That this man and the others may have fallen prey to a disease or a pathogen.

MULDER: Based on what other evidence?

SCULLY: There were no external signs of trauma or defense wounds and uh, his wallet was still full of cash.

MULDER: (eating sunflower seed) Thats interesting. What, uh, what sort of disease is this?

SCULLY: I dont know. There are conditions like vitiligo which attack melanocytes and prevent the manufacture of melanin in the skin. Auto immune disorders which are not yet clearly understood.

MULDER: So this man died of a disorder. He and four other young black men who conveniently contracted the disease in succession and then disappeared without any explanation whatsoever.

SCULLY: Well, its very possible that they have already turned up but because of the depigmentation there may have been a problem with identification, so I have reissued descriptions of John Does to area morgues and ERs.

MULDER: Scully, has it occurred to you that this might just be a...a little PR exercise?

SCULLY: Im sorry?

MULDER: To divert attention from the fact that young black men are dying and nobody seems to be able to bring in a suspect? The perception being that nobody cares.

SCULLY: Mulder, not everything is a labyrinth of dark conspiracy, and not everybody is plotting to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

MULDER: (cracks sunflower seed)

SCULLY: (sighs)

MULDER: Did you lift any forensic evidence from the body?

SCULLY: Yes, theres hair, skin, and fiber behind you on the counter. (He turns to look) What are you doing?

MULDER: (taking evidence) Im going to join the snipe hunt .... if you dont mind .... before the body count rises. (He leaves. SCULLY sighs.)



SCENE 4

(An apartment. Young black man from the airplane bathroom, ABOAH, is sitting quietly on the bed. There is a knock at the door. ABOAH rises to answer it.)

MAN: (accented voice) Mr. Aboah? (ABOAHS back has white splotches. Apt #23. Another knock) Anyone home? (Starts to leave, door opens.) Samuel Aboah?

ABOAH: (wearing a shirt) Yes?

MAN: Im Marcus Duff. Remember me? Your immigration counselor. We have an appointment to go over your naturalization petition.

ABOAH: (opens door wider) Please.

DUFF: Thank you. (enters, ABOAH locks door. DUFF sits and opens briefcase.) We could, ah, use a little light in here to fill out the petition. Maybe you could open a window, or something.

(ABOAH slowly crosses to a floor lamp and turns it on.)

DUFF: I guess that works. (laughs) Have a seat, Samuel. This is a little complicated. (ABOAH sits.) So..... (looks at ABOAH with concern) You okay? You look ill. You got a fever or something?

ABOAH: No.

DUFF: I know how lonely it is. Believe me..... being in a strange place far from your family. But once you become a US citizen I can help you bring over every brother, sister, aunt, uncle, and cousin. It all starts today, Samuel. Know what Im saying?

ABOAH: Thank you.



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Entrance to PENDRELLS lab. MULDER walking down the hall toward him.)

MULDER: Agent Pendrell. Thanks for turning this materials analysis around on such short notice.

PENDRELL: Shouldnt we wait for Agent Scully? Just so I wont have to repeat myself.

MULDER: Shes not coming.

PENDRELL: Why not?

MULDER: She had a date.

(PENDRELLS face falls, shoulders slump.)

MULDER: Breathe, Agent Pendrell. Its with a dead man. (puts his hands on PENDRELLS shoulders) Shes doing an autopsy. (PENDRELL smiles) You said you found something?

PENDRELL: Yeah, asbestos fibers. Not much there. And I didnt think there was much of anything either among the vegetable debris, all local soils, pollen, etc. til I came across this. (Holds up vial.) We had to go online with a botanist at UVN to determine what it was.

MULDER: Well, it looks like some kind of thorn.

PENDRELL: Its a seed, actually. But nothing youll find at your local nursery. (Puts it under microscope) Adenia Volkensii.

MULDER: Help me out.

PENDRELL: Its from a rare species of passionflower. Its a rare night blooming plant indigenous to only certain parts of West Africa.

MULDER: How could something this small travel 5,000 miles around the world and wind up on Owen Sanders?

PENDRELL: That I couldnt tell you.



SCENE 6
(MULDER on pay phone)

MULDER: (on phone) It contains a cerebropathic glycoside. Does that mean anything to you?

SCULLY: (voice) If Im correct, its a cortical depressant that works on the higher centers of the brain.

MULDER: (on phone) Is it lethal?

SCULLY: (on phone in autopsy lab) In large enough quantities it might be. Larger than anything contained in a single seed.

MULDER: (on phone) Did the toxicology scan detect any of it in Owen Sanders blood?

SCULLY: (Voice) No, the tox screen was clean.

MULDER: (on phone) Could his body have metabolized the substance?

SCULLY: (on phone) Only if the victim hadnt expired immediately.

MULDER: (on phone) Does that tell you anything about anything?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, but .... I think I found something that could explain the depigmentation in the victim. His pituitary gland was necrotized.

MULDER: (voice) His pituitary gland?

SCULLY: (on phone) The pituitary gland secretes all the regulatory hormones in the body and it controls the production of melanin in the skin cells.

MULDER: (on phone) So you found evidence that this is a disease?

SCULLY: (on phone) No. I have identified the effect. I am still looking for the cause.

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, well why dont you let me know as soon as you find anything out.

SCULLY: (on phone) Where are you, Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Off to water the seeds of doubt. Bye-bye. (Mulder said bye?!?!?!)

(MULDER hands his plane ticket to an attendant and proceeds down the ramp at the airport.)



SCENE 7
UNITED NATIONS BUILDING
NEW YORK, NY

(Night. MARITA COVARRUBIAS walks down exterior steps. MULDER follows. She looks nervous.)

MULDER: Ms. Covarrubias?

MARITA: Who are you?

MULDER: Agent Mulder. Fox Mulder.

MARITA: What are you doing?

MULDER: Sorry I frightened you.

MARITA: What do you want?

MULDER: Im not sure why, but I thought you might be in a position to help me.

MARITA: Help you?

MULDER: Four young men are missing in Philadelphia. One of the men was found dead last night. This seed was recovered from the victims body. (Shows vial) Its from a rare species of plant found only in West Africa. Do you know anything about this case?

MARITA: No.

MULDER: Is there any way you could find something out about it?

MARITA: Thousands of exotic species cross into US soil every day undetected. Bilge water is emptied into harbors. Produce sent through the mail. In practical terms, borders are little more than lines on maps.

MULDER: Is that a yes or a no.

MARITA: I cant help you.

MULDER: (Stopping her from leaving) You cant, or you wont? You made an overture to me. You left an opening. Tell me Im wrong. Tell me theres nothing here and Ill just walk away. Either way, I need to know.

(MARITA looks at him.)



SCENE 8
BUS STOP

(Night. Young black man, KITTEL sitting at a bus stop. Whooshing sound. He gasps and puts his hand to the back of his neck and looks around, pulls bloody seed out of his neck. He begins to lose focus, and breathes heavily. Bus approaches. Door opens. KITTELS vision blurs. He just sits frozen, no response.)

DRIVER: Hey, I got a schedule. Are you getting on or not? Whats your problem? Are you on drugs, or something? Ah, the hell with you. You can walk for all I care. Damned drugs. (Closes door and drives away.)

(ABOAH is revealed, white splotch on face. KITTEL looks scared.)



SCENE 9

(Day. Same bus stop. SCULLY interviewing DRIVER.)

DRIVER: He was sitting right here staring up at me with these glassy eyes. Pretty much out of it.

SCULLY: You mean he looked sick?

DRIVER: Yeah, now that you mention it. I mean, I asked him if he needed help, but he didnt say squat. Dont forget to put down I had a schedule to keep.

SCULLY: Did you observe anybody else in the area?

DRIVER: Not that I saw. I already told the police pretty much everything I know.

(MULDER drives up.)

SCULLY: Excuse me.

MULDER: What happened here?

SCULLY: We have another missing young man. His name is Alfred Kittel. 17 years old. Hes African American. His mother called the police around 3:00 this morning.

MULDER: How does she know hes missing?

SCULLY: He works at a fast food place down the street. He takes this bus every night, and last night he never made it home. They found his knapsack on the bench here. Police are out canvassing. I talked to a bus driver who said that he seemed disoriented and non-responsive which seems to me like it might be some kind of pre-symptomatic dementia.

MULDER: (checking ground) Or a reaction to a powerful cortical depressant.

SCULLY: What are you suggesting?

MULDER: You find Alfred Kittel and you find another one of those weird African seeds.

SCULLY: What makes you so sure?

MULDER: (hands her folder) Three months ago  one week before the first person was reported missing  the New York Port Authority filed that with the FAA. (Picture of dead man on plane.) Like Owen Sanders, this man wasnt an albino either. Not until he was found dead on a charter flight from West Africa, from Burkina Faso. The Embassy demanded that the body be returned before an autopsy could be performed.

SCULLY: It says here that the cause of death was undetermined.

MULDER: Yeah, undetermined, Scully, but not necessarily unknown.

(SCULLY looks up at him.)



SCENE 10
ABOAHS APARTMENT HALLWAY

(Two police officers at door.)

OFFICER: Aboah? What the hell kind of name is that? (knocks, ABOAH cracks door)
Mr. Aboah?

ABOAH: Yes?

(Inside apartment KITTEL, young man from bus stop sits frozen listening to voices.)

OFFICER: (voice) Philadelphia PD. Were canvassing the building in regard to a missing persons case. This is the young man were looking for. Have you seen him?

ABOAH: (voice) No.

OFFICER: (voice) Well, if you hear from anyone who has, or come across any information at all, you can reach us at this number. Thats a hotline. You can call 24 hours a day.

ABOAH: Thank you.

OFFICER: Thank you.

(ABOAH closes door and approaches young man, opens mouth and from his throat pulls out long object.)



SCENE 11
INS OFFICE
PHILADELPHIA, PA

DUFF: I am really quite busy.

MULDER: Im sorry. We wont take up much of your time. The INS District Chief told us that you were in charge of most of the casework for aliens emigrating from Africa and the Caribbean.

DUFF: I assist people from that part of the world where I came from 15 years ago.

MULDER: Well, were looking for somebody that came a little more recently than that. (checks paper) On a flight from Burkina Faso? This is the passenger manifest from the charter company.

DUFF: And ... you want me to do what exactly?

MULDER: Id like you to cross reference those names on that list with anyone applying for permanent resident status or a work visa within the last three months.

DUFF: I am a social worker. Not a police officer. My business is not chasing down illegals.

SCULLY: Sir, were not here to arrest anybody.

DUFF: But you are FBI agents, are you not?

SCULLY: Yes. Investigating a possible public health crisis.

DUFF: What kind of crisis?



SCENE 12
SAMUEL ABOAHS RESIDENCE
800 DEMOTT AVENUE
1:15 PM

(MULDER comes out front door, gets in car with SCULLY.)

MULDER: Hes not home. We might as well get comfortable.

SCULLY: (looking through file) It has to be here, Mulder. There has to be some evidence of a virus or bacterium.

MULDER: Scully, I think if you looked up from the microscope for a minute, youd see that whats really missing is a motive.

SCULLY: The motive of any pathogen is to reproduce itself. And my job as a doctor is to find out if and how it is being transmitted.

MULDER: If this is a health crisis.

SCULLY: Death is a health crisis. Something caused Owen Sanders pituitary to fail which in turn caused his metabolism to drop resulting in myaxadema coma and finally in death. Sometimes you have to start at the end to find the beginning. (MULDER is comparing picture of ABOAH to a group of construction workers.) I just hope we dont have to find another dead body to discover what that is.

(MULDER spots ABOAH.)

MULDER: Maybe we wont have to wait. (Gets out of car) Mr. Aboah? Can I talk to you a minute?

(ABOAH runs. MULDER and SCULLY follow him to a dead end alley. They dont see him.)

MULDER: Boy, this guy can move.

SCULLY: Hes not here.

MULDER: He has to be.

(They look around in empty car etc)

SCULLY: Mulder, I think I know where he went. (Indicates hole in the fence.) Come on, Mulder. Lets go. Weve lost him.

(MULDER walks over to a very small drain opening in the wall near the floor and sees ABOAHS head upside down. ABOAH is breathing heavily.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully. Look at this.

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(Commercial)



SCENE 13
MT ZION MEDICAL CENTER
PHILADELPHIA, PA
5:45 PM

(ABOAH is being slid into an MRI machine. SCULLY and a doctor look on. Then DOCTOR checks ABOAHS brown eyes.)

DOCTOR: From all outward signs, this man appears asymptomatic. I appreciate the connection youve tried to make, but Im afraid its a dead end.

(SCULLY looks at MULDER waiting outside glass door like a puppy.)

SCULLY: With your permission, sir, Id like to examine him some more. Id like to run a suppression test, to do a TSH screen, take a history.

DOCTOR: It would help if we could talk to him.

SCULLY: Im working on that.

DOCTOR: All right.

(SCULLY goes out door to MULDER.)

MULDER: Nothing?

SCULLY: Not yet. But that doesnt mean he isnt a carrier or even the index case.

MULDER: Well, hes some kind of case the way he disappeared down that drain pipe.

DUFF: (coming down hall, upset) Why has Samuel Aboah been arrested? You said his health was in danger. Why have I been lied to?

SCULLY: Nobody has lied to you, sir.

DUFF: Then please, release him immediately.

SCULLY: We would like to do some more tests on him. We have to be certain that his health hasnt been endangered and that he isnt endangering others.

DUFF: Then why have you called me.

SCULLY: As a translator. Wed like to be able to ask him some questions.

DUFF: About what?

MULDER: About Alfred Kittel and about several other young men who have gone missing since his arrival in Philadelphia three months ago.

DUFF: Then ... this is about a criminal charge.

SCULLY: There are no charges against Mr. Aboah.

MULDER: We only arrested him because he ran when we tried to question him, and I want to know why he ran.

DUFF: Sir, if you had ever been beaten by the police or had your home burned to the ground for no other reason than being born then maybe you would understand why he ran and why you would run too.

MULDER: That man ran because hes hiding something. (to SCULLY) And no amount of tests you run on him, no science is going to find that. Excuse me. (leaves angrily)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To find someone who I know plotted to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate. (SCULLY looks at DUFF and sighs.)



SCENE 14
BURKINA FASO EMBASSY
WASHINGTON, DC
6:45 PM

(MULDER is shown into an office.)

SECRETARY: (with accent) Minister, this is Agent Mulder with the FBI.

MULDER: Thank you for seeing me at such a late hour, sir.

MINISTER: (with accent) I did not have much of a choice in this matter. Someone from the United Nations spoke to the ambassador directly. Whats so important that it cant wait?

MULDER: With all due respect, sir, I think you already know.

MINISTER: Do I?

MULDER: `Something happened on a flight from your country about three months ago --- something that you felt compelled to hide even from your own ambassador. The State Department said the request to stop investigating this mans death came directly from you. (shows picture of dead airplane man) Now, I understand the need to protect your diplomatic position, but more men are dying, sir.

MINISTER: Even if I tell you what I know, you would never believe it.

MULDER: Youd be surprised at what I believe, sir.

MINISTER: I had hoped if I closed my eyes it would go away this time?

MULDER: This time?

MINISTER: My people ... the Bambara, are farmers. I grew up hearing the old stories, believing them as only a child can believe.

MULDER: What kinds of stories?

MINISTER: The Teliko ...spirits .... of the air.



SCENE 15
HOSPITAL

(Bored Security guard. Orderly enters ABOAHS room. MINISTERS voice continues over scene.)

MINISTER: (voice over) It was said they rested by day in close, dark places, deep inside tree hollows and in holes beneath the ground too small even for a child to hide himself.

(ORDERLY looks around. Room is empty knocks at bathroom door.)

ORDERLY: Mr. Aboah? (No answer)

MINISTER: (voice over) Only when the sun fell, when the rest of the world was sleeping, would they come out.

(ORDERLY wheels cart out of the room.)



SCENE 16
EMBASSY OFFICE

MULDER: Come out to do what, sir?

MINISTER: I was seven years old. Lying awake one night, I saw him. He was standing over me. His hair was like straw .... his eyes like water, staring down at me. I closed my eyes and screamed and felt myself being swept up into the air, but when I opened my eyes, I saw my father holding me.

MULDER: Then, it was a nightmare.

MINISTER: Thats what my father said, and I believed him, until the next day ... when they found my cousin, dead among his cattle, looking exactly like this man. (holds picture of dead airplane man)

(Cart in hospital hallway)

MINISTER: (voice over) Which is why, when this photograph came across my desk three months ago --- I knew the Teliko was more than just a childrens story. I knew it was real. I knew he was here.

(Small drawer in bottom of cart opens revealing ABOAHS eyes peering out.)



SCENE 17
HOSPITAL X-RAY VIEWING ROOM

SCULLY: This patient appears to have something in his throat, some kind of aberrant bone growth, or maybe something foreign lodged in his esophagus.

DOCTOR: Could be a lot of things. Youd be amazed what Ive seen removed from peoples throats in emergency rooms.

SCULLY: Well, thats only part of it. I discovered something even more disturbing when his PET series came back. Look right here on the sagittal section, right below the hypothalamus.

DOCTOR: There must be some mistake.

SCULLY: Theres no mistake. This patient has no pituitary gland.

DOCTOR: But thats not possible.

SCULLY: I cant even begin to explain what were seeing here, sir. I just hope this patient can, can provide us with some of the answers.

MULDER: (entering) Youll have to find him first.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I was looking for you down in quarantine. Samuel Aboahs gone. Disappeared.

(SCULLY looks shocked.)



SCENE 18
NIGHT

DUFF walks to his car. Startled by ABOAH.)

DUFF: Samuel? You scared me. They let you out of the hospital?

ABOAH: Yes.

DUFF: Everything is fine? Samuel? Did you want to see me about something?

ABOAH: (nods)

DUFF: (laughs) Well, come on. Let me give you a ride home. We can talk about it on the way. Lucky for you, I was working late.

ABOAH: Yes. Lucky.

DUFF: Come, lets go.

(ABOAH is hiding the thing he pulled out of his throat behind his back.)



SCENE 19
HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NEAR THE CART

MULDER is looking in drawer

SCULLY: (on cel phone) When did this happen? ..... Thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate it. (hangs up) Mulder .....

MULDER: (Pulling something out of the drawer.) I think this was his getaway vehicle. (Looks at top of cart.) He didnt even touch his Jell-O.

SCULLY: Lets go. That was the Philadelphia PD. Marcus Duffs car turned up abandoned with the keys in the ignition and the hood still hot.

MULDER: (nods)



SCENE 20

(DUFF lies frozen and scared as ABOAH pulls out slender metal object and sticks it up DUFFS nose with a cracking sound. Eeeeeewwwww! He is interrupted by a policeman walking by with a flashlight. Policeman finds DUFF with thing sticking out of his nose. Large open drain pipe is right beside him.)

POLICEMAN: (On radio) ...... requesting ambulance ......



SCENE 21

(DUFF being loaded into ambulance.)

SCULLY: Do you know what happened to him?

LIEUTENANT: I wont even try to guess what happened to him, but hes alive.

SCULLY: What about Aboah? Any indication of where he might be?

LIEUTENANT: Were still sweeping the area. Ill keep you posted.

(MULDER and SCULLY walk away)

SCULLY: Hes got to be around here somewhere, Mulder. He cant have gotten far.

MULDER: This guy can squeeze into a coffee can, Scully. He could be anywhere.

SCULLY: Theyll find him.

MULDER: Hell find another victim.

SCULLY: How do you know?

MULDER: We interrupted him before he could finish.

(They get in car)

SCULLY: Interrupted his killing Duff?

MULDER: The killing is just incidental I think, Scully, to a far more basic need.

SCULLY: What need?

MULDER: (driving) If Aboah has no pituitary then his body would lack the ability to produce melanin itself, right?

SCULLY: Theoretically, yes.

MULDER: Well, when you examined him you didnt observe one single albino trait or characteristic.

SCULLY: Considering his PET scan results I dont even know how he managed to stay alive.

MULDER: Thats what Im talking about, Scully, survival. And not just Aboahs. I think that anomaly you observed is not just physiological, I think it may be evolutionary.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: The lost tribe, a clan of sub-Saharan albinos linked by their common congenital deficit whove adapted over generations by ....

SCULLY: What, by stealing other peoples hormones?

MULDER: Somehow, Aboah has managed to survive.

SCULLY: Well, however hes managed to survive wha --- I mean what.... what makes you think hes not an isolated case?

MULDER: Because of something somebody told me last night. (Pause) An African folktale.

SCULLY: So youre basing this theory on a folktale?

MULDER: Its just another way of describing the same truth, right? I mean all new truths begin as heresies and end as superstitions. We ... we fear the unknown, so we reduce it to the terms that are most familiar to us, whether thats a folktale, or a disease, or a ...... conspiracy. (smile)

SCULLY: Well, even if youre right, I mean especially if youre right, why would he leave his own country to come here?

MULDER: Free cable. I dont know, the same reasons anybody comes to this country. Liberty, the freedom to pursue your own interests. (Sees construction site) Look at that.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: (Stopping car) Its a demolition site. (They get out of car.)

SCULLY: Why are we here, Mulder?

MULDER: Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Owen Sanders body. And you remove asbestos from an old building before you tear it down. It had to come from somewhere.

(They enter old building and split up. They just dont learn. MULDER climbs ladder. Pale ABOAH watches him. MULDER gets hit in the neck, pulls out thorn.)

MULDER: Ow.

(MULDERS vision gets blurry.)

MULDER: Scully? (yells) Scully!

SCULLY: (in another part of the building) Mulder?

(MULDER drops flashlight and passes out, hard.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder? (Climbs same ladder) Mulder? (Sees his dropped flashlight, and vent nearby. Looks in vent.) Mulder? (Climbs through vent. ABOAH watches her through grate. SCULLY sees pale dead KITTEL. Then sees MULDER. She crawls to him.) Mulder! Mulder, are you okay?

(No response, his eyes are staring. Hear someone getting closer quickly, then ABOAH appears around the corner. SCULLY drops her light and fires her gun at ABOAH. Bullets hit the wall, ABOAH is gone. SCULLY crawls back to MULDER.)

SCULLY: Its okay, Mulder. Im here, okay?

(SCULLY reaches over him and knocks out vent cover into a courtyard area with two dead bodies. She jumps down then pulls MULDER out.)

SCULLY: Sorry, Mulder. (Drops him to ground, then dials cel phone, her back to MULDER.) Yes, this is Dana Scully with the FBI requesting immediate EMS and police assistance. Im in Liberty Plaza ....... My badge number? JTT0331613.

(MULDER sees ABOAH at entrance to vent, but cant move. Looks very distressed. Keeps looking from SCULLY to ABOAH, trying to speak.)

SCULLY: (on phone with 911 operator from hell) No. Liberty Plaza. Theres a demolition site on the north side of the street.

(MULDER stares desperately at the back of SCULLYS head as ABOAH begins to move toward them. Psychic! SCULLY suddenly senses, and turns firing at ABOAH, hitting him mid air. MULDER closes his eyes in relief. SCULLY looks at ABOAH, still alive but hurt, then goes to MULDER.)



SCENE 22

(SCULLY typing)

SCULLY: (voice over) Special Agent Dana Scully, Field Journal Entry number 74. Despite acute trauma to his pituitary gland, Marcus Duff was discharged early this morning from Mt. Zion Medical Center. He is expected to testify before a Grand Jury in the capital case against Samuel Aboah who is being charged with five counts of murder. (Aboah in hospital room.) It remains uncertain, however, whether Aboah will live long enough to stand trial. His response to hormone therapy has been poor, his deterioration progressive. My conviction remains intact that that the mechanism by which Aboah killed and in turn survived, can only be explained by medical science, and that science will eventually discover his place in the broader context of evolution. But what science may never be able to explain is our ineffable fear of the alien among us; a fear which often drives us not to search for understanding, but to deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate. To obscure the truth not only from others, but from ourselves.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TRAVERSE CITY, MICHIGAN

(It is raining heavily outside a drugstore with a sign advertising "Passport Fotos While-U-Wait". A yellow Volkswagen pulls up in front. Inside are Mary and Billy. Billy looks around nervously, while Mary adjusts the rearview mirror and puts on lipstick.)

BILLY: It's just a damn passport photo. It's not the cover of 'Vogue'.

MARY: There's no reason I have to look like hell in it, is there? Now settle down.

BILLY: We're on a schedule here.

MARY: I know we're on a schedule here.

(Billy readjusts the mirror and spots something.)

BILLY: Act natural.

(A police car passes by.)

MARY: I'll be back in ten.

BILLY: Make it five. I'll be around back.

MARY: Relax, Billy.

(Mary gets out of the car, opens an umbrella and heads into the drugstore.)

(Inside, the druggist is preparing to take Mary's picture. Mary is pulling down a background screen.)

DRUGGIST: Lower it just a bit. Yep, that's it. Yeah ... big smile ... yeah ... hold it. (He snaps a picture of a smiling Mary) Big trip you got planned?

MARY: Oh, you know. Nothing special. Just good to have a passport.

DRUGGIST: Oh, it looks like it's clearing up. Might be a nice day after all. It's just going to take a few minutes. That comes to $6.95.

(A man in a yellow rain suit with hood enters the drugstore. Mary fumbles for her billfold.)

MARY: Great. I left my money in the car. I'll be back.

DRUGGIST: I'll be here.

(She opens her umbrella and heads back out into the rain. The man in the yellow rain suit walks past the counter but leaves without purchasing anything. Outside, Mary walks around back. The shadow of a hooded man appears on the back of her umbrella and grows larger. There is a bumping sound.)

MARY: Ow! Hey, you jerk!

(The hooded man, the same one in the drugstore, walks past. Mary examines her right shoulder and holds it as she stumbles down some steps toward Billy's car.)

MARY: What? Billy? Billy, someone did something to me, Billy.

(As she walks up to the driver's door of the car, she sees Billy slumped back in the seat, motionless, with much blood running down from his left ear. Mary groans, tries to support herself against the car, then drops the umbrella and falls to the pavement. She struggles to maintain consciousness, and dimly sees a car approach her and the hooded man get out of the car and approach her.)

(Inside, the druggist looks impatient.)

DRUGGIST: Shoot!

(He peels the picture from the film backing. Rather than the smiling Mary that he photographed, the photo shows an image of Mary screaming in terror.)

DRUGGIST: My God!

SCENE 2
LONG LAKE ROAD, NORTHERN MICHIGAN, 5:10 AM

(Mulder is driving while Scully is reviewing a file, which includes the photograph that the druggist took of Mary LeFante.)

MULDER: What are your thoughts on that, Scully?

SCULLY: Have the local police been contacted by this woman's abductor? No demand for ransom?

MULDER: No, unfortunately. It's going on three days.

SCULLY: Any additional leads?

MULDER: No, no hair and fiber evidence either. The rain washed it all away. The autopsy did come back on the dead boyfriend, though. It's a puncture wound through the left eardrum and into the brain, possibly from a long needle or awl.

SCULLY: I'm still not sure how you and I figure into this investigation.

MULDER: Don't you see the photo?

SCULLY: I assume that was taken by whoever it was who abducted her.

MULDER: It was taken by a sixty-five year old druggist moments before she was abducted. That's a passport photo from a local drugstore. The druggist who took that photo is the last known person to have seen Mary LeFante. Only he claims that wasn't the photo he was taking. He says the photo he was taking was normal in every respect. He only came forward to the police when he heard the woman was missing.

SCULLY: Well, whoever it was that took this photo was obviously privy to the woman's abduction.

MULDER: That is what you would think.



SCENE 3
IN THE DRUGSTORE

(The druggist places the camera on the counter.)

DRUGGIST: The damndest thing. Here it is just like I left it. It was under lock and key.

SCULLY: Is that where you keep it?

DRUGGIST: Yes.

SCULLY: Mind if I take a look?

DRUGGIST: Yes, help yourself. At first I thought I did something wrong when I took the picture. You see, there's that piece of paper you have to pull off. You have to do that just right.

(Scully kneels behind the counter, where the film is kept. She notices that the druggist has a brace on his right leg.)

MULDER: I'm sure you did it just fine.

SCULLY: Your film's out of date.

DRUGGIST: (puzzled) Is that against the law?

SCULLY: No, I was just making an observation.

DRUGGIST: I don't get much call for passport photos, you know. The copy shop over at the mall does them cheaper. (the phone rings) Excuse me. I sure hope you find that young woman, safe and sound.

(Scully has noticed a space heater just below the shelf that holds the film. The druggist limps to the back of the store to answer the phone.)

MULDER: (smiling) So which one of us gets to use the stun gun on Bruno Hauptmann back there?

SCULLY: All right, so he doesn't exactly stand out as a suspect. Mulder, take a look at this. See this smeariness here. I'm thinking that it's heat damage. With the heater sitting under the film right there, the emulsion probably melted.

MULDER: So you think that would make it look like she posed screaming for a passport photo?

SCULLY: Plus, the film is two years out of date.

MULDER: Oh.

(Mulder is nodding with a slight smile on his face. Scully notices and sounds less and less convinced as she talks.)

SCULLY: The, the photographic chemistry could have changed. The, the dyes ... fade, they ... all right, so what's your theory?

MULDER: I'm not sure I have a theory.

(Officer Trott enters the store and approaches Mulder and Scully.)

TROTT: Excuse me. You the two FBI agents?

MULDER: Yeah, agents Mulder and Scully.

TROTT: Sorry to have brought you all the way from Washington. Afraid we may have wasted your time.



SCENE 4
THE RESIDENCE OF MARY LEFANTE

(A number of officers are conducting an investigation, taking pictures and collecting evidence. Mulder and Scully enter, led by Officer Trott into the kitchen.)

TROTT: Inspector Puett. These are agents Scully and Mulder. (Trott leaves.)

PUETT: Agents.

MULDER: Inspector.

PUETT: United States Postal Inspector. My office is investigating a mail theft - one which we've traced to your missing person, Ms. Mary Louise LeFante.

SCULLY: She was a postal employee?

PUETT: She works as a sorter at the Kurland Hills Branch. Not coincidentally, a number of unsigned credit cards in transit through that branch never made it to their respective owners.

(He shows them a bag of credit cards recovered at the scene.)

MULDER: Mary LeFante was intercepting them.

PUETT: And her recently deceased boyfriend was signing them. We ran him, he was into forgery, check fraud, you name it.

(Mulder is looking at a number of normal-looking photographs held by magnets on the refrigerator.)

SCULLY: Mary LeFante's passport photo. Do you know how soon she wanted to leave town? (Puett shakes his head) Did she know about your investigation?

PUETT: Probably, though we didn't focus on her specifically until this week after she came up missing.

SCULLY: And you think that she faked her own disappearance?

PUETT: Well, it looks that way to me.

MULDER: Yeah, but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear? The magic was gone? Did you find a camera anywhere here?

(Puett shakes his head.)

(Mulder and Scully go upstairs into Mary's bedroom.)

SCULLY: So you're thinking this woman planted that photo of herself in the drugstore?

MULDER: What would be the point of that?

SCULLY: (shrugs, puzzled) I ...

(Mulder walks into the closet.)

MULDER: Here it is. (He emerges with a Polaroid camera.) Stand back, Scully, it's loaded.

(He puts his hand over the lens and snaps a photograph. He snaps several others as they talk.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: In the sixties, a bellhop named Ted Serios became kind of famous for taking what he called "thoughtographs". He claimed that by concentrating on an unexposed film negative, he could create a photographic representation of what he saw in his mind. He did landscapes, cathedrals, the Queen of England.

SCULLY: "Thoughtographs?"

MULDER: Also known as "skotographs." The literature on thought photography dates back almost to Louis Daguerre.

SCULLY: So that makes it legitimate?

MULDER: Look at that.

(The images on the prints are starting to emerge. Each one shows a distorted picture of a screaming Mary, not unlike the drugstore photograph. There are also several distorted skull-like images on each photo.)

SCULLY: Oh my God!

MULDER: I think he was here, Scully.

SCULLY: Who was here?

MULDER: Mary LeFante's abductor. I think he stalked her. (He walks out an exterior door onto a porch, toward the steps onto the porch and then to a window on the wall near the closet.) He could have come up right here. I think he came in here and he looked at her through the window, this close. Close enough to affect the film in that camera.

SCULLY: Psychic photography? Mulder, I think that it's obvious that somebody doctored these images and planted them to be found here. Maybe as some kind of a smokescreen.

MULDER: Meant to conceal what? This isn't about mail fraud, Scully, that's just incidental. What if ... what if ... someone had this ability? An image like this would be a peak into that person's mind.

SCULLY: Into their darkest fantasies.

MULDER: The fantasy of a killer.



SCENE 5
NEXT TO A HIGHWAY IN A NEARBY RURAL AREA

(As cars go by, Mary LeFante, who was lying in some weeds by the side of the road, gets to her feet and walks toward the road. She is wearing a nightgown. Expressionless, she walks along the road. One car honks its horn at her, then a police car pulls up behind her.)



SCENE 6
A HOSPITAL

(Mary LeFante is being wheeled through the hospital on a stretcher. A doctor, an orderly, and Mulder and Scully are by the stretcher.)

DOCTOR: She's completely nonresponsive. We did a preliminary tox screen on her found traces of morphine and scopolamine.

SCULLY: Twilight sleep.

MULDER: The dental anesthetic.

DOCTOR: It's basically a painkiller cocktail. It's also for women in labor.

MULDER: Would that account for her condition?

SCULLY: No, it wouldn't.

(Scully is examining Mary's pupils as they go through the hall.)

MULDER: What would?

SCULLY: (to the doctor) Give her a PET scan.

(a few minutes later, Mary is placed into the PET scanner by a technician.)

TECHNICIAN: All set.

(In the adjoining room, Mulder, Scully and the doctor watch as another technician operates a terminal that shows the results of a scan of Mary's brain. The scan shows the brain in blue, but there are large green areas and several red areas. Scully grimaces as she sees the results.)

SCULLY: Oh my God.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: She's been given what's called a transorbital lobotomy. It used to be known as an icepick lobotomy. It involves inserting a leucotome through the eye sockets.

MULDER: So we're looking for a doctor? Someone with training?

DOCTOR: Not judging by this.

SCULLY: Whoever did this, Mulder, did it wrong.

(Through the speaker, they hear Mary moaning from the examination room.)

MARY: un ... un ... unruhe ... unruhe ...

MULDER: (switching on the intercom) Mary?

MARY: un ... un ...

MULDER: We better go in there and get her.

(The doctor and technician go into the examination room and remove Mary.)

MARY: Unruhe ... un ... unruhe ...

(Officer Trott enters the adjoining room with Mulder and Scully.)

TROTT: We just got the call. There's been a second abduction.



SCENE 7
AN UNKNOWN LOCATION

(A light is switched on, showing a woman, apparently bound to a chair, with duct tape over her mouth. She moans and struggles. There is an unknown man with her who speaks in German. As she struggles, she watches him place a leucotome - a six-inch steel needle with a handle - on a metal table next to her.)

MAN: Unruhe. Hab keine Angst. Ich verde dir helfen. Du wirst deine Unruhe bald vergessen... deine Unruhe vergessen. [Unrest. Don't be afraid. I will help you. You will forget about your unrest soon... forget about your unrest.]



SCENE 8
THE MIDLOTHIAN CORPORATE PARK

(Scully drives up. She walks through a plastic-shrouded scaffolding, passing paramedics who are pushing a stretcher carrying a body. She finds Mulder in an office within the building. Other officers are investigating the scene.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Charles Selchik, certified public accountant (he motions to an outline of a body marked on the floor) ... dead from a stab wound through the ear ... cleaning crew found the body.

SCULLY: What about the missing woman?

MULDER: His secretary, Alice Brandt, age 32. Her family confirmed that she was working late last night.

SCULLY: What's her connection to the first victim?

MULDER: Apparently none, but if the M.O. remains the same ...

SCULLY: Yeah, the clock is running.

MULDER: Yeah. I keep thinking about that word that Mary LeFante was repeating - "unruhe." I checked the Michigan phone directory. It appears under three different spellings but none within 80 miles of here.

SCULLY: It might be significant as a word.

MULDER: That's what I've been thinking. Apparently in German, it means trouble or strife.

SCULLY: "Unrest."

MULDER: You took German in high school, Scully?

SCULLY: College.

MULDER: Unrest, huh?

SCULLY: I'm working on these crime scene photos from the first abduction. If we're lucky, we're dealing with someone who gets a vicarious thrill from returning to the scene of a crime.

MULDER: He wasn't there, Scully.

SCULLY: How do you know?

MULDER: It would have affected the photos. Trott, what did you find?

TROTT: Nothing much. There's no cameras or film here whatsoever. It's all just accountants' offices so I don't know why there would be.

SCULLY: Is that what we're looking for here, Mulder? More evidence of psychic photography?

MULDER: That may be the only evidence we get.

SCULLY: I've got a bureau forensics team coming up from Detroit.

MULDER: What's here for them to find? This guy is obviously very good at what he does. He's left behind no witnesses, no latent prints. The only thing he's left are those photos, which leads me to believe he doesn't even know that he has that ability.

SCULLY: We haven't found any new psychic photos here either.

(Scully sees something outside and looks down at a photo.)

SCULLY: Wait a second.

(She then walks to the window for a better look. She is looking at a sign over the scaffolding that she went through earlier.)

SCULLY: I want to show you something.

(She and Mulder are walking back through the plastic-shrouded scaffolding. They approach a distinctive sign for the Iskendarian Construction company.)

SCULLY: Right here. This. (she shows him a photo from the first crime scene that shows the same sign in the area) And look. It's the same company. What if the kidnapper was working construction at both sites? From these two vantage points, he would have been able to pick out the two women.

MULDER: You may be right, Scully, you should check it out. Let me know what you find.

SCULLY: Where are you going to be?

MULDER: I'll be back in DC. I want special photo to run this. I still think the answer is in here.

SCULLY: What if it's not, Mulder? This woman's time is running out.

MULDER: Well, that's all the more reason to fully investigate the one and only hard piece of evidence we do have. I'll be in touch.



SCENE 9
BACK AT THE UNKNOWN LOCATION WHERE ALICE BRANDT IS BEING HELD CAPTIVE

(The man is placing a nightgown, similar to the one that Mary LeFante was wearing when she was found, over Alice.)

MAN: Das ist für dich. Es ist wie das, dass sie getragen hat. [This is for you. It's like the one she was wearing.]

(The duct tape over Alice's mouth comes loose.)

ALICE: Oh, get away from me! Get away from me you bastard! Let me go! No! No!

MAN: Shh ... shh ... (he puts a new piece of tape over her mouth) Bald sehr ... sehr bald.



SCENE 10
FBI SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT, WASHINGTON D.C.

(Mulder and a technician are working on the photograph from the camera in Mary LeFante's house, displayed on a computer screen.)

MULDER: Can you get rid of the blurriness surrounding her, here?

TECHNICIAN: Yeah. I just need to mark a place where the blur comes to a point, and let the computer do its business.

(The skull-like images around Mary's face are now sharpened to show evil-looking heads with sharp teeth.)

TECHNICIAN: Bingo. Lord, look at that. This guy's an artist.

MULDER: Why do you say that?

TECHNICIAN: However he did this, however he put this together, it's seamless.

(Mulder points to another blurry image on the photo.)

MULDER: What about this face, here? Can you bring that up at all?

TECHNICIAN: Wait a sec ... Let's try ... I think I can sweeten it more.

MULDER: OK, do that.

(He has enlarged the area of interest, and as he works the area sharpens to show a man's face.)



SCENE 11
THE TRAVERSE CITY POLICE STATION

(Scully enters and approaches Officer Corning.)

SCULLY: What have you got?

CORNING: We're running the construction company employees. Eighteen workers overlapped on both job sites. We're checking the records now, but so far nothing.

SCULLY: What about day laborers?

CORNING: Mr. Iskendarian, there, says that his company doesn't hire workers off the books ...

ISKENDARIAN: I don't want any trouble with the IRS.

CORNING: ... but that his foremen might hire a little cash-only day labor without his knowledge. He's got seven job sites going now, as many foremen.

SCULLY: Gather officers to canvas. (to Iskendarian) Which foreman was working the Midlothian Corporate Park?

ISKENDARIAN: That job's finished.

SCULLY: Find out where he is today. I'll take that one. (She leaves.)

ISKENDARIAN: (to another officer) Can I use your phone?



SCENE 12
BACK IN D.C. AT THE SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHIC UNIT

(Mulder and the technician are still working on the photograph. Mulder is on his cell phone.)

MULDER: OK, thank you. (hangs up) NCIC shows no match for that man. (he points to two dark lines near the man's head) How about this shape up here? What is that? (they zoom out and see that the lines curve around a large area at the top of the photo) Can you take that and flip it so that that's on the bottom? Is that a shadow?

(They enhance the contrast and the dark lines show an outline of a man, with very long legs)

TECHNICIAN: Yeah, it is. Somebody's shadow.

MULDER: It's the kidnapper's shadow. It's like he's looming over her, it's like he's standing over her, he means to pass judgement on her, like a god.



SCENE 13
OUTSIDE AN APARTMENT BUILDING CONSTRUCTION SITE IN MICHIGAN

(Scully drives up, then walks into the building.)

SCULLY: Hello? Hello? (she walks up a stairway onto a balcony that surrounds an open area below) Hello? (she hears some noises and heads toward them) Hello?

(A man, Gerry Schnauz, emerges from a room wearing construction stilts.)

SCHNAUZ: Hi, can I help you?

SCULLY: Uh, I hope so. Are you the foreman?

SCHNAUZ: Yes, ma'am. Gerry Schnauz.

SCULLY: (flashes her badge) I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. I'd like to ask you some questions about the day laborers that you hire.

SCHNAUZ: What, is this some IRS thing?

SCULLY: No, sir, not at all.

SCHNAUZ: Well, my crew is at lunch if you want to talk to anybody, but everybody I've got on today is on the books, as far as I know.

(Scully's cell phone rings)

SCULLY: Excuse me. Sorry.

SCHNAUZ: Sure.

SCULLY: (turning and walking away, answering her phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, I may have something for you on the kidnapper. It's something about his legs.

SCULLY: Yeah?

MULDER: They're unusually long, they're out of proportion. I'm thinking he's either very tall, or he's not but wants to be. Scully? Scully, are you there?

(Scully turns back to Schnauz, who is still on the stilts. She hangs up without saying anything to Mulder.)

SCULLY: Unruhe. (Schnauz suddenly looks nervous. Scully draws her gun.) Stand where you are!

(Schnauz darts out and uses the stilts to jump across the open area to the other side of the balcony, but he loses his balance and falls off the stilts. Scully runs around the balcony toward him.)

SCULLY: Don't move!

(Schnauz gets up and ducks down the stairs. Scully is on the balcony looking down at him.)

SCULLY: Stop or I'll shoot!

(Schnauz continues to flee, but Scully fires, hitting a support column just in front of him. Schnauz stops and raises his hands. Scully keeps a gun on him as she go down the stairs and approaches him. She spins him around so that he is facing the support column.)

SCULLY: Hands behind your head! DO IT!

(Schnauz complies. As he stands against the column, breathing heavily, Scully approachs from behind and checks him for weapons. As she reaches into the pocket of his construction apron, she gasps and draws her hand back quickly, finding a spot of blood on her finger. She reaches back in more carefully and pulls out a leucotome, which is identical to the one shown earlier on the table next to Alice Brandt.)



SCENE 14
AN INTERROGATION ROOM AT THE POLICE STATION

SCHNAUZ: Who?

SCULLY: Alice Brandt. The second woman that you abducted. That's her name, Gerry. Where is Alice Brandt?

SCHNAUZ: I don't ... I have no earthly idea what you're talking about.

SCULLY: Tell us where she is, Gerry.

SCHNAUZ: I'm sorry. This is a case of mistaken identity or something. I honestly ... honestly have no idea what you're talking about.

SCULLY: (showing him a plastic bag containing the leucotome) Explain this.

SCHNAUZ: We're running sheetrock today. I use that to start the holes in the sheetrock, to keyhole in all the fixtures.

SCULLY: No, you used this to kill the two men.

SCHNAUZ: What two men?

SCULLY: You used this on Mary LeFante.

SCHNAUZ: Who? What? Wait, a minute ago it was Alice Brandt. I don't believe this, I do not believe this is happening.

MULDER: You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested, Gerry? In 1980, you attacked your father with an axe handle. You beat him so severely that he spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair.

SCHNAUZ: I was not jailed, I was institutionalized. I had a kind of chemical imbalance.

MULDER: Yeah, Gerald Thomas Schnauz, diagnosed and treated for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder six years in Melvoin Psychiatric Hospital, released 1986. So what you been up to since 1986, Gerry?

SCHNAUZ: Taking care of my father. Looking after him 24 hours a day. Making amends. He, uh, passed away January.

MULDER: Well, how did you feel about that?

SCHNAUZ: Sad.

MULDER: Says here that you have a sister. Where is your sister, Gerry?

SCHNAUZ: She passed.

MULDER: Actually, it says here she committed suicide in 1980. That was a bad year. What else happened in 1980, Gerry?

SCHNAUZ: Well, John Lennon got shot. Where the hell are you going with this? What are you, Sigmund Freud? Why don't you cut the BS?

SCULLY: Then why don't we get back to Alice Brandt. Where is she?

SCHNAUZ: (staring at Scully) You look troubled.

MULDER: Hey, Gerry. This your father?

(He shows Gerry the image of the man from the enhanced photograph.)

SCHNAUZ: (gasps) Where'd you get that?

MULDER: You left it for me. You left it like a fingerprint. Is this what you see when you close your eyes, Gerry?

(He shows Gerry the complete photograph. Gerry studies it carefully.)

MULDER: Is that what you see? Gerry ... tell me where Alice Brandt is.

SCHNAUZ: She's safe from the howlers. She's all right now.

MULDER: Gerry ... Tell me how I can find her.



SCENE 15
A RURAL AREA

(A procession of police cars speed down a gravel road. They stop, and officers, with Scully and Mulder, head up a hill. There they find the body of Alice Brandt, clothed in the nightgown. Scully examines the body, noticing darkening around the eye sockets. Scully is visibly upset, then angry. She turns and walks quickly back down the hill leaving the rest around the body. Some minutes later, Mulder walks down and approaches their rented Explorer. Scully is sitting in the driver's seat, obviously ready to go. Mulder stands at the passenger window.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, that word "unruhe", "unrest", is bothering me. Maybe he thought he was curing them somehow, saving him from damnation, from those things in the pictures, you know, he called them the howlers.

SCULLY: It's over, Mulder.

MULDER: Well, then that photo wouldn't be his fantasy. It would be his nightmare.

SCULLY: What the hell does it matter?

MULDER: Because I want to know.

SCULLY: I don't.

(She starts the engine. Mulder stares at her for a second, then gets in the car.)



SCENE 16
THE POLICE STATION

(Gerry is being processed by Officer Trott.)

TROTT: OK, Gerry. All in here, your wallet, jewelry, everything.

(Gerry deposits his possessions in a tray. He is hand-cuffed to the table. The officer takes his fingerprints. Moments later, he takes a police photograph of Gerry.)

TROTT: Eyes straight ahead. (he snaps the photo) Step over to the table.

(Trott hand-cuffs Gerry to the table again, then steps over to the printer to collect the document that is being printed. The document shows the photo in the upper right corner. However, instead of being of Gerry, it shows Trott with a bullet hole in his forehead and blood splattered on the wall behind him.)

TROTT: (looking at photo) What the hell?

(Gerry lunges forward and grabs Trott's gun from his holster and points it at him. A shot is heard.)

(Later, Mulder is examining the document, which now has real blood stains on it. The body of Officer Trott is bagged on the floor. Scully enters, and Mulder motions her over.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: This wound's in the wrong place. He was shot in the throat. He wasn't trying to save this victim.

SCULLY: We just got a report of a strong-arm robbery. It's at the drugstore where the first victim disappeared.



SCENE 17
THE DRUGSTORE

(Officers are examining the scene, while a paramedic attends to a wound on the druggist's head.)

SCULLY: (to the druggist) What happened?

(Meanwhile, Mulder goes to an automatic photo booth and inserts some money.)

SCULLY: (concluding her conversation with the druggist) Thank you. (she walks over to Mulder) It's Gerry.

MULDER: He took the passport camera and all the film in the store.

SCULLY: He also took morphine, scopolamine, hydrobromide and insulin syringes. He's making more twilight sleep.

MULDER: He wants to continue his work.

(The camera in the photo booth beeps and a flash goes off.)

SCULLY: You know, that job site that I arrested him at, Mulder. What if he's ... what if he's already picked out his next victim? There were ... there were apartment buildings on all sides.

MULDER: You think you interrupted his stalking?

SCULLY: Let's go.

MULDER: Hold on a second. You bring the car around. I just want to wait for this. I'll be right there.

(Scully walks around the side of the building and dials a number on her cel phone.)

CORNING: (on phone) Corning.

SCULLY: Corning.

CORNING: Yeah.

SCULLY: Send units to the 300 block of Belmont Avenue. Check all of the apartments in the vicinity of that job site. I think he's heading back there.

CORNING: Got it.

SCULLY: Thanks.

(She hangs up and walks to the Explorer. As she stands at the door and gets her keys, a hand emerges from beneath the car and injects something into her foot with a syringe. Scully cries out in pain, stumbles backward and falls to the pavement. She draws her gun but is unable to use it, slipping quickly into unconsciousness. Schnauz comes out from beneath the car and picks her up.)

(Inside the drugstore, Mulder examines the photo from the photo booth. It is similar to the previous ones but with an image of a screaming Scully. He runs out and around the building but doesn't see her. The Explorer pulls out from behind a truck and speeds away down an alley. Mulder chases on foot.)

MULDER: Scully! Scully!

(The Explorer turns at the end of the alley and speeds away.)

MULDER: Scully!



SCENE 18
THE POLICE STATION

(Mulder is intently studying the picture of Scully that he got from the photo booth in the drugstore. In addition to the howlers, there are six finger-like objects surrounding the upper part of her face.)

CORNING: Sir? Agent Scully's Explorer just turned up. It's abandoned at a Park & Ride about 20 miles up the US 81.

MULDER: Any sightings?

CORNING: Uh, a report of an Audi stolen from the same lot.

MULDER: He's switching cars. He's going to do that two or three times. (looking back at the photograph) (to himself) He's got six fingers here...

CORNING: Sir?

MULDER: (to himself) He's got six fingers. (to Corning) What about his apartment?

SECOND OFFICER: Got a unit at his boarding house, but he ain't coming back.

MULDER: What about friends, relatives, co-workers? Does he have a summer house? A winter house?

CORNING: He doesn't seem to have much of anything. We're running a couple of phone numbers we found in his wallet but so far ...

MULDER: Let me see his wallet.

(Corning tosses it to him. Mulder removes a newspaper clipping from the wallet.)

CORNING: It's his father's obituary.

(The clipping shows a military honor guard surrounding a flag-draped casket at a cemetary.)

MULDER: (reading from the clipping) Recipient of the Bronze Star medal during the Korean War ... Gerald Schnauz, Sr., DDS. He's a retired dentist.



SCENE 19
AT THE FORMER OFFICE OF GERALD SCHNAUZ, SR.

(Mulder kicks in the door and enters with several officers. The office has been deserted for some time. He sees a sign that says "Twilight Sleep. Ask your dentist about it." He breaks into another room that has a dentist's sink but the chair is gone. Mulder sees footprints in the dirt on the floor surrounding the former location of the chair.)

MULDER: He was here.

CORNING: Why would he take the chair?



SCENE 20
THE UNKNOWN LOCATION WHERE ALICE BRANDT WAS HELD CAPTIVE

(Scully is regaining consciousness. It is a small area with padding on the walls. She is tied to a dentist's chair with duct tape around her wrists and ankles. There is a dentist's table next to her with the leucotome. She sees the figure of Schnauz, wearing his construction apron, at the other end.

SCULLY: Let me go.

SCHNAUZ: Shhhh ...

(Schnauz walks over toward the chair. He starts tearing off more pieces of duct tape.)

SCHNAUZ: Es ist alles in Ordnung. [Everything is all right.]

SCULLY: It's over, Gerry. Let me go right now.

SCHNAUZ: Ich werde dir helfen. Du wirst deine Unruhe bald vergessen.

(He starts to cover Scully's mouth with duct tape.)

SCULLY: Aufhören! [Stop!] Ich habe keine Unruhe. [I have no unrest.] Ich habe keine Unruhe. Ich brauche nicht gerettet zu werden. [I don't need to be saved.]

SCHNAUZ: Yes you do. Everybody does, but especially you.

SCULLY: Why? Why me, Gerry? Do I remind you of your sister? Why did your sister kill herself, Gerry? What did your father do to her?

SCHNAUZ: He didn't do anything. It was the howlers.

SCULLY: OK, then let's talk about the howlers.

SCHNAUZ: They live inside your head. They make you do things and say things that you don't mean, and all your good thoughts can't wish them away. You need help. You've got them - right there. (he touches Scully's face between her eyebrows) Don't you feel them?

SCULLY: I don't have them, Gerry.

SCHNAUZ: See? They made you say that, just now, because they know I'm going to kill them.

(He picks up the leucotome from the table.)

SCULLY: What if you're wrong, Gerry?. What if there are no such things as howlers? What if you made them up inside your head to explain the things your sister said your father did?

SCHNAUZ: Great. Now they got you talking like Sigmund Freud. (shouting) I am on to you! I know your tricks! (in normal voice) Besides, I've seen them, in that picture that your partner showed me. Pictures don't lie. You saw them too.

SCULLY: If there are such things as howlers, Gerry, they live only inside your head.

(Schnauz sighs, then backs off to the other side of the area. Scully struggles to reach the table with her left hand, but Schnauz returns with the camera from the drugstore and pushes the table away. He points the camera at Scully, but instead holds the camera at arms length, pointing at himself, and takes a picture.)



SCENE 21
BACK AT SCHNAUZ'S FATHER'S DENTAL OFFICE

(Mulder is pacing the floor.)

MULDER: Six fingers, right. (Corning starts to talk to him) Why are there six? (to Corning) What?

CORNING: We've got the State Police looking as far south as Grand Rapids. Still no sign of him.

(Mulder takes a folder from Corning and frantically looks again at the photo from the drugstore.)

CORNING: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Damn it!

CORNING: What do we do?

(Mulder looks at the photo from the obituary and counts the headstones surrounding the casket.)

MULDER: That's five headstones. And the father makes six. Come on! (He runs out.)

CORNING: (shouting to the other officers) Let's go! Let's go!



SCENE 22
AT THE CEMETARY WHERE SCHNAUZ'S FATHER IS BURIED

(There are six headstones, including Schnauz's father's, in a row. Mulder and the officers run up to them.)

MULDER: Fan out. Check the tree line.

(Mulder sees an opening in a hedge at the edge of the cemetary.)



SCENE 23
THE UNKNOWN PLACE WHERE SCULLY IS HELD CAPTIVE

(Schnauz is nervously looking at a series of photographs that he has just taken. He shows them to Scully.)

SCHNAUZ: Wh ... what does this mean?

SCULLY: It means you need help, Gerry.

(He studies the photos for a few seconds.)

SCHNAUZ: No, I think what it means is that I don't have much time left.

(He pushes the table up to the chair and moves toward Scully with duct tape.)

SCULLY: No, Gerry, stop!

(He puts the tape over her mouth, and Scully's cries are muffled. He picks up the leucotome, but hears the creaking noise of springs. He moves back to the door, while Scully, still gagged, continues to try to free herself. Schnauz looks out a peep hole and sees Mulder outside.)

(Mulder is outside a motorhome. The windows on the door and the rear of motorhome are all shuttered. He walks to the front and looks through the passenger's door window. He sees that the keys in the ignition are on a keychain with a large plastic tooth attached and realizes that it belongs to Schnauz.)

MULDER: (shouts) Scully!

(Scully pulls her left arm free, pulls the duct tape from her mouth and cries out.)

SCULLY: Mulder! I'm in here!

(Mulder tries to break into the door of the motorhome by throwing himself against the door. Inside, Schnauz moves toward Scully with the leucotome. Scully grabs Schnauz's arm with her free hand.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Help! Mulder!

(Outside, Mulder grabs a nearby piece of pipe.)

MULDER: Scully!

(He hits the door window twice with the pipe and it breaks. Mulder reaches inside, unlocks the door and enters. Scully and Schnauz are still struggling inside. Schnauz turns to Mulder, who shoots him once. Schnauz falls.

MULDER: (to Scully) Are you hurt? (Scully shakes her head) (to Corning, who has arrived at the door) Get an ambulance!

(Both Scully and Mulder are breathing heavily. Scully frees her other hand, and Mulder takes her left hand and helps her up. She walks past him to the door, shielding her eyes for a moment from the bright light outside. At the door, she turns to look back at Schnauz for a moment, then steps out.)

(Mulder has watched Scully leave. He then looks down at the photographs lying next to Schnauz. He bends over to pick one up. The photograph shows Schnauz lying on the floor of the motorhome, surrounded by photographs, very similar to his current posture.)



SCENE 24
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(At night, Scully is typing on her laptop computer, with only a single table lamp on. The case file, with all the photographs, is on the table next to the computer. She looks tired.)

SCULLY: Addendum to case report. After his death, a diary was found among Gerald Schnauz's belongings, written in the second person and apparently intended as an open letter to his father. It includes the names of his victims, the women he desired to save. My name is contained in the last entry. I have no further explanation for the existence of the photographs, nor am I confident one is forthcoming. My captivity forced me to understand and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz. My survival depended on it. I see now the value of such insight. For truly to pursue monsters, we must understand them. (She picks up the photo of herself and studies it somberly) We must venture into their minds. Only in doing so, do we risk letting them venture into ours?

[THE END]

                                   THE FIELD WHERE I DIED


SCENE 1

MULDER: At times, I almost dream.

(Mulder is standing in a long field. The grass is tall, up to his waist, and there is no sign of habitation save for a fence. There is a slight breeze. He is looking sorrowfully at two pictures.)

I, too, have spent a life the sages' way and tread once more familiar paths. Perchance I perished in an arrogant self-reliance an age ago... and in that act, a prayer for one more chance went up so earnest, so... instinct with better light let in by death that life was blotted out not so completely... but scattered wrecks enough of it to remain dim memories... as now... when seems once more... the goal in sight again.

(The two pictures are very old and black-and-white, one of a civil war soldier, the other of a belle from the same time. The picture of the belle is ripped in half.)



SCENE 2
TEMPLE OF THE SEVEN STAGE; APISON, TENNESSE; 5:15 AM

BATF AGENT: Federal agents! We are armed!

(The soldiers burst into the room of an old warehouse, carrying riot gear. Most of the light is emanating from the flashlights on their helmets as they go through a hallway and towards a group of screaming people, mostly women.)

Move, move, move! Get down on the ground! We have warrants to search for the possession of illegal firearms!

(His small workforce files through the rooms, pushing people down and opening doors. Two open a door to find two small children being tended to by their mother.)

We are under orders to serve warrants for the arrest of Vernon Warren, also known as Vernon Ephesian!

(People scream and run like mad, afraid for their lives from these government troops. A few break for the door.)

Move it, move it, hold them back! Come on, come on, let's go! Move, move, move!

(Two soldiers run out after them. The whole "temple" is disarray. One poster on the inside of a door reads "Behold I am ALIVE For evermore Rev 1.18." The door is quickly kicked open and the agents pour in, including Mulder and Scully. The room is empty. A man pushed the bed.)

MULDER: Somebody tipped Ephesian off.

SCULLY: He's somewhere here on the compound.

(Sounds of officers making arrests continue in the other rooms. They walk out.)

Ephesian?

BATF AGENT: Nothing. We've covered ninety percent of the compound.

SCULLY: We have to find him.

BATF AGENT: There's no sign of the weapons, they've hid them somewhere.

(A glass door with a design catches Mulder's eye. In fact, it entrances him, as if triggering a memory.)

SCULLY: Where haven't we covered?

BATF AGENT: Well, we can check the machine shop again. Maybe they've got trapdoors.

(Mulder sees a window to a door through the glass he is looking through, one much plainer and leading outside. The sound fades away from him as he goes to the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder. Mulder!

(He walks through, still holding his gun. Scully looks back at the ATF Agent.)

Tear it apart.

(Mulder walks outside and sees agents training their guns on various boxes and grass knolls, searching for their targets. Scully walks out.)

Mulder? Mulder, where are you going?

(Mulder looks out at the field.)

Intelligence reported no hiding places beyond the yard.

(Mulder picks up the pace, jogging, followed by Scully. He stops again, being led on by something.)

Did you see someone?

(Mulder can hear a voice inside of his mind.)

WOMAN: I am he that liveth and was dead. And behold... I am alive forevermore...

(Scully grows suspicious of the field as well and clutches her gun tighter, starting off. A small voice can be heard. Mulder looks around for the location and sees wood glinting out from the dead grass.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: My God,  in the name of the city. My God...

(Her voice grows lower in her prayer. He bends down to the hatch as Scully keeps his gun trained on it, having seen it as well.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: Amen.

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: As in heaven...

(Mulder flings the door open and he and Scully stand over the dark hole, guns aimed at the man and six women inside.)

MULDER: F.B.I.

(They are all holding glasses of red liquid. The woman who had been talking raises the cup to her lips.)

No!

(Mulder dashes in and smacks the cup out of her hand. She gasps, then spits in his face. Mulder flinches, but stares at her, knowing her from somewhere. Vernon reaches out and caresses her cheek.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: It's okay... it's okay...

(Mulder grabs his wrist and handcuffs him, but his attention is still drawn to the young woman that caught his eye. Later, mugshots are taken of Vernon Ephesian, a young blonde, a brunette, an older blonde, an african-american woman, a fat brunette, and Melissa.)

KILEY ON TAPE: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms transmission received... zero-two-thirty hours, five November '96, Apison, Tennessee. Confirmed telephone trace from within Seven Stars compound.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE; 7:25 AM

(The tape continues. Mulder and Scully listen intently. Mulder puts down the mugshot of Melissa.)

BATF, this is Agent Kiley.

MAN ON TAPE: Uh, look, I'm not going to talk long right here, I, I can't even believe that I'm doing this.

(The other man on the tape sounds fairly old and has a raspy voice. Other B.A.T.F.s are listening, as well as Skinner, who is pacing slowly.)

Brilliant. Lookit, Vernon... he, he's got a lot of good ideas. He's, he's right about a lot, a lot of things, but he's doing stuff to kids now that... it... it ain't good, right? And I, I, I'm telling you, it, it's not why I signed on.

KILEY ON TAPE: Okay, okay, easy. Can you tell me your name, sir?

MAN ON TAPE: Call me... Sidney. Now, like I said, Vernon, he's, he's hurting the little kids around here bad. It ain't right. And, man, the guns... my God. Yeah, you could beat the whole Korean army here. Oh, God... I can't talk no more, I gotta...

(The call is cut off and a dialtone comes up. Skinner presses stop.)

SKINNER: This call capped off an eighteen-month B.A.T.F. investigation of the Temple of the Seven Stars led by Vernon Ephesian. Sidney's call convinced the attorney general to give the go ahead for this morning's raid.

MAN #1: The intelligence reports were weak. I mean, our man Spooky found Ephesian in a bunker A.T.F. didn't even know was there.

MAN #2: The bureau is responsible for coordinating a...

(Scully leans over to Mulder, who's reaction was less than wonderful to being called "Spooky" again.)

SCULLY: How did you know that?

(Mulder shakes his head. The two men continue to argue.)

MAN #1: Garbage in, garbage out...

SKINNER: Knock it off! The reports are valid. Illegal activities were going on at the Seven Stars compound. Somehow,  they were alerted in time to hide the evidence. Ephesian and his wives are being held on, frankly, B.S. charges of possession of dangerous chemicals... and you know their attorneys will be pushing for a quick arraignment. They'll be out of here in less than twenty-four hours if we cannot charge them. Agents on site will continue to search for illegal firearms. And even more critical, find the informant "Sidney." If they found out that he tipped us... it's likely we're looking for a murder. All right, go.

(The agents disperse and start out. Mulder closes the laptop in front of him as Skinner walks over. The agents stand.)

Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. You were assigned to this operation to investigate claims of Ephesian's paranormal abilities... channeling, astral projection...

SCULLY: We believe that Ephesian is a paranoid charismatic sociopath. He is obsessed with the book of Revelation and will use his knowledge of biblical text to get anything that he wants from his followers.

SKINNER: Ephesian had six women on the verge of suicide. You witnessed it. My concern is if the temple members are released, any subsequent federal investigation will ignite Ephesian's paranoia to such a degree that we won't have another Waco on our hands... we'll have Jonestown.



SCENE 4
8:12 AM

(Vernon looks up at his interrogator, Scully, who is sitting across from him. Another man, Ephesian's lawyer, is sitting next to Ephesian. Mulder is standing in the back, leaning against the wall.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: I knew you were coming. I've known for nine centuries. It was written in the Revelation of Jesus Christ... "Behold... the devil shall cast some of thee into prison that you may be tried... you'll have tribulation for ten days. Be thou faithful unto death and I'll give thee a crown of life.

(Mulder walks over to Scully.)

MULDER: But that message was to the church of Symrna. It's my understanding that your temple is the reincarnation of the church of Ephesia.

VERNON EPHESIAN: Mine... is the Temple of the Seven Stars. All seven churches receiving the Revelation. And the members are not a reincarnation of the church.

MULDER: Are you?

VERNON EPHESIAN: Oh, yes, I was present to hear Apostle John Mark deliver his message of the apocalypse.

(Mulder walks back to his wall.)

SCULLY: Vernon, if Sidney was unfaithful, did he receive a "crown of life?"

ATTORNEY: There are no members of the temple named or nicknamed "Sidney."

VERNON EPHESIAN: But I know you don't believe. See, I don't care if you think that I'm Jim Jones or David Koresh. I don't need you to believe or even like me. But just for a moment, I'd like you to put aside your investigation... for your own souls. It is vital that you understand that soon, very, very soon, all unfaithfuls, all disbelievers, all beasts, if that means me or... this "Sidney" or... you...

(He points to Mulder.)

All will be destroyed by God's mighty men. It is what has been told by God will happen. It is what has been told by God we must do. Do this and the "Lord shall preserve you from all evil. He will preserve your soul. The Lord will preserve your going out... and your coming in."



SCENE 5
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(Mulder continues to stare at Melissa's mugshot. Her prison number is "104622." Telephones ring and people chatter incessantly in the back.)

SCULLY: Skinner said no one else has come up with anything. As you can see, they've started to release members of the temple.

(A line of people are pouring up the stairs, hence the ruckus.)

The compound remains under federal control, though.

(Scully looks at Mulder for a second, worried over his obsession with the woman.)

Well, time is flying, we've got six wives to question. My estimate is twelve more hours of fire and brimstone and not a second about Sidney.

(She takes a sip of her coffee. Mulder holds up the picture.)

MULDER: Let's start with her.



SCENE 6
INTERROGATION ROOM

(The ashtray already has one butt, and Melissa picks the freshly-lit cigarette up and takes a drag off it.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: My name is Melissa Riedal-Ephesian, I'm twenty-five.

SCULLY: Melissa, do you understand your right to have an attorney present in this questioning?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: It's okay.

(Mulder, sitting across from her, stares at her, smiling slightly, entranced with her.)

MULDER: Where are you from?

(Melissa racks her brain, searching for an answer.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: I, I don't know.

SCULLY: What about your family, where do they live?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: My real family is here.

SCULLY: How long have you lived there?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: A year.

SCULLY: How long have you been married to Ephesian?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: A year.

MULDER: Does it bother you that he has other wives?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: "And on that day, seven women shall take hold of one man, saying 'we shall eat our own bread, we shall wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.'"

SCULLY: That's quite a faith you have in Vernon there, Melissa. I'd have a tough time if my husband had so many children with other women.

(A tear starts to roll down Melissa's cheek. She shrugs, smirking.)

Do you have a child by Vernon?

(Melissa smiles.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Someday. Vernon has to wait until God tells him when the right soul is ready to be reincarnated. That's why Vernon's children are the most sacred members of the temple.

MULDER: We were told that Vernon's been hurting the children.

(Melissa takes another slow drag.)

SCULLY: Have you ever witnessed any child abuse at the temple, Melissa?

(Melissa drifts off as Scully and Mulder watch her intently, confused slightly. Suddenly, she slams her fist down on the table, her face scrunched, her eyes narrow. Her voice is not only like Sidney's, but it is Sidney's.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Lookit! I don't know where you two are getting that from! I mean, I saw a couple of things, I mean, you know, it, it, it could have been anything, right?

SCULLY: Melissa?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Melissa? No. I don't know nobody called that.

MULDER: Sidney?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: What is this? The McCarthy hearings? No, no. Don't, don't know anybody by that name, no.

(Scully looks at her notes, aghast. Mulder isn't so surprised. Scully writes down "multiple personality" and shows it to Mulder.)

I saw a couple of things. It could have been anything, right?

(Mulder poises to write something.)

MULDER: Sidney, can you tell me who the president of the United States is right now?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Who is the president of the United States? What the hell kind of dumb question is that?

(Mulder writes down "past life." Scully looks over at Mulder as if he's leaping to conclusions.)

That is a stupid question. Harry Truman!

(Scully looks back at Melissa, wide-eyed. Mulder and Scully lean over to each other, whispering.)

SCULLY: You're claiming Sidney is her past life just because she mentioned Joe McCarthy?

MULDER: It's not just that. Somehow I just knew.

(They look back at Melissa, who calmly takes a drag from her cigarette, back to normal.)



SCENE 7
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(Mulder looks at a map of the surrounding area and bunkers. Scully is sitting. Skinner walks in, carrying a folder.)

SKINNER: Ephesian and his wives are being arraigned tomorrow morning. That's about fifteen hours to come up with something.

(He throws the folder down onto his desk.)

MULDER: Come up with something? We found "Sidney." Voice spectrogram confirms that Melissa Riedal's vocal pattern matches the A.T.F. "Sidney" call.

SCULLY: Melissa Riedal is not cooperating.

MULDER: But there is a personality in her that wants to. We need a psychological catalyst. I suggest we take her back to the compound. Maybe exposing her to that environment with Ephesian present will somehow enable Melissa to talk, or a personality inside her.

SKINNER: Agent Scully, could this be some kind of a stall or a staged diversion? It's my understanding that multiple personalities are rare.

SCULLY: They're extremely rare.

(She stands.)

In fact, many in the psychiatric community do not believe that dissociative identity disorder exists.

MULDER: What we witnessed meets the criteria established in the D.S.M.-IV. The presence of two distinct personality states that would currently take control over behavior, including the "protector" identity, Sidney. The inability to recall important personal information. She couldn't recall her own hometown. Transitions from one personality state to another are usually a matter of seconds and are often caused by psychosocial stress. Sidney appeared when we mentioned the children had been abused.

(Skinner looks at Scully.)

SKINNER: But you remain unconvinced?

SCULLY: I believe the disorder exists, but in this case, under these circumstances, I would have to know more.

SKINNER: If Melissa has multiple personalities, would her... his... testimony even be admissible?

MULDER: Judicial precedents have established that dissociative personalities are responsible.

SCULLY: Yes, but we are responsible for Melissa Riedal.

MULDER: What we are responsible for is the potential loss of fifty lives.

(They stare at each other for a moment, then look to Skinner.)

SKINNER: Do it.

(He walks out. Mulder walks over to the laptop and closes it up.)

SCULLY: You didn't even have the courage to tell Skinner what you really believe... that Melissa Riedal is being invaded by her past-life incarnations.

MULDER: Because he wouldn't believe me.

SCULLY: I don't believe that you feel responsible for those fifty lives... or Melissa Riedal. You are only responsible to yourself, Mulder.

(He puts on his coat, having finished packing up. He then proceeds to walk out angrily.)



SCENE 8
TEMPLE OF THE SEVEN STARS; 4:27 PM

(The two agents and Melissa have come back to the temple.)

MULDER: You're safe with us, Melissa. The murderer's not here.

SCULLY: We know that events occurred here that, uh, that may be painful. You may not want to talk about them. They may be so painful, you may be afraid to remember. But to help the others... to help the children and to help yourself... we're here with you to listen. To Melissa, to "Sidney," to whoever may need to talk.

(Melissa's eyes dart around quickly, her whole body tense. She walks into Ephesian's room. The bed has been moved back into place. Scully and Mulder watch her from a good distance. She walks over to a series of pictures with her and Vernon, starting to tear up. Scully walks next to her as she puts down her wedding picture and cries. Mulder closes the door and reads the poster. They walk into another section of the temple and find Melissa sitting at a child's desk as she tries to regather her emotions. The children's pictures are around, as well as some meager toys. Scully kneels down in front of her and Mulder sits off to the side.)

Melissa? Melissa.

(Melissa is coloring on the desk with a red crayon.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Why you call me that?

(Her voice is in the tone of a little girl's.)

SCULLY: What should I call you?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Lily.

(Scully glances over to Mulder.)

SCULLY: Lily... were any of your friends hurt in this room?

(Melissa looks up at her.)

What?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Can you do this?

(She moves her bottom lip over her top lip, playing.)

SCULLY: Melissa, Lily... it's okay to tell me.

(She starts to cry and stands slowly. Suddenly, her face scrunches and she wags her finger wildly as before. As Sidney.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Lookit, leave the kid alone. Hear me? She doesn't want to talk, right? No way. I'm sending her home.

MULDER: Sidney, you can all go home. You can all be safe if you tell us where they hid the guns.

(Melissa untenses and brushes the hair out of her voice. She stoically walks out of the room and looks through the glass door that Mulder spied before. As he did, she looks through the window to the door on the other side. She walks through both doors, Mulder and Scully quick to follow. He stops and looks out at the field again. Scully looks back at him, worried.)

SCULLY: What's wrong?

(He walks by her after Melissa. She follows. Melissa looks out into the field in almost the same way as Mulder did. She talks with a southern drawl.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: The weapons were placed in the bunker which they had built the night before.

(Scully takes out her notepad.)

SCULLY: That's why they weren't on the A.T.F. reports.

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: The federals would arrive in the morning, just before the sun.

(She walks out a little farther into the field. The agents follow, Scully taking notes.)

Realizing the government's might and number, most believed they, indeed, would never again see the light of day... just as they had watched their brothers die days before on Missionary Ridge.

(Scully looks up at her, recognizing the name. Melissa walks slowly again.)

We had received word of General Cleburn's retreat from the Union army. As a nurse, I had been ordered from Hamilton County to meet the troops, but... in actuality, I was searching for him, knowing that he would attempt to remain in Tennessee rather than retreat to Dalton.

(Mulder takes a few steps forward, her words ringing harshly upon his ears.)

I found him here amongst the others who had been lost as General Thomas pushed through the Confederate line. The federal troops would appear from that direction.

(She points over to the treeline where the sun is setting.)

Rather than retreat any further, they fought them... hiding us in the bunker. Inside, I could smell the smoke, hear their rifles... feel their bodies as they dropped onto the ground above. Every last one.

(She fights back her tears rigidly.)

Twenty-sixth of November. 1863.

(Scully has stopped taking notes and the two are watching her. Melissa turns to face them.)

I was here.

(Mulder looks up at her. Their eyes meet.)

As were you. This is the field where I watched you die.

(Tears well up in her eyes. Mulder shows no flicker of emotion, as if he knows this as well.)



SCENE 9
TENNESSEE

(Mulder and Scully are driving down a local road, Mulder at the wheel. Melissa is asleep in the back of the truck. Mulder has his cellular phone to his ear.)

SCULLY: Who are you calling?

MULDER: I'm arranging for a therapist trained in hypnosis to be at the command center.

SCULLY: Because hypnosis is used in the treatment of dissociative identities to bring forth a patient's various personalities?

MULDER: She wants to talk, Scully. It's a matter of getting it out of her.

SCULLY: No, it's about regressing her to a past life.

(She pulls on his arm and he turns off the phone.)

Don't do this to her, Mulder. This poor woman's mind, her life, is in shreds. Just being married to Ephesian indicates that, that she is susceptible to suggestion.

(Mulder hits the steering wheel, incredibly angry, screaming at the top of his lungs.)

MULDER: You, you were there, Scully! You saw it. You heard it. Why can't you feel it?

(Scully looks half-ashamed, half-worried.)

How could I know about a bunker in a field where I've never been?

SCULLY: And why is it that Vernon Ephesian is, reported by you, a paranoid sociopath because he believes that he lived in Greece a hundred years ago, and you're not, even though you believe you died in that field?

(Mulder looks away, anger and frustration in his eyes.)



SCENE 10
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(Melissa sits in a chair, a desk-lamp near her. The therapist's soothing voice coats the air. Her eyes are closed and she rubs her thumb under her fingers, which is in the air, her elbow rested on the chair arm.)

THERAPIST: I'm talking to Melissa. In the last year, at the Temple of the Seven Stars, is there anything that happened that you thought was wrong that hurt you?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Yes. There was a... woman who came to the temple. She and her son had been living on the street.

THERAPIST: What was her name?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Elizabeth.

(A microphone is on the table between Melissa and the therapist, who is also sitting. Scully and Mulder are close by her, Mulder sitting.)

Her son was Scott. Vernon took a liking to the boy. He said that he was a prophet returning. He took the boy away from his mother.

THERAPIST: Took him away? How?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Vernon's children are the grandchildren of God, kept separate from the others. The mother's heart was broken. She was afraid. The mighty men... late... night... Liz sneaks in to see Scott. Oh, he was happy.

(She smiles briefly.)

She bring, she brings him Butterfingers she stole from the kitchen.

(She starts to cry.)

Vernon... Vernon... Vernon catches them... the mighty men... they pull her away... and beat her in front of her son. The boy, "no! No, mom..."

(She weeps freely as the boy must have done that night. Scully takes notes as Melissa moans in tears.)

Vernon... Vernon... Vernon pulls him by... Vernon pulls him by his hair.

(She composes herself somewhat.)

Pulls down his pajamas, and he hit him. "you're not a child of God... garbage," he called him. Told him to sleep in the trash... with the rats. Oh, the mother... the mother cries...

(Tears well up again.)

But Vernon beats him in front of her. "Uh, oh, no, no, no, no..."

(Sidney reemerges, much to the surprise of her onlookers. Her finger wags wildly, her eyes squinted.)

Lookit! Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant move. What do you want to know? Just, just leave Melissa alone. She doesn't need to go through that anymore.

(The therapist looks over to Scully, who mouths the words "ask her where the guns.")

THERAPIST: Where are the guns?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: The... the bunkers, yeah. The, uh, uh... the Civil War bunkers, yeah. Vernon, Vernon, Vernon and his goons know, but I don't. I really don't.

(Scully leans over to Mulder.)

SCULLY: Maybe there's a map of the battlefield down in the records.

MULDER: You know how to find the other bunkers.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He waves her off slightly and looks back at Melissa.)

MULDER: Melissa...

(Melissa suddenly tenses, Sidney receding.)

It's me, Melissa. I want you to go back... back to the field.

(She opens her eyes and looks over to him.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Oh... oh...

(She reaches out to him, smiling. Her voice becomes brighter, a southern drawl protruding.)

Your eyes may have changed shade, but it cannot color the soul behind them. We have come together in this life, this time. Only to meet in passing.

(She starts to cry, placing her hand over her heart.)

It is so heartbreaking to wait.

(She starts to sob. Mulder's eyes grow tears as well.)

I miss you.

(They stare at each other before Melissa leans back in her chair, that past life fading. Scully leans over to Mulder again as he rubs the tears out of his eyes.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this is a product of her illness. She couldn't answer the question of the battlefield. She gave us no specific names, no information to prove her validity. There is nothing we can do to prove that this is the truth.

MULDER: There is one way.

SCULLY: Mulder, Ephesian's arraignment is in two hours. There is no time to be doing this.

MULDER: Wouldn't you, Scully? Wouldn't anybody?

(Mulder is now in the chair, his hand also raised in the same way, his eyes closed.)

THERAPIST: I want you to go into your past, beyond your life as Fox Mulder.

(His breathing is ragged.)

What do you see?

(He sighs and moans. Scully is standing in the back.)

MULDER: Ghetto streets... shattered glass... bodies of the dead... I'm a woman... a Jewish woman... Poland. My son is with me. He is Samantha.

THERAPIST: Samantha? I thought Samantha was your sister.

MULDER: In this life, she is my son.

(His eyes open.)

I see my father.

(He looks down, tearful.)

He's dead in the street. He is Scully...

(Scully's eyes widen slightly.)

But now... he's gone on now... waiting for us. The souls... come back together... different... but always together... again and again... to learn. I can't go to my father.

(He shakes his head, almost crying.)

Gestapo is standing next to him. An officer... he's Cancer Man... evil returns as evil...

(He lifts his head now, holding his eyes closed for a few seconds. He then opens them, and they are more hopeful.)

But love... love... souls mate eternal... my... husband... is taken away from me. To the camps. He is Melissa. We're always taken away.

(He starts to cry. Scully is deeply saddened by this, almost crying herself. He looks up, tears fading.)

I'm rising... I'm rising now... I'm rising now... high above...  my body. Above the field. My face is bloody. Near the bunker... the federals are gone... my sergeant is also dead. He is Scully.

(Scully is less shocked by this, listening closely.)

Sarah holds me. She is sad.

(His tears well up again. He shakes his head slightly.)

She is Melissa. She lives... near... the battle... Hamilton County... her name is Kavanaugh. Sarah Kavanaugh...

(Scully writes this down.)

And my name... is Sullivan Biddle.

(Sadness grows inside him again.)

She doesn't know... she doesn't know... that, that I'm waiting for her... that we will live again. We will live again. Oh, God... oh, my soul is tired.

(Scully kneels down in front of him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's Scully. Do you see any bunkers in the field?

MULDER: My soul is tired. I want to rest.

(She stands up.)



SCENE 11
HAMILTON COUNTY HALL OF RECORDS; 4:12 AM

(Scully traces her finger over a map of the battlefield. She folds up the book, which is "Maps and Battle Plans; 1863-1865." She looks over to the county register, containing files from 1800-1900. Placing down a book, she flips through pages until she comes to the name she wants: "Biddle, Sullivan." Then she finds the next name: "Kavanaugh, Sarah." Gasping slightly, she pulls open a drawer containing photographs and digs through until she finds the picture that Mulder was holding. On the back, it reads "Sullivan Biddle, 1862." Scully looks at the picture for a second, then digs through and finds "Sarah Kavanaugh, 1858." It is the second picture Mulder had.)



SCENE 12
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(Mulder stares at the two pictures placed in front of him.)

SCULLY: Ephesian's being taken down to his arraignment. He and Melissa are going to be released soon.

MULDER: Dana, if, um... early in the four years we've been working together... an event occurred that suggested or somebody told you that... we'd been friends together in other lifetimes... always... wouldn't it have changed some of the ways we looked at one another?

SCULLY: Even if I knew for certain, I wouldn't change a day.

(She heads for the door then looks back.)

Well, maybe that Flukeman thing. I could've lived without that just fine.

(She smirks and walks out. He smiles. Later, he and Melissa are listening to the tape of Melissa's regression.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN ON TAPE: We have come together in this life, this time. Only to meet in passing.

(Her voice cracks on the tape.)

It is so heartbreaking to wait.

(She sighs.)

I miss you.

(Mulder stops the tape.)

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: I don't believe in it.

MULDER: Why?

MELISSA RIEDAL-EPHESIAN: Those tapes are saying that we chose the lives we live before we're born, and who we live with. It's a nice idea. It's a beautiful idea. I want to believe.

(Mulder is surprised by her choice of words.)

And if I knew it were true, I'd want to start over. I'd want to end this pointless life.

(Mulder leans forward, speaking with a slight southern drawl.)

MULDER: Sarah... if it were true... no life would be pointless.

(She looks down at Kavanaugh's picture, then back up at Mulder. The door opens and Vernon looks in, his followers behind him.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: Melissa... it's time to leave.

(Melissa rips up the picture of Kavanaugh and walks out with it. Mulder sighs and stands, then folds his arms against the cabinet and lays his head against it in defeat.)

MAN: All right, let's go, y'all.

(Scully walks in.)

SCULLY: I've reported to investigators on the site about the possible existence of other bunkers.



SCENE 13
TEMPLE OF THE SEVEN STARS

(Vernon's group is congregated in the woods. Scully speaks over the scene.)

SCULLY: It's not the property of the Seven Stars, so the B.A.T.F. is continuing to search.

(The rest of the temple runs out to greet their returning leaders.)

GIRL: Mommy!

(Vernon wades through the crowd, stopping to hug a few people. Along with a mighty man, they see troops combing the area. Vernon looks over to Melissa, who stares at the ground and shows no emotion.)



SCENE 14
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(Mulder is looking at the map, Scully is sitting. Skinner is also standing near the table.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, the attorney general is furious as is, there's no way we're going to get a go-ahead for a second move on the compound.

MULDER: Ephesian preaches and his followers' believe that the F.B.I. and the A.T.F. are the devil's army, prophesied in Revelations 12:17, to make war on "the seed which keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ."

SCULLY: Revelations tells of Christian faith defeating that army.

SKINNER: You're saying he'll attack the A.T.F. agents searching for the bunker, and believing his prophesied, he'll win?

MULDER: I would be saying that if I thought he believed in Revelations in its entirety... but he hid the weapons.

SCULLY: Ephesian knew that he couldn't defeat us.

MULDER: If he doesn't believe that he can defeat the devil's army, he may think that by denying himself and his followers to the devil... by denying himself, do you understand? He will achieve for them the reward of life "forevermore..." and our worst fears will be realized.



SCENE 15
TEMPLE OF THE SEVEN STARS

(A mighty man opens the doors to a large room in the temple, followed by fellow worshippers.)

MIGHTY MAN: All members to worship. The Lord shall preserve you from all your evils. He shall preserve your soul.

(Men and women file out of rooms down the hallway. Melissa stares coldly at the mighty man. Vernon reaches out for her.)

All members to worship. The Lord shall preserve you from all your evil.

(Vernon grabs her arm gently and walks with her towards the main room.)

He shall preserve your soul.

(The congregants gather in front of a podium where Vernon stands. Melissa walks in slowly.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: Marvel not, my brethren, that the world hate you.

(Two men with assault rifles barricade the door and take positions near the windows.)

We know we've passed from death unto life because we love the brethren.



SCENE 16
FEDERAL COMMAND CENTER; CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE

(The B.A.T.F. Agent is furious at Skinner and the two agents.)

BATF AGENT: No, I will not remove our people, we're close to finding the weapons.

SKINNER: All I want is a cooling-off period.

(Agent Riggins walks in.)

RIGGINS: Ephesian's gathered all temple members in the worship hall. A parabolic mike we have aimed at the compound just picked this up.

(He puts a tape into the player and presses play.)

VERNON EPHESIAN ON TAPE: Marvel not, my brethren, that the world hate you.

(There is a sound of the door locking.)

We know we've passed from death unto life because we love the brethren. Hereby perceive we the love of God because we make heaven's life for us.

(Scully, realizing something, boots up her laptop. Riggins stops the tape.)

RIGGINS: The temple began running an interference frequency.

SCULLY: First epistle of John, Chapter Three: "He laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren."

SKINNER: Okay, Mulder.

(Mulder starts off.)



SCENE 17
TEMPLE OF THE SEVEN STARS

(A red liquid is being poured into glasses from a incredibly large container.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life.

(It is clear what the liquid is, since there is a large separate bottle clearly marked "poison" next to it. Men start to pass out the glasses.)

My little children... let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and truth.

(Melissa tentatively takes a glass.)

And hereby we know that we are the truth.

(Seeing agents gather a few yards away, the assassins of the temple break the window with the tip of their guns and start firing rounds off.)

And shall the stewards...

(The B.A.T.F. agents fire back, but one screams as he is hit.)

MAN #1: Man down! Man down!

(Melissa stares at the glass. Two vans drive up.)

Get him out of there!

MAN #2: Cease fire! Hold your fire, hold your fire!

(Mulder and Scully run out of the van and over to an agent.)

MULDER: Is there contact with the temple?

AGENT: If you call that "contact."

(They look over to the downed man being checked on. A man talks into a walkie-talkie.)

MAN: ...needs to be transported right away. Yeah

(Inside, Vernon is in full swing now, pacing around his followers.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: "...and enter in through the gates into the city. For without... are dogs... and sorcerers...

(Men and women start to take drinks of their poison shots.)

"And whoremongers... and murderers... idolaters...

(Slowly, the whole congregation is drinking to their death. Vernon stops walking and looks down at Melissa, speaking softly.)

"And whomsoever... loveth and maketh a lie."

(Melissa looks up at him, her finger wagging, her face scrunched, eyes squinted. Outside, Mulder, perhaps empowered by Sullivan Biddle again, takes off his coat and walks towards the temple, hands in the air.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no! You're dead!

(Inside, the only sounds are the screams of the agents. Everyone is dead. Bodies are strewn across each other. Mulder reaches the door. Melissa's eyes flutter open and she looks over at the massacre around her. Only she has survived... save for Vernon, who stands over her. She starts to cry. Mulder breaks open the door.)

VERNON EPHESIAN: "Behold... I am alive forevermore."

(He hands her a fresh glass of poison as she sobs softly. Mulder races down, trying to stop. Melissa looks out of the window, out onto her field, then looks down with new clarity. Mulder reaches the main room and opens the door... to find a massacre. Stepping over fresh bodies, he makes his way amidst the horror to the podium, where he kneels and finds Vernon dead, hand over the Bible. But he does not look at Vernon, but Melissa, clutching the ripped photograph of Sarah Kavanaugh in her wake. He starts to cry and takes the picture. Scully walks in with agents and stares at Mulder, who caresses Melissa's shoulder and looks out onto their field through the window. His voice echoes over the scene.)

MULDER: At times, I almost dream.

(Mulder is standing in a long field. The grass is tall, up to his waist, and there is no sign of habitation save for a fence. There is a slight breeze. He is looking sorrowfully at two pictures.)

I, too, have spent a life the sages' way and tread once more familiar paths. Perchance I perished in an arrogant self-reliance an age ago... and in that act, a prayer for one more chance went up so earnest, so... instinct with better light let in by death that life was blotted out not so completely... but scattered wrecks enough of it to remain dim memories... as now... when seems once more... the goal in sight again.

(The two pictures are very old and black-and-white, one of a civil war soldier, the other of a belle from the same time. The picture of the belle is ripped in half.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
AESTHETIC SURGERY UNIT
GREENWOOD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
CHICAGO, IL

(Surgery lines are drawn on patients stomach.)

NURSE WAITE: Miss Holland, Im Nurse Waite. Ill be assisting in your procedure.

HOLLAND: Is it going to hurt?

NURSE WAITE: You wont feel a thing. There isnt even any blood. Dr. Lloyds done over a thousand lipo procedures. Youre in good hands.

ORDERLY: OK, here we go.

(NURSE WAITE and ORDERLY wheel her down the hall.)

NURSE WAITE: Im going to give a tranquilizer now, and then right before the operation the doctor will give you injections of saline and anesthetic. And all you have to worry about is buying a new wardrobe.

DUTY NURSE: Here are your messages doctor.

BACKGROUND DOCTOR: Oh, fine thanks.

(NURSE WAITE enters scrub room.)

NURSE WAITE: Your liposuction patient is prepped and waiting in room five.

DR. LLOYD: (frantically scrubbing his hands) Fine, what else am I scheduled for?

NURSE WAITE: Youve got a scalp reduction, and a blepharoplasty following.

DR. LLOYD: Are they prepped?

NURSE WAITE: Um, no. Would you like me...

DR. LLOYD: Get them ready please. Id like to move right along this morning.

NURSE WAITE: Yes, doctor. (She leaves.)

(He is scrubbing his hands so hard that they bleed.)



SCENE 2
OPERATING ROOM

(DR. LLOYD puts on latex gloves, bloody fingers still visible. Makes incision in patient. Inserts liposuction tool. We see fat sucked out.)

CUT TO:

NURSE WAITE: (entering HOLLANDS pre-op room. ) How are you doing?

HOLLAND: Is the doctor going to be much longer? I think my tranquilizers starting to wear off.

NURSE WAITE: Im sorry, um, I -- I dont know where...

CUT TO:

(operating room, DR. LLOYD is violently stabbing liposuction tool into unconscious patient, who at this point we see has lines drawn on his balding head. Fat being sucked through tube turns bright red.)

CUT TO:

(NURSE WAITE exiting pre-op room. Views monitor of operating room 5 which shows the actions of DR. LLOYD. She enters the OR)

NURSE WAITE: Doctor Lloyd!!

DOCTOR LLOYD: (pulling down his mask) I think this patient is finished.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
OFFICE IN HOSPITAL

(MULDER and SCULLY interviewing DR. LLOYD. LAWYER present.)

DOCTOR LLOYD: What else do you call it? When youre in your body and out if it at the same time? Without the ability to control your actions  to stop yourself from doing what I did to that poor young man? What else do you call it?

MULDER: Spirit possession or demon possession. While these kinds of extraordinary mental states have been well documented throughout history, theyve been much maligned, rightly or wrongly, and havent held up in court well as a criminal defense.

LAWYER: I would like to reiterate that I have advised my client against speaking to you, and I would appreciate it if you would direct any legal discussion to counsel.

SCULLY: Doctor Lloyd, are you currently taking any kind of medication?

DOCTOR LLOYD: The occasional sleeping pill, and uh, uh, prescription antacid for my stomach.

SCULLY: Would you mind allowing me to check the dosage, and which ones?

DOCTOR LLOYD: No, I really... I would like to know why, because I...

LAWYER: I think youve gotten a clear picture of my clients story and his willingness to go along with your investigation.

MULDER: Yes, I believe we have.

SCULLY: Doctor Lloyd, you say that youve taken sleeping pills. How much sleep did you get the night before?

DOCTOR LLOYD: (looks at LAWYER who shakes his head): I, uh...I cant recall.



SCENE 4
GREENWOOD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

(MULDER and SCULLY exit elevator)

SCULLY: The sleeping pill he was taking was something called Somanil.

MULDER: Ive heard of it.

SCULLY: Its popular because it works directly on the central nervous system and it isnt stored in body tissue past its intended use. But its also very controversial for its addictivness and its effect on long term behavior.

MULDER: What  What was the date of ah, Dr. Lloyds prescription?

SCULLY: (reading folder) Well, he started taking the drug five years ago, and he went through  ooh, he took a lot of it. 19 one hundred tablet refills.

MULDER: (looking at attractive nurse in the hall) Wow.

SCULLY: (still looking at folder) Yeah.

(MULDER breaks crime scene tape over operating room 3, and they enter. MULDER turns on light)

SCULLY: You know, thats more than a pill a day.

MULDER: An addiction in other words.

SCULLY: An addiction which very well could have altered his ability to do his job.

MULDER: How many of these procedures would you say Dr. Lloyds performed?

SCULLY: Judging from his schedule the day of the accident, hundreds, and probably thousands.

MULDER: And not one fatality.

SCULLY: Youre missing my point here, Mulder. This  this place is a veritable factory. Cosmetic surgery is the boom industry of the medical world. And ASU wards like this are a gold mine.

MULDER: Everybodys doing it, so I hear.

SCULLY: And a brand new, state of the art facility like this can support an entire hospital.

MULDER: (bending down to look at marks on bloody floor) What do you suppose these are?

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: These five marks on your brand new state of the art floor?

SCULLY: Well, they look like they were made by, uh, the coasters from an OR table or some kind of equipment.

MULDER: They look to me like they were burned or scorched.

(MULDER uses tongue-depressor to connect dots with blood in shape of a pentagram.)

MULDER: In the shape of a pentagram.

SCULLY: (giving him *the look*) Mulder, if you want to connect the dots here, you should look at the facts. (MULDER rolls his eyes) Latrogenic deaths or  or deaths due to doctor error are upwards of 80,000 a year. Dr. Lloyd was pushing his limits. He was an accident waiting to happen.

MULDER: Im not a doctor , Scully, but youve got to be pushing pretty hard to mistake a beer belly for a bald head  not to mention door number three.

(He indicates operating room number as he exits. SCULLY follows and they watch monitor in another OR.)

MULDER: Its amazing that no one saw him in time to stop him.

SCULLY: Maybe they were all possessed.

MULDER: I dont think its just a simple possession, Scully. I think its more like sorcery or black magic or something like that.

(NURSE WAITE comes out of OR 5.)

MULDER: (to NURSE WAITE) Excuse me, what kind of procedure is that up there?
(indicates OR 5)

NURSE WAITE: Its a rhinoplasty. Im sorry, who are you?

SCULLY: Uh, were with the FBI. Im Agent Scully, and this is Agent Mulder. Were investigating a patients death here.

NURSE WAITE: Oh, uh ...yes. (hangs her head)

SCULLY: (looking at NURSE WAITES name tag) Youre Rebecca Waite. You were the attending nurse at the time. Am I correct?

NURSE WAITE: Yes.

SCULLY: Could you explain to me what happened to Dr. Lloyd. How - how a mistake like this could happen?

NURSE WAITE: No - no I-I cant really, um, I wasnt in the OR at the time and ... its, uh, difficult for me in my position.

SCULLY: Did you observe Dr. Lloyd at all before the accident?

NURSE WAITE: I helped prep the patient. I was supposed to assist. I did my job as a nurse.

MULDER: Are you aware that Dr. Lloyd is claiming he was possessed during the incident?

NURSE WAITE: (pause, smiles) I guess its cheaper than malpractice insurance.

MULDER: Uh huh. (smiles)

(DR. SHANNON comes out of OR 5)

DR.SHANNON: (to NURSE WAITE) Give him 500 c.c.s of ringers wide open before he goes to recovery. I need you to keep up with me here.

NURSE WAITE: (leaving) Right away, Dr. Shannon.

SCULLY: (holding badge) Uh, Dr. Shannon, can we have a word with you, please?

DR. SHANNON: Im sorry. Ive got a patient who cant wait. (She closes door of another room.)

SCULLY: Yeah, theres magic going on here, Mulder, only its being done with silicone, collagen, and a well placed scalpel.

(SCULLY looks at monitor with disgust, MULDER looks with interest.)



SCENE 5
BOARD ROOM

(Wood table has pentagram.)

DR. KAPLAN: What we have to do here is keep calm and do nothing out of the ordinary. The appearance here of any dissembling or impropriety will only deepen the FBIs probe on top of Dr. Lloyds insurance investigation.

DR. ILAQUA: Dr. Lloyd has made us a target.

DR. SHANNON: The last thing we need is to be caught up in an expose.

DR. KAPLAN: Then they start looking at our books again. I mean its bad enough we have to explain why buttock lipostructures cost 4,000 a pop.

DR. ILAQUA: We look greedy, therefore we look guilty.

DR. FRANKLYN: We havent done anything wrong, Dr. Ilaqua.

DR. KAPLAN: If we give any credence or credibility to Dr. Lloyds story, theyre going to burn us at the stake.

DR. SHANNON: What about the other personnel. They were talking to the nurse .. Waite?

DR. FRANKLYN: She cant tell them anything. ... because she doesnt know anything.



SCENE 6
PREP ROOM

FEMALE PATIENT: I cant feel my feet. Im having a skin peel, but I cant feel my feet.

NURSE WAITE: Its okay, its okay. Your feet are still there. They arent going anywhere.

FEMALE PATIENT: I ... its just .. Im afraid to be put to sleep. What if I dont wake up?

NURSE WAITE: Not to worry, not to worry. I want you to relax and think about your beautiful new face.

(NURSE WAITE is pulling leeches off the FEMALE PATIENTS belly. They have left five marks that form a pentagram.)

NURSE WAITE: Youre in good hands. Were going to protect you.



SCENE 7
MULDERS HOTEL ROOM

(He is looking in mirror, scrunching his nose. Knock at the door. MULDER lets SCULLY in.)

SCULLY: You wanted to show me something?

MULDER: Yeah. A videotape. (Puts tape in VCR.) This videotape of the operation shows that the five marks delineating the pentagram were in evidence prior to the patients death.

SCULLY: Stop it a second. (Tape show Lloyd stabbing with liposuction tool.) My god, Mulder. He basically stabbed the man to death in his sleep.

MULDER: Which only underscores the strangeness. A sane man acting under his own volition could never perform such an act. Look. (points out marks) There.

SCULLY: Well, presuming that has anything to do with this, who would have put them there?

MULDER: I dont know. A pentagram is supposed to be a symbol of protection and positive power used to control the elemental forces.

SCULLY: Well, then it doesnt even make sense.

MULDER: Yeah, but it does make sense that - that witchcraft or black magic would find a theatre in a place like this, preying on the weak and vainglorious.

SCULLY: But theres no other evidence of anything like witchcraft taking place here.

MULDER: Maybe there is. What was that, uh, prescription that Dr. Lloyd was taking?

SCULLY: The sleeping pills?

MULDER: No, the stomach antacid. Read me what its made from.

SCULLY: "An anti-spasmodic whose active ingredients include belladonna alkaloids "

MULDER: Belladonna. Its also known as Witchs Berry  thats an herb used in hexing rituals.

SCULLY: Mulder, do you know how many pharmaceuticals listed in the PDR contain belladonna?

MULDER: Yeah, just one  the one Dr. Lloyd was taking.

SCULLY: Well, if its that simple, why dont you put out an APB for someone riding a broom and wearing a tall black hat?

MULDER: (smiles sarcastically, wounded) You jest, Scully, but theres a good chance that this hex or ritual or whatever it is, may not be finished.



SCENE 8
SCRUB ROOM

(DR. SHANNON enters scrub room. DR. ILAQUA is scrubbing.)

DR. SHANNON: Well, the FBI seemed to have backed off at least for the time being.

DR. ILAQUA: Yes.

DR. SHANNON: Are you finished for the day?

DR. ILAQUA: Yes.

DR. SHANNON: Ive got a laser peel. Then Im out of here. Were going to get through this, Eric. All we have to do is keep our heads on straight.

NURSE WAITE: (entering) The patient is prepped, Dr. Shannon. Is there anything you need me to do?

DR. SHANNON: Yes, Im going to need a clean pair of scrubs from the laundry. I forgot to pick some up.

NURSE WAITE: Ill get them now. Is there anything you need, Dr. Ilaqua?

DR. ILAQUA: No, thank you. (exits the room as if in a trance)

(Later, DR. SHANNON in scrubs and NURSE WAITE try to enter locked OR room #2.)

DR.SHANNON: Am I prepped in another room?

NURSE WAITE: No, your patients in OR 2. (looks at monitor) Whos that?

DR. SHANNON: Thats Dr. Ilaqua. What the hell is he doing with my patient?

(Inside OR 2, DR. ILAQUA with a maniacal gleam in his eyes is operating a laser.)

DR. SHANNON: (through door) Dr. Ilaqua! Open this door! (DR. ILAQUA is drilling through unconscious FEMALE PATIENTS neck.) Eric! Open this door immediately! Dr. Ilaqua, do you hear me? Youve got to stop this now!

(NURSE WAITE watches monitor, then takes off running down hall.)

DR. SHANNON: (still through door) This is wrong! What are you doing? Stop this right now! Eric open this door immediately! (DR. ILAQUA continues to drill.) This is Dr. Shannon! I said stop this now! STOP!!!!!



SCENE 9

(SCULLY is examining DR. ILAQUA with a pen light.)

SCULLY: You dont remember anything, Dr. Ilaqua? How you got in the room, or what compelled you to do such a thing?

DR. ILAQUA: No, I was on my way home.

SCULLY: Do you realize what youve done now?

DR. ILAQUA: Yes.

SCULLY: (seeing prescription bottle in DR. ILAQUAS pocket.) May I? (removes bottle, and reads it) Ill be right back. (Exits, leaving him with a guard.)

(MULDER is in an office playing with rhinoplasty (nose) software. He looks at nose he has created, places a pencil on his own nose, makes a face, shakes his head and tries again. SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: Did you examine the victim?

SCULLY: No, just Dr. Ilaqua, why?

MULDER: I found something else on the videotape. (SCULLY glances at the computer screen, then follows MULDER to VCR. He pauses the tape.) Right there.

(Video is of NURSE WAITE removing leeches from female patient.)

SCULLY: What are they? Bruises?

MULDER: I dont know, but the orientation of the points describes a pentagram again. See.

SCULLY: Well, I found something, too. (Hands MULDER prescription bottle.)

MULDER: Thats the same prescription Dr. Lloyd was taking.

SCULLY: You think its just a coincidence?

(They share a disbelieving look.)



SCENE 10
CONFERENCE ROOM

DR. SHANNON: Any change in scheduling or workload is going to give the appearance of covering guilt. We cant compromise our position on this.

(MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

SCULLY: Sorry to barge in, but this is a matter of some urgency.

DR. FRANKLYN: Uh, no, please. Dr. Jack Franklyn. May we ask that you sit down?

MULDER: It appears weve interrupted a *gathering.*

DR. FRANKLYN: Gathering? Sir .. can you imagine this groups concern about whats happened, and our urgency to resolve this? And to finally bring the person responsible to justice.

SCULLY: Finally.

DR. FRANKLYN: (rises) I dont know how much of this you know, but uh, ten years ago there were several deaths at this hospital here in the ASU and like uh, the recent deaths they were all ruled accidental.

MULDER: Were any of you here at the time?

DR. FRANKLYN: A few of us, yes, but .. more importantly ... theres a nurse, Rebecca Waite. She was on the ward during those incidents. Six weeks ago, she transferred back here to the ASU.

SCULLY: Do you have any other reasons to suspect her?

DR. FRANKLYN: Well, shes the only person on the ward who had some contact with each of the victims and the doctors involved.

MULDER: Have you spoken with her?

DR. FRANKLYN: No, she left the uh, hospital early, and no ones been able to find her.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 11
REBECCA WAITES HOUSE

Night. We hear her speaking foreign language. She sits naked before a candle at an altar burning pieces of hair in some sort of ritual.)

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive and walk up to house. They hear a cat meow. SCULLY knocks. No answer. MULDER points to a broom outside the door.)

MULDER: Probable cause.

SCULLY: On the suspicion of being a witch?

(MULDER smiles and opens screen door. He points to a pentagram drawn near top of door. SCULLY looks resigned to the fact that MULDER *will* get into this house. They draw their guns and flashlights, nod at each other, and MULDER kicks in the door. They enter. SCULLY finds altar with candles burning.)

SCULLY: What could she have been doing in here?

MULDER: Probably not tax returns.



SCENE 12
1953 GARDNER ST
WINNETKA, IL

(Night. Car, a Jaguar, pulls up. DR. FRANKLYN gets out and enters house *which looks a lot like Kristins house in 3*. He tries to turn on the lights, but they dont work. Cautiously he goes upstairs into a bathroom. Bathtub is full of dark liquid. Written on the mirror is *VANITAS VANITATORUM*. Suddenly, NURSE WAITE jumps out of tub and attacks DR. FRANKLYN, they fight, then she disappears. DR. FRANKLYN stands, goes downstairs and dials 911.)

911 RECORDING: You have reached the 911 emergency line. Please stay on the line ...

(NURSE WAITE attacks him from behind, he knocks her out.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY arrive. MULDER shows his badge and they pass the ambulance to where NURSE WAITE is being restrained outside DR. FRANKLYNS house.)

NURSE WAITE: You dont know what youre doing! Let me go, now! (to MULDER) They dont understand. You have to tell them!

MULDER: I want to speak to her.;

NURSE WAITE: Tell them!

MULDER: I need to speak to her ...

SCULLY: Mulder, dont ...

NURSE WAITE: I tried to stop him, but its too powerful. (wheezes) Someone has to stop .... (Painful wheezing and gagging)

SCULLY: Get the paramedics over here! Get the paramedic over here now!

(NURSE WAITE vomits up straight pins and blood, then collapses.)

EMT: Watch it. (with stretcher) Come on. (lifts NURSE WAITE onto stretcher.)

SCULLY: Shes swallowed straight pins and is bleeding internally. Youve got to get her into surgery immediately.

EMT: There we go.

SCULLY: (to MULDER) Im going with her to the ER.

(SCULLY leaves with ambulance. MULDER looks at regurgitated pins and shakes his head.)



SCENE 13
DR. FRANKLYNS BEDROOM

(DR. SHANNON is sewing a cut on his head.)

DR. FRANKLYN: I would have done it myself, but Im still a little shaky.

DR. SHANNON: Jack, youre a lot cooler than Id be if itd been me.

DR. FRANKLYN: Ah, well, the important thing is its over now.

MULDER: (knocks) Dr, Franklyn?

DR.FRANKLYN: Ah, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I came by to see if you were okay.

DR. FRANKLYN: Yes. I - Im fine. Thank you.

DR. SHANNON: That woman broke in here. She was in here waiting for him.

MULDER: Looks like she took a pretty good shot at you.

DR. FRANKLYN: Yes, apparently.

MULDER: (big friendly smile) Nothing that a little plastic surgery wont fix up though, huh? (DR. FRANKLYN looks at MULDER) Do you have any uh, idea why she might have attacked you?

DR. FRANKLYN: Well, Im the one who voiced suspicion about her.

MULDER: She wouldnt have known that.

DR. SHANNON: Could have been any one of us  shes obviously quite mad.

MULDER: Ah, we have reason to believe that shes a practitioner of ritual magic.

DR. FRANKLYN: Ritual magic?

MULDER: A practicing witch.

DR. SHANNON: Youre saying shes whos responsible for Dr. Lloyd and Dr. Ilaqua? That witchcraft caused them to kill those patients?

MULDER: I think a lot remains to be proven.

DR. FRANKLYN: Hem, Im sorry. Ah, This evening has been a bit much, and I really need to get some rest.

DR. SHANNON: (to MULDER, very direct) I think all of us would like to get some rest... (puts on coat) get back to work and put this behind us.

(DR. FRANKLYN lies down on bed. MULDER follows DR. SHANNON out, closing the door behind him. DR. FRANKLYN slowly rises to hover two feet off the bed. His eyes are open and he smiles, then closes his eyes.)



SCENE 14
MULDERS HOTEL ROOM
3:40 AM

Book on table - The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology. MULDER is looking at his face critically in the mirror. Knock at the door.)

SCULLY: (voice) Mulder, its me.

MULDER: (turning from mirror) Come in, its open.

(SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: God, you look tired.

SCULLY: I do? (She crosses to look at herself in the mirror and sighs) I was just at the hospital. Our suspect, Rebecca Waite was just pronounced 20 minutes ago.

MULDER: Cause of death?

SCULLY: Massive blood loss due to esophageal hemorrhaging caused by the expulsion of hundreds of straight pins.

MULDER: You ever seen anything like that?

SCULLY: Well ... in med school I saw some weird stuff. (MULDER crosses over to witchcraft book.) Uh, theres a - a psychiatric disorder called pica which is characterized by the craving for non-food objects like clay, rocks, glue, but if she swallowed ...

MULDER: She would have died long before she yacked them up on the driveway. Unless, of course she didnt ingest them at all, which would fit with the phenomenon called allotriophagy.

SCULLY: (sitting beside MULDER on bed) Allotriophagy?

MULDER: (showing her book) Yeah, the spontaneous vomiting or disgorgement of foul or strange objects usually associated with someone possessed.

SCULLY: Mulder, I - I wont refute that this woman may have been practicing the occult, but ... what comes out must first go in.

MULDER: Well, according to this book people throughout history have coughed up all kinds of things from cue balls to butchers knives without any explanation of how they got there.

SCULLY: (indicating book) Whered you get this from?

MULDER: Rebecca Waites house. Its the same place I got this. (crosses to desk and picks up a calendar) This calendar was open to April. The 30th was marked by a symbol that youre familiar with by now? (marked with a pentagram and word "Roodmas")

SCULLY: Whats the significance of the 30th?

MULDER: Its one of the four Greater Witches' Sabbaths, there seasonal high holy days  according to that book over there, its also known as "Roodmas." Its also the birth date of the first victim. (thumbs through calendar) Now July 31st, is also marked with a pentagram. This coincides with "Lammas", another one of the Witches' Sabbaths. Its also the birth date of the second victim.

SCULLY: So you think she was choosing her victims based on their birthdays.

MULDER: No, no, remember, I said the pentagram is a - is a protective symbol. I think Rebecca Waite was trying to save those patients. I think she knew that they were in danger.

SCULLY: Which made her attack Dr. Franklyn.

MULDER: I think she knew something about him and I think we should find out what that is before he goes back to work.

(SCULLY considers.)



SCENE 15
SCRUB ROOM

(DR. SHANNON enters scrub room where DR. FRANKLYN and DOCTOR 2 are scrubbing up.)

DR. SHANNON: I just got a very disturbing call.

DR. KAPLAN: From whom?

DR. SHANNON: The FBI. They were asking about patients birth dates. (DR. FRANKLYN looks uncomfortable.) Theyre on their way over here right now.

DR. KAPLAN: I thought this was over.

DR. SHANNON: Apparently not. (leaves)

DR. KAPLAN: You had a good thing going, you can bet somebody will try and take it away. Im beginning to understand why a man becomes a conservative - hes got something to conserve. (notices DR. FRANKLYN in pain as he puts on robe.) Are you all right, Jack?

DR. FRANKLYN: Yeah, I just didnt get much sleep last night.

DR. KAPLAN: No, of course you didnt.

DR. FRANKLYN: Ill be fine.

DR. KAPLAN: (into wall intercom) Gail, push my ostoplasty back half an hour.

GAIL: (voice) Yes, doctor.

DR. KAPLAN: (to DR. FRANKLYN) Im taking your chem peel. Youre going home.

DR. FRANKLYN: I said Ill be fine.

DR. KAPLAN: Take a look at yourself. (DR. FRANKLYN looks in mirror.) You look like hell, Jack.

DR. FRANKLYN: Look, I appreciate the offer ...

DR. KAPLAN: Dont get me wrong. I am not being magnanimous, here. We just cant afford to make any more mistakes right now. (leaves, DR. FRANKLYN removes his hat)



SCENE 16
CAR

(SCULLY on phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes. Thank you. (hangs up) Dr. Franklyns already left, but his office confirms that one of his patients has a birth date which corresponds with one of the Sabbaths.

MULDER: When is that patient scheduled?

SCULLY: This morning  shes already in pre-op, and one of the other doctors is filling in.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 17
PRE-OP

PATIENT: (under influence of sedative) Is Doctor Franklyn okay?

DR. KAPLAN: Hes just not feeling very well.

PATIENT: Oh. I-I suppose this is one of those procedures that all doctors here could deal with, is-isnt it?

DR. KAPLAN: Yes.

PATIENT: Yes. Dr. Franklyn said that a c-chemical skin peel is safe ... almost ... risk ... free.

(DR. KAPLAN picks up chemical bottle.)

(MULDER and SCULLY enter hallway. They speak to a nurse.)

MULDER: Were looking for Dr. Shannon.

(At end of hall, Dr. Shannon begins screaming. MULDER and SCULLY run to her. They see in OR that PATIENTS face has been dissolved by the chemical. DR. KAPLAN looks on in horror at what he has done.)

DR. SHANNON: Oh! (begins crying)



SCENE 18
HOSPITAL OFFICE

DR. SHANNON: Our practice has been affiliated with Greenwood for thirteen years. Now the ASU accounts for over 50% of this hospitals revenue. Do you understand what that means?

SCULLY: It means that while doctors in other fields have seen their earnings fall because of managed health care, youve all managed to become wealthy.

DR. SHANNON: We fill a need. We didnt create it. Everyone wants to be beautiful. (SCULLY looks at MULDER) But our success made us arrogant. Im willing to accept responsibility for certain of our ... mistakes.

MULDER: "Mistakes?" Like those patient deaths ten years ago?

DR. SHANNON: That any of us could be capable of such gross negligence was inconceivable.

SCULLY: So you covered it up.

DR. SHANNON: If we did it was with the hospitals blessing. They conducted an internal investigation. We have become too valuable an asset, something to protect. Even at the cost of five peoples lives.

MULDER: There were five deaths?

DR. SHANNON: Yes. Four patients. The fifth was a colleague of ours who ... for all intents and purposes, worked himself to death. He died of a drug overdose.

MULDER: What was his name?

DR. SHANNON: Dr. Cox. Clifford Cox.

MULDER: Do you have a file on him?

DR. SHANNON: Probably in the computer.

MULDER: All right, Im going to need that and the files on those patient deaths ten years ago.

SCULLY: Why, Mulder? What are you thinking?



SCENE 19

(MULDER looking at COXS file.)

APPLICATION FOR APPOINTMENT TO THE MEDICAL STAFF

Dr. Clifford Cox
July 7, 1939
1671-7377-2
Mountview Medical Arts Bldg.
2050 Nelson St., Chicago, Ill
312/555-0107
312/555-0169 312/555-9102
1728 Alhermi St. Apt. 415
Chicago, Ill
Single M American

MULDER: Dr. Clifford Cox, birth date July 7th 1939, now can you take that photo and run it through the cosmetic surgery program I saw on this computer?

DR. SHANNON: Itll take me a few seconds to load up the software.

SCULLY: Mulder, Im still not sure where youre going with this.

MULDER: Ten years ago, four patients died. Like the recent victims, their birth dates all match the Witches' Sabbaths. Except Dr. Cox.

SCULLY: But Cox was a doctor. Nothing about his death matches up except its coincidence.

MULDER: Maybe, maybe not.

DR. SHANNON: Im on line here.

(Picture of Cox appears.)

MULDER: Okay, now this software was created to give patients an idea of their projected result, right?

DR. SHANNON: Within the limits of what the patient comes in with, we try to approach that aesthetic ideal. The computer runs a program based upon a matrix of relative proportions.

MULDER: Vanity. (Looks at SCULLY.) Vanity, ... all is vanity.

DR. SHANNON: Here it is.

MULDER: Now, can you move the eyes further apart and strengthen the forehead?

DR. SHANNON: That is beyond our surgical capabilities.

MULDER: I know. (DR. SHANNON and SCULLY look confused. DR. SHANNON types, looks more confused.)

DR. SHANNON: I dont understand. It looks like Jack Franklyn.



SCENE 20

(Heavy breathing. We see DR. FRANKLYN sweating, carving a word on a hard surface - SH ----)



SCENE 21
HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

SCULLY: Where else do you think he would be?

DR. SHANNON: I dont know. Ill check the OR. Maybe hes there.

(DR. SHANNON leaves. MULDER approaches.)

SCULLY: Hes not answering his pages.

MULDER: Did you try his home?

SCULLY: Answering machine. What are you thinking, Mulder? That Dr. Cox murdered these patients ten years ago then became Dr. Franklyn?

MULDER: No, Scully. I think he murdered those patients so he could become Dr. Franklyn. (Hands her pictures of COX and FRANKLYN.)

SCULLY: This kind of transformation is medically impossible.

MULDER: Its not medicine, Scully. Its blood sacrifice.

SCULLY: (The Look) Blood sacrifice?

MULDER: The most potent offering in black magic. What if this man, having reached the limits of medical miracles, decided to stage a miracle all his own?

SCULLY: So this man committed these murders in order to make himself beautiful?

MULDER: Everybody wants to be beautiful, Scully.



SCENE 22
OPERATING ROOM

(DR. FRANKLYN alone in an OR selects scalpels and other sharp instruments and lays them out on cart. DR. SHANNON enters.)

DR. SHANNON: Jack. What are you doing?

DR. FRANKLYN: Im so glad that youre here. (folds his arms)

DR. SHANNON: Jack, stay right where you are.

(DR. FRANKLYN nods his head. Instruments that he had laid out on cart disappear, DR. SHANNON gasps in pain and falls against the wall, then to floor. DR. FRANKLYN leans over her.)

DR. FRANKLYN: I hope those instruments were properly sterilized. (Kisses her on forehead, then leaves.)



SCENE 23
DR. FRANKLYNS HOUSE

(MULDER and SCULLY enter DR. FRANKLYNS house. Its raining outside.)

MULDER: Dr. Franklyn?

(MULDER goes upstairs, SCULLY stays down.)

MULDER: Scully, come over here. (She walks back to stairs.) Stop right there. Look what youre standing on. (It is a pentagram on the tile floor. MULDER comes back down. ) This ones different. Its been inverted. See these two upright points here? They represent the God of Lust, attacking heaven with its horns.

SCULLY: Look, hes inscribed all the names of the patients who were killed.
(They see "Shannon" carved at one of the points.)

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other, then run out the door.)



SCENE 24
HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

(DR. SHANNON is being wheeled on a gurney.)

DOCTOR: Clear the way. Moving through! (to DR. SHANNON) What did you swallow?

DR. SHANNON: (No answer)

DOCTOR: What did you swallow?

ORDERLY: She didnt say.

DOTOR: Im going in to do an exploratory laparotomy.

DR. SHANNON: Please ... dont.

DOCTOR: Give her two units blood, stat. Someone get a 16 gauge IV in and open it wide.

NURSE: Ill get the IV, Doctor.

DR. SHANNON: (in OR, now, blood on her lips. They transfer her to OR table) No ... please no, .... no....no, please, dont ... (Mask comes down over her face.)



SCENE 25

(Hand with scalpel. DR. FRANKLYN. He begins to cut along his own hair line.)



SCENE 26

(MULDER and SCULLY enter hospital.)

MULDER: Wheres Dr. Shannon? They said she was brought in here in an emergency?

NURSE: Dr. Shannon?

(MULDER and SCULLY walk down hall, looking in OR rooms.)

SCULLY: Mulder, in here.

MULDER: Dont let them operate on her. (Runs down hall.) Hold them off until you hear from me!

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To find Dr. Franklyn. (he is gone)



SCENE 27

(Pool of blood at DR. FRANKLYNS feet. He takes small fork and begins to peel the skin off his face. It looks uncomfortable.)



SCENE 28

(OR with DR. SHANNON.)

DOCTOR: Forceps.

NURSE: Here you go.

DOCTOR: Sponge it. Suction.

NURSE: Suction.

DOCTOR: Saline.

NURSE: Saline.

DOCTOR: More sponge.

SCULLY: (entering) You have to stop this procedure immediately.

DOCTOR: Whoever that person is, get her out of here, now!

SCULLY: Im Special Agent Dana Scully. Im an FBI agent. (Shows badge.)

NURSE: Get out here, now!

SCULLY: Listen to me! Im a doctor.

DOCTOR 2: (entering) What the hells going on here?

SCULLY: Im a federal agent.

DOCTOR 2: I dont care who you are. You cant interrupt a surgery in progress. This woman could die.

SCULLY: Thats exactly what Im trying to prevent.



SCENE 29
WARD

(MULDER enter ASU OR ward.)

INTERCOM: Dr. Hallender, please call obstretics. Dr. Hallender, please call obstetrics.

(MULDER sees OR monitor with bloody scalpel. He enters OR, and sees DR. FRANKLYNS face lying on the floor. MULDER looks a little nauseated.)



SCENE 30
OPERATING ROOM

(DR. SHANNONS OR. They are unstrapping her, surgery finished. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: What happened?

SCULLY: Well, they saved her life. They just pulled a whole whack of surgical instruments out of-of her intestinal tract. God only knows how they got there.

MULDER: Then it failed.

(Alarm begins blaring, people yelling and crying. MULDER and SCULLY go to another OR.)

HYSTERICAL NURSE: I tried to stop him! He just went crazy!

DOCTOR: Were losing her, fast!

MULDER: What is this patients birth date?

SCULLY: (grabs chart) October 31. Halloween.

MULDER: On Samhain ... the Fourth Witches Sabbath.



SCENE 31
CITY OF ANGELS MEDICAL CENTER

(Nice car pulls up to City of Angels Medical Center. Attractive man gets out.)

(Inside)

FEMALE DOCTOR: I cant tell you how happy I am that youve decided to join us, Doctor Hartman.

DR. HARTMAN: (DR. FRANKLYNS voice) Well, I like what Ive seen so far. The truth is, Ive always been drawn to Los Angeles.

FEMALE DOCTOR: With your credentials, Im sure you had plenty of options. Ive been reviewing your patient portfolio. Your work is among the most impressive Ive ever seen.

DR. HARTMAN: I like to say whoever God didnt get around to creating in his own image, its our job to recreate in ours.

(They share a smile.)

[THE END]

                                         MUSINGS OF A CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN



SCENE 1
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(An abandoned building. The rats scurry along the floor as the door creaks open. One rat remains still until a cigarette falls next to him, in front of a large man's feet. The man, the Cigarette-Smoking Man, steps on the cigarette and stares at the broken windows across the dark room. He sets down a suitcase on a table, then pulls out his cigarettes and a lighter. The gold lighter has "Trust No One" engraved in it. He flicks up the top and lights the cigarette, then pops open the suitcase to reveal a switchboard. He flicks one of the switches, then raises a small antenna. A few small red lights flick on and a hum sounds. He plugs a pair of headphones in, sits, and adjusts the headphones on his ears. Scully can be heard in the headphones.)

LANGLY: ...elaborate and dark conspiracy.

SCULLY: Look at you, you're shaking.

MULDER: One at a time, boys. Now what's going on?

LANGLY: Frohike's close...

FROHIKE: Don't use my name! What the hell's wrong with you? Now I'll have to kill you!

BYERS: Langly and I performed three sweeps...

FROHIKE: He's everywhere. He's everywhere.

BYERS: ...with the CPM-seven-hundred and did not detect a single bug.

FROHIKE: The CPM-seven-hundred is a piece of crap!

BYERS: The acoustic correlator is reading only passive sounds.

MULDER: I've been here twenty minutes and I still don't know what the hell is wrong! No one would kill you, Frohike, you're just a little puppy-dog.

FROHIKE: I don't utter another syllable until the CSM-twenty-five countermeasure filter is activated.

(There is static and a warbling sound. The Cigarette-Smoking Man flips another switch marked "Countermeasure Filter" and the sound quickly returns.)

BYERS: No electronic surveillance known can cut through the CSM-twenty-five.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man smiles and starts to take out a tripod from a suitcase.)

SCULLY: Okay, okay. Now tell us what you're so close to.

FROHIKE: Not a "what." A "who." If you find the right starting point and follow it, not even secrets of the darkest of men are safe.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man locks the main part of a sniper rifle onto the tripod.)

MULDER: Cancer Man? What did you find?

FROHIKE: Possibly everything. Maybe his background.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man hooks the nozzle onto the gun and aims it at a door with a sign that reads:

"THE LONG GUNMEN
Publishers of
"The Magic Bullet"
Magazine"

The scope is bright green, the crosshairs centered.)

Who he is, and who he wants to be.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man leans back uneasily, content to wait.)

August twentieth, 1940, Mexico City. A Stalinist agent assassinated Leon Trotsky with an icepick. At that same moment, a thousand miles north, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he appears. The father was an ardent Communist activist. During the Nazi-Soviet pact, he kept the N.K.V.D. informed about American plans to enter World War II. He was executed under the Espionage Act of 1917... before his boy could walk.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes another drag off his cigarette and looks down, his face in shadows.)

The mother, a cigarette smoker, died of lung cancer... before her son uttered his first word. With no surviving family, he became a ward of the state, sent to various orphanages in the Midwest. Didn't make friends, spent all his time reading... alone... and then... he appears to have vanished... until a year and a half after the Bay of Pigs.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man shows no emotion.)

PART I
"Things really did go well in Dealey Plaza."

SCENE 2
CENTER FOR SPECIAL WARFARE; FT. BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA; OCTOBER 30, 1962

(A number of troops run down a road, led by a drill sergeant. Jeeps drive by as well.)

TROOP LEADER: Premier Krhuschev, we want you!

TROOPS: Premier Khruschev, we want you!

TROOP LEADER: We're going to kick your rang-a-dang-doo.

TROOPS: We're going to kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

TROOP LEADER: Fidel Castro, we want you!

TROOPS: Fidel Castro, we want you!

TROOP LEADER: We're going to kick your rang-a-dang-doo.

TROOPS: We're going to kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

(One of the men, the louder men, is recognizable. He would later be the Cigarette-Smoking Man. Near a building, four men watch him with interest. Three of them are wearing suits, the other is wearing a colonel's uniform.)

TROOP LEADER: Mother Russia...

(In the barracks, the Cigarette-Smoking Man sits, reading "The Manchurian Candidate." His friend, William Mulder walks over, sorting through pictures, and sits in the bunk across from him.)

WILLIAM MULDER: Why don't you just go see the movie?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'd rather read the worst novel ever written than sit through the best movie ever made.

(A private walks over to the bunks.)

PRIVATE: Captain, sir. General Francis requests you report to his office ASAP, sir.

(He walks away. The Cigarette-Smoking Man stands, putting down his book.)

WILLIAM MULDER: My one-year old just said his first word.

(He hands the Cigarette-Smoking Man a picture of his wife holding a small boy.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What was the word?

WILLIAM MULDER: "J.F.K."

(They both smile. The Cigarette-Smoking Man hands it back and starts off.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'll catch you later, Mulder.

(In General Francis' office, he and three other men wait for the Cigarette-Smoking Man. They were the men watching before. The Cuban Man sits off to the side, smoking. The Mob Man looks over at the Agent Man, who stares at the door nervously. A buzzer sounds.)

MAN: He's here, sir.

(General Francis presses a button on his intercom.)

FRANCIS: Send him in.

(Another buzzer sounds, and the Cigarette-Smoking Man walks in.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You wish to see me, sir?

(The Agent Man, holding a folder, stands.)

AGENT MAN: Have a seat, Captain.

(The Captain does so, facing the Agent Man. He looks a bit confused.)

Captain, have you ever seen these two men...

(He points to the Mob Man and the Cuban Man.)

...met the general, or myself?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, sir.

(The Agent Man starts to walk slowly, reading from the folder.)

AGENT MAN: In January, 1961, did you aid Congo President Kasavuba in the arrest and assassination of Patrice Lamumbra?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, sir.

AGENT MAN: Were you involved in the training of Cuban nationals during "Operation Zapata," also known as "The Bay of Pigs?"

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'm sorry, sir, I'm unaware of any such operation.

AGENT MAN: On May thirty-first, 1961, did you aid Dominican locals in the assassination of Rafael Trujillo?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, sir.

(The Agent Man sighs.)

AGENT MAN: Your father was a convicted spy for the Soviet Union, executed in a Louisiana electric chair, was he not?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man's eyes aim down to the floor, thinking.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: My only regret, sir, is I was too young to throw the switch myself.

FRANCIS: At ease, Captain.

(He stands and walks around his desk.)

Your father's actions were totally out of your control. Each of us in this room stands a life eviscerated by the actions of another. Cigarette?

(He holds out a pack of Morley's.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, thank you, sir. I never touch them.

(Francis starts across the room.)

FRANCIS: You see, Captain, most people seek to control life's events in order to secure a more positive, productive and free existence. Often, however, the objectives of others conflict with our objectives.

CUBAN MAN: Viva la libertada.

FRANCIS: Now, most people, common people, really... can barely manage to control their own self-centered, myopic existence.

(He lights a cigarette, moving back across the room.)

They command armies of lawyers, armed with paper weapons, attacking with spiteful, vengeful... cowardly litigation. Others... operate within elephantine bureaucracies. And then, Captain...

(He takes another drag and stands in front of the lesser officer.)

There are extraordinary men... those who must identify... comprehend, and ultimately shoulder the responsibility for not only their own existence, but their country's, and the world's as well. Your father, Captain... believed his country should look to another form of government, and he took control of that belief. So, in that respect, we view him as an extraordinary man. And we believe... we know, Captain... that it runs in the family.

(He starts to walk around the confused soldier.)

Now, don't misunderstand. Your father should have been executed. Communism is, without a doubt, the most heinous personification of evil mankind has ever confronted...

(He sits at his desk.)

... and it is, in part, the reason that you are before us here today.

(The Agent Man steps out of the shadows and in front of the Cigarette-Smoking Man.)

AGENT MAN: You must understand, Captain, everything I'm about to say is classified "compartmentalized"... so intensely that if you accept this assignment and successfully execute it, you will no longer be an officer of the United States army, nor will any record of your service.

(He sighs.)

The assignment... is the assassination of an American civilian, age forty-six... former Naval PT-Boat Commander... married, father of two.

(The men stare at the Cigarette-Smoking Man for a reaction, who gives none. The Agent Man sits. The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at General Francis.)

FRANCIS: Last week, Captain, this country was brought to the brink of nuclear annihilation, a situation which never would have arisen had the individual in question, as Commander-in-Chief, provided an umbrella of air support during the invasion of Bacha de Cochinos.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Is there a cover story?

MOB MAN: Tell them it was done by men from outer space.

(The statement makes the Agent Man grow even more nervous.)

AGENT MAN: We've found and are setting up a patsy.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at General Francis through the cigarette smoke, then looks back at the Agent Man.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Where?



SCENE 3
DALLAS, TEXAS; NOVEMBER 22, 1963; WESTBROOK DRIVE; IRVING, TEXAS; 6:59 A.M.

(Lee Harvey Oswald walks down an empty street, smoking a cigarette. He coughs and walks into a garage. A disembodied voice comes from behind him.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You shouldn't smoke those, Lee.

(He turns around to see the Cigarette-Smoking Man in a blue suit.)

I'm reading studies that say they can kill you.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Well.

(He takes another drag and coughs some more. The Cigarette-Smoking Man starts around him.)

Mister Hunt, sir. I, uh, I've heard about those reports and they are no doubt correct.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You'll have a good view of the President today.

(Oswald nods as the Cigarette-Smoking Man comes full circle.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Well, I, I like the President's family. They're interesting people. However, I have my own views on the President's national policy. I'll probably just eat lunch.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'm going to the movies at the Texas Theater. It's only ninety cents. I love the movies.

(Oswald, having put out his cigarette, takes out the pack.)

I brought the curtain rods, Lee.

(Oswald pauses and puts the pack down on the bench, then picks up a long bundled package.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: I bought some curtain rods just like this from a mail order back in March.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: You did? Or A.J. Hidell?

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Well, Mister Hunt... Fidel's defenders have to be careful.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yes, we do. Speaking of which, Lee, I've informed our fellow defender that you will hide the curtain rods on the sixth floor of the book depository behind the curtains, against the back will.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Cuban Visa?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Once I've been notified the curtain rods have been safely removed from the depository, the Visa and the money for your trip will be in your room. Take a bus.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: I left all my money with my life.

(Oswald looks down, ashamed. The Cigarette-Smoking Man reaches into his pocket and pulls out some bills, then hands them to Oswald.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: That's all I've got. Thirteen and change. You better get going. Lee. You wouldn't want to miss your ride to work.

(Oswald nods, puts the pack of cigarettes in the Cigarette-Smoking Man's hand, and walks out. The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares at them.)



SCENE 4
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY; 8:00 AM

(A freight elevator leads Oswald up to a room filled with boxes. He looks around, then walks across the room and places the curtain rods behind a stack of boxes in the far corner of the room, a secluded spot surrounded with boxes. His supervisor notices some rumbling and walks in that direction. Lee suddenly pops out from around the corner of a row of boxes, startling the supervisor.)

SUPERVISOR: Good morning, Lee. Starting work right on time.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Yes, sir.

(He walks to a pile of boxes. The supervisor looks down, shakes his head a little, and walks over. Oswald watches him warily, wondering if he saw something.)



SCENE 5
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET; 11:15 AM

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man, dressed as a worker, steps out of the back of a blue van, then goes to the front and takes out a small white bag. The back of his shirt has a patch that reads "City of Dallas Public Works." His clothes are all dark blue. He walks into the small outlet.)



SCENE
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(A man walks up to his coworkers.)

MAN #1: The President should be driving past any minute! I think I hear everyone down on the fifth floor.

(All the men start walking toward the entrance.)

Where's Lee? Does he want to come?

MAN #2: Will, hurry up!



SCENE 6
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man, flashlight in hand, trudges on. He gets to a small standing space in the pipes and looks out through a small opening. He sees a number of people waiting on the lawn. He reaches into the small bag and starts to build a sniper rifle.)

MAN #3: Mister President!

(The crowd cheers as the President drives by, waving. Jackie Onassis Kennedy is sitting next to him, wearing bright pink. The Cigarette-Smoking Man presses an earphone closer to his ear.)

MAN #4: The President's car is now turning onto Elm Street...

(He puts the earphones down.)



SCENE 7
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(Lee Harvey Oswald walks up to the soda machine. The choices are Lemon Lime, Cola, Orange, Rootbeer, Grape, and one more. He sighs.)



SCENE 8
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man leans the tip of the gun out of the small window in the pipes.)

MAN #4: I was on the Stemmon's Freeway earlier, and even the Freeway was jam-packed with spectators waiting to see the President.

(The crowd starts to cheer, meaning the President is approaching. The Cigarette-Smoking Man slips his finger onto the trigger. A man on the lawn takes out an umbrella and opens it.)

People are really starting to crowd in now.



SCENE 9
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(Harvey puts a quarter in and chooses Rootbeer. A buzzer sounds and no bottle comes out.)



SCENE 10
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

MAN #4: The motorcade is heading down Elm Street now, passing the Texas School Book Depository...

(A white car drives by. The Cigarette-Smoking Man's finger tenses. A black car starts to drive by, small flags mounted at the front. The President's car. The man with the umbrella, holding it over his head, raises it twice.)

It looks like all of Dallas has turned out...



SCENE 11
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(Lee stares at the soda machine. The crowd cheers in the back. He chooses Cola.)



SCENE 12
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

(The trigger is pulled. A gunshot sounds.)



SCENE 13
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(The bottle drops into the opening.)



SCENE 14
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man pulls the trigger again. Kennedy is slumped over in his seat. Jackie O. Starts to scramble over the trunk.)

MAN #5: Get over here! Get over here!



SCENE 15
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(Lee sips his soda.)



SCENE 16
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man watches as the car drives by, Secret Security officers running behind it.)

MAN #4: I can't quite see from here. It, it appears something has happened on the motorcade route.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man starts to scramble down the pipes.)

Does anyone know what has happened? Is there any information?

(Men and women start to scream. Police sirens grow. The Cigarette-Smoking Man sits down under an opening in the ceiling, watching the mayhem.)



SCENE 17
TEXAS SCHOOL BOOK DEPOSITORY

(A police officer runs up the stairs, followed by the supervisor. They look at Oswald.)

OFFICER: Do you know this man?

SUPERVISOR: Yes, he works for me.

(They scramble up the stairs. Oswald is confused. He looks down.)



SCENE 18
TRINITY RIVER OVERFLOW OUTLET

MAN #4: The President of the United States is dead. It is official now. President Kennedy is dead.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man smiles slightly.)



SCENE 19
OSWALD'S BOARDING ROOM; 1:03 PM

(Oswald runs into the room and scours his desk, then looks through the small desk.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: No. No. No, sir. I won't be a patsy.

(He runs to his desk, pulls out the gun, and packs it into his jeans.)



SCENE 20
TENTH & PATTON; 1:15 PM

(Oswald walks down the street, passing a woman in a yellow dress. A police APB wire can be heard approaching.)

MAN ON APB WIRE: ... weigh about a hundred-and-sixty-five pounds. He should be considered dangerous. Use caution approaching.

(The police car pulls up along side Oswald, who stops slowly.)

TIPPITT: Good afternoon.

(Oswald walks up to the car and looks inside.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: I wish to see some form of identification, sir.

TIPPITT: Now easy there, partner.

(He puts the car in park.)

I just want to talk a minute.

(He gets out and starts walking around.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: If I don't see valid credentials, I'm going to assume you're with them.

TIPPITT: Them? What do you mean, partner?

(He walks closer. Oswald pulls out his gun. Officer Tippitt does too, but he is shot in the chest, grunting as he falls. Oswald shoots him again on the ground three more times, then starts running.)



SCENE 21
TEXAS THEATRE; 1:45 PM

(An old black-and-white movie is playing. Three army buddies are sitting around, talking in a bunker.)

MAN IN MOVIE #1: How about a cigarette?

MAN IN MOVIE #2: Thank you.

(Oswald walks into the theater.)

MAN IN MOVIE #3: You know, Kiefer knocked out a bunker. All by himself, too.

MAN IN MOVIE #1: He'll have more guts than I've got.

(Oswald looks around nervously.)

All I did was pick up the spoil.

MAN IN MOVIE #3: But he's really got it. After Connors and Thurston ran, he knocked out the bunker with one grenade.

(A man walks in through the emergency exit at the front of the theater, near the screen. Oswald watches him carefully.)

That's really something, huh?

MAN IN MOVIE #1: Yeah.

(The lights come up and the movie turns off. Policemen are all over the theater. A woman groans. Oswald's eyes widen.)

POLICE OFFICER #1: Take this side.

POLICE OFFICER #2: All right. Get along.

MAN: Officer, what's going on?

(Oswald sits down, trying to look inconspicuous.)

POLICE OFFICER #2: Go ahead and settle down.

(He walks past Oswald, who looks down. Officer stops, then looks back at Oswald. He walks over to him.)

On your feet. Come on.

(Oswald raises his hands and stands.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: It's going to be all over.

(He punches the police officer hard. Other officers race towards Oswald as the officer punches him back. Oswald keels over but does not fall, taking out his gun.)

POLICE OFFICER #2: He's got a gun!

(The officers jump him, surrounding him. He is in the center of them as they swarm him like a mob. His gun is taken and he is placed in handcuffs, screaming. They start leading him out, beating him all the while.)

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: I'm not resisting arrest! I'm not resisting arrest! Stop hitting me, you sons of bitches! I'm not the one! I'm not the one!

(The officers start to file out. The voices grow dimmer with distance.)

This is police brutality! This is police brutality! I'm not resisting arrest! Let me go, I can walk!

POLICE OFFICER #1: Get him in the car!

LEE HARVEY OSWALD: Let me go! I can walk!

(The shouting continues illegibly, sirens growing. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, sitting in one of the back rows, takes out a cigarette from the pack Oswald gave him and lights it. He takes a long, savoring drag.)



SCENE 22
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes a long, savoring drag. He puts out the cigarette and takes off his coat.)

PART II
"Just down the road aways from Graceland."



SCENE 23
THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN'S APARTMENT

(An old radio plays a very exciting speech from a history-making man. Another history-making man in a different way sits at his old typewriter, smoking a cigarette and thinking. The Cigarette-Smoking Man types quickly.)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: We must take positive action to seek to remove those conditions of poverty, insecurity and injustice, which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops. These are revolutionary times. All over the globe, men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression, and out of the wombs of a frail world, new systems of justice and equality are being born.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man puts down his cigarette in his ashtray and reflects on a line in his writings.)

The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: "I can kill you whenever I please..."

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: "But not today."

(He continues to type.

"but withdrew it.
please... but not today."

He talks as he types the words.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: "I can kill you whenever I please...

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: We in the West must support these revolutions.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: "...but not today."

(He smiles.)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: It is a sad fact that because of comfort, complacency...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man finishes typing the page and takes it out.)

...a morbid fear of communism and our proneness to adjust to injustice...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stands, reading, smiling.)

...the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries.

(THE FRONT PAGE TO THE STORY READS:

"TAKE A CHANCE:
A JACK COLQUITT ADVENTURE

Written By
Raul Bloodworth
(Nom de Plume)")

This had driven many to feel that only Marxism has the revolutionary spirit.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks up at these words, in shock but also saddened in realization.)

Therefore, communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through with the revolutions that we initiate.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man closes his eyes.)

Our only hope today lies in our ability...

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, no, no... why'd you have to do that?

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: ...to recapture the revolution...



SCENE 24
AN UNKNOWN LOCATION

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man picks up his cigarette out of the ashtray.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Why didn't you know this was coming... Edgar?

(The director coughs a few times, sitting at the end of a table of the Cigarette-Smoking Man's associates.)

AID: Last year, the house was not smiling on non-eye-to-eye surveillance.

DIRECTOR: So I stopped.

AID: We called Ramsey Clark to receive a go-ahead on tapping King's phone, but he refused.

MAJOR GENERAL: Our behind-the-fence operations on Willie believes that King's ally Stokley Carmichael is recruiting a Negro army to wage war on white America.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Wouldn't you if you were them? If this were only a civil rights issue, I'd vote for a King/Benjamin Spock presidential ticket. But after last night, it's not.

DIRECTOR: You actually sound sad about it.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I respect King. He's an extraordinary man. But now he's talking like a Maoist...

(The Major General looks at the director.)

And if he convinces Negroes not to fight in Vietnam, we'll lose... and the first domino will have fallen.

(The director leans to his aid.)

DIRECTOR: We must step up our efforts to discredit him.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Like your ridiculous suicide project? "There is but one way out for you." That dumb letter attempting to drive King into despair only alerted him to the level of our surveillance.

(The director leans towards the Cigarette-Smoking Man angrily, but the aid puts his hand on the director's arm.)

AID: We could create a film of him with a woman other than his wife. Using existing footage, we could insert him in a film we make of a woman... a white woman.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: The solution is more intense... than just dirty tricks.

(They all look at each other.)

AID: If you'll excuse us, gentlemen, the director has a meeting at the White House.

(The aid starts to stand.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Sit down. You've enough plausible deniability to last the rest of your nine lives.

(The aid sits.)

MAJOR GENERAL: A SIG force can execute a wet-insert operation. One day, he and his immediate circle are just found dead.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Too many questions. Americans believe the South is still fighting the Civil War. We find ourselves a cracker patsy and the motives become very black and white.

DIRECTOR: Another patsy.

AID: Should we... advise the President?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I work very hard to keep any President from knowing I even exist.

AID: Who will you order to do it?

(There is an uneasy silence. The Cigarette-Smoking Man leans back in his chair, staring at the cigarette smoke coming from the ashtray.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I'll do it myself. I have too much respect for the man.



SCENE 25
MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE; APRIL 3, 1968; 9:15 PM

(A busy street. People walk on the sidewalks, cars drive by. King talks over the scene.)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land. Confusion all around. That's a strange statement. But I know somehow that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks slowly down the sidewalk, his trenchcoat blending in with the night.)

And I see God working in this period of the twentieth century...

(An elderly black woman smiles warmly to him and walks into a building. The sign on the side advertises King being there. The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes out a cigarette, looking downtrodden.)

In a way... that men in some strange way are responding. Something is happening in our world. The masses of people are rising up...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man lights his cigarette.)

And wherever they are assembled today, whether they are in Johannesburg South Africa, Nairobi, Kenya, Accra, Ghana, New York City, Atlanta Georgia...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man pulls out the same picture of William Mulder's wife and one-year old boy.)

Jackson Mississippi or Memphis Tennessee, the cry is always the same, "We want to be free."

(A crowd cheers loudly. The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares sadly at the picture.)



SCENE 26
ROOMING HOUSE; 418 S. MAIN; APRIL 4, 1968; 5:15 PM

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares out the window when the door opens behind him. The Cigarette-Smoking Man sits in a chair. James Earl Ray walks in.)

JAMES EARL RAY: Raul...

(He closes the door.)

Got the binoculars you sent me out for.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Just put them down by your clothes.

(He points to them. Ray does so.)

JAMES EARL RAY: I heard, uh, Doctor King is staying at the Lorraine Motel right behind here.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stands.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Our gun buyer's coming by to look at the rifle.

JAMES EARL RAY: Well... I gave it to you this morning.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I have it. Look, uh, three's a crowd.

(He smiles and pulls out a roll of bills.)

Here's a couple of hundred. Go to the movies or something. Come back in two or three hours. Leave the Mustang, I'll need it.

(Ray takes the bills and walks out, shaking his head slightly. The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares at the door, then reaches under the bed and pulls out the rifle on a carpet. King talks over the scene, slightly garbled.)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Well, I don't know what will happen now.



SCENE 27
DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM LORRAINE MOTEL ROOM 306; 5:57 PM

(King continues to talk over the scene.)

MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now. Because I've been to the mountaintop...

(The crowd listening to him cheers loudly.)

I don't mind.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks through some bushes, then stands in a very small opening, holding his sniper rifle.)

Like anybody, I would like to live... a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he's allowed me to go up to the mountain... and I've looked over. And I've seen... the promised land.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks a little more and stops, then puts on some black gloves, concealed by the underbrush.)

I may not get there with you...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man locks the bullets into the chamber.)

But I want you to know tonight... that we as a people will get to the promised land!

(The crowd listening cheers again. The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes aim at room three-oh-six, marked on the door. A young black man walks to the door, directly in the crosshairs. He talks to a young black woman.)

So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I don't fear any man.

(The door opens behind the young man and he moves to the side. Two black men walk out. The first is Doctor Martin Luther King Jr.)

My eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord!

(A gunshot sounds, the barrel shaking as the bullet flies out. A still picture of a number of African-American men saluting a la the Black Panthers. The gunshot echoes. A still picture of the funeral, the coffin being pulled down the street in the funeral procession.)



SCENE 28
ROOMING HOUSE; 418 S. MAIN

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man listens to the television, a sadness tracing his face, reading.)

MAN: Memphis police found a rifle wrapped in a blanket, as well as some personal belongings believed to be that of the assassin, in the doorway of the Canipe Amusement Company.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man reads a letter from Montgomery & Glick Publishing.

"Mr. Raul Bloodworth
555 Brookabank Ave., Apt. 24
Washington, D.C.
20091

Dear Mr. Bloodworth,

I have recently had the unhappy and
reading your manuscript: Take A Chan
adventure.

My advice? Burn it! It stunk like
floor. That, Mr. Bloodworth, is ca
do well not to litter your next man
of them.

In addition, I felt the plot of TAKE A CHANCE to be preposterous,
the characters unbelievable, the ending lame and the writing,
frankly, crap. Needless to say, Montgomery & Glick Publishing
declines your manuscript.

Please, DO NOT send this piece of trash to another publishing
house.

Very Sincerely,

Albert Godwinkle")

Word of Doctor King's death at seven-oh-five P.M. has touched off states declarations of states of emergency in several states, including Washington, D.C., Chicago and Detroit.

(He tosses the letter away.)

Tonight in Indianapolis, New York State Senator Robert F. Kennedy made an appeal for calm.

ROBERT KENNEDY: I can also say that I feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man opens the drawer and looks at the picture of the Mulder family again.)

I had a member of my family killed...

(He stuffs the picture into an envelope in the drawer.)

And he was killed by a white man.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks up at the television, closing the drawer.)

My favorite poet was Aeschylus, and he once wrote... "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget..."

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man starts to recite along with Kennedy, from memory.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN AND ROBERT KENNEDY: "Falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair and against our will comes wisdom through the awful grace..."

ROBERT KENNEDY: "...of God."

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: "Of God."

(He stares at Kennedy.)



SCENE 29
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Frohike can be heard talking illegibly, overshadowed by a siren. The Cigarette-Smoking Man struggles to light his cigarette, the lighter failing.)

PART III
"The Most Wonderful Time of the Year!"



SCENE 30
WASHINGTON D.C.; DECEMBER 24, 1991

(A much older, grayer Cigarette-Smoking Man dumps an empty nicotine patch wrapper into the ashtray, standing in front of a table of fellow board executives.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: All right, gentlemen. Let's make this short and sweet so we can all go home for Christmas.

(He takes a folder out of his briefcase, closes it and sits.)

Domestic unrest operations?

LYDON: Yeah, the Anita Hill thing has lost steam since October.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Well, let it go. We played it right. Unfounded allegations will be flying around in no time. L.A.?

MATLOCK: The Rodney King trial has been moved to Simi Valley, just as you instructed.

(A machine beeps. The read-out reads:

"TUE DEC 24, 1991 3-15 PM"

THEN:

"SADDAM HUSSEIN LINE TWO")

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Call back.

JONES: Internationally, Bosnia-Herzegovina is set for a February vote on independence from Yugoslavia.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: America couldn't care less.

(He starts to write something down.)

LYDON: I'm working on next month's Oscar nominations. Any preference?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I couldn't care less. What I don't want to see is the Bills winning the Super Bowl. As long as I'm alive, that doesn't happen.

JONES: That'll be tough, sir. Buffalo wants it bad.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: So did the Soviets in '80.

JONES: What're you saying? You rigged the Olympic hockey game?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: What's the matter? Don't you believe in miracles?

LYDON: The boss gave the Russian goaltender a pre-game good luck pat on the back... unseen novocaine needle on a bogus wedding ring. Goalie's a little slow on the stick side... four-three, home team.

(Jones looks at the Cigarette-Smoking Man with respect and a bit of awe.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Payback's a bitch, Ivan.

(He stands.)

Well, gentlemen, if that'll be all...

MATLOCK: One thing internally, sir. That "Spooky" kid who talked his way into opening X-Files... it feels like trouble.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: He's mine to keep an eye on.

(The machine beeps again twice. The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at it.

"GORBACHEV HAS RESIGNED"

He looks back at his coworkers with a hint of shock.)

Gorbachev has just resigned.

MATLOCK: There's no more enemies.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man tugs on the nicotine patch on his neck slightly, then packs up his briefcase.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Merry Christmas.

(He places boxes down in front of Matlock and Lydon.)

Merry Christmas.

(He places two more down in front of Jones and his coworker. He closes his briefcase and starts for the door. Jones stands.)

JONES: If you don't have any plans, sir... we're all getting together with our families out in Virginia. You're more than welcome to...

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man smiles widely, but quickly regains his normal cold composure.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Oh... well... um... I have to, uh, see some, uh... family.

(Jones nods. The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks out. The four men open their boxes to reveal identical bland neckties. Downstairs, the Cigarette-Smoking Man walks down a dark hallway, then hesitates in front of a door, thinking. He looks down, then walks past the door of "Fox Mulder Special Agent.")



SCENE 31
THE CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN'S APARTMENT

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man sits in front of his typewriter, sighing, holding another letter. "The Most Wonderful Time of the Year" plays. The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at the phone, then puts the letter in his desk and stares at his typewriter. He quickly opens the drawer and opens the letter. He unfolds the letter and starts to read. He crumples it up and quickly shoves it in his drawer angrily and starts to type.

"Jack Colquitt at alone in his apartment at Christmas. He believed
in sacrifice."

(He types quickly, the thoughts racing in his mind.)

"Yet, some nights, he longed for a
second chance..."

He leans back in his chair. The phone rings. He quickly picks it up.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Yeah.

DEEP THROAT: You'll never believe what we just got for Christmas.



SCENE 32
DOGWAY, WEST VIRGINIA; DECEMBER 24, 1991; 10:21 PM

(A number of troops run around, closing off a warehouse. Inside, Deep Throat watches the mayhem, looking calm. He turns back to the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who walks down the stairs. The two of them start to walk.)

DEEP THROAT: The craft matches the dimensions of the vehicle spotted over Hanoi when I was in Vietnam with the Company that the Marines couldn't shoot down.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Occupant?

DEEP THROAT: Critical.

(They turn down a hallway of plastic, like a quarantine area.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Timing couldn't be worse.

(They walk past an armed guard.)

The Roswell story we concocted was gathering momentum. Had them all looking in the wrong direction. With luck, we'll get away with it.

DEEP THROAT: Yeah, no luck tonight.

(He stops. The Cigarette-Smoking Man does as well, looking back at him.)

Our Aurora spy planes confirmed the Russians tracked entry and have pinpointed touchdown.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Haven't you heard? There are no Russians anymore.

(They start to walk again.)

DEEP THROAT: I don't care if they're in the midst of ruin. The K.G.B. is not going to ignore an event of this magnitude, nor are the Chinese, nor the Germans, nor the British, nor anyone with the capability of discovering what happened here tonight.

(They walk into a large open space inside the warehouse.)

I'm certain each of them has operatives advancing on us right now.

(They walk over two a double door with a guard on each side. One of the guards opens the door and they walk into a large room. In the middle of the room is a large glass casing, taking up most of the room. Inside is a extraterrestrial biological entity, a brown and wrinkled one, laying on a cot, hooked up to life support machines. The respirator hisses eerily.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: How many historic events have only the two of us witnessed together, Ronald? How often did we make or change history? And our names can never grace any pages of record. No monument will ever bear our image. And yet once again, tonight, the course of human history will be set by two unknown men... standing in the shadows.

(Deep Throat turns to the Cigarette-Smoking Man and pulls out a gun, then turns it around and holds it out to his partner, handle first. The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks at it, then stares at Deep Throat.)

A living E.B.E. could advance Bill Mulder's project by decades.

DEEP THROAT: Security resolution council ten-thirteen states, "Any country capturing such an entity is responsible for its immediate extermination."

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks down at the gun again, then slowly looks up at Deep Throat.)

I'm the liar. You're the killer.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Your lies have killed more in a day than I have in a lifetime. I've never killed anybody.

DEEP THROAT: Maybe I'm not the liar.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I have a chance to go an entire lifetime without killing anybody... or any thing.

DEEP THROAT: With all of our work in the past thirty years, all of our victories, if the world were to see this... it would destroy all we've gained in a few hours. Tonight... we have a new... enemy.

(Deep Throat looks over to the dying alien. The Cigarette-Smoking Man merely stares at Deep Throat, then digs into his pocket and pulls out a quarter. They both look down at it. The Cigarette-Smoking Man shows both sides to Deep Throat, then flips it up in the air.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Heads.

(It lands on heads. The two look at each other.)

Go ahead. Make history.

(Deep Throat looks at the alien solemnly, then walks into the outer part of the glass casing. He puts his gun in it's holster, then puts on the air tank as the Cigarette-Smoking Man slowly pulls the nicotine patch off his neck. Deep Throat puts on the gas mask and walks into the main compartment, the lifeline monitor beeping steadily. He takes out his gun. The Cigarette-Smoking Man pulls out a pack of Morley's. Deep Throat cocks the gun and aims. The Cigarette-Smoking Man slowly pulls out a cigarette and raises it to his mouth, watching his friend's every movement. He takes out his lighter and flicks it on with one motion as the gun sounds. Deep Throat has pulled the trigger. He does it again as the Cigarette-Smoking Man lights his cigarette. Deep Throat whimpers slightly as the monitor flatlines. He and the Cigarette-Smoking Man lower the gun and lighter respectively at the same time. The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes a long drag, thinking.)



SCENE 33
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks out the window, a flashing red light illuminating the door to the Lone Gunmen's hide-out. He flicks the radio on again.)

FROHIKE: ...might have been desperate.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man puts on his headphones again.)

At that point, your work in the basement was getting attention on the top floor. That's why you were brought in.



SCENE 34
WASHINGTON, D.C.; MARCH 6, 1992

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man leans against a filing cabinet, closing up a document. The first page reads:

"EINSTEIN'S TWIN PARADOX:
A NEW INTERPRETATION

Dana Scully - Senior Thesis

University of Maryland
May 15, 1986"

He puts a cigarette in his mouth and turns to Scully and Blevins, sitting across from one another at Blevins desk. The Senior Agent is sitting close-by. This is obviously Scully's first day, or what is to be her first day, at the X-Files.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: Agent Scully, thank you for coming on such short notice. Please...

SENIOR AGENT: Are you familiar with an agent named Fox Mulder?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man lights his cigarette.)

SCULLY: Yes, I am.

SENIOR AGENT: How so?

SCULLY: By reputation. Um, he's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult, that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988. Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section. He had a nickname at the academy... Spooky Mulder.

(She smiles at the Cigarette-Smoking Man, who gives no response.)

SCOTT BLEVINS: What I'll also tell you is that Agent Mulder has developed a consuming devotion to an unassigned project outside the bureau mainstream. Are you familiar with the so-called "X-Files?"

(Later, the Cigarette-Smoking Man sits in the board room where the meetings are held between himself and his cohorts. He is smoking a cigarette. His briefcase with the listening device is open and on. There's a knocking. Mulder can be heard over the speakers.)

MULDER: Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with you.

MULDER: Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?

SCULLY: Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.

MULDER: Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent to spy on me.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man smiles proudly.)



SCENE 35
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The crosshairs haven't moved, the gun still trained on the door to the informants' office in the present day.)

FROHIKE: Henry David Thoreau wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man is holding the gun, aiming it, getting the feel for it.)

His life has been anything but quiet, yet I believe nothing but desperate. He's the most dangerous man alive, not so much because he believes in his actions, but because he believes his actions are all which life allows him.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man looks up, still showing no emotion.)

And yet... the only person that can never escape him... is himself.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man takes his headphones off.)



SCENE 36
THE CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN'S APARTMENT

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man opens another letter half-heartedly, this one from Pivotal Publications. He obviously believes this to be another rejection letter. He unfolds the letter and reads.

"Mr. Raul Bloodworth
555 Brookabank Ave., Apt. 24
Washington, D.C.
20091

Dear Mr. Bloodworth,

Thank you, thank you, thank you for
Take A Chance: A Jack Colquitt Adv

Wow! I loved it. It's perfect for
adventure angle. Such characters
death! You are definitely on the
adventure.

Please call me as soon as you
reached at (212) 555-0127."

He gasps in a bit of excitement and quickly picks up the phone, then starts dialing. It rings once. He talks giddily.)

WOMAN: Pivotal Publishing.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Um, uh, Walden Roth, please.

WOMAN: One moment.

WALDEN ROTH: Walden Roth.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Oh, Mister Roth, hello. Um, this is Raul Bloodworth, uh, author of "Second Chance: A Jack Colquitt Adventure."

(He sits.)

WALDEN ROTH: Yes, of course, Mister Bloodworth. What an active imagination you have... alien assassinations!

(He laughs.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Is it too much? Uh, I mean, is my imagination too active?

WALDEN ROTH: No, no, I love it. Now, as I've expressed in the letter, I wish to serialize your novel in my publication "Roman a Clef."

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man smiles widely.)

Many outstanding authors received their first printing in our publication.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man laughs for the first time, a good laugh, as if his dreams were coming true.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: That's great. Um, I had an idea about the artwork. Uh, um, I thought it could have a sort of Tom Clancy-ish kind of look, and, and that...

WALDEN ROTH: Great, great, that's, that's why we work with young writers, but I'll be honest, however. You'll have to relinquish some control.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Of course. Of course.

(He doesn't sound happy about that.)

WALDEN ROTH: After all, it is our publication and I can assure you we'll handle it with the utmost respect.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No, no, no. I, I, I, I, I, I'm sure you will.

(He sighs.)

I'm just excited.

WALDEN ROTH: Understandable. Uh, do you have an agent or attorney?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: No.

WALDEN ROTH: That's fine. It's a minimum agreement of twenty-five hundred dollars, and you'll save yourself ten percent.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Well, that's fine, that's fine. Any, anything. When do you plan to publish the story.

WALDEN ROTH: "Roman a Clef." It'll be on newsstands the morning of November twelfth.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man sighs contentedly. Sometime later, he types a letter.

"November 12, 1996

Gentlemen,
Please accept this"

A ring sound. He slides the chamber back to the beginning of the line.

"of my resignation,"

Another ring. It slides back to the beginning of the next line. He pulls out the paper, places it down on the desk, and signs it. He then checks his watch and picks up his pack of cigarettes. He starts to put it in his coat pocket, but stops and stares at it. His hand slowly closes, crushing the pack.)



SCENE 37
NEWSTAND; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man walks down the street, excited. The owner of the newsstand picks up a pack of new magazines as the Cigarette-Smoking Man purveys the many magazines. One of them is called End Credits, and has an article that says "Where in the Hell is Darin Morgan?" He turns to the elderly owner, a wide smile on his face.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: Sir. Do you have this week's issue of "Roman a Clef?"

(The man cuts the ropes to a few packages, then pulls out a copy and hands him it. On the cover is a beautiful, busty woman sitting on the top of a small mountain, scantily clad.)

Thanks.

MAN: There you are.

(The cover clearly highlights in the right corner in bold, white letters, the Cigarette-Smoking Man's article. He flips open the magazine, the smile having disappeared.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: This isn't the ending that I wrote. It's all wrong.

MAN: Look, if you're going to stand there and read it, I got to have to ask you to buy it. Of course, I don't know why anybody in their right mind would want to buy that sort of crap.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man slowly turns to him, looking a bit menacing, and hands him five dollars.)

That be it?

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man stares blankly at him, looking crushed.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: A pack of Morley's.

(Down the street a bit, he sits, smoking a cigarette slowly, obviously distraught, but hiding it. A shopping cart approaches, and an old bum reaches into the garbage can nearby and pulls out a box of chocolates. The bum shakes it, then sits down next to the Cigarette-Smoking Man and starts to eat. The Cigarette-Smoking Man doesn't mind, taking a drag off his cigarette then sighing.)

Life... is like a box of chocolates. A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift that nobody ever asks for. Unreturnable, because all you get back is another box of chocolates. You're stuck with this undefinable whipped-mint crap that you mindlessly wolf down when there's nothing else left to eat. Sure, once in a while, there's a peanut butter cup, or an English toffee. But they're gone too fast, the taste is fleeting. So you end up with nothing but broken bits, filled with hardened jelly and teeth-crunching nuts, and if you're desperate enough to eat those, all you've got left is a... is an empty box... filled with useless, brown paper wrappers.

(The bum continues to eat, oblivious. The Cigarette-Smoking Man pulls the resignation letter out of his coat pocket, tears it up, and stands. He deposits it in the trash as he continues to walk away, tying his trenchcoat up.)



SCENE 38
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man loads a bullet into the chamber of the sniper rifle, ready.)

FROHIKE: So far, this is based only on a story I read in one of my weekly subscriptions that rang a bell. I'm going out to check on the private hacker source that has been working on tracking a few leads that can produce definitive proof, and then we'll have him nailed.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man pulls back the hammer as Frohike walks out of the building, then looks around. The crosshairs are directly on his head.)

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: I can kill you whenever I please...

(He squeezes on the trigger, then lets the hammer rock back, releasing the trigger. Frohike walks down the street, dimly lit in the red lights.)

But not today.

(The Cigarette-Smoking Man starts to pack up his belongings, content in his position of power over his enemies.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
SENATE SELECT SUBCOMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE AND TERRORISM
WASHINGTON, DC

SCULLY: I, Dana Katherine Scully, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. (Gavel bangs, Scully sits down.) I would like to read from a prepared statement.

SENATOR SORENSON: You may do so.

SCULLY: I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years ago because I believed in this country. Because I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish the guilty and to protect the innocent. I still believe in this country. But I believe that there are powerful men in the government who do not.

(shot of CANCERMAN)

SCULLY:. . . men who have no respect for the law and who flout it with impunity.

CHAIRMAN ROMINE: Ms. Scully. . .

SCULLY CONTINUES: I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer possible. . .

CHAIRMAN ROMINE: Agent Scully- - this is not a soapbox, Miss Scully. Your statement will be entered into the record.

SCULLY: With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, I would like to finish.

CHAIRMAN ROMINE: This is not why we are here today.

SCULLY: Then why are we here, sir?

SENATOR SORENSON: Agent Scully, do you or do you not know the whereabouts of Agent Mulder? Are you or are you not aware of Agent Mulder's present location?

SCULLY: I respectfully decline to answer that question, sir.

CHAIRMAN ROMINE: Ms. Scully, you cannot refuse to answer that question.

SCULLY: Because I believe answering that question could endanger Agent Mulder's life.

CHAIRMAN ROMINE: You don't seem to understand. Your response is not optional; you are an agent of the FBI.

SCULLY: Then if I could please finish my statement. . . that it is no longer possible to carry out my duties as an FBI agent.

SENATOR SORENSON: Are you tendering your resignation, Ms. Scully? Is that what you're trying to say?

SCULLY: No, sir. What I am saying is that there is a culture of lawlessness that has prevented me from doing my job. That the real target of this committee's investigation should be the men who are beyond prosecution and punishment. The men whose policies are behind the crimes that you are investigating.

SENATOR SORENSON: Either you tell us what you know about Agent Mulder's whereabouts, or you will be held in Contempt of Congress.

(Scully and Sorenson stare at each other.)

SENATOR SORENSON: Agent Scully?

HONOLULU AIRPORT
US CUSTOMS
TEN DAYS EARLIER

(First Courier is in line, checking his watch. Camera shows his briefcase)

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: Where are you coming from?

FIRST COURIER: Japan

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: Did you travel anywhere else?

FIRST COURIER: The Republic of Georgia.

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: The purpose of your trip?

FIRST COURIER: Government business.

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: Okay, I'm going to ask you to see the customs official right through those doors.

FIRST COURIER: What for? I'm traveling on a United States diplomatic visa.

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: Random check, sir. Please proceed through those doors.

FIRST COURIER: I've got a connecting flight.

FIRST CUSTOMS AGENT: Right through those doors, sir.

(First Courier glares.)

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Right over here, sir.

FIRST COURIER: I don't know what this is about. I have diplomatic papers. I can't be treated like this.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Is that your only piece of luggage sir?

FIRST COURIER: Yes.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Can you open it for me?

FIRST COURIER: No.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Sir, I'm not offering it as a choice. Open the briefcase, or we'll open it for you.

FIRST COURIER: I don't have the combination.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Vince, I need a strip and full body cavity search of this man.



SCENE 3
(First Courier comes out of the bathroom, disheveled -- obviously freshly strip-searched)

FIRST COURIER: There's going to be hell to pay for this treatment.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Sir, would you mind telling me what kind of diplomatic work you do, sir, and what material you're transporting in these? (starts to open containers)

FIRST COURIER: Those are filled with biohazardous materials.

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: Then where's the paperwork? And why aren't the containers marked?

FIRST COURIER: Don't open those, whatever you do -- that material cannot be exposed to --

(Second Customs Agent continues opening canister.)

FIRST COURIER: Listen to me!

(Second Customs Agent drops the canister. It breaks open on the floor.)

FIRST COURIER: Open this door! Somebody open this door!

(Black oilien worms crawl around on the floor. A few crawl up on Second Customs Agent's boot. First Courier continues yelling and pounding on door)

SECOND CUSTOMS AGENT: What the hell is this?

(Second Customs Agent convulses as the wormy things crawl on him.)

FIRST COURIER: Oh my god! Somebody open this door! Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

(We see the worms crawling below Second Customs Agent's skin. His eyes turn black.)



SCENE 4
FLUSHING, QUEENS
NEW YORK CITY, NY
3:07 AM

(Shot of street, pans to inside huge shipping container. Scully with a big gun. Mulder's looking at some machine. Both dressed in black SWAT gear.)

MULDER: We can't go in too soon. We have to be patient, it'll happen.

SCULLY: What makes you so sure?

MULDER: I've received receipts over the past few weeks for detonation cord, for racing and diesel fuel, and for 80 bags of ammonium nitrate purchased in cash in three different states under three different signatures.

SCULLY: What makes you so sure that it's here -- that it's tonight?

MULDER: I've received two new receipts, one for first and last on this storage space, and one to rent a two-ton truck yesterday. Both with the same signatures. We could be looking at the next Oklahoma City.

SCULLY: Well, so who do you think's leaking them, and why are they leaking them to you?

(Mulder shakes his head.)

SWAT GUY: (interrupts): We got traffic.

(Stray dog eats something in the road. Truck drives up, chasing dog away. Truck pulls up to building. It has a New York license plate, ZCC-696. Mulder and Scully prepare -- grabbing their guns, etc.)

SWAT GUY: They're leaving.

MULDER: Hold it.

(The truck stops, backs up. Militia guys with guns some out on the loading dock of the warehouse. FBI throw open the doors of the shipping container they are hiding in. They order the militia guys down on the ground. They throw teargas bombs; gunfire is exchanged. Two men jump in the truck and drive off. Mulder and Scully give chase. There's a gunshot, and the truck swerves to a stop.)

Mulder (To Scully): Cover the driver's side. (To the truck) Federal agent, I'm armed! Exit the vehicle, now!

(shot of blood smeared on truck window)

SCULLY: Driver's dead.

MULDER: I counted two men.

MULDER: Get out of the truck.

(They continue advancing on the truck)

MULDER: Get out of the truck!

(A gun is tossed out the window.)

MULDER: Let me see your hands! Hands in the air!

(Man gets out of the truck. It's Krycek.)

MULDER: You son of a bitch!.

(Mulder rushes up and hits Krycek in the stomach with the butt of his rifle. Krycek falls to the ground. Mulder points his gun at Krycek, raises it as if to fire.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

KRYCEK: I handed you this bust, Mulder!

MULDER: Oh, come on, Krycek!

KRYCEK: Who do you think sent you those receipts?

(Dog sniffs for explosives, militia guys taken away, etc. Krycek leads Mulder and Scully into the warehouse. He's wearing black leather jacket, olive drab sweatshirt, blue jeans, and an olive baseball cap. His hands are handcuffed in front of him.)

KRYCEK: Most of the detonation cord was stolen from a construction site, and some of the explosives were just taken from a military base. I mean, security's just so lax, it's a joke --

(Mulder shoves Krycek, forcing him to site on a crate)

KRYCEK: Most everything else was over the counter. Two thousand kilos of boom-boom.

SCULLY: How'd you get involved with these men?

KRYCEK: They found me in North Dakota. They liberated me on a salvage hunt.

(Shot of militia guy in police car, looking at Krycek)

KRYCEK: Hey, you go underground, you gotta learn to live with the rats.

(Mulder slaps off Krycek's baseball cap. Krycek's hair is cut really, really short -- a skinhead 'do.)

MULDER: I'm sure you had no trouble adapting.

KRYCEK: These men are pathetic revolutionaries who'll kill innocent Americans in the name of bonehead ideologies.

MULDER: You're full of crap, Krycek. You're an invertebrate scum-sucker whose moral dipstick is about two drops short of bone dry.

KRYCEK: Hey! I love this country. (stands, going nose to nose with Mulder)

(Mulder shoves him back down, turns away)

SCULLY: What do you want, Krycek?

KRYCEK: Same thing you do. To find the man who tried to kill me. (To Mulder) The same man that was responsible for your father's death... (turns to Scully) your sister's.

SCULLY: You want this man brought to justice?

KRYCEK: You can't bring these men to justice. They're protected. The laws of this country protect them in the name of national security. They know no law.

MULDER: Then why don't you put a bullet in his head like you did that man out there?

KRYCEK: These men, they fear one thing; exposure.

KRYCEK: You expose *him,* you expose his crimes, you destroy the destroyer's ability to destroy.

MULDER: The only thing that will destroy this man is the truth.

KRYCEK: The truth, the truth! There's no truth. These men, they make it up as they go along. They're the engineers of the future. They're the real revolutionaries. I can get them for you too.

MULDER: (smiles) We can't help you Krycek.

KRYCEK: Mulder. This is just one bomb I'm sitting on here. You didn't ask me how many more I know about.



SCENE 5
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
HERNDON, VI

(Mulder, Scully, and Krycek walk through airport. Mulder and Scully have changed out of their SWAT gear. He's in a dark suit, coat, weird, block-patterned blue and grey tie. Scully is in a blue pants suit with black t-shirt and black coat. Krycek has taken off his sweatshirt to drape over the handcuffs. He's now wearing only his white undershirt under his leather jacket. No baseball cap.)

SCULLY: What flight is he on?

(The three of them look up at the arrivals board)

KRYCEK: It's an international charter that originated in Russia. Turkish airline.

MULDER: There it is, Air Lacayo, 6:45. Fifteen minutes ago. Come on, let's go. (Places a hand on Krycek's back, urges him forward.)

SCULLY: He still has to go through customs.

KRYCEK: No. He'll be carrying a diplomatic pouch.

(The three walk briskly through airport, spot Second Courier coming through sliding doors. He's carrying fluorescent orange pouch -- presumably the diplomatic pouch.)

KRYCEK: That's him.

(Scully approaches Second Courier, pulls out her badge. )

SCULLY: Sir, federal agent. Don't be alarmed; I just need to speak with you.

(Second Courier runs back through the doors)

SCULLY: Stop! Stop right there! Sir! (Doors close with Scully on the wrong side of them. She looks to Mulder.) Mulder!

(Mulder is handcuffing Krycek to a convenient handrail. Krycek cooperates, draping his sweatshirt over the cuffs again so no one will see them. Mulder glances back at him one last time, then takes off after the courier, who knocks over passers-by and takes off down a jetway, escaping across the tarmac. Mulder and Scully stand at the end of the jetway, looking after him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look. (Points at pouch, which is lying on a pile of luggage, apparently dropped)



SCENE 6

(Mulder and Scully come back through the sliding doors, heading toward Krycek, who's still handcuffed, leaning on the railing and trying to look casual.)

SCULLY: Is this some kind of joke?

KRYCEK: What?

MULDER: Show him.

KRYCEK: What is it?

MULDER: Expose it for him, Scully.

(Scully unzips the pouch, exposing a black rock.)

MULDER: What did you get for Halloween, Charlie Brown?

(Mulder walks off angrily, Krycek and Scully look at each other.)



SCENE 7
CRYSTAL CITY, VI
11:02 PM

(Ext. Skinner's apartment building. Cut to int. Skinner's apartment. Sound of someone knocking on door. Skinner comes down the stairs, shirtless, buckling his belt.)

SKINNER: Who is it?

MULDER: I need to speak with you, sir.

(Skinner sighs with exasperation, opens door. Mulder is standing in the doorway.)

SKINNER: What do you want, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I need your authorization to provide a safe house.

SKINNER: A safe house for whom?

MULDER: (Reaches to his left and yanks Krycek into view by the collar of his jacket. He has his baseball cap again.) This man has information about extreme-right militia that could save the lives of innocent Americans.

(Krycek meets Skinner's gaze, smiles nervously)

SKINNER: He'll be safe here.

(Mulder pushes Krycek in and closes door the door. Krycek is looking around the darkened apartment when Skinner slips up behind him and punches him in the stomach with all his strength. Krycek grunts and collapses. Skinner pulls him back up by his jacket collar.)

SKINNER: Relatively safe. We're not even yet, boy. (Shakes Krycek, who is groaning in pain.) That's a start. (To Mulder) Give me the keys.

(Skinner drags Krycek across the room by the collar and throws him out onto the balcony. Krycek falls onto the balcony floor. Skinner drags him up by the collar again and cuffs his right hand to the railing. Krycek leans against the railing, unable to stand.)

KRYCEK: You can't -- you can't leave me out here, I'm going to freeze to death! (jerks at handcuffs)

(Skinner shoves Krycek down to sit on the floor. Skinner crouches down to face him.)

SKINNER: Just think warm thoughts. (stands and leaves)

(Krycek jerks at the cuffs again, then rips his cap off, glowering.)



SCENE 8
NASA-GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
GREENBELT, MD

(Day, ext. of building. Cut to int. Sign painted on glass door saying "Department of Exobiology." Shot of the rock in a clear box. Dr. Sacks is carrying it. Mulder and Scully are waiting for him. He's got weirdly patterned brown tie, she's in a beige suit, looks like the same black t-shirt.)

SACKS: I know I asked you earlier, but you have no idea where this came from?

SCULLY: Not its origin, no.

MULDER: But you have an idea, don't you?

SACKS: This rock contains what are known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fitting the approximate description of those in fragments of meteorite found in the ice fields of Antarctica.

(Mulder, Scully look amazed)

SCULLY: Are you saying. . .

SACKS: What you're looking at is quite possibly from Mars. Over four billion years old.

MULDER: Is it valuable?

SACKS: Beyond adding evidence to the debate over the fossilized remains of alien bacteria, it's relatively worthless.

SCULLY: Does this rock contain fossilized remains, Dr. Sacks?

SACKS: Well, I won't know that until I'm able to take a core sample, which I very much hope you'll allow me to do.

MULDER: I think we'd all like to know what's in that rock.



SCENE 9
(Ext. Skinner's apartment building. Skinner comes out, wearing suit, trenchcoat, drab striped/patterned tie. He starts walking. Cancerman walks up behind him, cigarettes in hand.)

CSM: I didn't realize you lived in this neighborhood, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: I just moved in.

CSM: I'd guess you live on an upper floor? For the view?

SKINNER: What do you want from me?

CSM: Agents Mulder and Scully intercepted a diplomatic pouch here in Washington last night. I'm afraid it's created a problem in foreign policy circles. Quite a problem, actually.

SKINNER: I don't know anything about a diplomatic pouch.

CSM: No? Nothing about the matter?

SKINNER: No.

CSM: Well, I find that hard to believe. As their supervisory agent. As a friend, I should advise you, Mr. Skinner, that withholding information on matters of national security is punishable under the laws of this country for treason and sedition.

SKINNER: Thank you. I'll consider myself advised. As a friend.

CSM: I need that pouch, Mr. Skinner. And I need to know who gave them the order to intercept it.

SKINNER: I'll get back to you. (Walks away.)

CSM: Wars have broken out over far less, Mr. Skinner. Far far less.

(Skinner's balcony. Krycek is still out there, dozing and shivering. He wakes up when someone enters the apartment. It's the Second Courier. He starts going through drawers, obviously searching for something. Krycek looks scared. Second Courier goes out on balcony. Krycek seems to be gone. Second Courier looks over the edge, and Krycek, who is hanging outside the balcony railing, out of sight, grabs him by the shirtfront and pulls him over. He screams and falls 17 stories.)



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS
11:17 AM

(Int. Mulder's office)

MULDER (on phone): Thank you.

(There's a knock on the door and Scully comes in.)

SCULLY: Got something?

MULDER: Big dead end at the State Department, but U.S. Customs officials detained another courier on a similar visa in Honolulu two nights ago. He was coming from Russian Georgia carrying some kind of toxic soil sample.

SCULLY: Toxic?

MULDER: Yes, which leads me to believe what's in this rock we intercepted are answers beyond the existence of extraterrestrial life. Even beyond the conspiracy to cover up that existence.

SCULLY: Mulder, that rock contains fossils of what is believed to be alien bacteria, and even that is under intense debate.

MULDER: Why all this effort to get it onto U.S. soil? I think what Alex Krycek has given us is the pivotal piece to an even larger plot.

SCULLY: What he's given us, Mulder, is a rock. Alex Krycek is a liar, and a murderer.

MULDER: Who wants to expose the same men that we do and will go to any lengths to succeed.

SCULLY: What I'm worried about is you, Mulder and how far you'll go. And how far I can follow you.

(They look at each other. Mulder turns and leaves.)



SCENE 11
(NASA-GODDARD. Dr. Sacks is wearing a biohazard suit, using a circular saw to slice the rock. Oil spurts out of rock, worms start crawling onto Sacks. He screams.)



SCENE 12
(Int. Scully's car. Mulder is in the passenger seat, on the phone.)

SKINNER: (Ccalling from phone booth) Agent Mulder, where are you?

MULDER: I'm with Scully. We're on our way out to NASA-Goddard.

SKINNER: Well, I suggest that you turn around and head home. I don't know how I'm going to explain myself to the police.

MULDER: Explain yourself about what?

SKINNER: The police are at my place with a dead body. They want to talk to everyone in the building. (Hangs up)

MULDER: Pull over here.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm gonna take a cab.

MULDER: I want you to find out about that rock. Call me as soon as you do. (Gets out of car. )



SCENE 13
(Ext. Skinner's apartment building. Covered body on stretcher, swarms of cops, curious onlookers, etc. Skinner is talking to a detective.)

SKINNER: No, I wasn't home.

DETECTIVE: And you live on what floor?

SKINNER: Seventeenth. Walter Skinner. I'm an Assistant Director with the FBI.

DETECTIVE: Oh. Oh, my apologies, I got some bad information from my lieutenant that there's a man hanging from your balcony.

(Mulder slips into the apartment building behind Detective's back. Skinner gives him a meaningful look. Cut to Krycek being shoved into Skinner's apartment from the balcony, by Mulder. Krycek is holding his right wrist, which is reddened and a little bloody. Mulder jerks Krycek's arm up painfully and removes the handcuff.)

MULDER: We're going to walk out of here like nothing happened. If anybody speaks to us, you say
nothing.

KRYCEK: I got no problem. You put me up here, man, I'm looking forward to seeing you get me out.

MULDER (whacking Krycek's forehead): Stupid-ass haircut! (Grabs Krycek by the front of his jacket, as if he's going to punch him)

KRYCEK: I got news for you, Mulder. When they find out who's dead on the ground down there, there's going to be no question whose apartment he was pulled out of.

MULDER: Who is he?

KRYCEK: Same guy with the pouch.

Mulder (pulling Krycek along): Let's go.

KRYCEK: I say follow the pouch.

(Mulder's cell phone rings)

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. Listen to me: whatever's in that rock, it appears to be lethal.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: It's Dr. Sacks. He's. . . I don't know, Mulder. I've never seen this before. I don't know if he's dead or alive.

MULDER: I think you better find out. I want you to get me an address in New York. You're going to have to go through the Bureau to get that.



SCENE 14
UPPER WEST SIDE
NEW YORK CITY, NY
12:36 PM

(Int. -- hallway of Marita's apartment building. Mulder knocks on a door -- Apt. 22.)

MARITA: Who is it?

MULDER: Fox Mulder.

(Marita opens door a crack. It's chained.)

MARITA: What are you doing here?

MULDER: I need your help.

MARITA: How do you know where I live?

MULDER: FBI database. I'm sorry, it's a matter of extreme urgency. A diplomatic pouch left Russia and arrived here in the U.S. Two men are dead. I need to know why.

(Marita unchains door. Door shuts, Mulder goes in. )

LATER ON

(Mulder is asleep on a chair in Marita's living room.)

MARITA (on phone): Do you have its destination? And its routing directories? Thank you.

(Marita comes in, kneels by sleeping Mulder.)

MARITA: Agent Mulder?

(Mulder awakes)

MARITA: The diplomatic pouch traveled an apex route to the Russian province of Krasnoyarsk.

MULDER: Krasnoyarsk?

MARITA: The point of entry was the city of Norilsk.

MULDER: That's just north of Tunguska.

MARITA: Tunguska?

MULDER: Yeah.

MARITA: What are you looking for?

MULDER: My cell phone. I gotta book myself on a flight to Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

MARITA: I can help you, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Find my cell phone?

MARITA: No. With cover credentials. A diplomatic passport. A visa.

MULDER: Why? Why are you helping me?

MARITA: Because I can. Because there are those of us who believe in you...believe in the search for the truth.

MULDER: How long will it take?

MARITA: How long do you have?

(Mulder checks his watch. It's 3:12. Marita slinks off. Mulder waits.)



SCENE 15
(Outside Marita's apartment building. Krycek is in the passenger seat of Mulder's car, sleeping with his left wrist chained to the steering wheel. Mulder walks up to the car. Krycek wakes up when Mulder opens the car door.)

KRYCEK: Where have you been?

MULDER: Making travel arrangements. (He puts key in ignition. The car clock comes on as the engine starts; it's 3:15.)

KRYCEK: To go where?

MULDER: To follow the pouch.

KRYCEK: You're going to keep me in the dark?

(Mulder punches him in the face.)

MULDER: Yeah.

(They drive away. Krycek is lolling against the car window, seemingly unconscious.)



SCENE 16
(Int. NASA-GODDARD. Scully and Pendrell are in biohazard suits. Pendrell looks very unhappy.)

PENDRELL: These are Level 4 suits. Exactly what he's wearing.

SCULLY: Contamination is impossible unless there's a tear or a loss of pressurization. So whatever happened to him, it's unlikely it penetrated the suit.

PENDRELL: What do you think happened?

Scully (puts on helmet): We won't know until we get in there and take a closer look.

(They enter the lab where Dr. Sacks is. They pass through an airlock, and attach air hoses to their suits.)

SCULLY: Look, there's a film over everything.

PENDRELL: Looks like spray kicked off the saw blade when he was cutting into the rock.

(They stare at Sacks. He moves.)

SCULLY: Oh my God! This man's alive!

PENDRELL: He can't be. I mean he's not breathing.

SCULLY: No, I think he is. I think he's in some kind of coma state or some kind of somatic rigor.

PENDRELL: Due to what?

SCULLY: I don't know, I don't know, but we have to get him out of here.



SCENE 17
JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
NEW YORK CITY

(Mulder pulls into Long-Term Parking Lot C, parks the car. He turns to look at Krycek, then gets out of the car, leaving Krycek handcuffed to the steering wheel.)

KRYCEK: Mulder, you're not --

MULDER: I'm leaving the window rolled down. If I'm not back in a week, I'll call Agent Scully to come bring you a bowl of water.

KRYCEK: Mulder! You're not gonna leave me here! I got information, Mulder, about a second bomb! Time, date and place!

(Mulder pauses. Krycek continues yelling. Mulder turns and looks back.)

KRYCEK: ...Son of a bitch, get back here!

(Mulder walks back to the car, bends to look in window.)

MULDER: What did you say to me?

KRYCEK: What?

MULDER: You called me a bad name.

KRYCEK: (Starts cursing in Russian. Calls Mulder "paskuda" and "mudak," among other things. Spits on Mulder's face.)

MULDER (smiling): You speak Russian, Krycek?

KRYCEK: My parents were Cold War immigrants, what's it to you?

(Mulder nods and smiles)



SCENE 18
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VI

(Well-Manicured Man's horse farm. He stands at rail, watching young women jump horses over gates. A large grey sedan pulls up and CSM emerges.)

WMM: You've been putting on the miles.

CSM: It would help if you had a phone.

WMM: I come out here because there are no phones. What is it?

CSM: Our courier's dead.

WMM: Yes, I heard. Pushed out a window. Can this expose us?

CSM: No, of course not. Our necessary and plausible denial is intact.

WMM: Then what is your concern?

CSM: Last night, CIA airport intel had a man using UN credentials appear on their computers booked on a flight for Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

WMM: Who was it?

CSM: We haven't been able to determine that with any certainty yet, but it appears to be a man fitting the description of Fox Mulder.

WMM: You fool, you stupid fool! This must be corrected; this must be handled!

CSM: Well, of course it can be! You know my capabilities in a crisis.

WMM: I don't think you realize what's at stake here, what level this must be carried to. This will take more than just a good aim!

(WMM stalks off, CSM looks after him, smoking.)



SCENE 19
(Int. Skinner's office. He's sitting at his desk, Scully sits across from him examining a letter.)

SCULLY: Senator Sorenson wants to see us?

SKINNER: That's usually what a letter of summons means, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Yes, but a summons for what??

SKINNER: I can only guess, but the fact I'm named in the invitation with you and Agent Mulder leads me to believe I've been implicated in something far more serious than I already know.

(Scully looks down)

SKINNER: How much more serious, Scully?

SCULLY: It's hard to say.

SKINNER: More serious than harboring a known felon? What about Agent Mulder? What does he know?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder is endeavoring to get his own answers, sir.

SKINNER: Where?



SCENE 20
TUNGUSKA, SIBERIAN FOREST
RUSSIA

(A truck -- license plate 2105M -- drives along a soggy, muddy road. It stops. Mulder and Krycek, who were sitting in back, hop out. Krycek goes around to talk to the truck driver in Russian.)

KRYCEK: (to Mulder) He says it's about five kilometers through those woods.

MULDER: Let's go. (beckons)

(Krycek says something to the truck driver in Russian and slaps his shoulder. Mulder and Krycek head off through the rain and woods.)

(Mulder and Krycek kneel on the ground, digging under coils of razor wire.)

KRYCEK: You're really gonna keep me in the dark, aren't you? (punches ground) What are we doing here, Mulder?

(Mulder looks at him, continues digging)

MULDER: June 30, 1908. Tungus tribesmen and Russian fur traders look up into the southeastern Siberian sky and see a fireball streaking to Earth. When it hit the atmosphere, it created a series of cataclysmic explosions that are considered to be the largest single cosmic event in the history of civilization. Two thousand times the force of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.

KRYCEK: What was it?

MULDER: It's been speculated that it was a piece of a comet, an asteroid, or even a piece of anti-matter. The power of the blast leveled trees in a radial pattern for 2000 kilometers. No real definitive evidence has ever been found to provide a satisfying explanation of what it was.

(Crawls under razor wire. Turns back to Krycek, looks at him through fence.)

MULDER: I think somebody found that evidence. And the explanation is something that nobody ever dreamed of.

(Mulder turns and heads up the hill, not bothering to see if Krycek follows. Krycek looks around, hesitates a moment, then crawls under the fence and runs after Mulder.)

(Mulder and Krycek run down a hill, lie flat on the ground next to each other. Mulder pulls out a pair of binoculars.)

KRYCEK: What are they doing?

(Mulder peers through binoculars, sees men digging in the ground with pickaxes, supervisors with whips on horseback.)

MULDER: Looks like some kind of mining camp.

(Man at wheelbarrow falls down, is whipped.)

MULDER: Oh!

KRYCEK (whispers) : What?

MULDER: I don't think they're miners.

(The sound of hoofbeats. Mulder and Krycek look around.)

MULDER: Run!

(They run in different directions, Russians on horseback chasing after them. Krycek falls down a
hill and is hauled up. Mulder is tripped by a whip and flogged.)



SCENE 21
(Mulder lying in cell. There's blood on his temple and his jacket has been removed. There's something under his head; not sure if it's his jacket or a blanket. There's a hole in the floor of the cell -- plumbing facilities? A voice is whispering in Russian. Mulder sits up, leans against wall, wipes blood from his face.)

MULDER: I don't speak Russian.

PRISONER: Then no one has told you.

(Mulder stands. There's a slot in the wall that lets him see the prisoner in the cell next door. Or his eyes, anyway.)

MULDER: Told me what?

PRISONER: You were brought here to die. To wish you were dead.

MULDER: I wasn't brought here. I came here looking for something.

PRISONER: The only thing you will find here is death and suffering.

MULDER: What is this place?

PRISONER: This place? A gulag. A place where the guilty rule the innocent.

(The cell door opens. Two guards are there, holding Krycek with his right arm twisted behind his back and a billy club against his throat. They throw him onto the floor of the cell. He stands and yells something in Russian. The guards reply, twirling their keys and clubs, then lock the door. Krycek throws himself against the door, clawing at it.)

KRYCEK: We gotta get out of here. (Looks at Mulder.) They're going to torture us. (Crosses cell to claw at bars on window.)

MULDER: How do you know?

KRYCEK: They were questioning me. (Gives up on window, comes to stand chest to chest with Mulder.) Trying to get me to confess.

MULDER: To what?

KRYCEK: To being a spy.

(Mulder slams Krycek up against the wall, arm against his throat.)

MULDER: What did you tell them?

KRYCEK: That we were stupid Americans lost in the woods. (They stare at each other.) Mulder, you're going to need me in here. (Shoves Mulder's arm away from his throat.) Don't touch me again.

(They stare at each other, nose to nose. Mulder finally turns away. Krycek goes back to prying at the bars on the window.)



SCENE 22
SENATE EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING

(Ext. shot of building, cut to int. Sen. Sorenson's office. Scully and Skinner are ushered in.)

SENATOR SORENSON: Ah, Agent Scully, Mr. Skinner, thank you for coming.

SKINNER:(Shakes hand) Well, it was difficult to decline an invitation from a member of Congress, Senator.

SENATOR SORENSON: Please, have a seat. Are you familiar with the penalties for obstruction of justice?

SCULLY: Is that a rhetorical question, sir?

SENATOR SORENSON: You know why you've been called here today?

SKINNER: We have an idea, Senator.

SENATOR SORENSON: We've been looking into the death of this man outside your apartment, Mr. Skinner, and it's raised some troubling questions.

SKINNER: Such as?

SENATOR SORENSON: What this man was doing on your balcony before he fell to his death.

(Skinner and Sorenson look at each other)

SENATOR SORENSON: It was your balcony, wasn't it, Mr. Skinner? (more looks) Perjury is a very serious offense, particularly for an FBI agent.

SCULLY: We intend to file a complete report on this matter, sir, once we fully understand what it is that we're investigating.

SENATOR SORENSON: And Agent Mulder. . . can you explain to me why he declined my invitation to be here today?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder is in the field, sir, seeking answers to the questions you are asking.

SENATOR SORENSON: And where is he seeking these answers?

(Scully looks at Skinner.)

SENATOR SORENSON: Agent Scully?



SCENE 23
(The cell in Tunguska. A voice calls "Dinner!" in Russian. Bowls of yellow soup are slid through a slot at the bottom of the cell door. Krycek drinks from one and hands the other to Mulder. When he does this, you can see that Krycek's right wrist is still red and swollen. Mulder takes a sip, then spits it out. He pulls a large, wiggling roach out to of the soup. He shows it to Krycek, and they both throw their bowls on the floor. The door opens, and a guard comes in yelling. He pulls Krycek up and seems about to beat him until Krycek starts talking to him in Russian.)

APPROXIMATE TRANSLATION:

GUARD: Get up! Get up! (Grabs Krycek)

KRYCEK: I want to see your supervisor.

GUARD: (grabbing Krycek by his shirt front) Why would my supervisor want to see you?

KRYCEK: He'll want to see me.

GUARD: (lets go of Krycek, backs away) I don't know...I don't know...

MULDER: What are you saying?

KRYCEK: That I want to see his supervisor.

GUARD: Okay, but if he doesn't want to see you, you'll be accountable.

KRYCEK: (nods) I'll be accountable, I'll be accountable.

(Guard lets Krycek out of cell. Krycek stops, turns to Mulder.)

KRYCEK: Da svidanya. [Good-bye]

(Krycek leaves, door shuts, Mulder turns away in disgust.)

PRISONER: That man is not your friend. He speaks indifferently to the guards. Formal language, as if to an equal. You are deceived.

MULDER: Who are you?

PRISONER: A prisoner, like you, but I have committed no crime.

MULDER: Why are you here?

PRISONER: To do the work. Like the others. Like them, I will die in an experiment when there is no longer any use for me.

MULDER: What kind of experiment?

(Door opens again. Russian doctor comes in with guards. They hold Mulder down and the doctor injects something into the back of his neck.)

MULDER: NO!



SCENE 24

(Cut to Mulder naked on table, under chicken wire, along with many others. A guard walks up and down, the doctor observes. The sounds of screaming. A pipe over Mulder's face splashes black gunk on him. He struggles, futilely. Black oilien worms crawl up his nose and under his skin. His eyes turn black and swirly.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                   TERMA



SCENE 1
HARROW CONVALESCENT HOME,
BOCA RATON, FL

Nighttime
The scene opens at a window as the shade is being drawn.

A woman arrives in a minivan and enters the home. She stops near the bed of an old woman.

WOMAN: Auntie Janet? (the older woman awakens) Its time, Auntie Janet. Hes waiting.

The two women go outside toward the minivan. They enter it. A man is inside.

DOCTOR: We should hurry. We have papers to sign.(old woman nods. The doctor checks what looks like a suicide machine. ) Just tell me when.

AUNTIE JANET: Dont you cry for me, dear. Im tired of the pain.(She pushes a plunger to activate the machine.) Youre my angel of mercy. (she appears to fall into a restful sleep.

WOMAN: Is she gone?

DOCTOR: (checking her heartbeat) Somethings wrong here. (oily worms crawl out from under the old womans skin. The young woman screams).

SCENE 2

(A hand dipping a tea bag in a cozy, if modest apartment.)
(knocking is heard)

VASSILY PESKOW: [who is it]?

MESSENGER: [answers in Russian] (Peskow answers door) Vassily Peskow? [I have an urgent communiqu from Comrade Arntzen in Krasnoyarsk.]

PESKOW: [Please, I am retired from all of that now.]

MESSENGER: [Comrade Arntzen anticipated this response.]

PESKOW: [What does he want from me?]

MESSENGER: [He wants you to know that the Cold War isnt over. (he draws an envelope out of his jacket and hands it to Peskow, before walking away. Peskow turns it over in his hands. He closes the door.)]



SCENE 3
Interior of the gulag. Mulder is sleeping, huddled into a ball.

PRISONER: Prisoner? Hey Prisoner. (Mulder slowly awakens). I thought maybe you were dead.

MULDER: How long have I been lying here?

PRISONER: Hours...I dont know. The first time is bad.

MULDER: Theyve done this to you?

PRISONER: Yes. It becomes easier each time....until it kills you.

MULDER: What did they do to me.

PRISONER: You have been exposed to the Black Cancer.

MULDER: Black Cancer?

PRISONER: The cancer that lives in the rock.

MULDER: (advancing toward a hole in the wall where the other prisoners eyes are visible) Who are you?

PRISONER: I was a geologist....quite well known actually...but now I am just a test subject.

MULDER: You helped them find the rock?

PRISONER: I was there when they brought up the first fragments. This was before the mining....before we knew what lived in Tunguska Rock...

MULDER: How many men have dies here?

PRISONER: Hundreds...maybe more...The search for a cure goes slowly.

MULDER: Is that what they say the tests are for...to find a cure?

PRISONER: (shaking his head) No...they tell us nothing...We are left to guess and imagine the reasons for out torture....But, what else could it be?

MULDER: What happened to the man who was in the cell with me, Krycek?

PRISONER: He is most likely dining with the men responsible for our torture... I heard laughter when they left your cell.

MULDER: Im not going to die...

PRISONER: Why not?

MULDER: I have to live long enough to kill that man, Krycek.
(The prisoner passes something through the hole. Mulder examines it...it looks like a crude knife.) Where did you get this?

PRISONER: I made it...to kill myself....It took me two weeks- by then I had lost the desire.

MULDER: Youd rather suffer the torture?

PRISONER: (sighs) It is wonderful- the persistence of life. That rock we found buried so deep in the Earth- that ANYTHING could survive down there goes beyond all reason...No. They will have to kill me themselves.



SCENE 4
NASA GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
GREENBELT, MD

SCULLY: We havent been able to give him anything but fluids for over forty-eight hours.

PENDRELL: Well, it doesnt help that hes in a restricted environment.

SCULLY: Well, if he has been infected by some kind of organism we risk contamination...Are you seeing anything?

PENDRELL: The blood in the carotid artery looks slightly thickened...Possibly due to the decreased heart rate and blood pressure....Now whats this? What the hell is this?

SCULLY: What is it?

PENDRELL: I dont know...It looks like its concentrated around his pineal body...I think its alive.

SCULLY: It looks like a nest....some type of black vermiform organism attached to the pineal gland.



SCENE 5
RICHMOND, VI
Peskow is sitting at a bus stop, peeling an apple. He offers some to the woman sitting next to him.

PESKOW: Apple?

WOMAN 2: No. Thank you very much though.
Peskow boards the bus.
The destination sign changes from Richmond to Charlottesville.



SCENE 6
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VI

(Nighttime in a barn. Horses can be heard. A figure is approaching through the open barn door. It is Dr. Charne-Sayer. She gasps as she notices an intruder.)

PESKOW: Oh, pardon me.

DR. CHARNE-SAYER: Who are you?

PESKOW: As a boy, my father had a farm....not horses like these.(He approaches her) My name is Vassily Peskow.

DR. CHARNE-SAYER: Mr. Peskow...Im sorry, but you dont belong in here.

PESKOW: I am sorry, very sorry.

DR. CHARNE-SAYER: You are going to have to leave here. Im going to call you a cab.

PESKOW: But I have come here to see you, Dr. Charne-Sayre.

DR. CHARNE-SAYRE: (Spins around) Do I know you?

PESKOW: No...I dont know how you could.(In a sudden viscous motion, he grabs her throat. She gasps and kicks)



SCENE 7
OUTSIDE SCULLYS APARTMENT

SKINNER: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Sir...what are you...

SKINNER: Ive been trying to contact you for hours...The better part of the day.

SCULLY: Im sorry sir, my cell phone was turned off.

SKINNER: You owe me some answers, Agent Scully. Answers I dont have to the questions Im being asked about this missing diplomatic pouch. The pouch presumably being carried by the man who was allegedly pushed off my balcony, and whose connection to a known felon I harbored in my house against all good sense, Im going to have to explain to avoid perjuring myself before a Senate sub-committee tomorrow. Which, I might remind you, is a very serious crime in itself. Is it not, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes Sir. Sir, if I might explain...the contents of that pouch...it contained some sort of a biohazardous organism that is, luckily, being contained in a contamination laboratory at NASA Goddard, where Ive been all day trying to determine its exact nature.

SKINNER: That pouch you intercepted. Do you know what its intended destination was?

SCULLY: No sir, I dont.

SKINNER: Well, I do, Agent Scully, because I bent some rules this morning when I couldnt find you. To find out who was to receive it.

SCULLY: Who was it?

SKINNER:Dr. Bonita Charne-Sayre. Are you familiar with that name?

SCULLY: Yes sir, I am...Shes a well-know physician....and a...a virologist whos looked in on presidents. Shes also an authority on...on variola viruses.

SKINNER: Variola?

SCULLY: Smallpox....Shes been a vocal proponent of eliminating the last remaining stores of the Smallpox virus....destroying the only remaining vials in facilities here in Atlanta and the former Soviet Union.

SKINNER: Well, she was killed tonight.

SCULLY: Killed?

SKINNER: A horse stepped on her throat in a riding accident in Virginia.



SCENE 8

(Mulders cell in the gulag. Voices are faintly heard in the background. Mulders cell door clanks open.)

GUARD: [Gives Mulder an order in Russian]

MULDER: Where are we going?

GUARD:(Doesnt answer. He kicks Mulder in the chest and pulls him to his feet, all the while shouting in Russian which I dont understand.)



SCENE 9

Gulag, exterior. The prisoners are being marched along in rows. There are dozens or weary men, all in matching grey uniforms. The green truck that brought Mulder and Krycek to the gulag (see Tunguska) drives into the yard. Mulder catches sight of Alex Krycek, looking clean and warm, walking up a ramp in the far end of the yard. Alex greets the man who appears to be in charge.

PRISONER: Prisoner.....Is that your friend? (Alex and the man hug. Alex holds a lighter for the mans cigarette.) You have but one chance.

GUARD: (approaches the men)[(speaking Russian)Move it!]

MULDER:( draws knife from his pocket and breaks out of the line. He runs towards Alex and knocks him into the bed of the truck. He punches Krycek in the face, knocking our beloved hero unconscious. Mulder holds the guards at bay with the knife and manages to get into the cab of the truck and drive out of the yard. The prisoners cheer as Mulder drives away with Alex still lying in the truckbed. The in charge man sends guards after them on horseback. The guards shoot at them, but Mulder only drives faster. Alex slowly wakes up. He angrily pounds the glass behind Mulder's head. Sensing that he is in danger, he rolls off the truck, landing hard on his right arm. Mulder realizes too late that the brakes of the truck have given out. He is forced to crash the truck into a ditch.



SCENE 10
WELL-MANICURED MANS FARM.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA

Night. A dark car pulls up in front of the house. The Cigarette Smoking Man steps out and climbs the steps to the porch where well manicured man is sitting, smoking a cigarette.

CSM: Thats a nasty habit...bad for the health.

WELL-MANICURED MAN: (snuffs out cigarette with his shoe) Health is the least of my concerns at the moment.

CSM: Yes. (lights cigarette) According to reports your....personal physician suffered a serious riding accident here on your property.

WMM: Dr. Charne-Sayre was murdered.

CSM: By whom?

WMM: If I knew, do you think Id be standing here talking to you?

CSM: (smiling) Oh....you need me now...A man of my capabilities...is that it?

WMM: This was a professional hit.

CSM: And you out here all alone...so vulnerable...Were you sleeping with her? Surely you wouldnt be so foolish as to put the project at risk for the sake of your personal pleasures.

WMM: Find her killer!

CSM: Call off this Congressional investigation.

WMM: I cant. But, Senator Sorenson is an honorable man. They are all honorable ...these Honorable men (WMM starts to walk away)

CSM: I heard Mulder was captured in Tunguska. (WMM stops and turns around) I hear now hes escaped. Wake the Russian Bear and it may find weve stolen its honey.



SCENE 11
TUNGUSKA

(The horse guards approach the wrecked truck. There is blood on the windshield, but no Mulder.)

GUARD 2: [hes gone]

IN CHARGE GUY:[ Back on your horses. We must find him.]



SCENE 12

(The woods. Krycek is running, still holding his injured right arm. He falls to the ground in pain. A sound startles him. From the woods, a group of young men emerge. Curiously, they are all missing their left arms. They surround Alex.)

KRYCEK: (catches his breath before addressing them in Russian) [What do you want from me?]

FIRST MAN: [Why do you run?]

KRYCEK: [I have escaped from the prison camp.]

FIRST MAN: (examining Alex closely)[You are a liar.]

KRYCEK: No...(he realizes that he has reverted to English and nervously excuses himself) Im sorry..Nyet- [I am American....and Ive been falsely accused of spying.]

FIRST MAN: Then your enemy is mine. We can protect you.



SCENE 13

(Night. The guards are still searching for Mulder and Krycek. They pass through a small clearing. As they pass, Mulder wearily peeks out from a pile of dead leaves.)



SCENE 14
SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE AND TERRORISM
WASHINGTON, D.C.

SCULLY: I Dana Katherine Scully swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me so help me God. (a gavel falls and she takes a seat.) I would like to read from a prepared statement.

MR. ROMINE: You may do so.

SCULLY: I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years ago because I believed in this country. ( a messenger hands a note to Mr. Romine) because I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish the guilty and to protect the innocent.( Mr. Romine hands a reply to the messenger, who takes it to Senator Sorenson.) I still believe in this country, but I believe that there are powerful men in this government who do not . (Senator Sorenson reads the note.) ...men who have no respect for the law, and who flout it with impunity.

MR. ROMINE: Uh...Miss Scully...

SCULLY: (continuing) I have come to the conclusion....

MR. ROMINE: (growing impatient) Agent Scully.

SCULLY: ...that it is no longer possible...

MR. ROMINE: This is not a soapbox Miss Scully. Your statement will be entered into the record.

SCULLY: With all due respect Mr. Chairman, I would like to finish.

MR. ROMINE: This is NOT why we are here today.

SCULLY: Then why are we here, sir?

SENATOR SORENSON: Agent Scully, do you or do you not know the whereabouts of Agent Mulder? (Scully looks at him) Are you, or are you not aware of Agent Mulders present location?

SCULLY: I respectfully refuse to answer that question, sir, because...

MR. ROMINE: Agent Scully, you cannot refuse to answer that question.

SCULLY: Because I believe that answering that question could endanger Agent Mulders life.

MR. ROMINE: You dont seem to understand. Your response is not optional. You are an agent of the FBI.

SCULLY: Then if I may please finish my statement...(starting before they have a chance to stop her)...that it is no longer possible for me to carry out my duties as an FBI agent.

SENATOR SORENSON: Are you tendering your resignation, Agent Scully. Is that what youre trying to say?

SCULLY: No, sir. What I am saying, is that there is a culture of lawlessness that has prevented me from doing my job- that the real target of this committees investigation should be the men who are beyond prosecution and punishment....the men whose secret policies are behind the crimes that you are investigating.

SENATOR SORENSON: You have a legal obligation to answer the questions posed to you. Now....either you tell us what you know about Agent Mulders whereabouts, or youll be held in contempt of Congress.



SCENE 15

(Buzzer Sounds)

SCENE: Scully is being led down a white hallway by a U.S. Marshall. She is led to a cell and locked inside.



SCENE 16
Woods, daylight. The truck driver enters the clearing. He roots around in the leaves and angrily pulls Agent Mulder out.

TRUCK DRIVER:[ You idiot! You ruined my truck!]



SCENE 17

(Truck Drivers home. His wife is sitting at a table reading something. The truck driver throws Mulder to the floor. The wife gasps and spins around.)

DRIVER: [This sonofabitch ruined my truck!]

WIFE: [Be careful with him. Hes hurt.]

DRIVER:[We cant keep him here. Theyre looking for him.]

WIFE: (fetching hot water)[ You shouldnt bring him here if you dont want me to take care of him.]

DRIVER: [Hes not staying.] (walks outside, angrily slamming the door.)

WIFE: Kak va za voot? (what is your name?) Kak va za voot?!?

MULDER: No Russian.

WIFE: American?

MULDER: Tell your husband Im sorry about his truck.

WIFE: (examines Mulders arm. She sees that he has been given the test.) The test!?!

MULDER: Yeah.

WIFE:(sighs and shakes her head) They kill everybody for the test.

MULDER: Why dont they kill you?

WIFE: My husband makes deliveries. They spare our lives. But now...no truck... he is afraid.

MULDER: Well, I have to go now.

WIFE: No.

MULDER: Theyll come looking for me. Theyll come looking for you.

WIFE: No. There are other ways.

MULDER: I dont know what youre talking about. What other ways?

WIFE: Grisha! ( a young boy enters. He too has no left arm) No arm. No test.

MULDER: You dont understand...these tests. The smallpox scar on your arm is some kind of identification. You have to help me escape. Ill help you escape. You have to help me get to St. Petersburg. (there is a sound at the door. Mulder spins around. The driver is standing in the doorway with a large knife.)



SCENE 18

(Night. Alex Krycek is asleep, huddled in a blanket by a roaring campfire. All too late, he snaps awake. The men surround him and pin him down. Man one comes at him with a red hot knife. He begins to saw on Alexs left arm while our beloved hero writhes and screams in agony.)



SCENE 19

(Scullys cell. She is reading a document labeled simply : Variola Virus She turns as the cell door opens. Skinner enters.)

SKINNER: You holding up?

SCULLY: Ive got plenty to read.

SKINNER: I can understand you protecting Agent Mulder but...

SCULLY: Its not just Agent Mulder that I am protecting, sir.

SKINNER: Then what are you doing?

SCULLY: We were called before this committee to answer questions about a murder- about an intercepted diplomatic pouch- a pouch that was to be delivered to a prominent doctor- a woman who is now dead, as is the man who was delivering said pouch- the contents of which have infected an exobiologist with a paralyzing toxin. Yet, what are we stuck on here? The whereabouts of Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: You mean its the wrong question.

SCULLY: Several of the men on this committee are lawyers. It is my experience that lawyers ask the wrong question only when they dont want the right answer.

SKINNER: Unless Agent Mulder has already found the answers theyre looking for.

SCULLY: Or someone wants to make sure that he doesnt find out.

SKINNER: These are congressmen were talking about, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I know that, sir. And it is my natural inclination to believe that they are acting in the best interest of the truth...but I am not inclined to follow my own judgement in this case.

SKINNER: Youre going to follow Agent Mulders? Is that it?



SCENE 20
CONTAINMENT LAB AT NASA GODDARD

Peskow enters the safe room. Dr. Sacks is lying on the table. Peskow takes out a syringe. He squishes out some of its contents before plunging it through the suit into the Doctors neck. The oily worms crawl out of the doctors nose and eyes. Peskow takes the rock and leaves.



SCENE 21
WELL-MANICURED MANS FARM.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA

CSM: His name is Vassily Peskow. He was a KGB line-X stringer working out of Moscow center.

WMM: But how could this be? How could the Russians know we were working on our own inoculation? Six of us knew!

CSM: Dr. Charne-Sayre?

WMM: (defensively) She was trusted...absolutely!

CSM: (calmly taking a drag off his cigarette) Then I dont know.

WMM: Find this man! Find him!

CSM: If my intelligence sources are right...I think theres someone who might save us the trouble.



SCENE 22
INTERIOR. SENATE SUB-COMMITTEE.

(Gavel pounds)

SENATOR SORENSON: Mr. Chairman, may I? (Mr. Romine motions for him to proceed) Agent Scully...youve had a good long time to think about the question that was asked in our last session. I want to give you the opportunity to answer that question here, today. So I can help our good chairman here to get on with this proceeding.

SCULLY: I cant answer that question, sir.

SENATOR SORENSON: Im going to ask you again. Where is Special Agent Mulder? Why is he not here?

SCULLY: Id be happy to answer you questions about the man carrying the diplomatic pouch...

SENATOR SORENSON: Agent Scully.
SCULLY: ...about his murder, and my opinion about its connection to the death of Dr. Bonita Charne-Sayre of the World Health Organization...

SENATOR SORENSON: Miss Scully....youll get your chance with all of that...

SCULLY: or about the biotoxin being transported within that pouch.

SENATOR SORENSON: (angrily) Answer the question Miss Scully.

MULDER: What is the question? (they all gasp and turn to see Mulder- with BOTH arms.)

MR. ROMINE: (pounds gavel) All right. Lets come to order. Agent Scully...do continue.

SCULLY: Yes, sir. If I may Id like to finish making my point.

MR. ROMINE: What is your point, Miss Scully?

SCULLY: That the death of Doctor Charne-Sayre, given her field of expertise, not only suggests that she knew something about the toxin, but also its origins, and that knowledge may be directly linked to the man in Assistant Director Skinners apartment building ( as she is talking, A.D. Skinner walks in. He does a double take when he sees Agent Mulder. He whispers something to Agent Scully.)

SENATOR SORENSON: Miss Scully?

SCULLY: Yes, sir...uh...Assistant Director Skinner has just informed me that there has been an accident directly related...

SENATOR SORENSON: An accident...?

SCULLY: A doctor, infected with the toxin, has died under suspicious circumstances involving a theft of evidence...of the contents of the diplomatic pouch...

MR. ROMINE: Well, weve gotten off to a real fine start here. Im going to recess now until this new matter can be explained. So that we might then begin to move in a forward direction.(He pounds the gavel)

SCULLY: (pushes away from the desk and moves toward her partner)
Mulder...(she hugs him).

MULDER: I get to put my arms around you...both of them.

SCULLY: When did you get back here?

MULDER: Its been a long, strange trip.

SKINNER: Some other time. I think theres been enough strangeness here to sort through.

SCULLY: Mulder, Ive made several connections about this toxin- about what it might be...

MULDER: So have I.

SCULLY: Sir? I need your permission to book two airfares to Boca Raton, Florida. It shouldnt take more than twelve...fifteen hours...but in the even that it does, I need you to stall the committee tomorrow, for the purpose of...

SKINNER: If you explain it to me, Agent Scully, Im going to have to explain it to them. I suggest you do everything in your power to make it back for tomorrows session...or I cant help you.( he gives them both meaningful glances before walking away.)

MULDER: Boca Raton?

SCULLY: Dr. Bonita Charne-Sayre is a board member and a chief physician for a chain if elder-care convalescent hospitals across the country....guess what one of her patients died of in Boca Raton?



SCENE 23
HARROW CONVALESCENT HOME
BOCA RATON, FLORIDA
8:15 PM

Inside the elder care center. A nurse is giving the patients their nightly medicine. Vassily Peskow walks in casually, smiling at the nurse. He removes a bottle of pills from his pocket. He goes to the medicine cabinet and switches his pills for ones in an identical bottle.



SCENE 24
AT THE CONVALESCENT HOME, 9:32 PM.

NURSE: (answering door) Yes. What is it?

SCULLY: (brandishing creds) Agents Mulder and Scully. We need your permission to come onto the premises and speak with you or any of your patients.

NURSE: What about?

MULDER: May we come in?

NURSE: Well, yes.
(They all walk into the ward)

SCULLY: When was the last time these patients were checked.

NURSE: An hour ago, at bed check.

SCULLY: (checking a patients pulse) This man is dead.

NURSE: What?
(Mulder examines other beds. The patients are dead. Oily worms rest near their orifices. One woman is clutching an empty paper cup.)

MULDER: Scully.(Scully walks over) These people are test subjects. Theyve all been poisoned.

SCULLY: Who gave these patients their meds tonight?

NURSE: (forlornly) I did.

SCULLY: Okay, I need you to call 911. Tell them you have an emergency quarantine of a biohazardous material. I need you to show us all of the entrances of the hospital. Weve got to seal this building immediately.
(As the door closes, the camera moves in on the last bed. We see Vassily Peskow rise and sneak out).



SCENE 25
FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, NEW YORK CITY

SCULLY: I do not understand what it is you hope to learn here.

MULDER: Everything thats happened....every death weve seen can be traced back to one man.

SCULLY: But according to you that man is in Russia...possibly even dead.

MULDER: Well, he isnt working alone.(They are led into a cell block).
Terry Edward Mayhew. Can we talk with you...have a little off the record chat?

MAYHEW: About?

MULDER: Alex Krycek.

MAYHEW: Who?

MULDER: The man who set you up....you and the members of your militia.

MAYHEW: Name wasnt Krycek. It was Arntzen, or something like that.

MULDER: You came into contact with him in North Dakota salvaging materials from a missile silo.

MAYHEW: I aint never been in no missile silo. I dont know nothing about that.

SCULLY: This man Krycek, or Arntzen as you call him...How did he come into contact with you?...off the record.

MAYHEW: He came to us...with some building materials and big ideas.

MULDER: What was he looking to build?

MAYHEW: Two....devices.

MULDER: Did he ever mention Black Cancer.

MAYHEW: Oh yeah!

SCULLY: What did he say?

MAYHEW: Developed by the Soviets. Saddam used it in the Gulf.

SCULLY: You mean...used as bio-warfare?

MAYHEW: Why do you think they made them servicemen take all them pills? U.S. Government knew about the Black Cancer. They lied. Didnt have no cure...no inoculation.....I think well quit right there. I got nothing more to say.

SCULLY: Lets go Mulder.

MULDER: Wait a second. You said there were...uh..two devices. What happened to the other bomb?

MAYHEW: I ate it.

MULDER: (looses his patience and throttles Mayhew).

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: You want to know about anarchy? You dont tell me where that other bomb is and Ill make sure you spend your prison time on your bigoted hands and knees putting a big smile on some convicts face.

MAYHEW: (gasping) Sonofabitch stole it- truck and all. Some storage garage.

MULDER: Where?

MAYHEW: Terma...North Dakota.

MULDER: Thank You.(releases him and heads out of cell) Scully, get on the phone and get the license numbers for any two-ton trucks stolen in North Dakota in the last six months. Then call Canadian border authorities and have them stop any truck fitting that description. Tell them theyre
looking for a bomb.

SCULLY: What are you doing, Mulder?

MULDER: This has been a big setup from the beginning- almost perfectly executed. Someone used Krycek, then Krycek used us...someone who didnt want that rock in American hands.

SCULLY: But whats in Canada?

MULDER: Where would you put this rock if you didnt want it to be found?

SCULLY: Back in the ground.



SCENE 26
BORDER CROSSING, ALBERTA CANADA

SCENE: Vassily Peskows truck is stopped by border authorities.

PESKOW: Fertilizer for my hothouse tomatoes. Beautiful tomatoes, all year, eh? (the border guard returns his license) Thanks.( pulls down back door of truck).



SCENE 27

(Daytime. Helicopter flying over what appears to be an abandoned oil refinery.)
The copter lands and Mulder gets out.

MULDER: Go back to the refinery. See if you can find anybody who knows anything about that truck.

Scully: (nods)
(The chopper takes off. Mulder approaches the truck. he tries to open the door. Peers in the window, etc. He spies a pipe sticking out of the ground.

CUT TO SCULLY GETTING OUT OF CHOPPER AT REFINERY

SCULLY:(goes to gate and climbs fence. The chopper takes off behind her. Peskow sees her and goes to hide. The sound of the closing door alerts Scully.

CUT TO MULDER, TAKING GRATE OFF PIPE

MULDER: Peers into the pipe. Sees a box, but cant reach it. Suddenly, the oil well next to him comes on, coating the ground and Mulder with oil. He is still trying to reach the box.)

CUT TO SCULLY AT REFINERY

SCULLY: (Goes to door marked Valve Room. She cannot open the door.)

CUT TO MULDER, REACHING FOR THE BOX

MULDER: (hears a beeping sound. The bomb is about to detonate. He runs away. He is barely out of harms way as the bomb explodes.

CUT TO SCULLY, REACTING TO THE EXPLOSION

PESKOW: (sneaks up behind Scully. He throws his arm in a choke-hold about her neck. He draws her gun and points it at her head.) I would just as soon kill you, but please, dont make me. My work is done. Sur Posidive. [at last].( he releases her and backs away, still holding the gun at her.)

SCULLY: (glances at the oil blaze (caused by the explosion) and hurries off to find Mulder. She finds him lying on the ground near the fire.) Mulder! (she helps him to his feet and leads him away).



SCENE 28
INTERIOR. SENATE SUB-COMMITTEE CHAMBERS.

(Gavel pounds)

MR. ROMINE: Id like to get started here. Miss Scully?

SCULLY: Yes...Im ready here, sir.

MR. ROMINE: You have evidence to present. At least, thats what Ive been told.

SCULLY: Yes, Senator...evidence linking a number of deaths... a great number...to a biotoxin that was transported to US soil by a courier who was also killed.

SENATOR SORENSON: Is this the same man who was pushed from the Assistant Directors apartment?

SCULLY: Yes. He has not been IDed.

SENATOR SORENSON: Do we have the name of the individual who pushed him?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. Alex Krycek...who is missing and, possibly , deceased.

SENATOR SORENSON: And are you then in possession of the pouch or its contents?

SCULLY: No sir. (The senators whisper among themselves)

SENATOR SORENSON: What evidence are you then presenting us with today?

SCULLY: Documents and interviews in support of a wide-ranging conspiracy to control a lethal bio-toxin that is, in fact, extra-terrestrial (as she speaks, Mulder comes to stand beside her, under the auspice of handing her a file)in origin.

SENATOR SORENSON: (chuckling) Well...uh....what are we talking about...?Little green men, here?

SCULLY: No, sir. Not at all.

MULDER:(interrupting) Why is this so hard to believe? When the accepted discovery of life off this planet is on the front page of every newspaper around the world? When the most conservative scientists and science journals are calling for the exploration of Mars and Jupiter? With every reason to believe that life and the persistence of it is thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere? If you cannot get past this, then I suggest this whole committee be held in contempt, for ignoring evidence that cannot be refuted.

SENATOR SORENSON: This is NOT why we are here today.

MULDER: Then why are we here today?!?

MR. ROMINE: I will suggest that we recess here until such a time that all the evidence can be properly evaluated.(bangs gavel).
(CSM stands up in the rear and slinks out).



SCENE 29
ST. PETERSBURG, RUSSIA.

SCENE: Night. Interior of Peskows apartment. Peskow enters the apartment and stops suddenly as he notices a guest.

PESKOW: [ Please, if you are here to ask another favor, I am retired...Comrade Krycek.]

KRYCEK: I am only here, Comrade, to congratulate you on a fine job.

PESKOW: Harasho (thank you)
(The camera trails down to the tea bag Alex is dipping with a pale, shiny, hideous fake arm.....)



SCENE 30

(Scene disolves to Senator Sorenson's office, where he's reading over a folder, presumably the report re: Tunguska. He holds it open and hands it over his desk to .... Cancer Man! CSM, with a lit cigarette in his mouth, glances over the report, takes his cigarette out of his mouth as the ash falls onto the pages, then places the folder in what looks like a box full of other soon-to-be "forgotten" files.)

[THE END]
                                   PAPER HEARTS


SCENE 1
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder lays asleep on his couch when he wakes up and notices something on the ceiling. A small red dot. The red dot moves down off the ceiling and onto the wall as Mulder sits up. The red dot stops and forms the word "Follow." It continues down onto the floor. Mulder stands and follows. He follows it outside, where it goes onto a white El Camino and forms the words "Mad Hat." It then continues past a sign that reads "Bosher's Run Park, Manassas Parks & Rec." The red dot shoots off into the woods. Mulder runs after it and sees it on a tree. It slides down onto the floor, onto the chest of a little girl. She is dead, laying in a pile leaves. The red dot forms a heart on the right side of her chest and she sinks down into the ground, the heart remaining for a few seconds, then disappearing as leaves cover the girl. Mulder gasps as he wakes up on his couch. He sighs and looks around, then gets up and throws a phone book down onto the desk. It is the Fairfax County phone book, and the first address under "Parks" is "Bosher's Run Park." The address is "6002 Lonetree Rd." Getting in his car, he drives off and pulls up to the park. Carrying a flashlight, he walks past the sign he saw in his dream and over to the spot where he had been. There is no little girl there, but he kneels and moves the leaves out of the way. In the morning, an excavator scoops up some dirt and places it in the screen.)

EXCAVATOR: Here, try the screen.

(The second excavator shuffles the dirt around. Mulder walks quickly over towards them.)

MULDER: Concentrate on this area, over here. Right there.

(He points to the spot.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He turns to see Scully walking towards him.)

What's going on?

(Mulder walks over to her.)

MULDER: I'm not sure I can explain, Scully.

SCULLY: You called for a forensic excavation at five A.M. on a Sunday? What are you looking for?

MULDER: Just give me a minute, Scully, okay?

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing out here?

MULDER: I keep having this dream. It's about a little blond girl.

SCULLY: You're saying that you're out here because of something you saw in a dream?

(He nods slightly, knowing it sounds ridiculous.)

EXCAVATOR: Sir!

(They run over to the excavator and kneel down. They have uncovered a skull.)



SCENE 2
BOSHER'S RUN PARK; MANASSAS, VIRGINIA

(The excavator is unearthing the skeleton, scooping out the dirt around it. A grid has been placed over it to separate areas. Mulder and Scully watch.)

EXCAVATOR: Carefully remove the dirt around it...

SCULLY: So, tell me about this dream.

MULDER: I've had... flashes of it, three nights in a row. And last night, it went on long enough to lead me right to her.

(He walks towards the two excavators.)

I need the chest exposed.

EXCAVATOR: Yes, sir. It just takes a little time.

(Mulder picks up some rubber gloves and kneels down wear the second excavator was, who got up and walked away.)

Sir, let us do that... sir...

(Mulder starts to scoop away the dirt with his hands.)

SCULLY: Mulder, if you destroy evidence, we may never find out what happened here.

MULDER: I know what happened here. She was strangled. He used an eight-gauge electrical cord. He took something from the body post-mortem... a trophy. A piece of fabric cut from her clothes... in the shape of a heart.

SCULLY: You're saying you got all these details from your dream?

MULDER: No. I know this M.O. I know it from memory.

SCULLY: Whose M.O.?

MULDER: John Lee Roche. He killed thirteen eight-to-ten year-old girls.

(He exposes the chest partly, revealing a set of ribs, over which is a nightgown with a cloth heart cut out.)

This makes fourteen.

(Scully looks down at it.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder opens the file cabinet and begins digging through the folders.)

MULDER: It was a difficult case, he was extremely hard to catch.

(He pulls out a folder marked "Roche, John L" and hands it to Scully, who is sitting.)

By 1990, ten victims had been found scattered across the eastern seaboard. The earliest dated back to 1979.

(He sits.)

V.I.C.A.P. named the case "paper hearts" because of the trophies the killer took.

(Scully looks at pictures of young girls in the folder, the victims.)

All the victims were abducted from their homes. Reggie Purdue brought me onto the case because he thought I could get inside the killer's head.

SCULLY: Did you?

MULDER: I concluded that, that we were probably looking for a salesman. Someone who, who traveled around a lot, someone who could gain people's confidence, someone ordinary.

(Scully looks at the mugshots of Roche.)

Turns out Roche was a vacuum cleaner salesman. His job took him all over the northeast. He'd be in someone's home, demonstrating his vacuum cleaner. All the while, he'd be checking out their kids. He'd choose a victim then come back for her months later.

SCULLY: But it was your profile that caught him.

(Mulder shrugs slightly, agreeing.)

What about the, uh, the trophies he took, the cloth hearts?

MULDER: We never found them, but we didn't need them to make the case. We had him cold on thirteen counts of murder. He admitted to thirteen. Polygraph said he was telling the truth. But that always bugged me about this case. I always wanted to find those hearts and count them, see if they really added up to thirteen. I guess they didn't.

SCULLY: Well, if nothing else... I think I can at least help explain your dream.

(She closes the folder.)

I don't think you ever stopped thinking about this case. I believe that you may have solved it in your sleep.

MULDER: So you think that I've somehow had this information about a fourteenth victim all the time and I've been processing it unconsciously?

SCULLY: You said it yourself once. You said that a... a dream is an answer to a question we haven't learned how to ask. You did good work, Mulder. Let's identify this girl so we can put her to rest.



SCENE 4
AUTOPSY LAB

(Mulder sits, looking at the skeleton of the girl. Her ribs have been pulled open, and the cloth is sitting on the table. There is a small pocket with a dollar sign stitched in. The door opens and Scully walks in with a folder.)

SCULLY: I believe her name is Addie Sparks. She went missing from her home in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, in June of 1975. I contacted the Center For Missing and Exploited Children, ran a search through the database.

(Mulder nods.)

MULDER: 1975 is too early.

SCULLY: The match is right, Mulder. The, the, the height is right, the description of the sleeper is right.

MULDER: That would mean Roche started way before we thought he did.

SCULLY: Mulder, we're going to have to verify this. Are you up for that?

(Mulder nods.)



SCENE 5
NORRISTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA

(Mulder and Scully pull up to the house of Frank Sparks. Children are playing nearby. Mulder uses the knocker and Sparks opens the door.)

SCULLY: Frank Sparks?

FRANK SPARKS: Can I help you?

(Scully shows him her badge.)

SCULLY: Yes, I'm Agent Scully, this is Agent Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. May we speak with you?

FRANK SPARKS: You found Addie?

(Inside, they are all sitting. Sparks pulls the cloth heart out of a bag and looks at the small pocket with a dollar sign stitched in. His voice is hoarse with sorrow.)

This was for the tooth fairy. When Addie was asleep at night, I'd... I'd come and put a quarter in this pocket. Her mother sewed it.

SCULLY: Where is your wife, sir?

FRANK SPARKS: She passed away last summer.

(He stares off, trying to contain his sadness.)

So, you, you, uh... you're saying the, uh... the man that did this is already in prison.

MULDER: Yes, sir, and he won't get out.

FRANK SPARKS: You do this full-time, telling people... this kind of news?

SCULLY: No, sir, not full-time.

MULDER: It's not a good job.

FRANK SPARKS: No. I used to think... that missing was worse than dead because...

(He clears his throat.)

You never knew what happened.

(Mulder stares at him, understanding.)

Now that I know... I'm glad my wife's not here. She got luckier.

(Mulder looks over to a picture of a little girl on the mantel.)

How many more people, uh... like me are you going to visit today?

MULDER: Sir?

FRANK SPARKS: Were there other victims... you didn't know about?

(Scully looks at Mulder, unsure. Afterwards, Sparks closes the door as they start back to their car. Mulder's eyes flash to the white car with the red dot on it that he saw in his dream.)

MULDER: Roche's car... Roche drove a white El Camino, Scully. I saw it in my dream.

(He runs to his car.)

SCULLY: What are you saying that means?

MULDER: The cloth hearts he collected, he would have wanted to keep them close to him. For a traveling salesman, that means inside the car, right?

(He pulls out a folder and starts to look through it.)

SCULLY: Maybe... you're saying the hearts might still be in his car?

MULDER: Well, he doesn't have them in prison, the cell is searched regularly, his mail is examined. His car was sold at auction in 1992, put beyond his reach. It's worth a look, Scully. We've got to find those hearts in order to count them.

SCULLY: Don't you think the car might have been searched at least once already?

MULDER: Not by me.



SCENE 6
HOLLYVILLE, DELAWARE

(The garage door slides up and a man shows the car to Mulder and Scully. It's a nice white car, with flames painted on the sides.)

MAN: Here it is. I've been, you know, detailing it. Dropped the bed shell and did the decals, stuff like that.

SCULLY: Thank you.

MAN: Honest-to-God, serial killer owned my car? For real?

(Mulder gets in the front seat. He checks the visors as Scully gets in the passenger side. They search the glove compartment and under the seats, but to no avail. Mulder pulls out a pocket knife and starts ripping up the upholstery. Scully looks at him.)

MULDER: Helping him detail.

(Scully shrugs slightly and reaches around on the floor of the back seat. She pads the ceiling for a bump, but finds nothing, as does Mulder.)

Something's wrong here, Scully.

SCULLY: Maybe it's underneath.

(She gets out of the car. He slides the visor over then realizes something. His memory flashes the dream part where the red dot turned to "Mad Hat.")

MULDER: "Mad Hat..."

(He goes over the words in his head.)

Hey, Scully. The camper shell.

(He gets out.)

The kid said he took the camper shell off.

(They walk outside and through a path in the woods to the side of the house. Mulder pulls out the camper shell, which has been covered in a plastic sheet. He steps on the underside, searching for a bump. He kneels down and pads around, then rips off the cloth on the side. He pulls out a copy of the book "Alice in Wonderland" and stands.)

"Mad Hat." Mad Hatter.

(He starts to flip through as Scully looks. They find the first heart. He continues flipping, then starts counting out loud after a while.)

MULDER: Eight... nine, ten... eleven, twelve... thirteen, fourteen...

(Scully stops and looks at it.)

SCULLY: Addie Sparks.

(Mulder continues flipping.)

Fifteen... sixteen.

(Mulder finishes flipping through.)

MULDER: He had two more victims.

(We hear a sound of a buzzing over the scene.)



SCENE 7
LORTON REFORMATORY; LORTON, VIRGINIA

(A guard leads Mulder and Scully towards a cell. Mulder and Scully place their guns in a drawer, then Mulder takes off his ankle gun and places it in as well. The drawer shuts and their is another buzz. The gate next to them slides open and they walk through. A basketball can be heard. Mulder opens the door at the end of the hallway and the two walk towards John Lee Roche, who is playing basketball. He looks at them.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Mulder. Long time, no see. You got a new partner.

(He lightly tosses the basketball through the hoop.)

MULDER: Agent Scully.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: So what's up?

MULDER: We found Addie Sparks, John.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Congratulations, I guess.

(He takes a soft hook shot.)

SCULLY: We also found your cloth hearts. All sixteen of them.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Huh.

MULDER: Sixteen victims, John. How come you only said there were only thirteen?

(Roche sinks another shot.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I don't know. Thirteen sounds more magical, you know?

MULDER: Why don't you tell us about your last two victims, then?

SCULLY: You're in here for life, you've got nothing to lose.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I got nothing to gain.

MULDER: You can gain one moment of decency in your life. You can finally let those families put their daughters to rest.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I understand you take this very personally, Mulder.

(The next shot bounces off the rim.)

How about this?

(He twirls the basketball on his finger.)

Sink one from there and I'll tell you.

(He tosses it to Mulder, who is standing at the foul line. Mulder sinks it and smirks.)

You'd trust a child molester?

(Roche walks past them.)

You bring my hearts and give them back to me... I'll tell you everything you want to know.

(He looks to the guard.)

Let me out.

(There is a buzz and he walks out.)



SCENE 8
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The thirteen hearts that had been named are now all lined up in bags, with nametags on them. Mulder looks at the two left and takes off his glasses. He puts his head down on the desk, rubbing his eyes, then looks up and sees the red dot on the wall. He watches as it moves down the wall and under the door. Walking to do the door, he can barely hear a television talking. To his surprise, it is the house. Samantha sitting in front of the television, a Stratego board game set up, Mulder loses his breath in shock.)

MAN: ...she had erased a conversation between President Nixon and H.R. Haldeman while transcribing the subpoenaed tape. Woods testified that she had erased only about five minutes of the conversation but the tape contained an eighteen-minute gap.

SAMANTHA MULDER: Fox, it's your move.

MAN ON TV #1: Under investigation from Senator Howard Baker, H.R. Haldeman reiterated the White House explanation that Rosemary Woods mistakenly erased...

(Mulder walks around to the other side of the board game.)

MULDER: Samantha...

SAMANTHA MULDER: Are you going to move or not?

(He kneels down, staring at his sister.)

MAN ON TV #1: ...foot on the footpedal...

SAMANTHA MULDER: Do we have to watch this, Fox?

MAN ON TV #1: ...and then accidentally hitting the record button.

(Leon Jaworski, the Special Watergate Prosecutor, comes on screen.)

LEON JAWORSKI ON TV: It must be very difficult to reach a conclusion. It was an accident.

(Realizing the situation, he recalls the basic idea of his past sentences and states them.)

MULDER: "The Magician" comes on at nine.

SAMANTHA MULDER: Mom and Dad said I could watch the movie, buttmunch.

MULDER: They're next door at the Galbrands'. They left me in charge.

(There is a clattering and the lights shut off.)

No.

(The room starts to shake, the picture vibrating against the wall. Samantha stands as the Stratego pieces start to shuffle across the board. Mulder stands, remembering every detail, as the pictures fall and knickknacks topple over on the mantel.)

Not again.

(There is a sound of an engine revving and a bright light shines through the windows. A weird humming starts as Mulder and Samantha avert their eyes from the light. The doorknob turns. Mulder reaches for his gun, but it is not on him.)

Samantha, run!

(He runs over to the cabinet and throws a case down on the floor, which breaks open. He picks up the gun and looks over to see not aliens standing in the doorway, but Roche, illuminated by the headlights of his car. Mulder stares at him, kneeling. Roche walks over and stands over him, smiling, before walking away.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Fox! Fox!

(Mulder wakes up with a start.)

MULDER: Samantha!

(He stares at the two cloth hearts.)



SCENE 9
LORTON REFORMATORY; LORTON, VIRGINIA

(Mulder is seated at a table. There is a window in back of him. A buzzing sounds and Mulder stands. Roche walks in and sits across from him. They sit in silence.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Did you bring me my hearts?

MULDER: Yesterday, you said something about me taking it personally. Why did you say that to me?

(Roche smirks.)

Where were you in 1973?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: What, the whole year?

MULDER: November. Twenty-seventh of November. Do you know what I'm getting at?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I was selling vacuum cleaners in 1973. I made a sales trip to Martha's Vineyard that year and... I sold a vacuum cleaner to your dad. He bought it for your mom. I believe it was a, um... Electrovac Duchess or the Princess model and... your dad and I talked about it at great length. He... he had a really hard time choosing.

MULDER: What do you know about my sister?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You bring me my hearts... and maybe I'll tell you more.

(Anger strong in Mulder's eyes, he throws a hard right, which soundly connects with Roche's jaw. Roche flies off the chair and lands on the floor. He stands slowly as Mulder holds his fist. The guard walks in.)

This man... this man hit me.

(The guard looks at Mulder.)

GUARD: I didn't see it.

(He walks over to the door and bangs on it while Scully walks in from the other door. The door opens and the guard and Roche walk out.)

SCULLY: I did.

(Mulder shakes the feeling back into his hand. Another buzz and they walk out, Mulder putting his coat on.)

MULDER: He was there, Scully. He was in the house. He took Samantha.

SCULLY: In your dream, Mulder. It was a dream. Your mind made it up.

MULDER: A dream is an answer to a question we haven't yet figured out how to ask, right? Something buried in your subconsciousness. You heard him in there, he knew something. He mentioned being on Martha's Vineyard.

SCULLY: Is it a state secret you lived in Martha's Vineyard?

MULDER: Well, how would he find out about that?

SCULLY: Through the prison library. The inmates have access to computers and the internet. I checked. Roche logged on just yesterday.

(They stop walking.)

MULDER: Looking for what?

SCULLY: The server records don't show, but on the Net, Mulder, he can find out practically anything about you. Look, he is playing with you, Mulder. He is committing emotional blackmail and you are letting him. You walked into that room with your heart on your sleeve. He saw vulnerability, and he took advantage of it. You had a dream... a nightmare... and you, and you had it because of all the emotions that this case is stirring up for you. But... it was nothing but a dream.

MULDER: My last dream came true. Scully, do you believe that my sister Samantha was abducted by aliens?

(Scully looks away.)

Have you ever believed that? No. So what do you think happened to her?

SCULLY: What are you saying you believe now?

MULDER: I don't know. I don't know what happened. I don't know what to believe. I just know that I have to find out now.

(He walks past her.)



SCENE 10
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT

(Mulder uncovers a desk and looks through a drawer.)

MRS. MULDER: Fox?

MULDER: Mom, I'm in the basement.

(Mulder walks over to the stairs in the basement where is mother is walking down, still recuperating.)

I'm sorry, how are you feeling?

MRS. MULDER: Good, Fox, I'm fine. Honey, what are you doing down here in the middle of the night?

(Mulder takes out the cloth hearts.)

MULDER: Do you recognize... these fabrics? Either one of them?

MRS. MULDER: What am I looking at?

MULDER: Just look closely. Do... do they seem familiar to you?

MRS. MULDER: Familiar how?

MULDER: Just familiar. Have you seen them before?

MRS. MULDER: Fox, I don't know what you want me to say. You know my memory isn't as good as it used to be, ever since I had the stroke, I just don't know...

(They hug.)

MULDER: It's all right.

MRS. MULDER: Oh, Fox...

MULDER: Dad never bought you a vacuum cleaner, did he?

MRS. MULDER: Yeah. A long time ago.

(They pull out of the hug. Mulder seems shocked.)

I don't use it anymore.

MULDER: Where is it?

MRS. MULDER: Well, it's here, under the stairs, in the storage.

(He heads under the stairs.)

Fox, what is going on?

(He pulls open the door to the storage and turns on the light. Pulling other things away, he pulls out an old circular vacuum cleaner. An Electrovac Princess. Mulder slams it down into it's box.)



SCENE 11
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is sitting at his desk. Mulder and Scully walk in.)

MULDER: Sir? I've been denied further access to John Lee Roche. I've been told that order comes down from you.

SKINNER: Could you tell me why you saw fit to strike a prisoner in federal custody?

(Mulder looks back at Scully.)

Agent Scully didn't report that to me, Mulder, though she should have. The whole thing was videotaped as per prison policy. I saw it. You're lucky I don't have your ass in a sling!

MULDER: Sir...

SKINNER: You gotten too close to this, Mulder. You've let this man get to you.

MULDER: I have reason to believe he can tell us what happened to my sister Samantha.

SCULLY: It is looking possible, sir. John Lee Roche apparently spent most of 1973 in Boston. He did take one sales trip up to Martha's Vineyard in October of that year. The timing is right.

MULDER: I need to know. I just need to speak with him one more time, sir.

SKINNER: It just makes it even less of a good idea, Mulder.

SCULLY: Sir, the fact remains that we still have two more victims that we need to find and identify, and no one has more insight into Roche than Agent Mulder and this is still Agent Mulder's case.

(Skinner sighs.)

SKINNER: You tread very lightly.

(Mulder nods. Skinner looks to Scully.)

You see that he does.

(Scully looks away, and she and Mulder walk out.)



SCENE 12
LORTON REFORMATORY; LORTON, VIRGINIA

(Roche pulls up a seat and stares angrily at Mulder, who is seated across from him.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I'm not talking to you if you're going to hit me again.

(Scully looks at Mulder as well, who pulls out the two remaining cloth hearts and puts them down in front of Roche. Roche pulls open the bag and is about to pull out the heart when Mulder grabs his hand.)

MULDER: No. You don't get to touch them. They stay in the bag. Name them.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I think you know one of them already.

(They stare at each other.)

SCULLY: Prove it.

(Roche smiles.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Watergate was on TV. You and your sister... were sitting in front of it... playing a board game with, uh, little red and, uh... blue plastic pieces. And you wanted to watch a TV show... the one, the one with Bill Bixby? What the heck was the name of that thing?

MULDER: How could you know what I said?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I was watching... from the window. I was, I was very careful.

MULDER: If that's true, tell me where my sister is.

(Roche looks down at the hearts.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Pick her out.

MULDER: What?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You choose the one that was your sister, and I'll tell you where she is. Hey, come on, it's a fifty-fifty chance.

(He positions the hearts next to each other.)

Either way, I'm giving you a victim.

(Mulder picks the one to his right.)

That one? You're sure you want that one?

(Mulder looks a bit confused, thinking he might have picked the wrong one. Scully continues to glare at Roche, who smiles slyly.)

No, just kidding, it's... it's a good choice. Okay, you want to write this down?



SCENE 13
FORKS OF CACAPON, WEST VIRGINIA

(Scully moves a small plant out of the way to reveal the words "Mad Hat" carved into a rock. Mulder falls to his knees and starts to dig at a spot in the dirt, much to the chagrin of Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder... let's get a team out here. Let somebody else do this.

MULDER: Help me, Scully.

(Scully, knowing how obstinate Mulder is, starts to dig as well. They keep digging until they see something in the dirt. Mulder brushes off a set of ribs covered with cloth that has a paper heart cut out. Scully sighs and looks back at Mulder, who stares at the heart.)



SCENE 14
AUTOPSY LAB

(Mulder stands at the far end of the room, looking at the body, which is covered. He walks over to it and opens a folder, then looks at an x-ray. He looks down at the body for a long time, then pulls off the cover and stares at it. He looks over at it's shoulder as Scully looks in.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: It's not her, Scully. Am I right? Samantha broke her collarbone when she was six.

(Scully walks over.)

It was her left collarbone. We had, we had a rope swing out in the backyard. It's not broken, is it?

SCULLY: You're right, Mulder, it's not a match.

(Mulder sighs in relief.)

It's not her.

MULDER: It's somebody, though.

(Roche's voice starts over the scene.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You know, like I said...



SCENE 15
LORTON REFORMATORY; LORTON, VIRGINIA

(Mulder and Scully are interrogating Roche again. A guard is in the back room.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: It was a fifty-fifty chance.

SCULLY: Tell us the name of that girl.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: It was Karen Ann Philiponte.

(Scully takes notes. Mulder just glares at him.)

She lived in a green rancher in... East Amherst, New York. Mint grew outside her window. I stood outside her window atop sprigs of mint. It smelled wonderful.

(Scully is agitated by Roche's lawlessness. She spits out her words.)

SCULLY: What year?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: July... 1974. I had her mother on the hook for an Electrovac Argosy, but at the last minute, she said "thanks but no thanks."

(Scully looks up at him, no flicker of emotion.)

Oh, well.

(They sit in silence for a few seconds, the agents glaring at him. Mulder pulls out the last paper heart. He slides it across and Roche picks it up, studies it, and slides it back.)

It's your sister.

MULDER: If that's true, tell me where.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You want to know a lot more than that, don't you? You want to know everything, right? The big mystery revealed.

SCULLY: Drop the mind games.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I can't just tell you. I know you don't believe me. You need me to show you, you need me to lead you through because... after all these years, anything less than that's not going to satisfy you, right?

MULDER: You just want to get out of here.

(He stands and walks to the back.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You're damn right I do... if only for a day or two. I'm realistic. And more than that, I... I can't wait to see your face.

SCULLY: Oh, God...

(She stands.)

You're going to see the inside of your cell instead. You're going to rot there.

(She looks at Mulder and walks to the door. He picks up the heart and follows. He looks through the window at Roche, Scully looking at Mulder.)

Are you okay? Mulder, the last thing you should do is give this man his way on this. If you do, he could string us along forever. I know you appreciate that. There has to be another way to come to the truth.

(Mulder nods slightly. Roche looks at them in the window and walks out, the door buzzing. Scully sighs.)



SCENE
MULDER'S APARTMENT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder lays on his bed, thinking, staring at the ceiling. After a while, he sits up, picks up the phone, and dials.)

WOMAN: Clerk's office.

MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the F.B.I.



SCENE 16
SEABOARD AIR FLIGHT #1650; WASHINGTON TO BOSTON

(A stewardess opens coke cans as the drink tray is going by. Mulder continues to talk on the phone over the scene.)

Badge number J-T-T-o-four-seven-one-o-one-one-one-one. I need a removal order for a federal prisoner.

(Roche looks back at the stewardess, handcuffed.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Can I use the lavatory?

MULDER: Keep your hands in your lap.

(He covers the handcuffs with the jacket. They get up and start towards the back of the plane, but Roche manages to get by the drink cart while Mulder is stopped by them.)

STEWARDESS: Need a drink?

MULDER: Excuse me.

(Roche looks at a young mother and her daughter, who is looking out the window.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: First flight?

MULDER: Excuse me, I have to get by.

YOUNG MOTHER: Yeah.

STEWARDESS: Could you just wait one second, please?

(Roche kneels, eyeing the little girl.)

MULDER: Now!

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You having fun?

CAITLIN ROSS: Mmm-hmmm.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: What's your name?

CAITLIN ROSS: Caitlin.

(Mulder gets by the stewardesses as Roche stands. Mulder nods to the young woman as they walk by. Skinner can be heard over the scene.)

SKINNER: What the hell do you mean...



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner is conferring with Scully.)

SKINNER: He checked out Roche?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder convinced the judge that it was an emergency situation.

SKINNER: And where were you while this was happening?

SCULLY: I had left Agent Mulder for the day. I suggested that he get some sleep. Sir, I have a clear idea of where he might have gone and I am sure that I can catch up with him.

SKINNER: I'll be the one to catch up with him. Where's he headed?

(He stands and puts on his coat.)

SCULLY: Martha's Vineyard. And I would hope that you'd appreciate the uniqueness of this situation and it's effect on Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: No, I fully understand the effect it has on him, Agent Scully. As I recall, that was the sum and total of my last words to you on the subject. You let me down. Let's clean up this mess before it gets completely out of hand.

(He starts out.)



SCENE 18
MARTHA'S VINEYARD, MASSACHUSETTS

(Mulder flicks on the light switch as he opens the door, Roche following him inside. They walk into the hallway, then Roche peeks into the main room.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: No one home?

(Mulder remains stoic. Roche smiles and sits on the plastic-covered couch.)

I sat on this couch... when your dad bought the vacuum. You're ready?

MULDER: Go.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: November twenty-seventh, 1973. I watched the house for hours. I parked across the way, out over there. I was just casing, I wasn't planning for this to be the night. But then, all of a sudden, your parents leave and I figure...

MULDER: Where'd they go?

(Roche stands and goes to the window.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: House next door. To play pinochle, I don't know... whatever it was people did back then.

MULDER: Go on.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: So after they're gone, I get out of my car and I move closer.

(He kneels down in front of the television.)

And I watched you and your sister playing that board game.

(He stands.)

A little bit after eight, I'm about ready so I move to the junction box.

(He starts to walk around.)

I cut the power, and the lights go off, and then I moved around the front door. And I was ready to kick the door in... it was unlocked. It was 1973. It was... a different world back then.

MULDER: And then what did you do?

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Well, you remember that. I... came in the front door. And you tried to get to your father's gun, I g, I give you credit for that. But then you sort of froze, and then... I took your sister away from all this. To a happier place.

(Mulder walks over to him.)

MULDER: That's exactly how it happened? Right here in this room?

(Roche looks a little unsure, confused.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Yeah.

MULDER: Wrong house.

(Roche is shocked.)

My father bought this house after he and my mother divorced. This house is in West Tisbury. The house that Samantha was abducted from is in Chilmark. That's six miles from here!

(Roche looks away.)

You screwed up. You were never here. You didn't take Samantha.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Wishful thinking.

MULDER: No. No, but I think I know what happened. Somehow you got inside my dreams.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Come again?

MULDER: I profiled you. I got inside your head, maybe you got inside mine. Maybe some nexus or connection was formed between us and through that, you got access to my memories of my sister Samantha and you used them against me for this.

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You're just resisting me.

MULDER: And you're in the wrong house, you stupid son of a bitch! You were never here, you liar!

JOHN LEE ROCHE: It's geography, man. It's just geography. It was twenty-three years ago, that was geography we're talking about.

MULDER: Yeah, but you remember all the other details so vividly. That's because you watched it through my eyes... through my dreams.

(Roche sits in the chair, laughing.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I hear things about you, Mulder. You know what I heard? I heard you go after aliens... from space. It's like your world will be okay as long as you can believe in, like, flying saucers.

(He makes a twirling motion with his finger and a corny sci-fi noise.)

But I'm telling you the God's honest truth. I can see you're not as open-minded as you think you are.

MULDER: You must have been one hell of a salesman, Roche. First flight's at six A.M. Why don't you enjoy your last few hours of freedom? Come on.

(Roche stands and they walk out.)



SCENE 19
HOTEL

(Mulder sits at the table, studying the paper heart. Roche is asleep on the couch. He hears something outside.)

SAMANTHA MULDER: Fox!

(He stands.)

Fox, help! Unlock me! Help! Help me!

(He goes over to the window and sees the white car outside. He gasps. Samantha pounds on the car window.)

Fox, help me! Help me!

(Mulder looks over at Roche, then dashes out as the engine revs.)

Unlock me! Fox!

(Mulder tries the door handle, but it is locked.)

Fox, help me! Unlock me! Fox!

(He opens the door and pulls her out. He hugs Samantha tightly, then pulls her away to look at her. Smile wide, he hugs her tight again and notices something on the floor. The red dot. It forms "bye." Mulder hears the car's engine rev and turns, holding nothing, to see is gone. He wakes up, hearing a pounding on the door. His hands are beneath the table, and he throws it over as he stands, finding he is handcuffed. Roche is gone.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

SKINNER: Mulder, open the door!

(Mulder looks around. Afterwards, in the morning, Mulder is talking to Scully and Skinner.)

MULDER: He must have done it in my sleep, I had another dream.

(Skinner sighs.)

SKINNER: Why don't you check to see if anybody saw him leave?

(Skinner motions to two men, who walk out.)

MULDER: He took the last cloth heart.

SCULLY: He also took your badge and your phone.

SKINNER: Where's your gun?

(Mulder stares at him blankly.)

How do you explain yourself, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I don't.

SKINNER: You don't. A predator is loose because of you. God only knows how many hours lead he's got. Any idea where he might be headed?

(Mulder thinks for a second.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: Where's your phone?

(Skinner sighs and hands him his phone. Mulder sits.)

There was a small child on the plane.

SCULLY: What child?

(Mulder dials the number.)

WOMAN ON PHONE: Seaboard Air...

MULDER: Yeah, please put me through to your supervisor.

SCULLY: Mulder, what child?

MULDER: This is Fox Mulder of the F.B.I. I'd like a passenger manifest for flight sixteen-fifty from Washington National to Boston, 8:50 P.M. last night. My badge number is J-T-T...

(The woman talks illegibly. Mulder hangs up.)

An Agent Mulder just called ten minutes ago. They gave him the same information.

(They start off.)



SCENE 20
NEW FRIENDS DAY CARE; SWAMPSCOTT, MASSACHUSETTS

(The agents pulls up to the scene to find the person in charge talking to police.)

WOMAN: He said he was from the F.B.I. He said her mother was in an accident. He needed to take Caitlin...

(She sobs. The agents get out of the car.)

LOCAL COP: You said he was a, a white male?

WOMAN: Yeah.

LOCAL COP: About how tall was he?

WOMAN: Um, he was about six foot five or something.

(Mulder, Skinner and Scully walk over to her.)

He said his name was Mulder. He had a badge. He said he was official. Oh my God, what have I done?

(The local cop looks over to Skinner.)

LOCAL COP: We sent a unit over to pick up the girl's mother. She's on her way down.

SKINNER: Okay.

WOMAN: Wh, what am I going to tell her? It's all my fault.

MULDER: It's not your fault. It's my fault.

(He walks back towards his car, Scully following.)

Sorry, Scully, you were right. He was playing me the whole time.

SCULLY: You don't think he took Samantha?

MULDER: None of that really matters now, does it?

(They stop at the car.)

SCULLY: Well, where do you think he'd take this girl? Would he follow his M.O. and drive her out of state?

MULDER: There's no reason for that, he knows we're going to catch him. He just needs it be sooner than later. He's going to stay in the Boston area. It'll be somewhere nearby.

SCULLY: Well, how much of a creature of habit is he? Do you think he'd want to take her someplace familiar?

MULDER: Try to relive some past glory? Is that what you're thinking? I don't know, what?

SCULLY: Well, he lived in Boston in the early '70s, right?

(She reaches through the open window and takes a folder off the dashboard. Skinner walks over.)

SKINNER: What do you got?

SCULLY: Roche's old address in the area. Revere. Nine-eight-o-nine Alice Road, apartment number six...

MULDER: He's there.

SKINNER: How do you know?

MULDER: Alice, "Alice in Wonderland," he's the Mad Hatter.

SKINNER: Mulder, that's, that's...

MULDER: That's where he got the idea in the first place.

(He gets in the driver's seat.)

SKINNER: All right, let's go!

(He whistles and the agents and officials start piling into their cars.)

<-9809 ALICE ROAD->

(Mulder is the first to enter, busting down the door. The apartment is empty and abandoned.)

SKINNER: Check the other rooms!

(The agents go ahead.)

SCULLY: I don't think he brought her here.

(Mulder looks out the window and sees a bus terminal with hundreds of buses across the way.)

MULDER: He never brought anyone here.

(He runs out. Skinner puts away his gun as they follow. Mulder walks across the field and starts to climb the metal barrier.)

SKINNER: Plug the entrance!

(He looks out at the hundreds of abandoned buses and climbs down. He pulls out his gun on his ankle and hears a girl scream. Running in that direction, he looks around and, as if led by some unknown force, starts to walk slowly past buses. He finds the bus he thinks is the one and slowly approaches the doors. Pulling it open, he pops out of the entrance, gun raised, and sees Roche sitting at the back, Caitlin in the seat in front of him. He lowers his gun and slowly starts towards them.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I'm beginning to believe we do share that... nexus you spoke of. You always seem to find me.

MULDER: Are you okay, Caitlin?

(Caitlin nods.)

Good. My name is Fox, I'm going to take you home.

(She nods again.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I have your gun, Fox.

MULDER: Caitlin, can you do me a favor? Can you count to twenty? Can you do that? Will you close your eyes and count to twenty out loud, quietly and slowly?

(She nods and closes her eyes.)

CAITLIN ROSS/MULDER: One, two...

(Mulder cocks his gun and puts it directly in Roche's face.)

CAITLIN ROSS: Three...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I will shoot.

CAITLIN ROSS: Four...

MULDER: Don't make this end badly.

CAITLIN ROSS: Five...

(Mulder looks down to see Roche pointing Mulder's gun at the seat in front of him, a path that would go right through Caitlin.)

Six... seven...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You're not giving me very much choice.

CAITLIN ROSS: Eight...

(Skinner and Scully appear in the entrance, guns pointed at Roche.)

Nine...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: I really don't want to go back to prison.

SKINNER: Put the gun down, Roche!

CAITLIN ROSS: Ten... eleven... twelve...

(Roche pulls out the last paper heart, still in the bag.)

JOHN LEE ROCHE: You have one left.

CAITLIN ROSS: Thirteen...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: How are you going to find her without me?

CAITLIN ROSS: Fourteen... fifteen...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: How sure are you it's not Samantha?

CAITLIN ROSS: Sixteen...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: Huh?

CAITLIN ROSS: Seventeen...

JOHN LEE ROCHE: How do you know?

CAITLIN ROSS: Eighteen... nineteen...

(Mulder blows Roche's brains out, leaving blood all over the window behind his head. Caitlin screams and runs towards Scully.)

SCULLY: Come here.

(Roche slumps down.)

SKINNER: Get her out of here. Call an ambulance!

(Caitlin sobs. Mulder keeps his gun trained on Roche, then slowly lowers it, breathing raggedly.)



SCENE 21
FBI HEADQUARTERS; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder sits at his desk, staring at it. Scully knocks and walks in. They stare at each other in silence for a few seconds before Scully puts down a stack of papers on Mulder's desk.)

SCULLY: I got back some lab results. The dye analysis determined that the fabric of the last heart was manufactured between 1969 and 1974... but beyond that, there's nothing more they can tell us. Mulder, it's not Samantha... and whoever that little girl really is, we'll find her.

MULDER: How?

SCULLY: I don't know... but I do know you.

(He looks up at her, then back down.)

Why don't you go on home and get some sleep?

(He laughs heartily. She does the same. They hug, Mulder's head against her bosom. She strokes his hair, then walks out. He continues to smile, then it fades. Mulder pulls open his desk drawer and cradles the last paper heart, before placing it in the desk drawer and closing it.)

SCENE 1

(Night. FLAKITAS shack. FLAKITA, a middle-aged migrant worker is telling a story to the other women of the camp. Lots of voices speaking Spanish.)

FLAKITA: Quiet! Quiet, listen to me. It was a terrible thing. Youre not going to believe me, even when I tell you. Some say it is a story, a fairy tale. But I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.

CUT TO:
SCENE 1
(FLAKITAS story. Day.)
MIGRANT WORKERS CAMP
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY, CA

(Children and chickens running around small collection of rundown shacks. Large open bed truck pulls into the camp. ANGLO MAN is in back. Men begin to follow truck.)

ANGLO MAN: Quiero hombres fuertes. Rapido. Lets go. Vamos.

(Men begin getting in the truck. A young man, ELADIO BUENTES watches. FLAKITA watches ELADIO watch. Another young man, SOLEDAD BUENTES kisses a pretty young woman, MARIA DORANTES on the cheek as she herds animals into a pen. SOLEDAD greets her in Spanish. They affectionately say something along the lines of "Take care, see you later," then SOLEDAD goes to the truck. We now see that it was MARIA that ELADIO was watching. ELADIO goes to MARIA.)

ELADIO: (in Spanish) I missed you last night, my love.

MARIA: (in Spanish, smiling) Im not your love

SOLEDAD: (to another man in truck bed) Gracias. (He turns and sees ELADIO laughing with MARIA. SOLEDAD is jealous.)

MARIA: (in Spanish) Your brother will see us. He says Im breaking his heart.

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Are you?

MARIA: No.

ELADIO: Si.

MARIA: No. (smiles)

(Truck drives away, SOLEDAD still jealously watching them from truck bed.
FLAKITA starts toward MARIA and ELADIO.)

MARIA: (in Spanish) No. Are you calling me a liar?

ELADIO: (flirting) Si.

FLAKITA: (in Spanish) Maria! What are you doing? The goats! The goats are escaping!

(MARIA runs after some escaped goats over a small hill. ELADIO gives FLAKITA a suspicious look, closes the gate, then follows MARIA. A VILLAGE WOMAN comes out of a shack to stand with FLAKITA.)

FLAKITA: (in Spanish) Two brothers. One woman. Trouble.

VILLAGE WOMAN: (something in Spanish)

FLAKITA: Mm hmm.

(LOUD explosion. FLAKITA screams. Bright flash of light then rain begins pouring down. FLAKITA steps inside doorway and watches. The ground and rain buckets show that the rain is yellow.)

FLAKITA: Look  the rain is strange.

(Rain stops abruptly. FLAKITA and VILLAGE WOMAN look at ground.)

FLAKITA: Look at the water - its yellow. (sees goats coming back over hill) Las cabras. Maria! Maria! (runs over the hill followed by the other women) Maria! Maria!

(FLAKITA finds MARIA lying dead beside a dead goat. Goat is covered in yellow fungus. MARIAS mouth, nose, and eyes are covered also with fungus. No ELADIO.)

FLAKITA: Madre de Dios.

SCENE 2

(MULDER and SCULLY investigating area where MARIAS body was found. Dead goat body still there, covered in flies. SCULLY holds cloth over her face as she examines it. MULDER is several paces away, his back to the goat. He is eating sunflower seeds.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this happened how long ago?

MULDER: Tres dias. Muy incredible, no?

SCULLY: Only the smell. Mulder, you brought me out here on the pretense of investigating an unexplained death. Can you tell me why were standing out here in the middle of a field looking at a dead goat?

MULDER: Well, according to eyewitnesses, the death were investigating was preceded by a Fortean event. Thats a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon also known as a transient.

SCULLY: A transient.

MULDER: Yeah. Witnesses described a bright flash about 30 degrees off the horizon, then a hot yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky. Fortean researchers call these "liquid falls." Black and red rains are the most common, but there have also been reported cases of blue, purple and green rains.

SCULLY: Purple rain?

MULDER: Yeah. Great album. Deeply flawed movie, though.

(They begin walking toward the camp.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this "transient," as you call it, this bright flash in the sky - I assume you think it has some connection to -

MULDER: Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters, cattle mutilations, the kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you were just looking at.

SCULLY: And the victim, Maria Dorantes, did she die in a similar fashion?

MULDER: I would assume so.

SCULLY: You assume? Nobodys examined the body?

MULDER: Nobody cares, Scully. The victim and many of the witnesses are illegal immigrants. Migrant farm workers.

MULDER: I thought it might be important to talk to them. Before they migrated.

(They walk into camp. SCULLY opens one of the shacks doors. All the residents run, fearing that MULDER and SCULLY are the Immigration Police.)

FLAKITA: La Migra! La Migra!

MULDER: No La Migra! No La Migra!

(Pandemonium, people running. Mulder and Scully try to convince them they are not Immigration.)

SCULLY: No La Migra, no La Migra.

MULDER: No La Migra.

SCULLY: (showing badge) La FBI, no La Migra. (MULDER pushes her hand down to hide her badge.)

MULDER: Its all right. We dont want to take anybody away. Relax. No, its okay. Tranquile.

FLAKITA: What do you want?

MULDER: We want to know what happened to Maria Dorantes. (FLAKITA does not answer.) Does anybody know what happened to Maria Dorantes? Did anybody see anything?

FLAKITA: El Chupacabra. Thats what happened to Maria Dorantes.

SCULLY: El Chupacabra?

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Yeah, its a Mexican folktale. El Chupacabra, the goatsucker. Its a small gray creature with a big head and a small body and big black bulging eyes.

FLAKITA: Si! Si! Si. Light. Then rain. Then La Chupacabra. He comes and eats away Marias eyes and face.

MULDER: (After a look to SCULLY) Did you see the Chupacabra?

FLAKITA: No. But everyone here knows that this is the truth.

(SCULLY looks skeptical.)

SOLEDAD: This womans a liar! There is no Chupacabra. The Chupacabra is nothing but a story told to children. I know the killer of Maria Dorantes.

SCULLY: Who would that be, sir?

SOLEDAD: Its my brother, Eladio Buente. He killed Maria because she loved only me.

MULDER: Uh, how do you explain the uh, the yellow rain and the dead goat over the hill?

SOLEDAD: Its a trick for fools who believe in fools superstitions.

SCULLY: (look to MULDER) Thank you, Mr. Buente. Youve been very helpful.

(MULDER and SCULLY walk away from the camp.)

SCULLY: (softly, only MULDER can hear) Maria ... Maria ... I just met a girl named Maria.

MULDER: I doesnt make a whole lot of sense, Scully.

SCULLY: It makes perfect sense, Mulder. Admit it. You fell for it. Your "Fortean Event" turned out to be nothing more than the oldest story in the world. Two men. One woman. Trouble.

MULDER: I admit, theres a strong suspicion of motive and intent - but the amount of detail, the description of that Chupacabra ...

SCULLY: Mulder, what weve walked into here is a Mexican soap opera, and one for the local cops.

MULDER: Local cops dont care, Scully. I dont know who does.

(They look back at squalid camp.)

SCULLY: Okay, I care, but what are we supposed to do about it?

MULDER: Find out what killed Maria Dorantes. Take a look at her body.

SCULLY: While you do what?

MULDER: Try to find this man, Eladio Buente.

(SCULLY sighs as MULDER leaves.)



SCENE 3
INS SERVICE PROCESSING CENTER
FRESNO, CA

MULDER: (entering LOZANOS office holding badge) Agent Lozano? Im Special Agent Mulder. Im with the FBI.

(LOZANO is American, but of Mexican descent.)

LOZANO: The FBI? Here?

MULDER: Were investigating the death of a migrant worker.

LAZANO: Really?

MULDER: Im looking for a man named Eladio Buente. He hasnt been seen for three days and hes not in police custody. I thought he might be in INS custody.

LOZANO: He might. (Offers seat to MULDER, takes down a file and opens it.) Lets see. Okay! We have a Jose Feliciano. We have Juan Valdez, we have Cesar Chavez, we have Placido Domingo here. (MULDER smiles.) But I dont see any Eladio Buente

MULDER: So you are telling me that no one here uses their real name.

LOZANO: What is this man wanted for?

MULDER: Possibly the murder of a woman named Maria Dorantes.

LOZANO: (disbelief and disgust) Oh, man. The Chupacabra?

MULDER: Yeah. Youve heard of it. You dont believe in it?

LOZANO: I believe these people. But their lives are small. So they have to make these fantasies just to keep on going - to feel alive. Because they are strangers here. They feel hated, unwanted. Whenever their passions become inflamed, they resort to violence. And then they cannot turn to the law, so they make up these fantastic tales. Call it anything you want, but this is an age old story.

MULDER: Ive heard that.

LAZANO: Well, lets see if we can find your Eladio Buente. (They get up.)



SCENE 4
FRESNO COUNTY MORGUE

(SCULLY enters. CORONER is working on a body.)

SCULLY: Excuse me? Excuse me?

CORONER: (not wanting to help) Can I help you?

SCULLY: Im Agent Dana Scully with the FBI. (shows badge) Im investigating the death of a migrant worker.

CORONER: Juan or Juanita?

SCULLY: Im sorry?

CORONER: Doe. A man or a woman?

SCULLY: Uh, a woman named Maria Dorantes. I need to determine a cause of death in order to close out an investigation.

CORONER: Oh, it sounds vaguely familiar, but I dont think Ive been able to get to her, yet.

SCULLY: Well, Im a medical doctor. If you show me the body I can examine it myself.

CORONER: Its in the fridge. (nods her head to the side)

SCULLY: (referring to the body being autopsied) I dont think hes going anywhere.

(CORONER looks up.)

CUT TO:
(SCULLY unzipping white body bag.)

CORONER: Thats her.

(SCULLY opens bag. Body is completely covered in fungus.)

CORONER: Oh, my God.

(SCULLY surprised.)



SCENE 5

(INS holding cells area. MULDER and LOZANO approach a cell.)

LOZANO This must be him.

(ELADIO sits in cell looking very lonely.)

MULDER: Why is he segregated like this?

LOZANO: (to a guard) Por que lo tiene segregado?

GUARD: Los otros detenidos lo molesteban mucho. Ninguno se la aserga a el. La tienen un miedo terrible.

LOZANO: (to Mulder) He said that the other detainees were giving him a hard time. Causing trouble. They dont want to go near him.

MULDER: They think hes the Chupacabra.

LOZANO: That may be, but I will tell you with a tremendous degree of certainty this guy is not Erik Estrada.

(MULDER SMILES. THEY LOOK AT HIS FOLDER: ERIK ESTRADA, HISP, M, 6-0, 190, CALIF, USA)

LOZANO: (knock on door) Buente!

(ELADIO stands.)

LOZANO: El fbi. Quieren hacerte unas pregunttas.

MULDER: Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes.

LOZANO: Quiere sabar si mataste a Maria Dorantes?

ELADIO: No! No lo hice! Soy innocente! (shouts) No soy asesino!!

MULDER: What did he say?

LOZANO: "I didnt do it."

MULDER: Ask him what happened.

LOZANO: Que fue lo que paso?

ELADIO: Huvo un ruido cumo un relampago muy cerca ...

LOZANO: "There was a noise like thunder, but very close .."

ELADIO: ...un rayo muy brilliante ..(continues in Spanish)

LOZANO: "...and then there was lightening, very bright. It blinded me. I fell to the ground, and then I felt the hot rain fall on me. And when I finally could open my eyes and see ..."

(ELADIO crying now, very passionately telling the story.)

LOZANO: (not passionately translating) "...I saw the dead goat. And then I saw Maria ... Maria. She called my name ... once. She was lying in a puddle of yellow rain. Something had eaten at her face. Then I held her in my arms. Then she died. And then I got up, and I ran, screaming.

ELADIO: (screams) Soy innocente!!!!

LOZANO: This guys *better* than Erik Estrada.

MULDER: Hmm.

(Later, detainees are being loaded onto bus. When they try to put ELADIO on all the others start yelling "Chupacabra," terrified. MULDER watches.)

MULDER: Whats going to happen to him?

LOZANO: Hell get his 45 seconds before the judge, and hell be placed on a south bound bus.

MULDER: There any way to delay that?

LOZANO: Why would you want to do that?

MULDER: Try to solve an unexplained death.

LOZANO: I would think the FBIs got better things to do. (MULDER has no answer.) File your paperwork. By the time they process it, hell probably be back here, anyway.

(MULDER watches the guards put ELADIO up front with the driver. SCULLY drives up and beeps the horn.)

SCULLY: Did you find Eladio Buente?

MULDER: Yeah, I found him.

SCULLY: Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes?

MULDER: Not exactly, no.



SCENE 6

(SCULLY and MULDER driving, short time later.)

SCULLY: Did he tell you what happened?

MULDER: Flash of light ... yellow rain .. Maria! (yells) Maria!!!

(SCULLY gives him the "Maybe you are really insane, Mulder" look. MULDER shrugs.)

SCULLY: He didnt kill her, Mulder. I examined the body of Maria Dorantes, and I believe that her cause of death was natural, albeit strange. She seems to have succumb to a massive fungal infection.

MULDER: A fungus?

SCULLY: Aspergillis, according to the coroner. Its a mold that's found in dead leaves, compost, even household dust.

MULDER: And it can kill?

SCULLY: Not normally. Its actually very common and quite harmless.

MULDER: You dont think thats weird.

SCULLY: Well, aspergillis can be lethal to people with immunodeficiencies like AIDS patients and ah, transplant recipients. And I found high levels of methyl bromide in her blood workup. Its a - a pesticide thats used for soil sterilization. Highly toxic. Now I think that her body was so ravaged by pesticides that a normally benign fungus may have compromised her whole immune system.

MULDER: It still doesnt explain the flash of light and the yellow rain. And El Chupacabra.

SCULLY: Mulder, I know you dont want to hear this, but I think the aliens in this story are not the villains. Theyre the victims.

(MULDER starts to say something, then nods at her. They see the bus that the detainees had been placed on. It has run off the road, and the detainees a running away across an open field.)

SCULLY: Look at that.

(They stop and go to investigate. MULDER watches the detainees leave.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(The driver is dead and covered in fungus.)



SCENE 7
CRIME SCENE

(INS bus is now a crime scene. Lots of officers around. Night. SCULLY, paper mask over her face, removes some of the fungus off the dead driver and places it in a specimen jar.)

MULDER: What does it look like?

SCULLY: It appears this man died of systemic shock. Brought on by what appears to be another massive fungal infection

MULDER: The same fungus that killed Maria Dorantes?

SCULLY: No. It looks dissimilar. I dont know what this is. But its speed and its aggressiveness are frightening. The infections covered 90 percent of his body, Mulder, through both layers of skin.

MULDER: (to LOZANO, who is looking at the driver) Did you find him?

LOZANO: We were able to round up most of the people who escaped from this vehicle but Eladio Buente wasnt among them.

SCULLY: No one knows where he ran?

(LOAZANO looks at MULDER.)

MULDER: Agent Lozano, this is my partner, Agent Scully.

LOZANO: (touches his hat to SCULLY) They all ran the other way, away from the Chupacabra. The man they say is responsible for this tragedy.

SCULLY: Eladio Buente didnt kill this man. He didnt kill anybody.

MULDER: Im not so sure about that, Scully. (SCULLY gives him a "what?!" look.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this is the work of a pathogen of - of some kind of a highly virulent strain.

MULDER: Im not questioning that, but right now Eladio Buente is the only connection we have to this death and to the death of Maria Dorantes, which is why I need you to spare any manpower you can to try to find him.

LOZANO: Manpower? We dont have the resources to go chasing after one poor illegal.

SCULLY: Mulder, whatever you hope to learn by finding this man we have to first make a definitive classification of the fungi taken from the victims. I need to isolate it and I need to get a sample of it to a mycologist as quickly as possible.

MULDER: Good. You should do that. While Agent Lozano and I try to find El Chupacabra.

(LOZANO nods to SCULLY as he and MULDER leave. SCULLY rolls her eyes.)



SCENE 8
BARBERS SHOP

Television shows Mexican soap opera. Passionate argumentative scene between a man and woman. ELADIO enters. BARBER looks up.)

ELADIO: Senor?

BARBER: What do you want?

ELADIO: (in Spanish) I need to go back to Mexico.

BARBER: You want to go back? Estas loco?

ELADIO: (in Spanish) I know you have a truck  the one that brought me here.

BARBER: We haul mucho basura with that truck. What makes you think we haul it back?

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Your driver must go back to the border. I need him to take me. (beginning to cry) Ill pay you.

BARBER: (in Spanish) Give me money.

ELADIO: (in Spanish) I have no money now, but Ill give it to you when I return to Mexico.

BARBER: How long have you been in this country? Ni credito! Ni caridad. Equi es America, you dumb wet.

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Please, Ill get the money. I must leave here.

(On television, the two actors kiss passionately.)

BARBER: Truck stop at dusk. No dinero, no ride. Comprende?

ELADIO: Si. Dinero.

BARBER: Dinero.

(ELADIO leaves.)



SCENE 9
STREET CORNER

A pickup truck pulls up to a group of Mexican men all clamoring for attention. Three men get in the truck bed and it pulls away. ELADIO approaches. CULVER, a construction foreman pulls up in a pickup with a camper over the bed.)

CULVER: Construction. I need two construction workers. Dos! Okay, you two in the back.
Lets go.

(CULVER gets out to let two men in to the back. ELADIO is sitting in truck bed.)

CULVER: I only need two, amigo. Dos. Hey, out of the truck. I got work to do. (Grabs ELADIOS arm. ELADIO stays put. Other two men begin walking away.) Hey, where are you going?

(Shakes his head, and closes camper.)

CULVER: Youll have to do.



SCENE 10
MYCOLOGY LAB
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, FRESNO

(Science lab. STEEN, a mycologist looking at spores under a microscope with SCULLY.)

STEEN: What youre looking at, Agent Scully, is the most ubiquitous fungal spore known to mankind - dermatophytosis.

SCULLY: Athletes foot?

STEEN: One of the survivors of countless extermination efforts. Historically underrated. And unfairly overshadowed by the ever-popular cockroach.

SCULLY: But our body has natural defenses against this kind of invasion. I mean, even in the absence of an immunoresponse a fungi like this one or like the aspergillis sample that I gave you, dont they need the right environment to multiply?

STEEN: Yes, unless they have help. (Gets a vial of yellow fluid out of the refrigerator.)

SCULLY: Whats this?

STEEN: Its an enzyme I isolated from both your specimens, but thats about all I can tell you.
Its unlike any enzyme Ive ever seen.

SCULLY: So its not the fungi, but the enzyme that kills.

STEEN: Acting as a catalyst. As an accelerant. Let me show you. (gets petri dish) This is pucchinia graminis. Black stain rust. Its been the cause of a fairly containable crop blight here in the Valley. Now---

(He places two drops of the enzyme in the dish causing the fungus to quickly expand and overflow.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

STEEN: I must say if this were to get out into the environment, dermatophytosis might give the cockroach a run for its money. Hmm?



SCENE 11
STREET CORNER

LOZANO is questioning some men. MULDER looks at graffiti of a typical alien head with caption - EL CHUPACABRA VIVE!)

LOZANO: (finishing with men, getting CULVERS name) Gracias. (to Mulder) He was here, all right. They say he got into the truck a foreman named Culver.

MULDER: (pointing to graffiti) The storys out.

LOZANO: Oh, yeah. I told you. These people love their stories. Its the one thing that keeps them from going mad when theyre out there standing on the street corner all day waiting for work.

MULDER: So they really dont think hes the Chupacabra?

LOZANO: No. Theyre certain of it.

MULDER: Did you tell them about the fungal infection?

LOZANO: Yeah, they wouldnt listen. Theyre only interested in what will become of Eladio Buente.

MULDER: What will become of him?

LOZANO: When his brother finds him?

MULDER: Hell kill him

LOZANO: Yes, probably. A man cannot live with vengeance in his heart.

MULDER: So we got to find him first.

LOZANO: (grabs MULDERS arm) My mother used to say that blood should be left to cleanse itself. God curses the man who stands between two brothers.

MULDER: Well, in this case, hell curse the man who doesnt.



SCENE 12
CONSTRUCTION SITE

ELADIO working alone. He holds his stomach as if he doesnt feel well.)

ELADIO: Senor? Senor? Jefe? Senor Culver?

(ELADIO wipes his face. His sweat is the same color as the enzyme back in the lab.)

ELDAIO: Jefe? Hey, Jefe?

(ELADIO goes to water cooler and washes his face.)

SOLEDAD: (voice) Eladio Buente! (SOLEDAD picks up a length of metal pipe) Eladio?

(Fungus is now growing on the spigot of the water cooler. No sign of ELADIO. Door to port-a-potty swings slightly open.)

SOLEDAD: Eladio Buente. (in Spanish) Come out of there! Come out like a man so I can split open your face, bastard.

(No response. SOLEDAD opens door of port-a-potty and sees dead CULVER, covered in fungus. Truck engine starts, and ELADIO after almost running into SOLEDAD, drives away. SOLEDAD is very upset.)

SOLEDAD: Assesino!!!



SCENE 13
MEADOWVIEW ESTATES
UPPER FRESNO COUNTY

(Upper-middle-class neighborhood. GABRIELLE BUENTE is cleaning a house. ELADIO calls to her.)

ELADIO: Gabrielle! Gabrielle!

(GABRIELLE nervously points for him to come to the back door.)

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish, whispering) What are you doing here, Eladio

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Im going to Mexico. Come with me, Gabrielle.

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish) Have you lost your mind? Do you want me to lose my job?

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Im very afraid. My brother wants to kill me for something I didnt do.

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish) They say that you are the Chupacabra, and that you killed Maria Dorantes and many more.

ELADIO: (in Spanish, crying) Gabrielle, Im not a killer.

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish) Quiet! The lady of the house will hear us.

ELADIO: (in Spanish) I need your help. I need money.

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish, resigned) My job at the market pays me tonight.

ELADIO: (in Spanish) Gabrielle, I cant wait. (he runs away)

GABRIELLE: Eladio!



SCENE 14
MYCOLOGY LAB

SCULLY on cell phone to MULDER.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me.

MULDER: (voice) Hey, Scully. Where are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) Im at the state university bio department. Mulder, listen to me. I think youre right. I think Eladio Buente is responsible for those two deaths.

MULDER: (voice) Responsible, how?

SCULLY: (on phone) By spreading an enzyme produced by what appears to be a new strain of conidial fungi.

MULDER: (voice) Hows he spreading it?

SCULLY: (on phone) My guess is by touch.

MULDER: (voice) I saw this man, Scully. He was unaffected.

SCULLY: (on phone) He could be just a carrier, then  a kind of Typhoid Mary.

CUT TO: MULDER at construction site.

MULDER: (on phone) Youre saying its a new strain?

SCULLY: (voice) Yes. Mulder, its extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus. You must not inhale it, you must not touch it ...

(LOZANO opens port-a-potty, MULDER stops him.)

MULDER: Lozano, careful. (on phone) Scully, Ive been thinking. I know thats dangerous, but just bear with me. These Fortean transients that the women described? They could have been caused by an object falling at a high rate of speed through the atmosphere creating a sonic boom and a flash of light. What astronomers call a bollide.

SCULLY: (on phone) A bollide?

MULDER: (on phone) Created by a meteorite or a piece of extraplanetary material - of which two thousand tons falls to the Earth every day. Now - now this yellow rain. Space debris could have fallen into a nearby lake superheating the water and sending it skyward. Which would mean this is
alien.

(LOZANO looks at him like hes crazy.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I think this is beside the point, right now.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, and the fungus ...

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, let me work on the fungus, okay? What you need to do is to find the man who might be spreading it.

MULDER: (on phone, reluctantly obeying) Kay. (hangs up)

LOZANO: So. Youve got your own "stories" too, huh?

(MULDER smiles, nods, and laughs at himself. Large car pulls up)

LOZANO: Hey, its El Barbera.

BARBER: Hey, Lozano. I hear youre looking for the Chupacabra. For a modest fee, I can tell you where he might be found.

(LOZANO and MULDER approach the car.)



SCENE 15
TRUCK STOP

MULDER and LOZANO are tailing ELADIO among the tractor trailers. ELADIO is coughing, appears very sick.)

MULDER: Eladio! (ELADIO runs, followed by MULDER and LOZANO. To LOZANO)
Dont touch him.

(ELADIO runs through a crowd of frightened immigrants, then rolls between the wheels of a moving truck. MULDER, for once, is not stupid enough to follow.)

MULDER: I lost him!

(As a convoy of trucks roll by, we see Eladio lying in the bed of a truck filled with goats. MULDER raises his hands in defeat.)



SCENE 16
HIGHWAY 99
FRESNO COUNTY

(Night. Crime scene. MULDER and SCULLY open the back of the truck that contained the goats. They are all dead and fungused.)

MULDER: (disgusted) Uh!

SCULLY: More goats.

(THEY walk back to the police cars.)

MULDER: Agent Lozano! How does this man keep eluding us?

LOZANO: These people are invisible. You look at them and you dont see them. Theyre just workers - cheap labor to pick crops and clean houses. To most people they are aliens in the true sense of the word.

(Gets FLAKITA out of a car.)

FLAKITA: Ay, Chupacabra! (Spanish, she is frightened as she sees the goats.)

LOZANO: Its okay. Calm down, calm down.

FLAKITA: Can a man do this? Can Eladio Buente do this? Eladio, he went to his cousin, Gabrielles house asking for money.

LOZANO: When?

FLAKITA: Today! He say he kill nobody. But Soledad, he went to Gabrielles house trying to kill Eladio.

LOZANO: Calm down.



SCENE 17
GABRIELLES APARTMENT

(Knock at door)

GABRIELLE: Quien es?

LOZANO: (outside door) Gabrielle Buente. This is Agent Lozano, INS.

(GABRIELLE looks to the side. Closed Captioning has SOLEDAD say : Dont tell him Im here. She opens door. LOZANO enters and grabs her arm.)

LOZANO: Where is he?

GABRIELLE: Que?

(MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

LOZANO: Dont give me your "que." You know who. Where is he? Eladio.

GABRIELLE: (crying) He is not here, please. I would not let Eladio Buente in here. Please, you must believe me.

SCULLY: Maybe you should check the back.

(LOZANO lets her go and goes to the back.)

MULDER: What about his brother, Soledad?

GABRIELLE: (not looking at MULDER) No. He is not here! No one is here! I am alone!

MULDER: Have you seen either of them?

GABRIELLE: Si. But I am afraid. Because of what they say about Eladio. About El Chupacabra.

SCULLY: There is no El Chupacabra, Gabrielle. Eladio is a very sick man. If he comes here, you must not let him in. If he comes to this door you must call the police. Do you understand?

LOZANO: (reentering) Theres nobody. Im going to be watching you, Chiquita. Every move. Comprendes?

GABRIELLE: Si.

(They leave, GABRIELLE closes the door.)

(Outside, later, SCULLY gets into truck with LOZANO. MULDER closes passenger door.)

MULDER: I think we should hold up a moment.

SCULLY: For what?

MULDER: Somethings going on here.



SCENE 18
LA RANCHERA MARKET
DOWNTOWN FRESNO

(Supermarket where GABRIELLE works. ELADIO enters, very sick now, open sores on his forehead. Shoppers look at him with disgust. He goes to a self serve nut and candy display and begins hungrily devouring cashews. A CLERK sees him.)

STORE CLERK: Hey, Jose! This aint no restaurant! You know you have to pay for all that!

(ELADIO collapses, taking the display with him, then runs.)

STORE CLERK: Hey what are you doing? Come back here! Hey, you have to clean that up!

(ELADIO is gone. STORE CLERK picks up one of the fallen nuts, now covered with fungus.)



SCENE 19
OUTSIDE GABRIELLES APARTMENT BUILDING

SOLEDAD exits building. MULDER is sitting in back seat of truck, LOZANO and SCULLY up front.)

MULDER: Thats our man.

SCULLY: Eladio Buente?

LOZANO: No. Thats his brother - Soledad.

(SOLEDAD get into his car and drives away. The agents follow.)



SCENE 20
OUTSIDE GROCERY STORE

pay phone rings. ELADIO enters and answers it.)

ELADIO: (on phone) Bueno.

GABRIELLE: (on phone) Eladio?

ELADIO: (on phone) Si, Gabrielle. (in Spanish) Where are you? (crying) Why didnt you come to work?

GABRIELLE: (on phone, in Spanish) Listen to me, Eladio. Soledad - I could only lie to him so long. Eladio? (phone in booth dangles, ELADIO is gone) Eladio!!?

(SOLEDAD drives up and enters store looking for Eladio. Agents enter the store.)

LOZANO: Soledad Buente! Stop, stop! (All draw guns, quickly.)

SCULLY: Drop your weapon!

MULDER: Drop the gun!

SCULLY: Drop it!

LOZANO: Fuetala!

SCULLY: Put it down! Now!

MULDER: Apurate! Drop it!

LOZANO: Fuetala!

SOLEDAD: (in Spanish) I only want vengeance. My own brother killed my Maria. (crying) I want the revenge of brother against brother. (drops gun to his side) I must avenge her death. (he falls to ground, Agents run to him. He holds his hands behind him to be cuffed. SCULLY picks up his gun.) Solo quiero vengarme, pues!

LOZANO: (Reads Miranda to SOLEDAD in Spanish.)

SOLEDAD: (yells) Eladio!!!

LOZANO: Quiet, loco!

SOLEDAD: (something Spanish, loud)

SCULLY: (seeing something) Mulder.

MULDER: Hes been here.

(LOZANO also looks. The nut and candy display has been completely covered with fungus as has the dead STORE CLERK lying beside it. Eeewww.)



SCENE 21
GABRIELLES APARTMENT BUILDING

ELADIO staggers down hall to GABRIELLES door. Hall light flickers. He knocks.)

GABRIELLE: Quien es?

ELADIO: Eladio.

GABRIELLE: Eladio? (opens door) (in Spanish) Whats wrong? What happened to you?

(The shape of ELADIOS head has changed.)

GABRIELLE: (as he tries to enter, she backs up) No.

ELADIO: What are you afraid of?

GABRIELLE: Look! Look at your face!

(ELADIO looks in mirror. His head is oddly shaped and he looks a bit fungal.)

GABRIELLE: You are what they say you are.

ELADIO: No.

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish) You killed Maria Dorantes!

ELADIO: (bringing hands to face in horror) No!

GABRIELLE: (in Spanish) You are the Chupacabra.

ELADIO: (Screams) Nooooo!! Nooooooooooo!!!!!!!



SCENE 22
GABRIELLES APARTMENT

(Later. MULDER, SCULLY, and LOZANO bust in, guns drawn.)

MULDER: Eladio? Eladio Buente?

GABRIELLE: (crying) Hes not here. Hes gone.

SCULLY: Gone where?

GABRIELLE: To Mexico. Where he can hide his terrible face.

MULDER: Hows he going to get to Mexico?

GABRIELLE: I gave him all my money!

SCULLY: You gave him your money?

GABRIELLE: Yes! Because I was afraid. I was afraid that the Chupacabra would kill me, too!

(MULDER and SCULLY look exasperated.)

LOZANO: What can I say?

MULDER: How are we going to find this man?

LOZANO: Good luck. Im gonna go process the brother. (He leaves.)



SCENE 23
OUTSIDE

(MULDER and SCULLY get in their car, MULDER drives.)

SCULLY: You know, what she said about Eladio Buente, about his face ...

MULDER: I dont know what to believe anymore, Scully. These people sure love their stories.

SCULLY: Mulder, he could be anywhere right now. If - if he were to enter a metropolitan area with what hes carrying ...

MULDER: He wont.

SCULLY: If hes going to Mexico ...

MULDER: (having a Mulder leap of logic moment) Shes lying. If this man really thinks he killed Maria Dorantes, he wont be going to Mexico.

SCULLY: Then where is he going?

MULDER: The same place Agent Lozano and Eladios brother are going. Hes going to face his brother.

SCULLY: I dont understand.

MULDER: God curses the man who stands between two brothers. Get on your cell phone and have a haz-mat team assembled. (Starts car.)



SCENE 24
MIGRANT CAMP

(FLAKITA, sitting before some candles in her shack rises at the sound of a car. She sees LOZANO standing and yelling in the middle of the camp.)

LOZANO: Eladio Buente! Come on out! Be a man and face your brother!

FLAKITA: Madre de Dios.

(ELADIO bursts out of shack and runs over the hill from the beginning.)

FLAKITA: Eladio, NOOOOOO!!!!!!

(LOZANO and SOLEDAD pursue. We hear arguing, someone saying no no no no ! and then a gunshot. FLAKITA comes out to find LOZANO dead, fungus forming around his eyes and mouth.)

FLAKITA: Y me dicho la Chupacabra. (and some more Spanish)

(FLAKITA looks up to see a very bright light and sees very strange humanoid figures coming over the hill. FLAKITA runs back inside.)

FLAKITA: (voice, telling story from beginning) They came from the sky, more Chupacabras.

CUT TO:
(Present, telling story in her shack)

FLAKITA: Coming to save Eladio. I slammed the door and prayed that they would not come to kill me, too.

VILLAGE GIRL: What will happen to Soledad.

FLAKITA: He was taken up by a Chupacabra. He will suffer for his treachery. He is made to suck the blood of only the sick and dying goats when the Chupacabra comes to feed.

VILLAGE GIRL 2: That is not what Gabrille says.

FLAKITA: What does Gabrielle know?! I was there! I saw it with my own eyes.

VILLAGE GIRL: Gabrielle says she lied to La FBI, so that her cousin, Eladio, might live. But La Migra Lozano knew that Soledad could not live with vengeance in his heart.

CUT TO:
(GABRIELLES version.)

LOZANO: (fires gun over his head, ELADIO stops) Alto! Turn around and face the man whose love you killed!

SOLEDAD: You killed Maria! Because she wouldnt love you! Because her heart belongs to only one man! (Grabs LOZANOS gun and aims at ELADIO.) Dont make me shoot you in the back, Eladio! Turn! See my tears! Turn around like a man!

ELADIO: No. (in Spanish) I am not a man! (he turns revealing his face which is worse) I am the Chupacabra!

CUT TO:
(Graffiti wall. GABRIELLE pucks up narrative, telling story to a group of men.)

GABRIELLE: "Shoot! Shoot!" La Migra shouted. But Soledad began to cry. "No! No!" cried Soledad. I cannot shoot my brother! He is my brother! My flesh, my blood."

CUT TO:
LOZANO: Shoot him! Hes El Chupacabra!

GABRIELLE: (voice)...shouted La Migra.

(SOLEDAD struggles to shoot.)

LOZANO: We cannot let him go!

CUT TO:
GABRIELLE: "He is the goat-sucker and he must be killed!" But Soledad, he could not kill Eladio because he knew I would never forgive him.

MEN: Que paso? Que paso? (What happened?)

CUT TO:
LOZANO: Cobarde! (grabs for his gun)

SOLEDAD: No! No!

CUT TO:
GABRIELLE: (passionately) La Migra Lozano tried to pull the gun from Soledads hand, calling him a coward. "No!" cried Soledad. "He is my brother!" And the gun went off. Bang! Bang! And La Migra Lozano fell dead.

MEN: Ah, esta buena! (Thats great!)

GABRIELLE: Pero, no! La Migra Lozano brought Soledad to kill Eladio so he would not be cursed. So God cursed Soledad for his treachery and turned him into El Chupacabra - like his brother.

MAN: (in Spanish) Have you seen him? Your cousin?

GABRIELLE: No. Together, they run. To Mexico.

(Camera pans to wall of graffiti. Bald alien head fades into ....Skinner!!!)

SKINNER: (voice) El Chupacabra?



SCENE 25
SKINNERS OFFICE

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SKINNER: Frankly, Im confused by this story.

MULDER: I dont blame you.

SCULLY: We cant exactly explain it ourselves, sir.

MULDER: At any rate, we arrived just after the haz-mat team ...

CUT TO:
(MULDERS version, haz-mat guys are in place of FLAKITAS Chupacabras. FLAKITA runs away frightened.)

MULDER: (voice) They established a perimeter, then secured the area. An eyewitness was found, but her testimony was questionable.

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the site as team brings in a body container.)

SCULLY: (voice) The Haz-mat team were able to contain the fungal infection within the migrant camp. No other casualties were reported. And we found no other traces of the accelerating enzyme.

MULDER: (voice) Except on the body of Agent Lozano. We found him dead at the scene with a bullet wound to the chest.

CUT TO:
SCULLY: And the fungal infection already starting to eat away at him.

SKINNER: What happened to the brothers?

SCULLY: They were nowhere to be found. Lozanos revolver turned up ten miles away near the car of a man known locally as El Barbera.

CUT TO:
(BARBERS car, gun lying next to it, SCULLY shines flashlight in car. BARBER dead inside, covered in fungus.)

MULDER: (voice) Apparently, the brothers paid this man for a ride to Mexico, but they didnt get very far.

CUT TO:
SKINNER: So these men are still at large, carrying a highly contagious ... fungus, that can kill a man in his tracks?

SCULLY: Its not a fungus, sir. Actually, its an enzyme to which the brothers had an abnormal tolerance, and which came from what I believe to be an anti-enzyme gene.

SKINNER: And this enzyme came from where?

MULDER: Outer space, sir.

SKINNER: (Sighs) So this is the story youre asking me to report? You would think that with the resources we have wed be able to find these men. Im not hearing a good explanation of why this hasnt happened.

SCULLY: Well, sir, they, um...They have a way of being almost invisible.



SCENE 26
NIGHT

(Lonely road in Mexico. SOLEDAD and ELADIO BUENTE, the Chupacabras, are hitchhiking. No one stops.)

MULDER: (voice) The truth is, nobody cares.

[THE END]
                                          LEONARD BETTS


SCENE 1
PITTSBURGH, PA

(Ambulance on route to Hospital. EMT MICHELLE is driving, EMT LEONARD BETTS is working on a patient in the back.)

MICHELLE: (on radio) Monogehela. Were en route with a male cardiac, age 62. ETA in 12.

HOSPITAL DISPATCH: (voice) Copy. ETA in 12. Crash unit standing by.

MICHELLE: Hows he looking, Leonard?

LEONARD: Up to his ass in alligators.

(Patient is wheezing. MICHELLE keeps glancing over her shoulder to watch LEONARD work.)

MICHELLE: Is he going into arrest?

LEONARD: No, hes not.

(LEONARD sticks a needle into the patients chest. Vital signs on monitor jump back to normal.)

MICHELLE: What did you do?

LEONARD: Aspirated his chest. He has a tension pneumothorax pressing on his heart.
It just looked like a cardiac.

MICHELLE: Nice catch. How did you know?

LEONARD: Because hes dying of cancer. Its already eaten through one lung.

MICHELLE: Thats amazing. How did you know, Leonard?

(Because MICHELLE is looking over her shoulder, she doesnt see streetlight signal change from yellow to red. A pickup truck broadsides the left side of the ambulance, completely crushing the back. When the ambulance comes to a skidding halt, MICHELLE, groggy and bleeding from a cut on her forehead, gets out and begins looking for LEONARD.)

MICHELLE: Leonard? Leonard? Leonard?

(She sees LEONARDS decapitated body lying near the crushed ambulance, then sees his head a few feet away.)

MICHELLE: Oh, God. Leonard.



SCENE 2
MORGUE

(MORGUE BOY closes the drawer containing the dead patient. We also see a drawer labeled LEONARD BETTS. MICHELLE, head now bandaged, looks in the morgue sadly. She closes the door and leaves.)

(Later, MORGUE BOY has his headphones on and is reading. There is a metallic rattling sound. MORGUE BOY listens for a moment, then goes back to reading. He listens again as there is a thumping sound.)

MORGUE BOY: Hello?

(MORGUE BOY goes to investigate. He sees LEONARDS head lying on the floor. When he bends down to investigate, a figure standing behind him hits him on the head with a long metal object. MORGUE BOY passes out. In the reflection of the metal drawers, we see the naked figure walking through the morgue. The image is very distorted.)

SCENE 3
MONGHEHELA GENERAL HOSPITAL
PITTSBURGH, PA

(Next day. Morgue. MULDER and SCULLY are looking inside LEONARDS now empty drawer. Camera angle is from inside the drawer.)

MULDER: Pretty cozy. Whod ever want to leave.

SCULLY: Well, whoever happened to get locked in here last night, I guess.

MULDER: That would be one Leonard Morris Betts, age 34. But it should probably be noted that when Mr. Betts arrived here last night he was sans head. He was decapitated when his ambulance crashed. He was an emergency medical technician for this hospital  a very good one, apparently. Slew of commendations, write-ups in the local paper.

SCULLY: What about the morgue attendant?

MULDER: Somebody cold-cocked him and stole his clothes. He didnt see who. No alarms tripped, no sign of a break in. Its weird, huh?

SCULLY: Mulder, what are we doing here?

MULDER: Did I mention that Mr. Betts had no head?

SCULLY: Yes. So? I mean, youre not suggesting that a headless body kicked his way out of a latched morgue freezer, are you? Are you? Because I think its obvious this is some kind of bizarre attempt at a cover-up.

MULDER: Meant to conceal what?

SCULLY: My guess would be body snatching for profit. Theres a shortage of - of teaching cadavers at medical schools. An unscrupulous medical supplier might pay top dollar, no questions asked.

MULDER: Yeah, but why take a headless one and leave so many top-dollar bodies behind?

SECURITY GUARD: Sir? Those video grabs you asked for? We found something. These are from the emergency room camera taken at 4:13 this morning.

SCULLY: Theres your perpetrator wearing a stolen uniform.

(Images on video are fuzzy. Where the head should be is just static.)

MULDER: Unfortunately, you cant see very much on these. What - whats all this stuff here?

SECURITY GUARD: Bad video. The security system isnt exactly state-of-the-art.

MULDER: Well, if this is our guy, what did he do with the corpse he stole?

SCULLY: Well, maybe he got spooked and was forced to abandon it.

MULDER: They combed the facility. Where could he hide an adult body where it wouldnt be found?

SCULLY: Ill show you.

(Later in front of the hospital disposal unit. MULDER looks sick throughout the scene.)

SCULLY: All hospitals operate some form of medical waste processing. This unit disposes of surgical remains  amputations, excised tumors. Theyre ground up and heated with microwaves and the result is a uh, sterile soot thats used as road fill. (She is putting on a face shield and full arm gloves.)

MULDER: Well, then theres probably nothing there for us to find.

SCULLY: Well, that depends on how often they dispose of their waste. Hopefully, only once every few days. (Holds out hand. MULDER gives her flashlight. Opens door of unit. It is full of disgusting stuff.) Were in luck.

MULDER: Are you sure about this, Scully? Because if youre not sure I dont see that theres any reason to disturb all this stuff, just

SCULLY: (reaching in unit, squishing sounds) Mulder, I think Im going to need your help. Your arms are longer.

(MULDERS registers many things, none of them pleasure at the idea of helping.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY in face shield and protective sleeves are digging through the container of human remains.)

MULDER: Oh.. I think I got the toy surprise.

(Pulls up a slimy head.)

SCULLY: Leonard Betts.

MULDER: (still disgusted) Thats his head. Wheres his body? Theres not enough room in here. Maybe he didnt dispose of the body. Maybe he got it out of here somehow.

SCULLY: Why did he take the time to dispose of the head?

MULDER: I dont know. Maybe theres an answer here. Something we should check out.

SCULLY: Well, we already know how he died. In an automobile accident. What more is there to know?

MULDER: Maybe nothing, but its all weve got to go on right now. You should see if you can find a place where you can examine Betts head.

SCULLY: While you do what?

MULDER: Check out his house. I know how he died. I want to see how he lives.

SCULLY: Lived.

MULDER: Lived.



SCENE 4
EXAMINATION ROOM

SCULLY places BETTS head on a scale. It reads 10.9 pounds. She carries it to an autopsy table and picks up a tape recorder.)

SCULLY: Case number 226897, Leonard Betts. As remains are incomplete all observations refer to a decapitated head. Weight:10.9 pounds. Remains show no signs of rigor mortis or fixed lividity. Nor do the corneas appear clouded which would seem inconsistent with the witnessed time of death now (checks wall clock) 19 hours ago. Ill begin with the intermastoid incision and frontal craniotomy then make my examination of the brain.

(As SCULLY begins to make the incision, BETTS eyes open and the mouth slowly opens, startling SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Oh, God!

(SCULLY is shocked and drops scalpel.)

SCULLY: Mmm.



SCENE 5
INTERIOR OF BETTS APARTMENT

(Voices and a key in the lock are heard outside. Figure runs past camera and out of sight.)

LANDLORD: (voice) This one here?

MULDER: (voice) This one here, (MULDER enters.) Thanks, Ill lock up.

LANDLORD: Okay.

(MULDER walks through apartment. He sees framed newspaper article naming LEONARD EMT of the year. In the bathroom the tub is filled with dark liquid, clothes strewn about on floor. There are prints on the open window. MULDER dips his fingers in the liquid and smells it. He finds two large empty bottles of iodine under the sink. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Its me. Um, Ive run into kind of a unique situation, here.

MULDER: (on phone) What did you find?

SCULLY: (on phone) Uh, so far, not much. I uh, did a PET scan on Leonard Betts remains actually four times now, and each time the image has come out degraded uh, like its fogged somehow.

MULDER: (on phone) Like the security footage.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, this is cutting edge technology here, Mulder. The technicians say the machine is working perfectly. They also say the that only thing that could account for this kind of image distortion is some form of radiation, but I dont see how or-or where it could be emanating from.

MULDER: (on phone) What did your examination uncover?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I I havent exactly performed an examination yet.

MULDER: (on phone) Why not?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well. Because I, uh I experienced an unusual degree of postmortem galvanic response.

MULDER: (on phone) The head moved.

SCULLY: (on phone) It blinked at me. I mean, I - I know exactly what it is. Its residual electrical activity stored chemically in- in the dead cells.

MULDER: (on phone) Blinked or winked?

SCULLY: (on phone, sighs)

MULDER: (on phone) Youre afraid to cut into it. Scully, youre not saying that that - that its alive, are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, I am certainly not saying that at all.

MULDER: (on phone) But has it crossed your mind that that its not quite dead, either?

SCULLY: (on phone) What do you mean?

MULDER: (on phone) Im standing here in Leonard Betts apartment. Whoever we saw in those video grabs, his clothes are strewn all over the floor. He made himself at home. Maybe he was home.

SCULLY: (on phone) Leonard Betts?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Without his head.

MULDER: (on phone, embarrassed) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I dont even know how to respond to that.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, Im gonna call the local PD and have them put the building under surveillance just in case whoever it is comes back. Ill be in touch.

(MULDER hangs up and leaves. A moment later, LEONARD, with a new head, sits up in the tub on iodine where he had been submerged. He gently blows iodine out of his nose.)



SCENE 6
EXTERIOR OF HOSPITAL

(MICHELLE is walking to her ambulance. MULDER approaches her.)

MULDER: Michelle? Michelle Wilkes? (shows badge)

MICHELLE: Yes?

MULDER: Im Fox Mulder with the FBI. Youre the person on record whos responsible for the disposition of Leonard Betts remains.

MICHELLE: He didnt have any family. No friends, either, as far as I could tell.

MULDER: Except you?

MICHELLE: I liked him, but I wasnt really his friend. He didnt let people get that close. Im not sure I could even call myself his partner. Mostly, I just stayed out of his way.

MULDER: What do you mean?

MICHELLE: Leonard was an amazing medical technician. He could diagnose illness better than any doctor Ive ever seen. You know how they say some people can just look at you and tell you whats wrong?

MULDER: Mm-hm.

MICHELLE: Leonard could do that. Especially with cancer. I always told him he should have been an oncologist or something. He used to volunteer at the cancer ward  read to patients, stuff like that.

MULDER: Did you ever notice anything about him  anything odd?

MICHELLE: No. Well, he never got sick. That was pretty amazing  doing what we do. He was the picture of health.

MULDER: Was he ever injured on the job?

MICHELLE: No. Never. I mean until

MULDER: Oh, yeah.

MICHELLE: Im sorry. I dont know what all this has to do with someone stealing Leonards body. I mean, it almost sounds like youre investigating Leonard.

MULDER: No, no. Thanks for bearing with my questions. I appreciate your time. (leaves)



SCENE 7
HOSPITAL LAB

MULDER and SCULLY watch as LEONARDS head is lifted dripping from a vat of epoxy.)

SCULLY: This procedure is called biopolymerization. Its basically a high-tech mummification process. The remains are dipped in the epoxy and once its cured the specimen can be sliced for examination.

MULDER: Or youve got yourself a nice paperweight. (MULDER laughs at his own joke.)

SCULLY: (NOT laughing) At any rate .. we should have some autopsy answers for you soon.

(Later, a PATHOLOGIST holds up a thin slice of head and places it under a microscope.)

PATHOLOGIST: Im starting with an anterior slice from your Mr. Betts  one favoring the frontal lobe. (puts it under microscope) Well, this is certainly strange.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Is something wrong with the image?

PATHOLOGIST: In a manner of speaking. Here, see for yourself.

SCULLY: (looking at monitor) Oh, my God. His entire brain looks like one giant glioma.

MULDER: He had cancer?

SCULLY: He was riddled with it  I mean every - every cell in this sample. Every cell, essentially, in his entire head and in his brain was was all cancerous. Its completely pervasive.

MULDER: Could you live in this condition?

PATHOLOGIST: Live? This man would have been long dead before reaching such an extreme metastatic stage.

MULDER: Well, how do you explain it?

PATHOLOGIST: Maybe the polymerization distorted the sample. Maybe were not really seeing what we think were seeing.

MULDER: Mmmm. Mm. Maybe were just seeing it clearly for the first time.

SCULLY: What are you suggesting?

MULDER: Lets get a slice to go.



SCENE 8
AMBULANCE

(MICHELLE is driving in her new ambulance with her new partner. She listens to radio exchange.)

EMT 1: (female voice) Monongahela, 136 en route with male, age 20 not responding to CPR. Please advise. Dispatch, somebody pick up please.

EMT 2 (voice, sounds like LEONARD) Mobile Catholic 208 to base. I know youre up to your ass in alligators but it sounds like you patient may be in

MICHELLES PARTNER: (getting her attention) Michelle?

EMT 2: (voice, sounds like LEONARD) anaphylactic shock

MICHELLE: Leonard?

EMT 2: (voice, sounds like LEONARD) epinephrine

MICHELLES PARTNER: (wants her to help him unload their patient) Michelle, come on

EMT 1: (female voice) Ah, hold 208. Hey, that seems to be working. Good call, 208. Thanks for the tip.

EMT 2: (voice, sounds like LEONARD) No problem. Glad I could help.



SCENE 9
DR. CHARLES BURKS LAB
UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
COLLEGE PARK
DR. CHARLES BURKS LAB

MULDER and SCULLY show him the slice of LEONARDS head.)

BURKS: Oh, wow! Ive never worked with a sample of human tissue, before. What exactly were you looking to find?

MULDER: Ill tell you if we find it.

BURKS: Excellent.

SCULLY: Are you ever asked to defend this as a legitimate scientific process, Dr. Burks?

BURKS: Only if youre not happy with the results.

MULDER: Chuck did some of the pioneering work in Kirilian photography in the US.

BURKS: Although I prefer the umbrella term "aura photography." Basically, by applying high frequency electricity I am able to photograph an organisms coronal discharge.

SCULLY: (skeptical) "Coronal discharge?"

MULDER: Coronal discharge, life force  the Chinese call it Chi. Its an accepted fact in most eastern cultures.

SCULLY: And the theoretical basis of holistic medicine, of acupuncture, but what is its application here?

MULDER: It may account for the fogging of your PET scan of Leonard Betts head.

(BURKS is developing photo.)

BURKS: You know, with this equipment I have been able to capture phantom images of whole leaves that were cut in half or the vestigial image of a lizards tail long after its been cut off which, you have to admit is pretty cool.

(BURKS places developed negative on lighted wall. The image show the faint outline of shoulders under the head.)

BURKS: Ah, looks like we got something here. Oh, yeah. Now I dont know exactly what youre looking for, but. Oh, yeah. Theres definitely some kind of energy happening here.

MULDER: (pointing at picture for SCULLY) Chuck, would you believe that this mans head had been decapitated?

BURKS: (laughing) Oh, come on. No way.

MULDER: Way. (to SCULLY) Are we happy with the results?

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY leave the lab.)

MULDER: I dont know about you, Scully, but those sure as hell looked like shoulders to me.

SCULLY: I dont even know how to explain that photo or even what it proves.

MULDER: What if it proves that Leonard Betts is alive, somehow?

SCULLY: Mulder

MULDER: You said that Betts tissue was riddled with cancer. Now what is cancer but normal cells growing rapidly out of control usually caused by some damage to their DNA.

SCULLY: I dont know where youre going with this?

MULDER: Well, let me tell you. What if there was a case where the cancer was not caused by damaged DNA  where the cancer was not a destructive or an aggressive factor, but was rather the normal state of being?

SCULLY: Well, even if that were possible, hes been decapitated.

MULDER: What if this mans life force  his Chi, whatever you want to call it, somehow retained a blueprint of the actual man himself? Guiding rapid growth not as cancer, but as regeneration?

SCULLY: You think that Leonard Betts regrew his head?

MULDER: The fluid that I found in Betts bathtub was povidone iodine. Its often used by lab researchers on reptiles and amphibians to aid regeneration. We both know salamanders have grown entirely new limbs  regenerated.

SCULLY: Salamanders ore one thing, but no mammal possesses that kind of regenerative power. I mean, there isnt a creature walking this earth that can regrow its head.

MULDER: Worms. You cut a worm in half, you get two.

SCULLY: Mulder, theyre worms.

MULDER: Im just saying its not unheard of in nature, thats all.

SCULLY: Well, unheard of or not, someone is going to great lengths to dispose of the evidence.

MULDER: Well, maybe Betts is trying to protect his secret.

(SCULLYS cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully Yeah  Okay ..Great. Thanks. (hangs up) Well, apparently, Leonard Betts did have some secrets -- one of them being that he had an alter ego named Albert Tanner.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: I had Danny run the fingerprints. Two names came up. The second one was Albert Tanner. But, unlike Leonard Betts, Albert Tanner has a living relative  Elaine Tanner, his mother, who just happens to live here in Pittsburgh..

MULDER: (thinking) Huh.



SCENE 10
TANNER HOUSE

Doorbell. ELAINE opens door for MULDER and SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Elaine Tanner?

ELAINE: Yes.

SCULLY: Im Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder, were with the FBI.

ELAINE: Oh, what can I do for you?

SCULLY: Is your son Albert Tanner? (ELAINE nods.) Wed like to ask you some questions. (They enter.)

ELAINE: (leaving the room) Please excuse me for a second. Ive got something on the stove.

(MULDER finds a picture of a younger Betts on a coffee table.)

MULDER: Scully.

(ELAINE reenters.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, is this your son?

ELAINE: Yes, thats Albert.

SCULLY: We know this man as Leonard Morris Betts. Are you familiar with that name?

ELAINE: No.

MULDER: Do you know if your son ever used any other names for himself?

ELAINE: Why are you asking me about him?

SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, are you aware that your son has recently dies?

ELAINE: What do you mean "recently?"

MULDER: When did your son die?

ELAINE: Six years ago. He was killed in an automobile accident. Why?

SCULLY: Would it be possible to get a copy of the death certificate or some form of verification?

ELAINE: Of course. (leaves the room again)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Confused yet?

SCULLY: (quietly) Yeah.



SCENE 11
ALLEGHENY CATHOLIC HOSPITAL
PITTSBURGH, PA
NIGHT

MICHELLE approaches an EMT.)

MICHELLE: Excuse me. Um, Im looking for and EMT, the man driving unit 208?

EMT: The new guy. Yeah. 208s over there. He just went off shift, but you might catch him.

MICHELLE: Thanks. (She follows a figure toward grassy area near dark parking lot.) Leonard? Leonard?

(LEONARD reluctantly turns to face her.)

MICHELLE: Oh, my God! It cant be. How can it be? Leonard, is it you?

LEONARD: Hey, Michelle. (Opens his arms. She cautiously steps into his embrace.) Its okay. Its okay. I just wish you hadnt found me, thats all.

MICHELLE: What are you talking about? Leonard?

(He stabs her in the back with an autoinjectors. She begins convulsing in his arms.)

LEONARD: Im sorry, Im sorry. Im sorry.

(LEONARD lets MICHELLE, now dead slide gently to the ground.)

(SECURITY GUARD sees them.)

GUARD: Hey! You, there! Hold it! Stop! Stop where you are!

(LEONARD runs toward parking lot. GUARD pursues, tackles LEONARD, and cuffs him to a car door handle.)

GUARD: (getting out radio) Stay there Son of a bitch. (to radio) Ronnie? Oh, pick up, man.

RONNIE: (voice) Go ahead.

GUARD: (walking away to check on MICHELLE) We got a situation in the parking lot. This guy just attacked some woman. Shes up in the ambulance parking area.

(LEONARD begins to pull at his thumb. Its obviously very painful. Tearing sound.)

GUARD: (voice) Better get a doc down here right away. Ill check on that guy.

(GUARD returns to where he left LEONARD. Cuffs are bloody, LEONARD is gone, a thumb lies on the ground.)



SCENE 12
PARKING LOT

Day. Light sleet. MULDER and SCULLY at crime scene. MULDER puts thumb in an evidence bag.)

MULDER: (holding up the thumb bag) Siskel or Ebert? Whats the story?

SCULLY: Michelle Wilkes was murdered, but, uh, we wouldnt know that if the security guard hadnt witnessed it.

MULDER: Why is that?

SCULLY: I found a spent autoinjector in the grass. She was given a lethal dose of potassium chloride. Its an electrolyte found naturally in the body and a coroner doesnt usually check for it.

MULDER: Betts was here, Scully. She must have discovered that and then he had to kill her to protect his secret.

SCULLY: Well, the security guard did ID him as her attacker. He worked as an EMT, but his coworkers said his name was Truelove.

MULDER: Do you know how this man escaped? He tore off his thumb because he knew he could re-grow another one.

SCULLY: Mulder, it just doesnt work that way.

MULDER: But is it unimaginable? Is Betts ability to regenerate any greater a leap forward than our ancestors ability to communicate with language or to walk upright?

SCULLY: But, but language, evolution  I - its a process of steps, not leaps.

MULDER: Recent evolutionary theory would disagree. What scientists call "punctualism" or "punctual equilibrium"  it theorizes that evolutionary advances are cataclysmic, not gradual. That evolution occurs not along a straight, graphable line, but in huge fits and starts and that the unimaginable happens in the gaps  the gap between what we are and what Leonard Betts has become.

SCULLY: What youre describing is someone so radically evolved that you wouldnt even call him human.

MULDER: On the other hand, how evolved can a man be who drives a Dodge Dart?

(MULDER and SCULLY open the hatchback of the Dart and find a cooler filled with bags of medical waste. Plaque says human organs for transplant. SCULLY reads some of them.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God. Myeloid Sarcoma, Epithelial Carcinoma  these are all cancerous tumors. This is surgical waste thats been tagged for disposal. What do you think he wanted with them?

MULDER: (looking a little sick) You may not want to know. Scully, theres a great possibility that Leonard Betts not only is cancer

SCULLY: But that he needs it for survival? (MULDER nods) So youre saying that this is?

MULDER: Snack food. Wouldnt it make sense that evolution or natural selection would incorporate cancer  the greatest health threat to our species as part of our genetic makeup?

SCULLY: Why do I think that Charles Darwin is rolling in his grave right now.

MULDER: Ask yourself: Why is Leonard Betts an EMT? Why does he regularly visit cancer wards? Access.

POLICEMAN: The cars registered to one Elaine Tanner, 3108 Old Bank Road.

SCULLY: Betts mom.

MULDER: Do you think Mom knows her dead son is tooling around in her car?



SCENE 13
TANNER HOUSE

MULDER and SCULLY and a group of police greet ELAINE TANNER when she opens the door.)

SCULLY: Elaine Tanner? We have a warrant to search the premises.

(They enter and begin searching.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, We know that your son is alive and that youre in contact with him. You need to tell us where we can find him. Last night, he murdered a woman in cold blood. By lying to protect him, you are considered an accessory to murder.

MULDER: (entering with large empty bottle of iodine) Can you tell me what you use this for? Its a pretty big bottle. Do you get a lot of cuts?

ELAINE: When my son was eight years old, there were two boys who picked on him because he was different. He just ignored them. He knew he was better than they were. One day, they cornered him walking home. Beat him up. He didnt even try to fight back  just lay there taking the blows. So, I dont believe you when you tell me he killed anyone. But if he did, he had his reasons.

SCULLY: What reasons, Mrs. Tanner?

ELAINE: God put him here for a purpose. God means for him to stay, even if people dont understand. And thats all Ive got to say.



SCENE 14
SEEDY BAR

BEARDED MAN sits at bar drinking, smoking and coughing. LEONARD watches him. He hides his thumb which is now a little bud. BEARDED MAN gets up and goes outside to his car. LEONARD follows, holding a scalpel. Outside, LEONARD approaches BEARDED MAN.)

LEONARD: Excuse me. Im sorry, but youve got something I need.



SCENE 15
TANNER HOUSE

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: Did you find something?

MULDER: No sign of him, not even a stray sock. Just this.

SCULLY: Receipt for a storage locker.

MULDER: Yeah, and the key on his key ring with the number 112 engraved on it.

SCULLY: Lets check it out.



SCENE 16
STORAGE LOCKER 112

LEONARD has pulled the BEARDED MANS car in to the locker. LEONARD is naked, obviously very uncomfortable, blood on his mouth. He proceeds to give birth to a fully formed another LEONARD out of his mouth. Ewww. The New LEONARD screams in agony.)



SCENE 17
LATER ON AT THE STORAGE LOCKER

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the U Keep It storage locker. They see blood seeping out from under the door.)

MULDER: Scully.

(They draw their guns and roll open the door. Dead BEARDED MAN falls out. Then LEONARD speeds the car straight at them. MULDER pushes SCULLY out of the way, then they stand and fire at the car. The car violently explodes.)



SCENE 18
HOSPITAL AUTOPSY BAY

(SCULLY examines BEARDED MAN.)

SCULLY: Mr. John Gilnitz. Death from massive blood loss due to what I can only describe as a skillful removal of his left lung.

MULDER: Its Betts.

SCULLY: Doing what?

MULDER: I guarantee, Scully, this mans medical records will show he had lung cancer and Leonard Betts was in need of what he had.

SCULLY: How would he have known that?

MULDER: His partner said he had an ability to diagnose cancer. Maybe his need provided a heightened sense.

SCULLY: Well, what ever he was doing he is taking the secret to his grave.

MULDER: Yeah, for the second time.

(They walk over to LEONARDS burned body on another table.)

SCULLY: Mulder, Leonard Betts is dead. Of that I am absolutely certain. And he is not coming back.

MULDER: You would have said the same thing about Albert Tanner.

SCULLY: I dont understand.

MULDER: Six years ago. Albert Tanner dies in a car accident. His mother buries him. Several days ago, the same man shows up as Leonard Betts. Explain that to me.

SCULLY: Obviously, someone is lying. Maybe the first death was staged.

MULDER: You want to bet on that?

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY stand between LEONARDS body and an unopened coffin. SCULLY covers her nose as the coffin is cranked open revealing a corpse identical to that of LEONARD.)

MULDER: Will the real Leonard Betts please stand up?

SCULLY: Mulder, these men may be no more than monozygotic twins.

MULDER: I dont think so, Scully. I think that what were standing witness to here goes way beyond the regeneration of a thumb or a limb or even a new head.

SCULLY: Mulder, I dont know what youre getting at here. Regeneration of an entire body?. I dont know why Im standing here listening to this.

MULDER: Because I think that the fiery crash that killed this man was a ruse, a decoy and that this man lying here is actually still at large.



SCENE 19
TANNER HOUSE

(A trembling, whimpering LEONARD sits in the bathtub at the TANNER house. The tub is filled with iodine and ELAINE gently sponges him.)

ELAINE: Im scared. The FBI. They seem to know all about you. They dug up the coffin. They found your friend. I dont think theyre ever going to leave you alone, and youre weak. You have to restore your strength. You know what you have to do.

LEONARD: (moans softly)

ELAINE: Im your mother and its a mothers duty to provide.



SCENE 20
ELAINE TANNER RESIDENCE
11:32 PM

(Exterior TANNER house. MULDER and SCULLY are in car on stakeout.)

SCULLY: If this man really exists, what make you think hed come back here?

MULDER: The only person connected with Betts who knows his secret is his mom. If were going to get him, itll be through her.

(Sound of siren approaching. MULDER and SCULLY get out and pull guns on EMTs getting out of ambulance.)

MULDER: Get out of the truck!

SCULLY: Federal agents!

MULDER: Get out of the truck!

EMT: Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

EMT2: We-we got a call  elderly woman, massive chest trauma and blood loss  3108 Old Bank.

EMT: Believe me. Thats all we know.

SCULLY: Stay here.

(MULDER kicks in door. SCULLY goes upstairs to ELAINES bedroom.)

SCULLY: Mulder, get the EMTs up here.

MULDER: (calling to EMTs) You guys get in here.

(ELAINE is unconscious on the bed, bandage on her chest. MULDER joins SCULLY.)

SCULLY: She has an open wound, a surgical cut.

MULDER: Three guesses what was removed. He did this to her and then he called an ambulance.

(EMTs enter and care for ELAINE.)

SCULLY: Judging by the response time, he might still be here. (MULDER leaves.)

(Later, outside. ELAINE is being loaded into ambulance. MULDER comes from behind house.)

MULDER: Betts is gone. He must have taken off on foot.

SCULLY: Shes gonna be okay, Mulder. Shes not out of the woods, but I think we might be able to get where he went out of her.

MULDER: You stay with her. (pulls out cell phone) Ill call local PD and have them cordon off the area.

SCULLY: Okay. (She gets in the ambulance and it leaves.)

MULDER: (on phone) This is Special Agent Mulder with the FBI. Ive got an emergency situation in progress. I need all available units to 3108 Old Bank Road. Im searching for a murder suspect.



SCENE 21
ER ENTRANCE AT HOSPITAL

(ELAINE is taken out of ambulance. SCULLY calls MULDER.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me. Weve got Mrs. Tanner going into the ER, but she took a downturn en route. They defibrillated her to try and get her to try and get her heart back, but theres no chance of getting anything cogent from her. Not tonight, anyway. What about on your end?

MULDER: (on phone) Were going house-to-house, here. Thats the only thing I can think to do. We got a chopper coming in, but until then Id say Betts has got a pretty good chance of getting away. If he steals a car or gets a ride, he could get away for good.

(SCULLY notices dark fluid has dripped onto her head from top of ambulance.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) I mean, he obviously worked this thing out pretty well, Scully, so if theres anything you can get out of Mrs. Tanner tonight, anything at all, at this point we dont have much else to go on.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, get over here right now.

MULDER: (on phone) What?

SCULLY: (on phone) Get over here now.

(MULDER hangs up and runs to his car.)

(SCULLY draws her gun and climbs up ladder on side of ambulance to look on top., LEONARD grabs her foot and pushes her in the vehicle.)

SCULLY: Ahh!

LEONARD: Im sorry but youve got something I need.

(SCULLY stares at him in shock for a moment. LEONARD comes at her with a scalpel, and she fights him off. Then when he comes at her again, she turns the power on the defibrillators to full and zaps him on the head. LEONARD flies out the back of the ambulance and lies twitching on the pavement. SCULLY pants heavily as people begin running out from the ER.)

EMT: Oh, my God.

EMT2: Lets get a crash cart.

(SCULLY stares at LEONARD.)



SCENE 22
CAR

(SCULLY is sitting quietly in passenger side of car. MULDER comes out of the hospital and leans over to talk to her.)

MULDER: They pronounced Betts ten minutes ago.

SCULLY: Hes dead?

MULDER: As near as anyone can tell. His moms alive though, mainly due to the fact that Betts dressed her wounds so carefully. Shes going to pull through, at least for the present.

SCULLY: (quietly) Cancer?

MULDER: Yeah. Its uh(checks his notepad) metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, to be precise. She was treated for it previously but got a clean bill of health about three months ago.

SCULLY: (no answer)

MULDER: (gently) You did a good job, Scully. You should be proud.

SCULLY: I want to go home.

(MULDER nods and closes her door, goes around to drivers side and gets in. He drives her away from the hospital.)



SCENE 23
SCULLYS BEDROOM
2:08 AM

(SCULLY wakes up coughing. She finds a spot of blood on her pillow. She realizes her nose is bleeding.)

SCENE 1
PHILADEPHIA, PA
COURTROOM

JUDGE: If there are no further motions, the Superior Court of the State of Pennsylvania declares case number BD 237 closed. (gavel)

(ED JERSEs lawyer hands him divorce papers for Cindy Savalas, petitioner and Ed Jerse, respondent, decree of dissolution. Wife looks happy, is congratulated. JERSE, not happy, signs.)



SCENE 2
HARD 8 LOUNGE

(Hard 8 lounge. The Pretenders music [yeah! Go Chrissie] playing loudly. JERSE at bar lights a cigarette, indicates to bartender he wants another drink. JERSE is drunk so bartender says...)

BARTENDER: No way.

(JERSE hands him credit card, then takes picture of himself and two kids out of wallet, looks at it, then stabs cigarette into his face on the picture.)

(Red neon tattoo parlor sign. JERSE starts to pass it by, then looks at the selection in the window. Lightening flashes as he sees a picture of a seductive girl, right eye winking.)

(JERSEs apartment. JERSE enters, still slightly drunk. Pulls off his shirt and removes bandage from his right bicep, exposing the tattoo of the girl with the phrase "Never Again" printed under it. He passes out on the floor. Next shot of the tattoo shows both her eyes open.

VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL
CONSTITUTION GARDENS
WASHINGTON,D.C.
2:35 A.M.

(MULDER interviewing MAN WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT. SCULLY loses interest quickly.)

MULDER: And these unknown craft. Where were the majority sighted?

MAN WRA: On route home, me, others, walk onto minefield by base. Long black car drive up. No door handle. No window. No persons drive. We run. Mines...explosion, but...no sound. Nothing. Silent.

MULDER: You said others. Are any of them with you in America?

(SCULLY walks over to Vietnam Memorial)

MAN WRA: Yes. Three or four of us have settled in Philadelphia.

(Focus on SCULLY at the Wall. MULDER and MAN WRA are just voices)

MULDER: Can you verify each of you worked on the base?

MAN WRA: Difficult to know. KGB still held much power at this time. Keep our...uh...papers."

MULDER: "Credentials"

(SCULLY sees flowers, toy car, and card at base of wall "Dear Brother, Twenty years later, I still miss you. We know what you did was right.)

MAN WRA: Y-yes. We are each mentioned in "Thread Three" report. You check.

(SCULLY picks up a rose petal)

MULDER: If youre mentioned in "Thread Three" you must have been there on Gray October.

(SCULLY contemplates rose petal)



SCENE 4
JERSES OFFICE CUBICLE

Burned picture is on his desk. Phone ringing)

WOMAN: Hello?

JERSE: Hello, Mrs....Denunzio. Hi, this is Ed Jerse over at Fuller and Seigle. How are you this morning?

MRS DENUNZIO: Eh, the kids, you know. (Sound of children)

JERSE: I understand. I just wanted to call and let you in on a stock thats going public next week.
.
MRS DENUNZIO: Oh, well its so hard after the holidays. Dont hit her with that! I mean it! Im sorry, what?

JERSE: A company in Tucson called Cryo-Cord has achieved an amazing advancement in the technology of cryogenics.

MRS DENUNZIO: Uh-huh.

JERSE: Y-you see, stem cells from the blood of an umbilical cord may be transplanted in the treatment of many life threatening diseases such as - - -

VOICE: Loser.

(JERSE looks up in shock)

MRS DENUNZIO: Such as?

JERSE: What?

MRS DENUNZIO: Diseases such as what?

JERSE: Before that, what did you say?

MRS DENUNZIO: I didnt say nothing. You were talking.

(VOICE laughs. JERSE takes off headset and walks around to another cubicle where two women
are talking.)

JERSE: Say it to my face. Right to my face. Now that Im in front of you, call me a loser to my face.

COWORKER: Calm down.

VOICE: Trash her desk.

(JERSE pushes everything on the desk to the floor. Female boss comes in)

BOSS: Why dont you go home, Ed. Well discuss this later.



SCENE 5
X-FILES OFFICE
WASHINGTON, DC

SCULLY, alone, holding MULDERs nameplate.. MULER enters in casual clothes carrying a bag. He is in a hurry.)

MULDER: I made a last ditch effort to get out of it, but the Bureau is holding fast to its Federal Employees Vacation Policy. (Opens file cabinet) I havent taken a day off in four years, so either I take a week vacation now, or they start not paying me for eight weeks vacation time. I dont like it, but I got to do it. I got to pay the rent. I got to eat Part of me cant help thinking this is just another way to get me out of here. But it is only a week, and youll be here to keep an eye on things for me, so... heres a few things for you to keep an eye on while Im gone. (Sorts through files)

SCULLY: Why dont I have a desk?

MULDER: What do you mean?

(SCULLY holds up his name plate.)

MULDER: (pointing behind him) I always assumed that that was your area.

SCULLY: (wistfully) Back there.

MULDER: Okay, so well have them send down another desk and there wont be any room to move around her but we can put them really close together face to face, maybe we can play some Battleship.

SCULLY: So what is it you want me to keep an eye on?

MULDER: That contact that we met last night at the Wall who had the distinction of being present for a first - - - that being you abandoning me during questioning. In the future, Ill make sure that all those people being interviewed provide you with a multi-media laser show to keep your interest maintained. In any case his name is Sevlov Pudovkin. Hes a Russian immigrant with a doctorate in astronautical engineering. He and several other contacts worked at a military space center in the Republic of Karelia. They smuggled out reverse-engineered reports of two alien craft which crashed and were retrieved from the Sea of Barents.

SCULLY: And these reports are for sale?

MULDER: At a high price, yeah.

SCULLY: Mmmhmm. Have you confirmed the identity of these individuals?

MULDER: Thats your assignment while Im gone. (SCULLY is not pleased) I want you to run an INS check and a Bureau NCIC check on these individuals. (Hands her a paper) All of whom now reside in the "Little Russia" section of Philadelphia. Ive also made arrangements for travel so you can administer eye-to-eye surveillance on their activities. (Hands her plane ticket.)

SCULLY: Im not going.

MULDER: (chuckles) What do you mean?

SCULLY: Your contact, while interesting in the context of science fiction, was, at least in my memory, recounting a poorly veiled synopsis of an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle.

MULDER: Eenie, meenie, chili beanie, the spirits are about to speak?

SCULLY: Rocky and Bullwinkle are looking for an upsidasium mine. Boris Badenov alters the road signs which causes them to walk onto a secret military base, where they are picked up by a car with no windows and no door locks, and there are silent explosions from a compound called "Hushaboom."

MULDER: So youre refusing an assignment based on the adventures of Moose and Squirrel?

SCULLY: "Refusing an assignment?" It makes it sound like youre my superior.

MULDER: Do what you want. Dont go to Philadelphia, But let me remind you that I worked my ass off to get the files reopened. You were just assigned. This work is my life.

SCULLY: And its become mine.

MULDER: You dont want it to be.

SCULLY: This isnt about you. Or maybe it is, indirectly. I dont know. I feel like Ive lost sight of myself, Mulder. Its hard to see, let alone find in the darkness of covert locations. I mean, I wish I could say that we were going in circles, but were not. Were going in an endless line - - two steps forwards and three steps back. While my own life is...standing still.

MULDER: Well, maybe its good that we get away from each other for a while. (Starts to leave)

SCULLY: Where will you be?

MULDER: Ironically enough, its personal. Its a... place I always wanted to go. What I anticipate to be a spiritual journey. I hope to ... discover something about myself. Maybe you should do the same.

(MULDER exits. SCULLY takes rose petal out of her pocket, looks at it, then places it on MULDERS desk.)



SCENE 6
JERSES APARTMENT

Close up of the tattoo, eye is winking again. JERSE is on the phone.)

JERSE: Yes, Mrs. Shima-Tsuno. Maam, what if I swore to you that it would never happen again? ... I just would like another chance. .... I-I need another chance, Mrs. Shima-Tsuno. ... Look, that stock I recommended, virtual gambling, is up. ... Mm-hmm. ... Mm-hmm. ... Right ... I understand. ... Thank you for your time. ... Good bye.

(JERSE hangs up, hits the phone, and shoves it off the desk. He puts his head in his hands.)

VOICE: (mocking) "Thank you for your time." (giggle) If you were any kind of man, you would have told her to kiss your ass, but no. Another woman sticks it to you. Aint that right ... Eddie.

(JERSE crawls on the floor, listening, trying to find the source.)

JERSE: (banging on floor) Hey! I can hear you down there. Hey! Stop it! Shut up! Shut up down there! Knock it off!

(Downstairs, woman is changing paper in bottom of birdcage. She glances up, then sits on sofa and turns on TV. The Partridge Family singing "Doesnt Somebody Want to be Wanted")

KEITH PARTRIDGE: I go downtown, and roam all around
but every street I walk, I find another dead end.
Im on my own, but Im so all alone
I need somebody so I wont have to pretend....

VOICE: You hear that? Its you, Ed. Its all about you

(JERSE bangs the floor harder. Woman downstairs turns the volume up. Knock at JERSEs door. He opens it to two Jehovahs witnesses, man and woman. Woman hold out pamphlet.)

JEHOVAH WOMAN: Good evening, my name is Hannah, and this is Spencer. Have you ever imagined what it would be like - - -

JERSE: Do-do you hear that? D-downstairs.

HANNAH: What I hear is the confusing and troubling sound of- - -

JERSE: Shes trying to drive me crazy.

HANNAH: Oh, we just talked to Miss Schilling, and I dont believe she would do - -

JERSE: Somehow, she knows what I thinking. I dont want to feel it --- but they know, like psychics or something, or an implant thing, trying to drive me crazy. (HANNAH and SPENCER share a look) Theyve even programmed the TV to criticize me. There, you hear it? There! There! There!

HANNAH: W-well come back some other time. (They hand him pamphlet -picture of praying hands and words - "Are you a Failure?" and leave.)

VOICE: Mm-mm-mm. You see? Even the Jehovah Witness babe wont waste her time on you. No woman would, and you just sit and take it. (JERSE clasps hands over his ears) Take it like a man.

(Downstairs, Miss Schilling hears knock at door. She ignores it. Music very loud. Ed breaks in door and advances threateningly.)

MS SCHILLING: Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here. What do you think youre doing? Get out of my apartment! (Tattoos eye is open)

(Camera leaves the apartment and wanders down the hall. Under the music we hear her screaming for help. Camera goes into cellar. JERSE drags blood-stained cardboard box down stairs and opens fiery furnace door. We hear him straining, and fire sounds, then see him reach to bottom of now empty box and retrieve SCHILLINGS remote control.)

VOICE: Attaboy, lover. From now on, Im your right-hand gal. You and me. As long as Im with you, no one will ever hurt you, Never Again.

(JERSE looks down at tattoo, which is now winking again.) commercial



SCENE 7
MOUNTAIN HIGHWAY

MULDER in middle of road with cel phone bending over and pacing around trying to get a clear signal.)
(X-files office phone ringing)
(Mountain highway. Machine picks up)

MULDER: Oh, hey. Scully, its me. (has trouble hearing) I-Im just calling to see how youre doing, and uh... (Xfiles office, desk with rose petal) Give me a call... Give me a call on my cel when you get a chance, just let me know where youre at....



SCENE 8
PHILADELPHIA, PA

(SCULLY sitting in car drinking coffee. Looks in file that MULDER gave her. Picture of the guy shes supposed to check out, PUDOVKIN. She sees him walking down street, looks through binoculars. He goes into a store. SCULLY follows. She walks to curtain at back of store where people are speaking Russian. She peeps through curtain and sees him take a wad of money from a man and woman, payoff style. SCULLY turns away as PUDOVKIN leaves. She watches him cross the street and go into the same tattoo parlor JERSE used. SCULLY follows and sees JERSE arguing with SVO, the tattoo artist.)

JERSE: No, thats not my problem. You did good work. Its very nice. Its just like in the window, but ...

SVO: So what? Why do you want to cover it? Listen friend, everyone gets tattoo they deserve.

(SCULLY looks around all the pictures in the shop, especially at the ourobus, Millenium logo.)

JERSE: What if you dont cover the whole thing? Just the eyes and the mouth?

SVO: Even if I say yes, its too soon. The skin must heal.

JERSE: Ill pay you anything.

SVO: Miss, miss. You. You like this on his arm?

(SCULLY comes over to look. Tattoos eye is closed.)

SCULLY: Wow. (At the tattoo, or the arms owner, were not sure.)

VOICE: Eddie?.....

SCULLY: The, uh, the color ... the red on the lips. Its extraordinary.

(Tattoos eye is now open)

SVO: Something I find in Soviet prison. I tell him, everyone gets tattoo they deserve. Beautiful, Cheap. Thought over. Impulse.

VOICE: Thought I was your girl.

SVO: Tattoo reflect on body what lies in persons soul......

VOICE: Youd break my heart over a cheap redhead?

SVO: ...use the sewing needle, paperclip.....

VOICE: You talk to her, and Im going to be bad. (JERSE covers tattoo with sleeve)

SVO: ...charcoal shavings, urine. I find grasses growing in prison yard. Rye and such. Only use now, on that tattoo.

(PUDOVKIN, man SCULLY is following opens door at back of shop.)

PUDOVKIN: Svo. (Waves him back)

SVO: Pardon me. You look.

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Thank you.

(SVO leaves, JERSE puts on coat.)

JERSE: Mind some advice from a stranger? Make sure youve thought it over before you get it done.

SCULLY: What, you didnt get the tattoo you deserve?

JERSE: Mine was too impulsive.

SCULLY: Never say never. Yeah, sometimes I wish I were that impulsive.

JERSE: Careful what you wish for. Theres more fashionable places in the city. How did you end up here?

SCULLY: Im in town visiting my aunt in the neighborhood. How bout you.

JERSE: Theres a real crummy bar across the street. Its good for when youre feeling down.
I was kind of down last week and uh...

SCULLY: So it wasnt so much "impulsive" as it was "hammered?"

JERSE: Have you ... um... seen much of Philadelphia?

SCULLY: No.

JERSE: Theres a couple of really nice restaurants by the river, if youre interested.

SCULLY: Id like that. But um.... Im ... um leaving tonight.

JERSE: Uh, if youre ever in town again, thats my home number. I work there mainly. (hands her a card, then leaves, clutching his arm)



SCENE 9
ADAMS INN
PHILADELPHIA, PA
5:23 P.M.

(SCULLY sitting cross-legged on bed, typing on laptop. Phone rings)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: (we see back of his head) Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder. Whats wrong?

He is in MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE

MULDER: (wearing 70s Elvis sunglasses) Nothings wrong. Im just at that special place, and I wanted to share it with you. Did you know that Elvis bought all the furniture in just 30 minutes? (walking around a room in Graceland)

SCULLY: How did you know where I was?

MULDER: I-I checked where we always stay in Philadelphia. I knew you wouldnt abandon me. Hows the case going?

SCULLY: Ive handed it over to the Philadelphia bureau.

MULDER: The Philadelphia bureau? They dont know or care about the X-files. What are you doing?

SCULLY: Mulder, there is no Xfile. Your contact is connected to the Vorofskoi Mir, extortion, credit fraud, cons, he is nothing but a swindler.

MULDER: How do you know?

SCULLY: What do you mean, how do I know? You assigned me the background check. I did as told, as always.

MULDER: Okay, just hold off until I get there, okay?

SCULLY: What, you dont think Im capable?

MULDER: Of course I believe that youre capable, its just that in this case I need you to...

SCULLY: Its not just in this case, Mulder.

MULDER: Wh-whats the agents name in Philadelphia?

SCULLY: It is over. Done. Pudovkin is out of our hands. Look Mulder, I have to go.

MULDER: (sneering) What, have you got a date, or something? (SCULLY doesnt answer) Y-youre kidding.

SCULLY: I have everything under control. I will talk to you later. (She hangs up)

(MULDER hangs up his cel, then does an Elvis dance move)

(SCULLY looks at card JERSE gave her.)



SCENE 10
JERSE"S APARTMENT

VOICE: Isnt it better this way, baby? Me and you alone. Women are so petty.... jealous.... controlling. That bitch today would have been just like all the others.

(Phone rings. JERSE answers it)

JERSE: Hello?

SCULLY: Uh, hi. Um, Ed Jerse, please.

JERSE: This is him.

SCULLY: Its Dana. We met today. Um, my, uh, my flight was cancelled because of the storm and I was just wondering if I could take you up on dinner.

JERSE: I think its worth fighting a little snow. One thing - - my car is in the shop. Well have to meet.

SCULLY: I could pick you up.

JERSE: Give me an hour?

SCULLY: Good. Well uh, Ill see you then.

(JERSE hangs up.)

VOICE: Go ahead. Treat yourself. This girl is a real doll. But beauty is only skin deep, baby. I go all the way to the bone.

(JERSE burns the tattoo with his cigarette.) commercial

(JERSEs building. SCULLY enters, sees the Jehovahs witnesses knocking a MS. SCHILLINGs door.)

SPENCER: (there is no answer) She said shed be here. (Knocks again) Ms. Schilling?

(SCULLY goes upstairs and knocks on JERSEs door. He opens it with his shirt half on.

SCULLY: Hi.

JERSE: Hi.

SCULLY: Im, uh, early. The storms not so bad.

JERSE: Its supposed to get bad later tonight. Come on in. Ill be ready in a second. (He closes door.) At least we can forego "what-a-nice-place-you-have" formalities.

SCULLY: Ed, I-I uh, I dont go out very much. I think the last time I went on a date was to see Glen Garry Glen Ross and the characters in the movie had a much better time. (Sees his sleeve) Ed, youre bleeding.

JERSE: Its just the damn tattoo. Um, here. (He goes into bathroom)

SCULLY: Im a doctor. Do you want me to take a look at it?

JERSE: No, its okay. Its been nothing but trouble. (He puts fresh bandage on it.)

(SCULLY looks at picture of kids and JERSE with burned out face.)

JERSE: (entering buttoning fresh shirt, quick change!) I hope you like this place. I made reservations. (He sees her looking at the picture)

SCULLY: Ed.... the, uh... the crummy bar you told me about. Take me there.



SCENE 11
HARD EIGHT LOUNGE

(JERSE and SCULLY in a booth with drinks)

SCULLY: So, what make this place a good place to go when youre feeling down?

JERSE: Oh, its kind of ... Everyone here looks like their problems are worse than mine. Makes me feel good about myself.

SCULLY: Yeah, but you cant tell whats going on in somebodys head just by looking at them. I mean, theyre probably thinking that were the ones that are screwed up. (Being very oral with her drink stirrer.)

JERSE: Are we?

SCULLY: Who knows? I mean sometimes, I, uh... Ive always gone around in this, uh ... this circle. It usually starts when an authoritative or controlling figure comes into my life. And part of me likes it, needs it, wants the approval. But then at a certain point, along the way, I just, you know .... (makes a stop motion with her hand. JERSE looks at her questioningly) Okay, umm.... My father was a Navy Captain. I worshipped - - I worship - - the sea that he sailed on. And when I was 13 or so I went through this .... thing (hand gesture), where I would sneak out of my parents house and smoke my mothers cigarettes. And I did it because I knew that if he found out, he would kill me. And then... along the way, there are other ... fathers.

JERSE: Sounds a little like you time has come around again. I want things more like a straight line, and I dont ever want to go backward. Thats why I got the tattoo I deserve. Marked the moment, the feeling ... memorial of something that I never want to have happen again.

SCULLY: I want to see it.

JERSE: You know, Dana, just cause I marked the moment wanting to go forward doesnt mean that it worked.

SCULLY: (reaching for him) I want to see it.

JERSE: (stopping her) Come on. Its all scabbed up.

SCULLY: Its okay.

(JERSE grabs her hands roughly. SCULLY gasps)

JERSE: Youre so curious. Get your own.



SCENE 12
SVOS TATTOO SHOP Water is sprayed on SCULLYs bare lower back. An area is shaved.

SCULLY and JERSE watch each other. Very sexual. Alcohol is swabbed, then the pattern of the snake eating its own tail is applied. SVO prepares the needle.)

JERSE: She wants the same red. Like mine.

(SCULLY jumps when the needle first touches her, but then gets a look almost of pleasure. JERSE watches. As her skin bleeds, her expression is pleasure/pain release.)

(JERSEs apartment. Same mood as the tattoo parlor. JERSE looks at the weather outside.)

JERSE: Look, the weather and a few drinks under your belt ... Id feel better if you stayed here. Hey, Im not up to anything. I just want you to be safe. Ill take the couch. That tattoo hurt at all?

SCULLY: Yeah, um.... it feels weird. I, uh, I cant see it and..... but I feel different. Its like, um, I dont know how I feel about that.

(JERSE lifts her shirt and the bandage and looks at the tattoo)

JERSE: It looks all right.

SCULLY: (seeing blood on JERSEs arm) Ed, youre bleeding again. Will you let me take a look at it? I am a doctor. (She pulls off his jacket and shirt)

JERSE: They said this could happen.

SCULLY: Ed, it looks burned.

VOICE: Get her hands off of me!

(JERSE violently grabs SCULLYs hands and holds her still, lips getting closer)

VOICE: Those are bad thoughts youre having, baby. Kiss her and shes dead.

(Camera goes out into the hall, and door magically closes) Commercial



SCENE 13
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Next day. Xfiles office. MULDER still in casual clothes dials phone.)

HOTEL: Adams Inn.

MULDER: Dana Scully, please.

(Phone rings)

HOTEL: Im sorry, sir, there is no answer in that room.

MULDER: Thank you. (He hangs up, and notices the rose petal on his desk)



SCENE 14
JERSES APARTMENT

Close up of JERSEs bandage with bloodstain same shape as a rose petal. JERSE wakes up on couch. Writes a note.)

(Later, knocking wakes SCULLY who is in the bed wearing JERSEs shirt. She opens the door for two men holding badges.)

MAN #1: Good morning. Im Detective Gouveia and this is Detective Smith. May we speak with Edward Jerse?

SCULLY: Uh, Im sorry. Hes not in. I dont know where he is.

GOUVEIA: Were you here the night before last?

SCULLY: No. Could I help you with something? Im with the Bureau.

(They look at her suspiciously. SCULLY realizes how she looks, what she is wearing, and goes to get her ID)

SMITH: The resident downstairs, Kaye Schilling, was reported missing. Some blood was found in her apartment - - not hers. It had some, uh ... abnormalities.

SCULLY: Such as? Look, I have a background in forensic medicine. I assure you that anything you divulge to me will be held in the strictest confidence.

GOUVEIA: Well, a preliminary toxicology report found this substance in the bloodstains. Blood type was "A", and hers was "O."

SCULLY: May I? (Copies down substance information)

SMITH: Look. Heres our card. Wed appreciate Mr. Jerse giving us a call when he returns. And if he doesnt, we will.

SCULLY: Okay.

(They leave. SCULLY closes door. Sees JERSEs note - "Dana, went to get coffee and breakfast. Didnt want to wake you. XO Ed" She logs on to his laptop which must have the new DEC Alpha 1000 MHz chip and a T3 line coming directly into the house. She accesses the FBI data base. The substance is Ergot, which is from a parasite on rye and related grasses. She feels her tattoo. Psychotomimetic drug, auditory, psychotic. SCULLY dials the phone.)

WOMAN: Federal Bureau of Investigation.

SCULLY: Yeah, Fox Mulder, please.

WOMAN: One moment.



SCENE 15
X-FILES OFFICE

Mulder listening to something on headset. Phone rings, SCULLY hangs up just as he answers. Mulder reluctantly hangs up.)

(JERSE enters apartment with bags, smiling)

JERSE: Good morning. Whats wrong?

SCULLY: Ed. Sit down. (Moves her coat. Her badge is on top) Some detectives were here. The woman in the apartment downstairs was reported missing. They found some blood in her apartment and I believe circumstantially, it may be yours.

JERSE: I was helping her move in and I cut myself.

SCULLY: You need to tell that to the detectives. But what Im also afraid of - - and this concerns both of us - - is that an ergot alkaloid was found in the blood which is why I think it may have been yours. Now ergot is a parasite that lives off of rye and related grasses. Svo said that he used rye somehow in his ink. Now if this is true, we may be subject to hallucinogenic ergotism. Aural, visual hallucinations. Dangerous and unlikely behavior. We need to go to the hospital to be tested.

JERSE: I dont need that, Dana. Its such a relief to be able to tell someone. I hear it, Dana. In my head, only deeper. Its more than just some chemical reaction. She talks to me. She hates women ...my wife, my boss ... you. Shes so jealous, Dana. She makes me do things. I dont want to, but she controls me. But I believe that you made her go away.

SCULLY: We need to get help. Now, Im going to go into the other room and Im going to come back and we are going to go together. (Picks up her coat, her badge falls, but JERSE doesnt see it. She picks it up goes into the other room.)

VOICE: Mmm-hmmm. Whod she call? Whod she call, Eddie? Come on. Arent you just dying to know? (Eye is open)

(JERSE hits redial button)

WOMAN: Federal Bureau of Investigation.

VOICE: Dana Scully, please.

JERSE: Dana Scully, please.

WOMAN: One moment please.

(JERSE hangs up. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Okay, lets go. (doesnt see him at the desk)

JERSE: (attacking her from behind) Never again!! Never again! (Slams her against couch. She breaks free. He blocks the door. She runs to the bathroom and locks it. She finds a pair of surgical scissors just as he busts the door in. He slams her head against the wall knocking her unconscious.)

VOICE: Another woman in my bed? Burn the sheets! Burn her. Burn her!

(JERSE rips sheets off bed and wraps SCULLY, scissors still in hand, in them. VOICE laughs as he carries her down to the basement and drags her to the furnace and opens it. SCULLY struggles out as he gazes at the flames.)

VOICE: Come on. Do it for me.

(JERSE grabs for SCULLY and she stabs his arm.)

SCULLY: This isnt you, Ed.

VOICE: Go on, Eddie.

SCULLY: Get control of yourself.

VOICE: Ah, but its good to lose control.

SCULLY: Take control!

VOICE: Do it!

(JERSE sticks the tattooed arm into the flames. SCULLY yells and pulls him out. He falls, his arm badly burnt. SCULLY stands in shock. Close up of her tattoo.)



SCENE 16
X-FILES OFFICE

Door opens revealing a still tired and bruised SCULLY. MULDER walks up behind her and into the office. He is sarcastic.)

MULDER: Welcome back. You look a lot better than you did in the hospital. And congratulations for making an personal appearance in the Xfiles for the second time. (Gets file from cabinet) Its a worlds record. (He keeps looking for a response. There is none.) Ed Jerse is in custody at the St. Johns burn facility in Philadelphia. Traces of ergot were found in his bloodstream as in yours, but not to the degree that should cause hallucinogenic ergotism. (SCULLY sits) Hell undergo psychiatric evaluation after recovering from burn trauma. Comrade Svo has been shut down, he was under investigation for having connections to my friend Pudovkin. Case closed on Boris Badenov, which is really a shame because I was thinking of having an "N.Y." tattooed on my ass to commemorate the Yankees World Series victory. Better late than never, hunh.

(SCULLY picks rose petal off his desk. MULDER watches her. Then rises uncomfortably and goes back to file cabinet.)

MULDER: The uh, field office in Dallas is uh, receiving reports of the image of a missing child appearing on a blank billboard outside of Arlington... (Sits again, opening new file.) ....so.... All this, because Ive ... because I didnt get you a desk?

SCULLY: (Looking up at him) Not everything is about you, Mulder. This is my life.

MULDER: Yes but its m - -

(SCULLY looks at him questioningly. He starts to speak again, then sighs and fiddles with things on his desk. Uncomfortable silence in the room.)

[THE END]
                                       MEMENTO MORI



SCENE 1

(Slow zoom in on Scully, she is looking at skull x-ray)

SCULLY: I feel time like a heartbeat, the seconds pumping in my breast like a reckoning. The luminous mysteries that once seemed so distant and unreal, threatening clarity in the presence of a truth entertained not in youth, but only in it's passage. I feel these words as if their meaning were weight being lifted from me, knowing that you will read them and share my burden, as I have come to trust no other. That you should know my heart, look into it, finding there the memory and experience that belong to you, that are you, is a comfort to me now as I feel the tethers loose and the prospects darken for the continuance of a journey that began not so long ago, and which began again with a faith shakened and strengthened by your convictions, if not for which I might never have been so strong now. As I cross to face you and look at you incomplete, hoping that you will forgive me for not making the rest of the journey with you.

SCENE 2
HOLY CROSS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
WASHINGTON, DC

(Mulder with flower bouquet, walking down hallway)

MULDER: (in passing to nurse) Oncology? Thanks.

(in x-ray room, Scully is there)

MULDER: Scully? I uh, stole these from some guy with a broken leg down the hall. He uh, won't be able to catch me. (pause) How ya doing?

SCULLY: I guess that's the question. Actually I feel fine. (pause)

MULDER: What uh, what exactly are we looking at here?

SCULLY: It's what's called nasopharengeal mass. It's a small growth between the superior conchea and the sinoidal sinus.

MULDER: A growth?

SCULLY: A tumor. You're the only one I've called.

MULDER: Is it operable?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: But it's treatable.

SCULLY: The truth is that the type and placement of the tumor make it difficult, to the extreme.

MULDER: I refuse to believe that, I..

SCULLY: For all times I have said that to you I am as certain of this as you have ever been. I have cancer. It is a mass on the wall between my sinus and cerebrum. If it pushes into my brain statistically there is about zero chance of survival.

MULDER: I don't accept that. Th..there must be some people who have received treatment for this, we..can....

SCULLY: Yes there are.



SCENE 3
SKINNER'S OFFICE

SKINNER: This news comes as the worst kind of surprise Agent Scully. I'm sorry, very sorry.

SCULLY: Thank you sir. I don't mean for this to be awkward and I would appreciate if we could keep this matter confidential.

MULDER: I understand. I assume you'll be taking a leave of absence.

SCULLY: No sir, actually I've asked my doctors to hold onto my medical records until Agent Mulder and I can exhaust a possible avenue of investigation.

SKINNER: Investigation?

MULDER: Last year agent Scully and I pursued a case in which a number of women, proported abductees, experienced similar symptoms after having implants removed from the base of their necks. A woman in Allentown, Pennsylvania, named Betsy Higopian was undergoing treatment for nasopharengeal tumor. We just haven't been able to contact her yet.

SKINNER: I'm sure you're aware we have contacts with the best physicians and medical facilities in the country.

SCULLY: Yes sir, but for my own reasons I'd like to like to pursue this through the justice department rather than a personal matter.



SCENE 4
ALLENTOWN, PA

(Woman in house peeling MUFON sticker off window, we hear car stop, doors close, shot of Mulder and Scully walking towards house, woman opens the door)

RELATOR: I'm sorry, no early birds.

SCULLY: We're not here for the garage sale. We're looking for Betsy Higopian. No one's returning our messages.

RELATOR: Sorry, um, Betsy's passed away, just 2 and a half weeks ago. Are you a relation?

MULDER: No, we're with the FBI.

RELATOR: Some kind of trouble?

MULDER: Betsy was part of a MUFON group?

RELATOR: I don't know, I'm just the relator.

MULDER: Would mind if we come inside and take a look? (shows badge, woman stands aside, they enter, Scully has a flashback of the women she met last year, then touches the back of her neck)

MULDER: Hey Scully listen to this. (static in phone) There's two lines coming into this house. This one was lit.

SCULLY: Someone's sending a fax or computer modem.

MULDER: Ya but who and for what?

(Mulder and Scully go downstairs, find computer)

MULDER: Someone must have remote access to the system.

SCULLY: And downloading data.

MULDER: Copying files. Let's get a trace on this before whoever it is hangs up. (Scully dials phone)



SCENE 5
FRONT OF APARTMENT BUILDING
NIGHTTIME

SCULLY: Apartment 234 is listed under Kurt Crawford. (rings bell)

MULDER: I'm going to check around back. Why don't you see if you can get the manager.
(Mulder going behind building, walks up back stairs, man comes out of a door and
tries to escape towards the front, Scully points gun towards him)

SCULLY: (yelling, aiming gun) Stop! Federal agent! Hold it! Put your hands where we can see them. Is your name Kurt Crawford?
(Mulder knocks him down)

KURT CRAWFORD: Yes.

MULDER: Scully..

SCULLY: What?
(Scully dabs at blood on her nose)

SCULLY: I'm fine Mulder, quit staring at me I'm fine.



SCENE 6
IN APARTMENT

MULDER: (through door) You ok in there Scully?
(Scully in bathroom)

SCULLY: Ya I'm just washing up. (cleaning blood off her nose, she leaves bathroom, sees K freed)

SCULLY: You took his cuffs off.

MULDER: He says he's a member of the same Mutual UFO Network group that Betsy Higopian belonged to, that he was downloading files for safe keeping as Betsy had instructed him to.

SCULLY: Then why did he run?

MULDER: He thinks his life's in danger, he thinks there's a government conspiracy to suppress the information gathered in those files.

SCULLY: You think he's credible?

MULDER: Well he seems to know an awful lot about Betsy and the other women in the MUFON group you met in his house.

SCULLY: Well, that will have to be cross-checked.

MULDER: We can't.

SCULLY: Why not? (pause while Mulder and Scully look at eachother, S walks toward K, arms crossed)

SCULLY: How did they die?

KURT CRAWFORD: Brain cancer. All within the last year.

SCULLY: All of them?

KURT CRAWFORD: From the group you met there's only Penny Northern, and she's in the hospital and it doesn't look good.

SCULLY: What makes you think this is a conspiracy, that the government's involved?

KURT CRAWFORD: What makes you think it isn't. (pause) Eleven women are abducted, all with similar recollections of the experience, all developing identical brain tumors, and all refuse state or federal health care because of their insistence of the facts. And all dying within the space of a year.
(Mulder pulls Scully aside)

MULDER: I want you to listen to me.

SCULLY: About what?

MULDER: About what you won't to admit to yourself, what you're denying.

SCULLY: What am I denying?

MULDER: Where your cancer came from.

SCULLY: Mulder it doesn't matter.

MULDER: It does matter, if what you have is a result of your abduction and that abduction is something the government knows about then those are facts that should be brought to light.

SCULLY: (sharp) I don't know what happened to me. I have no clear recollection and I don't think these abductions are even abductions.

MULDER: But these women are dead.

SCULLY: No they are not. One woman isn't. There's Penny Northern.

MULDER: If you won't listen to me then I think you should go talk to her.

SCULLY: (angered) About what? What it feels like to be dying of cancer? What it's like to know that there's absolutely nothing you can do about it?

MULDER: If that's too hard for you then I think you should call an investigator. You have one remaining witness Agent Scully. I'd think you'd want to know what her story is.



SCENE 7
ALLENTOWN BETHLEHEM MEDICAL CENTER

(Penny in hospital bed, Scully enters her room)

PENNY: Dana, hello.

SCULLY: I'm..I'm sorry did someone tell you I was coming here to see you?

PENNY: No.

SCULLY: Then how did you know it was me?

PENNY: I recognized you. I told you when we met last year, I held you and comforted you in the place, after the tests.

SCULLY: I'm sorry I don't mean to be insensitive, but uh, I don't share those memories.

PENNY: It's alight.

SCULLY: I've come to ask you some questions.

PENNY: About Dr. Scanlon?

SCULLY: No. Who's Dr. Scanlon?

PENNY: He's treating the cancer. He treated Betsy too. He thinks he might have isolated the cause, and if he'd caught it earlier he might have been able to do more for her, and for me.

SCULLY: His name's Scanlon?

PENNY: Yes. (pause) What did you want to ask me?



SCENE 8

(Mulder in apartment with Kurt, Scully calls him on cell phone)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: Where are you Scully?

SCULLY: I'm at the hospital with Penny Northern. Where are you?

MULDER: I'm at Betsy Higopian's going through some of those hard files before stuff starts disappearing, and call me an early bird but I think I've found something. Now some of these women who have died, they're childless, and they've been treated for infertility at the clinic about 30 miles from here. Penny Northern and Betsy Higopian are among them.

SCULLY: Mulder that's..

MULDER: I've made some phone calls and I've tried to get some information but nobody is talking to me, so..

SCULLY: Mulder I need you to come up here.

MULDER: Why, did you find something there?

SCULLY: I need you to bring the overnight bag from the trunk of the car and I need you to call my mother and ask her to bring up some things at the hospital.

MULDER: Is there something I should know?

SCULLY: Mulder, whatever you found or whatever you might find I think that we both know that right now the truth is in me, and that's where I need to pursue it, as soon as possible.

MULDER: I will be right there.
(both hang up)



SCENE 9

(Mulder leaves apartment, gets in car, leaves. A car behind his pulls up to apartment building)
(Kurt in apartment)

KURT CRAWFORD: Agent Mulder? (pause) Agent Mulder?
(man in dark overcoat attacks Kurt with needle instrument, we see the remains of Kurt dissolve into green slime)



SCENE 10

(Scully in hospital bed, she sees white light, blurred figure, comes into focus)

DOCTOR SCANLON: Dana? I'm Dr. Scanlon. We spoke last night on the phone.

SCULLY: (waking) Ya hi, sorry sleeping.

DOCTOR SCANLON: I noticed. How's your energy level generally?

SCULLY: Oh you know. I don, I don't feel sick at all.

DOCTOR SCANLON: Your MRI's and your charts aren't here yet but I have an idea of what to expect, you probably do too from your medical training.

SCULLY: I know that the chemotherapy is going to make me sick.

DOCTOR SCANLON: And the radiation. They're both part of a high dose approach to knock your system down so we can attempt the gene therapy on P53. (pause) You're going to feel like dying.
(pause, Margaret Scully enters through door)

MARGARET SCULLY: Dana

SCULLY: Hi mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: Hi.

SCULLY: This is uh, this is Dr. Scanlon.

DOCTOR SCANLON: Hi.

MARGARET SCULLY: Hi. (pause, they shake hands) I uh, I drove. I was going to take the shuttle but it's only an hour more by car. Can you imagine?

SCULLY: Mom, I'm fine. I'm going to be fine, I'm just here for treatment

DOCTOR SCANLON: I'm gonna go. I've ordered some additional blood work and I'd like to start in this afternoon.

SCULLY: Thank you. (pause) Mom, I know what you're gonna say, but I don't have any experience being sick. I promise you, I feel fine, I feel..(sighs)

MARGARET SCULLY: I don't know why you didn't tell me. (angry) I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.

SCULLY: I wanted to get all the answers first.

MARGARET SCULLY: And you found them here?

SCULLY: I have found some clarity, and maybe a way to fight back.

MARGARET SCULLY: I don't wanna be kept in the dark.

SCULLY: You'll know mom.
(Margaret Scully holds Scully)

MARGARET SCULLY: You have always been the strong one, but you are my only daughter now.

SCULLY: I know mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: (crying) Oh, Dana.



SCENE 11

(Scully undergoing treatment, she is lying flat with plastic mask over her face, a large machine is rotating around her head)

SCULLY:
In med school I learned that cancer arrives in the body unannounced, a dark stranger who takes up residence, turning it's new home against itself. This is the evil of cancer, that is starts as an invader, but soon becomes one with the invaded, forcing you to destroy it, but only at the risk of destroying yourself. It is science's demon possession. My treatment, science has attempted exorcism. Mulder I hope that in these terms you might know it and know me, and accept this stranger that so many recognize but cannot ever completely cast out. And if the darkness should have swallowed me as you read this, you must never think there was the possibility of some secret intervention, something you might have done. And though we've traveled far together, this last distance must necessarily be traveled alone.



SCENE 12
CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE
LEHIGH FURNACE, PA

(Mulder is breaking into building, types on computer, sees Kurt breaking through a window, M follows)

MULDER: I've got a gun pointed at your head. Turn around very slowly. Kurt Crawford, we seem to be traveling in the same circles these days.

KURT CRAWFORD: You can put the gun away.

MULDER: You disappeared with those files from Betsy Hagopian's, I called you at least half a dozen times. I got to thinking you're a liar, now tell me I'm wrong.

KURT CRAWFORD: I'm looking for the same that thing you are. I've been trying to hack my way into that system but I can't seem to make it past the password protect.

MULDER: You think you can get access from here?

KURT CRAWFORD: I need to find that password.
(Mulder motions to Kurt, he sits at computer, Mulder picks up snowglobe with the word 'Vegreville' on it)

MULDER: Vegreville.
(Kurt types it)

KURT CRAWFORD: We're in. (both smile)



SCENE 13

(Scully's face with spinning metal object approaching quickly)

PENNY: Dana, it's ok, it's ok Dana, you'll be ok.

(Scully wakes up, clasps Penny's hand)

SCULLY: (sleepily) Where am I?

PENNY: You're in you're own bed now Dana, you're safe.

SCULLY: I feel nauseous.

PENNY: It's the chemo. The chemo's always the worst.

SCULLY: I had a bad dream. Some..someone was doing something bad to me. You were there. I heard your voice.

PENNY: They let me come to you during the procedures. I don't know why, human compassion is not something that they have.

SCULLY: I'm sorry Penny. I ca..can't hear this right now.

PENNY: You've got to try to make sense of it Dana. It will help you through the pain to understand why this is..this is happening to you.



SCENE 14

(Mulder in Skinner's office)

MULDER: I need you to set up a meeting for me.

SKINNER: (to aid) Hold up my calls.

SKINNER: Where's Agent Scully?

MULDER: She's at a hospital in Allentown beginning treatment.

SKINNER: What happened to your investigative avenues?

MULDER: They've taken a turn. A pretty big U-turn by the looks of it. (pulls out disk) This is a file directory from a federally operated fertility clinic. Agent Scully's name is on this file, although I'm pretty sure, pretty damn sure she's never undergone treatment for infertility.

SKINNER: What's in the file?

MULDER: I don't know. It's just a directory for a mainframe housed in the Lumbard Research Facility.

SKINNER: So you want to set a meeting, with whom?

MULDER: Cigarette man. (pause) I have no doubt in my mind he's behind this.

SKINNER: You've come to me before like this Mulder.

MULDER: Ya well this is different, this is different, I'm willing to deal now.

SKINNER: Find another way.

MULDER: No, no I need that meeting.

SKINNER: You deal with this man, you offer him anything and he will own you forever.

MULDER: (heated) He knows what they did to Agent Scully. He may very well know how to save her.

SKINNER: (sharp) If he knows, you can know too but you can't ask the truth of a man who trades in lies.
I won't let you.

MULDER: We are talking about Agent Scully's life.

SKINNER: Find another way.



SCENE 15

(Mulder with Lone Gunman)

FROHIKE: The Lumbard system is a dedicated mainframe. Impossible to hack, so they say.

MULDER: How'd you guys get in?

BYERS: A modified clipper chip we cannibalized from a government surplus army field encoder.

FROHIKE: Bought it back from the Chinese.

LANGLY: But for all the work it took to get it, what we got on Agent Scully's file..I don't know how much help it's gonna be.

MULDER: What do you mean?

BYERS: It's a gene code we've seen before, detected in Scully's blood after her abduction.

MULDER: Does it tell us anything at all?

BYERS: Normal DNA is inactive in it's utical form. When it's unwound or branched like this one that's when it's active, when it can mutate.

LANGLY: It's probably what made her sick.

MULDER: Why store something like this and why keep it a secret?

BYERS: Scientists get funky about having their research poached.

LANGLY: Someone might be trying to find a cause.

MULDER: Or a cure.

FROHIKE: Theoretically.

MULDER: You guys ever been to the Lumbard Research Facility? (pause) Well pick out something black and sexy and prepare to do some funky poaching.



SCENE 16

(Skinner in darkened Mulder and Scully office, CSM sitting in chair, smoking cigarette)

CANCER MAN: It's funny, I always thought of you as Fox Mulder's patron. You'd think under your eges that he wouldn't be consigned to a corner of the basement.

SKINNER: At least he doesn't take an elevator up to get to work.

CANCER MAN: You think I'm the devil Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: I'm not here to talk about what I think about you.

CANCER MAN: Then why are you here? Is Mulder's partner under illness? (pause) Is it terminal, the cancer?

SKINNER: You tell me.

CANCER MAN: Modern medicine today, I hear they can perform miracles. (pause)

SKINNER: I need a miracle.

CANCER MAN: Well, you think a lot more of me than you let on Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: What would it take?

CANCER MAN: For Agent Scully's life? What would you offer?

SKINNER: (sharp) What'll it take?

CANCER MAN: Well, I'll have to get back to you on that. (leaving) Oh Mr. Skinner, which way is the elevator?



SCENE 17

(Frohike and Langly breaking into storm drain, Mulder and Byers in car near building)

BYERS: We'll double back in 50 seconds. (pause, speaking through communications device) Frohike, where are you guys?

FROHIKE: We're in the K section in a storm drain where the communication system links up to public power. Standby. Two minutes for a system check.

MULDER: We gots to go. (Byers and Mulder get out of car)

BYERS: (to Langly and Frohike) We're in motion.

FROHIKE: They're in.

LANGLY: Security cameras offline, patching in now.

FROHIKE: Smile Byers you're on candid camera.

LANGLY: Exterior security has been breached.
(Byers and Mulder inside, reach locked door)

BYERS: Langly are you reading this?

LANGLY: Redundant systems, triple shut bypass this is going to be a toughy.

MULDER: You guys couldn't spring for 2 of these? (pulls mic off Byers's ear) Langly what the hell is going on?

LANGLY: Mulder. This is going to take a moment.
(Mulder sees signs of doctors through window, Dr. Scanlon's is among them)

MULDER: Boys we have a problem. The doctor that's treating Scully's cancer's on staff here.

LANGLY: More mysteries await. Bypass is complete.

MULDER: (to Byers) Look I need someone to get to Scully to get her to stop treatment. Right now you're the only one who can do that.



SCENE 18

(Scully in hospital bed, writing in journal)

SCULLY: I have not written to you in the last 24 hours because the treatment has weakened my spirit as well as my body. Mulder, it's difficult to describe to you the fear of facing and enemy which I can neither conquer nor escape. Penny Northern has taken a downturn. I now look at her with a respect that can only come from one who is about to walk the same dark path. Seeing her I can't help but see myself in a month or a year. I pray that I have her courage to face this journey. Mulder, I feel you close though I know you are now pursuing your own path. For that I am grateful, more than I could ever express. I need to know you're out there if I am ever to see through this.



SCENE 19

(Mulder in hallway)

MULDER: Langly where the hell am I going?

LANGLY: Loosing you on the video feed Mulder. Mulder? Do anything Frohike?

FROHIKE: Nada I didn't touch a thing.

MULDER: Langly can you hear me? (static) Langley I can't hear you. (Mulder in front of a door) Open the door. Open the damn door!
(Door opens, Mulder sees multiple individuals identical to Kurt Crawford)

HYBRID: Agent Mulder, come in.

MULDER: You're hybrids.

HYBRID: Please come in so that we might explain.
(M looks around, sees multiple growing tanks with hybrids inside)

MULDER: You've been using me.

HYBRID: Not at all. You're arrival was only coincident with the execution of our objective.

MULDER: What objective?

HYBRID: Subvert the project. The project that created us.

MULDER: (rubs condensation off on of the tanks) I've seen this boy before. These boys were you.

HYBRID: We're among the end results.

MULDER: And you want to destroy them?

HYBRID: No. What we want is the same thing that you want.
(Hybrid and Mulder in vault with many metal compartments)

MULDER: What are these?

HYBRID: Human ova. (pause)

MULDER: Taken from whom?
(they see a drawer with Scully's name on it)

MULDER: (whispered) What? (opens drawer to reveal vials)

HYBRID: During her abduction, high application radiation procedure which caused superovulation.

MULDER: Why?

HYBRID: For fertilization. They constitute one half of the necessary raw materials.

MULDER: For genetic hybridization, or reproduction. These women, these women are your birth mothers.

HYBRID: Barren now, from the same procedure that caused their cancer. And now they're left to die, their conditions hastened by the men running this project.

MULDER: You're trying to save them.

HYBRID: They're our mothers.
(Mulder leaves with vial)



SCENE 20

(Mulder walking down hallway)

LANGLY: (static) Mulder are you there?

MULDER: Langly I can't hear you.

LANGLY: We've got a security breach in section J14.

MULDER: You sure it's not Byers?

LANGLY: Nope I've got Byers right here on the screen.
(security men running down hall, Byers sees them)

MULDER: Langley help me out here, I don't know where I'm going.

LANGLY: You're in the bioquarenteen wing leading to an exit. At the end of the hall you'll access a door to a biosecure room. Working on the locks now.

MULDER: 'K Langly, Frohike I'm here open the door.

FROHIKE: The doors work on redundant systems, we're working fast.
(man approaches from opposite end of hall, shoots gun in Mulder's direction)

MULDER: Work faster. Langly open the door now! (Multiple shots) Get me outta here! Get me outta here now!

LANGLY: Almost there...go!



SCENE 21
ALLENTOWN BETHLEHEM MEDICAL CENTER
9:47PM

(Mulder checking Scully's room, she's not there, he sees her journal and reads the most recent entry beginning with 'Mulder, I feel you close')

MULDER: Nurse, nurse! Dana Scully is supposed to be in her room, where is she?

NURSE: She's not there?

MULDER: No what happened to her?

NURSE: I don't know.

MULDER: Well who the hell does know?

BYERS: Mulder.

MULDER: What happened to Scully?

BYERS: I got to her.

MULDER: Where is she now?
(Byers opens door to reveal Scully at by Penny's bedside, Scully and Mulder look at each other, Scully turns back to Penny)

PENNY: Dr. Scanlon isn't coming back?

SCULLY: No, I don't think so Penny.

PENNY: Dana, I want you to get well. You've been such a comfort. You've got to be the one. You can't give up hope.

SCULLY: I haven't. I won't
(Mulder closes the door leaving Penny and Scully alone)



SCENE 22
5:05AM

(Nurse running into Penny's room, Scully exits, Mulder on bench)

MULDER: (stands) She gone?
(Scully nods yes, she is upset)

MULDER: I'm sorry. I know what she meant to you. (pause) When I came to find you, you weren't in your room I got scared that something had happened..and I read some of what you wrote.
(S sighs, walks closer to Mulder)

SCULLY: I didn't want you to read that. I had decided to throw it out. I decided tonight that um..that I'm not going to let this thing beat me. I came into this hospital able to work, and that's how I'm leaving.(M nods)

MULDER: Byers tell you about Dr. Scanlon?

SCULLY: Yes.

MULDER: He may very well have killed those women.

SCULLY: That will have to be proven, if we find him.

MULDER: When we find him. Scully something was done to you, something that you're just beginning to remember. You can't quite figure it out but it can be explained and it will be explained. And no matter what you think as a scientist or a doctor, there is a way, and you will find it, to save yourself.

SCULLY: Mulder I can't kid myself. People live with cancer. They carry on, and so will I. You know I've got things to finish, to prove to myself, to my family, but for my own reasons.
(they smile, then hug)

MULDER: Come on back. (pause) The truth will save you Scully. I think it'll save both of us.
(Mulder kisses Scully on the forehead, Scully exits down the hall, Mulder takes vial of Scully's ova out of pocket and looks at it thoughtfully)



SCENE 23

(Skinner's office)
(phone rings)

SKINNER: Skinner.

MULDER: I was leaving you a voice mail. It's 5:30 what are y..

SKINNER: I'm working. How can I help you?

MULDER: I want you to know that Scully's doing ok. She says she's coming back to work actually.

SKINNER: Good, that's good to hear.

MULDER: I was calling to thank you for your advice about your chainsmoking friend. I think you were right. We have to know what he knows, we just have to find another way.

SKINNER: There's always another way.
(they hang up, we see Cancer Man sitting in front of Skinner's desk)

CANCER MAN: Yes I believe there is, if you're willing to pay the price.
(CSM puts his cigarette in coffee cup, leaves)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
BEN ZION CEMETERY BROOKLYN NEW YORK - DAY

(In a Jewish cemetery, a funeral is taking place. A rabbi is reading. Leaves and wind rustling around the head stones as the camera zooms closer to the grave site. People dressed in black are gathered, men with beards and sideburn ringlets, women with veiled hats... We see Jacob Weiss and his daughter, Arial, looking down at the casket in the ground. She is startled when a clump of dirt is thrown on it. Men are taking handfuls of dirt and throwing them in the hole to cover the grave. We see Arial again, having flashes of what must have happened to Issac Luria.)



SCENE 2
GROCERY STORE

(Scenes of Isaac in a grocery store, a hard kick heard, Isaac falls to the ground, clutching his stomach. Three teenagers are standing above him.)

TONY OLIVER: Get it. It's in the back.

(One of the teens steps over Isaac and walks to the back of the store.)

TONY OLIVER: Come on!

(Another teen goes with the first to the back of the store. Isaac has blood on his face. He is still on the ground looking up at Tony. Tony raises a gun and cocks it.)



SCENE 3
CEMETERY

(Scene flashes back to Arial, who inhales quickly and she realizes she's back at the funeral. Her father leans to her ear.)

JACOB WEISS: It's all right. You don't have to do this.

ARIAL: No. I want to.

(She walks forward and takes a clump of dirt. She holds it up and looks at it as she thinks again of the store.)



SCENE 4
GROCERY STORE

(Isaac looks up at Tony.)

ISAAC: Why are you doing this?

(Tony Oliver only answers with two shots.)



SCENE 5
CEMETERY

(Arial back at the funeral still holding the clump of dirt. Jacob puts his hand on her wrist.)

JACOB WEISS: Come.

(The dirt falls from her hand into the grave. They walk away as she looks back one more time. There's a distant rumbling in the sky.)



SCENE 6
CEMETERY - NIGHT

(A full fledged thunderstorm is raging in the cemetery. Lightening flashes. Hands are in the mud forming a head on the ground. A figure in black is forming a body out of mud on the ground. Lightening flashes again. The person in black stands and walks away. The figure's chest starts going up and down with breath. It's alive...)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 7
X-FILES OFFICE

(We see a close up of a driver's license. Isaac Luria's. Scully talks as we see Scully and Mulder standing, looking at the license.)

SCULLY: His name was Isaac Luria. He lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, home to a sect of Hasidic Jews who have lived there since the late 19th Century.

MULDER: It's an area also known for its history of racial tensions and hate crimes. Rosenbaum, Tawana Brawley..

SCULLY: And now Isaac Luria. He was murdered two days ago in the market that he owned. Severely beaten and shot five times at point blank range. The police ruled out robbery because the only thing that was missing was a video tape from the surveillance camera. The police found it early this morning.

(She takes the tape and puts it into the VCR.)

MULDER: Where?

SCULLY: In the VCR of a 16 year old named Tony Oliver. That's him on the upper right.

(We see the surveillance camera from the store. The two teens hold Isaac as Tony Oliver punches him in the face.)

MULDER: Has he been arrested?

SCULLY: No, because he's dead. Apparently he was watching this tape when he was strangled to death.

MULDER: Very Old Testament.

SCULLY: Yeah. But with a new twist. The Brooklyn Homicide detectives contacted the FBI Civil Rights branch with an interesting set of fingerprints that they pulled off of the boy's body.

MULDER: Interesting how?

SCULLY: They belonged to Isaac Luria.

MULDER: Risen from the grave to avenge his own death?

SCULLY: Some people might assume that. It's probably what someone would like us to think.

MULDER: But you have your own idea.

SCULLY: I think this is a crime of hatred like the crime that spawned it. A hatred that goes back 4000 years but masquerading as something else here. A callow attempt at murderous retribution disguised as spectral justice.

MULDER: A resurrection hoax.

SCULLY: And not a very good one.

MULDER: Yes, spectral figures are not often known to leave fingerprints. Casper never did.

SCULLY: Somehow the killer got a hold of Isaac Luria's fingerprints and we have been asked to prove how.



SCENE 8
WEISS RESIDENCE WILLIAMSBURG, NEW YORK

(There's a knock on a door. Then we see the wood door of the Weiss'. Jacob answers it. He just looks at Scully and Mulder.)

SCULLY: Excuse me, sir. We're with the FBI. We'd like to speak with Arial Luria.

(No answer.)

SCULLY: Is she home?

JACOB WEISS: I'm Arial's father, Jacob Weiss. Why are you bothering her again? She's already spoken with the police.

(Arial appears from behind her father.)

ARIAL: It's all right. Let them in. (She opens the door wider.) Please, come in.

(Scully and Mulder enter. There are a bunch of people, men, in the room.)

ARIAL: We can talk in the study.



SCENE 9
STUDY

(We see a letter, Consent for Exhumation, Jacob is holding. He hands it to Arial.)

JACOB WEISS: This is why you are here? This is what you come to ask? Here, in this house of mourning?

ARIAL: What is this?

SCULLY: We would like your permission to reopen Isaac's grave.

JACOB WEISS: No! The answer's NO!

ARIAL: Why does this have to be done?

SCULLY: We're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man. His name is Tony Oliver.

(She hands Arial Tony Oliver's mug shot.)

SCULLY: He's one of three suspects in the murder of your husband. We believe it was an act of retaliation and that the other two suspects are targets.

ARIAL: He's just a boy.

JACOB WEISS: He's an animal. A monster, like the others animals that killed Isaac. Whose grave you're now asking us to desecrate so you can now protect them.

ARIAL: Papa, please.

JACOB WEISS: Where were you when Isaac needed your protection? When we called the police, they said we were paranoid, that there was nothing to worry about. They always say that when someone threatens the Jews.

MULDER: So there was a specific threat of violence?

JACOB WEISS: The threat is always there. Just this morning, this is what I found under our door.

(He hands Mulder a pamphlet. It reads "How AIDS was created by the Jew" with a caricature picture of a Jewish man with a money bag.)

JACOB WEISS: And now you come here not to help us, but to ask our help so you can impose justice to the only man who has taken justice into his own hands.

MULDER: We would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you can tell us who that man is.

JACOB WEISS: Even if I knew, why would I tell you?

SCULLY: Because this is a homicide investigation, sir, and you are required by law to assist us.

JACOB WEISS: I know all about your laws.

SCULLY: Sir, I'm afraid that even without your consent, we can get a court order to exhume Isaac's grave.

ARIAL: Do what you feel is necessary. But leave us alone. Let us mourn in peace.



SCENE 10
OUTSIDE

(Mulder and Scully exit the house, rush through the rain to their car. )



SCENE 11
CAR

(Mulder, of course, is in the driver's seat. They put on their seat belts.)

SCULLY: I'm afraid he knows who killed Tony Oliver, Mulder, and he doesn't want us disturbing Isaac Luria's grave because he knows what we'll find.

MULDER: Maybe...

(He pulls the pamphlet out of the breast pocket of his coat.)

MULDER: ...but it's hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that. (He hands it to Scully.) Anybody delivering justice to a people who have known that kind of persecution and hatred, why wouldn't they protect him?

SCULLY: Justice or revenge?

MULDER: I'm not saying those kids deserve full prosecution under the law, but the hate mongering goes both ways.

SCULLY: Yes, but the right to free expression doesn't extend to murder.

MULDER: I bet whoever published that knows the boys who murdered Isaac Luria. They might have a guess at who killed Tony Oliver, too.

(He starts the car.)



SCENE 12
STREET

(Their car pulls away. There is a wet, muddy man standing by a construction area watching them drive off. We don't see much more of him than a leg, arm, and hand with writing on it. Sorry, but I can't tell what's written on it. It will be explained, sort of, later. Arial is looking out of the upstairs window.)



SCENE 13
BJUNES COPY SHOP 1525 AVENUE J

(We hear his voice before we see the close up of Bjunes.)

BJUNES: Oh, sure I knew him. He's the man who owned the store right across the street. But I'd be lying to say I was surprised it happened.

(Mulder and Scully stand on the other side of the counter from him.)

MULDER: Why is that?

BJUNES: You know how they are. Always trying to find ways to make money off of honest folks who work for a living.

(Scully is a little shocked.)

MULDER: Can you think of anyone who held a grudge?

BJUNES: I can't think of anyone who didn't.

MULDER: Did you?

BJUNES: Why? I'm not under any kind of suspicion, am I?

(He laughs uncomfortably.)

SCULLY: No, not directly, but these young men are and we have reason to believe that you know them. (She gives him two mug shots to look at.) Their names are Derrick Banks and Clinton Maguire.

BJUNES: Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not familiar with them.

(He couldn't be more pleasant.)

MULDER: Are you familiar with this? (He shows Bjunes the pamphlet.) We think those kids are familiar with it, enough to incite them to the murder of Isaac Luria.

(Bjunes' smile fades. He glares at Mulder.)

BJUNES: You work for them too, don't you?

MULDER: Who?

BJUNES: You know who, you look like you might be one yourself.

(Mulder chuckles.)

SCULLY: We work for the FBI, Sir.

BJUNES: Who does the FBI work for?

(She smiles back at Mulder as if to say, Who is this d***head.)

BJUNES: You call me paranoid because that's exactly what they want you to do. But there's one thing you can't call me, and that's a Zionist collaborator.

SCULLY: You take a long look at these photos. It may be your last chance to save their lives.

(The scene continues on surveillance camera.)



SCENE 14
BACKROOM BJUNES COPY SHOP

(The TV and tape of Mulder and Scully is playing. )

SCULLY: One of their accomplices, a man named Tony Oliver, was found murdered this morning.

BJUNES: Why are you telling me this?

SCULLY: You haven't heard the rumors?

BJUNES: What rumors?

(One of the teenagers is in the room watching the TV.)

SCULLY: That Luria is back from the dead? That he's risen from his grave?



SCENE 15
COPY SHOP

(Back to the front of the store.)

BJUNES: What kind of Jew trick is this?

MULDER: A Jew pulled it off 2000 years ago.

(Bjunes looks at Mulder. Mulder nods.)

SCULLY: We're just relaying the evidence, sir. You can draw your own conclusions. But I'm sure you wouldn't want to be endangering these young men's lives.

MULDER: Bless you.

(They leave. Bjunes goes into the back room.)

BACK ROOM COPY SHOP (Bjunes enters the back room. He looks around.)

BJUNES: Derrick?

(No answer. )



SCENE 16
CEMETERY - NIGHT

(Two shovels dig into the dirt. Clinton and Derrick are digging up Isaac's grave.)

CLINTON: Are you sure about this?

DEREK: I heard them, man. I'm not waiting around to find out if it's true.

(There is someone watching from behind a tree, then walking up behind them. There is a car backed up to the grave. They're quite deep now. The figure stops and rests his written hand on a tombstone. The boys get to the coffin.)

CLINTON: What's wrong?

DEREK: It's nailed shut.

CLINTON: There's some tools in the trunk.

(Clinton climbs out of the grave. He opens the trunk and looks through it. The figure approaches. Clinton turns and gasps. There's a thud. Then it's louder as we're in the grave. DEREK is whacking the shovel on the coffin. It splinters. He bashes the shovel in again. It's giving way. He kneels down and pulls at the boards by hand.)

DEREK: I got it open, man. Get down here.

(He busts open the grave. His hand flies to his face. It reeks. )

DEREK: Hey Clinton, check it out.

(Isaac is in the grave.)

DEREK: Hey, Clinton, check it out. Clinton? Don't mess with me.

(Having gotten no answer, he raises to him feet and looks around. He is surprised by something he sees.)

DEREK: Oh... oh, man.

(Clinton is face down in the dirt pile.)



SCENE 17
LATER

(Cops and Mulder and Scully are there. Scully puts on her latex gloves and raises the body bag flap from Clinton's face. She rubs the choke marks on his neck. She puts the body bag back. The coroner's office workers take the body away. She walks up to Mulder, crouched by the grave, putting on latex gloves.)

SCULLY: Ligature marks on the victim's neck are consistent with the vigilante's MO. Forensics come up with anything?

MULDER: Yeah, second set of footprints, but the mud is too soft to take a mold.

SCULLY: I guess Clinton was here with Derek Banks.

MULDER: Looking for what?

(They get into the grave. )

SCULLY: Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution for Tony Oliver's death.

MULDER: That seems kind of redundant, doesn't it? Messing up somebody you already killed? I think they came here because they were afraid.

(He crouches to the coffin.)

SCULLY: Afraid?

(Mulder lifts a sheet of plastic. They both cover their noses. )

MULDER: Afraid that man they hated enough to kill wasn't really dead.

(We see the corpse's hands.)

MULDER: Look, there goes your theory of how Isaac's fingerprints got onto the victim's body. What's that look like to you?

(There's a tattooing or something on his hand, like the figure's.)

SCULLY: The body wasn't embalmed according to custom. Maybe it's postmortem lividity or some sort of tattooing. It's hard to tell with this stage of decomposition.

(Mulder reaches down by the corpse's head.)

MULDER: What's this? (He pulls out a book.) A little bedtime reading?

(He's going to open the book when it bursts into flames.)

MULDER: FIRE!



SCENE 18
STREET

(Bjunes walks along the street and comes to his storefront. He unlocks the gate and door and enters.)



SCENE 19
COPY SHOP

(Bjunes enters and locks the door behind him. We hear Derek.)

DEREK: You owe me for two weeks.

(Bjunes turns and sees Derek.)

BJUNES: Where have you been? Is it true? You and your friends killed the Jew?

DEREK: Just give me my money.

BJUNES: What the hell were you thinking? I never told you to kill anyone. I never said to do that.

DEREK: No? What did you expect me to do? Hide back here like you? Licking envelopes in the dark, calling them names?

BJUNES: We're working to spread the truth.

DEREK: The truth? Man, you're as pathetic as they are.

BJUNES: I am exposing their lies.

DEREK: Those are just words. You think they killed my friends with just words?

(He emerges from the shadow. Bjunes is surprised.)

DEREK: That's right. Clinton's dead, too. Now I'd like my money.



SCENE 20
JUDAIC LIBRARY

(Close up of a magnifying glass on the burnt symbol on the burnt book from Isaac's grave.)

KENNETH UNGAR: It's called the Sepher Vetzirah. The Book of Creation. The earliest known Hebrew text of man's mystical communion with the divine.

(Mulder and Scully are sitting with Kenneth Ungar, scholar with the Judaic Archives.)

SCULLY: Is it ever buried with the dead?

KENNETH UNGAR: No. In observance with the Jewish belief, the corpse is buried only in its shroud. No other worldly possession is allowed.

MULDER: Have they ever been known to spontaneously combust?

(He finds it slightly humorous.)

KENNETH UNGAR: No. It's a book on mysticism, not mysticism itself.

MULDER: Is it printed on any special paper or any special ink?

KENNETH UNGAR: No, it's just a book. Leather and paper. I suspect somebody might be trying to play a trick on you.

SCULLY: There may be a possibility that moisture leaked its way into the coffin, into the binding and pages of the book. If the ground water was contaminated with arsenic or arson gas could have created a combustible mixture.

(She shrugs.)

MULDER: Is there anything that distinguishes the particular Sepher Vetzirah from any other such books?

KENNETH UNGAR: There's a name imprinted or stamped on to the leather.

SCULLY: A name?

KENNETH UNGAR: Yes, a Hebrew name. Weiss. Jacob Weiss.

(Scully looks at Mulder. Mulder nods.)

SCULLY: Jacob Weiss.



SCENE 21
WEISS RESIDENCE

(Arial is face-to-face with Mulder and Scully.)

ARIAL: Why do you want to see him?

SCULLY: There's been another murder. Another suspect in your husband's death has been found dead last night.

ARIAL: Where was this?

MULDER: Next to your husband's grave.

ARIAL: How does this concern my father?

SCULLY: Yesterday he expressed strong feelings towards this latest victim.

ARIAL: Those were just angry words.

SCULLY: And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene. This is escalating into something else Arial. Something that has to stop.

ARIAL: My marriage to Isaac... you have to understand how much it would have meant to my father.

MULDER: What do you mean, would have meant?

ARIAL: We got our marriage license a few weeks ago, but the wedding wasn't until today.

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

ARIAL: I'd like to show you something.

(We see an elaborate ring with a steeple or building decoration in a glass domed case.)

ARIAL: It's a communal wedding ring made in Colon, a village near Prague. My father was an apprentice to the man who designed it.

SCULLY: It's beautiful.

ARIAL: Uh hum. Every woman who got married in the synagogue wore this ring as a symbol that she was a queen, her husband a king. And a home... They made a castle... not only on their wedding day, but for the rest of their lives together. But most of those lives ended in one day in the spring of 1943. 9000 Jews were massacred after digging their own graves.

SCULLY: But your father survived.

ARIAL: Because he was 10 years old. He had small fingers to make bullets at a munitions factory.

SCULLY: And through all this, he hid the ring?

ARIAL: Even after the war he hid it, even from my mother.

SCULLY: Why?

ARIAL: Because to him, it was a dead relic from a forgotten place. Until the day that I told him I was getting married, and for the first time in fifty years, he took out this ring. He said it was like his village was born again. He knew how much I loved Isaac.

SCULLY: Arial, tell us where your father is.

ARIAL: I know my father. He would never kill anyone.

SCULLY: What if you're wrong?



SCENE 22
PARK STREET SYNAGOGUE

(Men are praying in Hebrew. Mulder and Scully enter and look around.)

SCULLY: Do you see him?

(Some of the men look at Scully. Three men walk to Mulder and Scully.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry. We don't mean any disrespect.

MAN: Who are you?

(Scully takes out her badge.)

SCULLY: We're with the FBI. We're looking for Jacob Weiss.

MAN: Why?

(Mulder points. Jacob is with the men in the pews. He sees them and walks away. Mulder and Scully walk through the men after him. He's gone. They go through an open door to a dark hallway. Scully looks into another room as Mulder goes up the stairs. Scully follows him. At the top of the stairs, they take out flashlights and separate. Scully stops.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(They see a man hanging by a rope from the rafters. They go to the body. It's Derek Banks. There's a man who tiptoes past a light. Scully and Mulder both follow him with guns and flashlights drawn. A figure body slams Mulder to the ground. Scully turns and she's plummeted to the floor also. She rights herself still laying on the floor. Her gun pointed out. She shoots the rafter above the man's head.)

SCULLY: Don't move! Federal agent!

(The man stops. She gets up. She steadies the gun and flashlight on the man.)

SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?

(Mulder is still stunned on the ground, but turns over and picks himself up. )

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Put your hands in the air where I can see them. Turn around slowly.

(The figure complies. It's Jacob Weiss.)

MULDER: I got him, Scully.

(Scully walks to Jacob with handcuffs.)

SCULLY: Mr. Weiss, we're placing you under arrest.

(As Scully handcuffs him, Jacob looks past her into the shadows.)

SCULLY: Come on. Let's go.

(Scully leads Jacob away. Mulder stops and looks at where Jacob was looking. Seeing nothing, he follows. The figure with the hand tattoo is looking at the swinging corpse of Derek Banks.)



SCENE 23
TWENTY-FIRST PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

(Scully walks down the hallway looking at a file. We hear Arial.)

ARIAL: Where is he? Where's my father?

(Scully looks up and sees Arial.)

SCULLY: We've arrested him, Arial, under suspicion of murder.

ARIAL: I don't believe you. It can't be him. Did he tell you he killed this person?

SCULLY: I think that's the direction it's going. Agent Mulder is in with him now.

ARIAL: I need to see him.

SCULLY: Arial, I think you'd better get him an attorney, he's refusing legal representation.

ARIAL: I need to see him!

SCULLY: Okay. You ask Detective Barley down the hall. He'll give you a place to wait while your father is been processed.

(Arial starts off. )

SCULLY: Arial? (Arial turns to Scully.) I'm sorry.

(She doesn't answer and walks down the hallway.)



SCENE 24
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Mulder sits in a chair across the table from Jacob.)

MULDER: Who killed them, Jacob?

JACOB WEISS: Our synagogue has been vandalized 13 times in the last year. I heard a noise in the attic. I went up to see what it was and he attacked me. It was self-defense.

MULDER: Hanging a man in self defense?

JACOB WEISS: Is it any worse than what they did to Isaac?

MULDER: Is it any better? They found your book, your Sepher Vetzirah in Isaac's grave.

(Pause)

JACOB WEISS: (quietly) So?

MULDER: So, that puts you at a second crime scene.

JACOB WEISS: I'm guilty! What more do you want from me?

MULDER: The truth.

JACOB WEISS: I have given you the truth!

MULDER: There was someone else in that attic with you. Who was it?

JACOB WEISS: There was no one else.

MULDER: Then you're a liar.

JACOB WEISS: You don't know nothing about nothing and I have no more to say about this. I would like to see my daughter.

(Mulder leaves the room. )



SCENE 25
OTHER ROOM

(On the other side of the two way mirror, Scully has watched the interrogation. Mulder enters.)

SCULLY: You want to see the background check I ran? He immigrated to Israel after World War II where he joined the Irgun, Jewish military underground. He was arrested in 1959 by the British for a bombing that killed 7 civilians. He's a terrorist, Mulder. A killer.

MULDER: He's not our killer though.

SCULLY: What do you mean? He gave a confession, I just stood here and listened to him.

MULDER: I think there was a second person in that attic, Scully. Weiss knows it too and he's protecting whoever it is.

SCULLY: Well, who? His daughter?

MULDER: No. Somebody big enough and strong enough to knock me down.

SCULLY: Who do you think it was?

(Through the glass, we see Arial enter the room and hug her father.)

MULDER: Stick around, this could get interesting.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To see a man about a burning book.

(Scully turns and watches through the window.)



SCENE 26
INTERROGATION ROOM

(Arial looks at her father, still holding him.)

ARIAL: Daddy. They say you confessed. Why are you doing this?

JACOB WEISS: To protect you.

ARIAL: From what?

JACOB WEISS: I think you know. They found my book in Isaac's grave.

ARIAL: That can't be true.

JACOB WEISS: No?

(Arial looks away.)



SCENE 27
BJUNES COPY STORE

(More pamphlets are being run on the machines. This one says "How your tax dollars support Zionist Imperial something". Bjunes hears a noise. He lets it go and watches the run of pamphlets. There's a Swastika on the wall. There's another noise. He gets his gun. As he's fumbling, trying to see if it's loaded, a figure grabs him by the throat. The figure lifts him off the floor. Bjunes is choking.)



SCENE 28
JUDAICA ARCHIVES UPPER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN

(Kenneth Ungar is sitting at a table reading. We hear Mulder.)

MULDER: There's something you didn't tell me... (Kenneth looks up. ) About the contents of this Sepher Vetzirah.

KENNETH: What is it you want to know?

MULDER: I want to know about the myth of the Golem.

KENNETH UNGAR: This is a mystical text. These pages are filled with Golems and vivics and demons of every size and shape.

(Kenneth puts on his glasses.)

MULDER: It's the Golem that I'm interested in.

KENNETH UNGAR: And I'm interested in why an FBI agent would be so interested in such a thing.

(Mulder sits at the table with him.)

MULDER: That's what I was hoping you could tell me.

KENNETH UNGAR: The early Cabolists... they believed that a righteous man could actually create a living being from the Earth itself. Fashioned from mud or clay... This creature could only be brought to life by the power of the word. In practical terms... (Kenneth opens the Sepher Vetzirah) ... by the direct application of certain secret letter combinations.

MULDER: Combinations found in that book?

KENNETH UNGAR: See... (He shows a page to Mulder) ...these pages, they're basically instructions for animating the inanimate. (He turns the page.) And this... this passage here talks about inscribing a single word on the Golem itself.

MULDER: On the back of his hand?

KENNETH UNGAR: I'm impressed.

MULDER: What's the secret word?

KENNETH UNGAR: Emet. See... (He points to three symbols of the text.) Aleph, Mem, Tau... Creates the word, Emet.

MULDER: I don't speak Hebrew, I don't know what that means.

KENNETH UNGAR: Truth. Emet means truth. (Kenneth sits back down.) See, Mr. Mulder, therein lies the paradox... because the danger of the truth is contained in the word Golem itself. Which means matter without form, body without soul.

MULDER: So the Golem is an imperfect creation.

KENNETH UNGAR: Oh, kind of a monster, really. Unable to speak or feel anything but the most primitive of emotions. It runs amok. It has to be destroyed by its creator.

MULDER: Destroyed, how?

(Kenneth stands again and flips through the book to find the page.)

KENNETH UNGAR: By erasing the first letter, Aleph. (Kenneth puts his finger over the first symbol, on the right.) Emet becomes met... which means dead. Again, Mr. Mulder... the power of letters, not just to create, but to kill.

(Mulder's cell phone rings. He answers it.)

MULDER: Yeah...

(Scully is driving.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. There's been another homicide.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Herb Bjunes. I'm on my way to the print shop right now.

MULDER: Okay, I can be there in ten minutes.

(They hang up. )



SCENE 29
COPY SHOP

(Outside there is police tape cordoning off the area. Cop cars all over.)



SCENE 30
INSIDE

(Bjunes lays on the floor. Glasses on the floor next to him. A hand holds a pamphlet that reads, "Only through blood can the Jewish scourge be cleansed". Mulder crumples it up.)

MULDER: A man with a mission. Look at all the energy he spent spewing his hatred.

(He throws it on the floor. Scully looks at a stack of papers. )

SCULLY: Well, he wasn't toiling in obscurity. This manifest lists hundreds of names, including our three murder victims.

MULDER: Well, there's no way Weiss could have killed him.

SCULLY: Yeah, I'll call the precinct and have him released.

(A voice from behind them.)

MAN: Agent Scully?

(They walk to a desk where a detective sits.)

DETECTIVE: The image is fuzzy, but I think we've got a hit. (He is playing the surveillance tape from the store. Isaac Weiss is on the tape.) There.

(He freeze frames. )

SCULLY: Oh, my God. It's Isaac Luria. He's still alive.

MULDER: I'm not so sure about that.



SCENE 31
LATER

(Bjunes body is zipped into a body bag and carried away. Scully is on her cell phone.)

SCULLY: No. That won't be necessary. (She hangs up.) Well, the coroner matched Luria's dental records.

(She walks to Mulder, who is sitting at the desk looking at the surveillance tape.)

SCULLY: It was definitely his corpse in the grave. This video tape... it must have been altered some how. Planted by whoever is staging this hoax.

MULDER: It's not a hoax, Scully. It never was.

SCULLY: But if Luria is dead, Mulder...

MULDER: This is not Luria. Not really.

SCULLY: Well, who do you think it is? Some kind of a ghost?

MULDER: A ghost is spirit without form. I believe what we're looking for and what we're seeing here, is... is form without spirit. Something called a Golem.

SCULLY: A Golem?

MULDER: It's kind of a man made monster described in Jewish folklore. It's fashioned through mud and then animated through mystical incantation.

(He walks away.)

SCULLY: Mud! (She follows him.) Mulder, what are you talking about? And... for what purpose? Exacting revenge?

MULDER: I don't think it was hate that created this, Scully. I think it was love.



SCENE 32
WEISS RESIDENCE

(Mulder and Scully are in the hallway. Mulder knocks on the door.)

MULDER: Arial, it's Agent Mulder. Open the door.

(No answer. He knocks again. Scully tries the knob.)

SCULLY: It's not locked.

(They go in.)



SCENE 33
INSIDE

(No lights are on. Scully walks into the room as Mulder turns on a lamp.)

SCULLY: Arial?

MULDER: She's not here, Scully.

SCULLY: How do you know?

(The glass dome that held the ring is empty.)

MULDER: Because it's her wedding day.



SCENE 34
SYNAGOGUE

(Candles are lit. No one is there. Jacob walks in. He walks up the aisle. He takes a candle from a stand by a pew and walks through the door to the stairs.)



SCENE 35
UPSTAIRS

(Jacob walks up the stairs with the candle.)

JACOB WEISS: Arial? I know you're here. I know you can hear me.

(He continues walking through the attic. A hand grabs his shoulder. He turns in surprise. It's Arial in a wedding dress.)

ARIAL: Leave us alone, Tata. You don't belong here.

JACOB WEISS: I'm your father.

ARIAL: Please go.

JACOB WEISS: Not without you. I'm not leaving without you.

ARIAL: I want to see him.

JACOB WEISS: He's dead. Isaac is dead.

ARIAL: No.

JACOB WEISS: The boys... they killed him. Their hate took him from you and you tried bringing him back with your love. (Arial is crying.) But what you brought back, you have to understand, Arial... It isn't him. It's an abomination. He has no place among the living.

ARIAL: He said he'd call me back, Tata. We were talking on the phone about the wedding. Isaac said he had to go. There was a customer who needed him. And that he would call me back. But when I heard the phone ring later... something told me not to pick it up. A woman's voice was on the line. I didn't hear what she was saying... I didn't have to. I knew Isaac wasn't calling me back. (Jacob is crying too.) I just wanted to say goodbye, Tata.

JACOB WEISS: I know. (They hug. ) I know...

ARIAL: I didn't think. It was just a wish. They were just... words.

(There a noise and a shadow.)

JACOB WEISS: Stay here.

ARIAL: I want to go with you.

JACOB WEISS: No.

ARIAL: Tata.

JACOB WEISS: No.

(He goes to the shadow. She stays.)



SCENE 36
OUTSIDE

(Mulder and Scully drive up. They get out and go into the building. )



SCENE 37
INSIDE

(They walk in with guns. They see Jacob hanging from a rope, still alive. Scully goes and holds on to his legs and lifts.)

MULDER: Hang on, I've got a knife.

(He begins to cut the rope. The Golem is seen in shadow against the wall. Mulder hurries. The rope is cut and they set Jacob on the floor and loosen the rope from around his neck.)

SCULLY: His pulse is thready.

MULDER: Will he be all right?

SCULLY: If we get him to a hospital. (Mulder stands.) Where are you going?

MULDER: To find Arial.

(Scully continues working on Jacob. Mulder goes up the stairs with his gun and flashlight. He looks around. He sees Arial sitting on the floor, crying. )

MULDER: Arial?

(He puts his gun in his holster and goes to her. )

MULDER: We found your father. He's alive. He's going to be okay. I know about Isaac. Where is he?

ARIAL: I don't know.

MULDER: All right. Come on. We gotta get outta here.

ARIAL: No.

MULDER: Come on, Arial.

(Mulder lifts her to her feet.)

ARIAL: No... (They hear a noise and turn. The Golem is standing there.) Isaac?

(Arial goes to him. Mulder pulls her back and behind him. He pulls his gun.)

MULDER: Stop or I'll fire.

ARIAL: No!

(She pulls on his arm. The figure keeps walking toward them. Mulder shoots twice.)

ARIAL: No! Stop...



SCENE 38
DOWNSTAIRS

(Police are there. Scully is still with Jacob. They hear gunfire. )



SCENE 39
UPSTAIRS

(Mulder continues firing as the Golem gets closer. The Golem lashes out at Mulder and Mulder is flung to the floor. The Golem is choking Mulder. )

ARIAL: Isaac!

(She has the ring in her hand. The Golem stops choking Mulder and looks at her. He goes to Arial. As he gets closer and out of the shadow, she sees his face and cries out. He takes the ring and holds it at the end of her ring finger.)

ARIAL: (Hebrew) I am to my beloved... as my beloved is to me.

(He puts the ring on her finger. She smiles to him. They curtsy. She kisses his hand tattoo and then erases the Aleph symbol.)

ARIAL: I loved you.

(They look at each other as she cries and his face deteriorates, turning back to mud. Scully comes.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(She goes to him. He's still laying on the ground catching his breath.)

SCULLY: Are you okay? I heard shots fired. (She helps him up. ) What happened?

(He can't talk. They look over at Arial. She's kneeling over Isaac's body, which has slumped to the floor. She is caressing his shoulder and arm.)

SCULLY: What is she doing?

MULDER: Saying goodbye.

(He had turned to dirt. She picks up a handful and lets it spray over the body as she continues to pray and caress him.)

(A translation of the prayer was kindly provided by Shlomi Catz:)

"Itgadal ve-itkadash shemei raba (will be greated and hollied his big name)
Be-alma di-vra chi-r'utei (in a world that [he] created as his wish)
Ve-yamlich malchutei (and "kinging" his kingdom)

[THE END]


In Memory of Lillian Katz.


                                              UNREQUITED



SCENE 1
U.S CAPITOL MALL NEAR THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL,
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(General Block is addressing a large crowd of people. Many in the crowd are waving flags.)

GEN. BLOCH: That many of you here tonight came home not to a hero's welcome but to the hostility of the American people is a shameful fact of history. (cheers) One that I will never understand or forgive. (cheers) But it also underscores our sacred duty, not just today but forever, to honor those who served with honor and to remember those who fell, men and women whose ultimate sacrifice must never be forgotten. (cheers) There is probably no audience that understands better that our freedom is not free ...

(Skinner sits on stage near General Bloch and talks to agents out in the crowd by radio. Parts of General Bloch's speech are heard among their conversations.)

SKINNER: All right, you're my eyes out there. Talk to me. Positions report.

GEN. BLOCH: We owe that freedom to the selfless sacrifice of those ...

AGENT HILL: Sector three clear.

SCULLY: No sign of him in four.

SKINNER: Sector six, report. Mulder?

GEN. BLOCH: ... it is our duty to remember them ...

MULDER: He's here. I feel him.

SKINNER: Then where is he?

GEN. BLOCH: ... This country was born on the backs of people willing to fight for their freedom ...

(Scully sees a man in soldier's fatigues walking forward in the crowd.)

SCULLY: Hold on. I think I have him in section four.

SKINNER: Can you confirm that, Scully?

GEN. BLOCH: ... and for that, I think it would be an investment that they would be proud of today ...

(Scully looks at a photo of a man with long hair. The man she's watching has short hair but is clearly the same person.)

SCULLY: Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three.

SKINNER: Positions hold. Three and four, do you have eye contact?

GEN. BLOCH: ... There is a statue of a solider and the plaque on that statue reads "not for themselves but for their country" ...

(Hill also sees the man moving forward.)

AGENT HILL: I have him in three. He's coming to you, Scully.

MULDER: Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.

GEN. BLOCH: ... That attitude has perservered as the spirit of American soldiers, and it is in this spirit that we honor our contrymen ...

(Scully is following the man, but he stops and looks at her. He then continues forward.)

SCULLY: Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth.

AGENT HILL: Copy that. I'm cutting him off.

SKINNER: Talk to me, people. Does anybody have him? What's happening, Scully?

GEN. BLOCH: ... This memorial is a place where we can come and thank those men and women who died not for themselves but for their country ...

(Scully is moving closer to him.)

SCULLY: I'm closing on him.

SKINNER: Do you have him in three?

AGENT HILL: Negative.

GEN. BLOCH: ... I'm always struck by something as I walk this mall. The Vietnam Memorial ...

SKINNER: Scully? Scully?

(Scully no longer sees him.)

SCULLY: I lost him. You got him, three?

AGENT HILL: I don't see him, Scully?

GEN. BLOCH: ... always someone standing at it, always someone running their fingers across the names ...

SKINNER: What's happening, Agent Scully?

(Scully and Hill have come together.)

AGENT HILL: I can't see him anywhere.

SCULLY: He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder?

GEN. BLOCH: ... There's a tremendous amount of emotion in that simple act.

(Mulder is at the front between the General and the crowd.)

MULDER: Not yet. (he sees the man in the crowd) I got him. (he keeps his eyes on the same place but now doesn't see him) I lost him.

(Skinner sees the man approaching the speakers' platform.)

SKINNER: Pick him up, Mulder. He's right in front of you.

(Mulder glimpses the man drawing a gun.)

MULDER: (drawing his weapon) He's got a gun!

(Skinner lunges for General Bloch, pushing him back from the speaker's stand. People in the crowd duck.)

SKINNER: General, get off the stage!

(Mulder's image of the man fades out.)

MULDER: I can't see him. I can't see him.

(Mulder stands at the front of the crowd with his weapon aimed straight ahead.)

SCENE 2
FORT EVANSTON, MARYLAND
TWELVE HOURS EARLIER

(A military helicopter lands in a parking lot. General MacDougal emerges.)

SOLDIER 1: Morning, Sir!

(The general walks across the lot and gets into a limousine.)

SOLIDER 2: All right. Let's go!

(The helicopter lifts off as the limo starts to move. The limo exits the base. General MacDougal opens his briefcase and removes a folder. The divider between him and the driver goes up and the door locks. MacDougal assumes that the driver is responsible. He sees a King of Hearts in front of him and picks it up. On the back is a drawing of a skull with a pair of bloody sabers crossed beneath it. He looks up and suddenly sees a man - the same man seen in the teaser - sitting on the seat across from him.)

GEN. MACDOUGAL: Who the hell are you? How did you get in here? (the man aims a gun at him) What the hell are you ...

(The driver, Private First Class Burkholder, hears a gunshot. He quickly pulls the car over to the side of the road and gets out.)

PFC BURKHOLDER: Lieutenant General, Sir!

(He opens the back door of the limo. He sees General MacDougal dead with a bullet hole in his forehead. The card is lying on his chest. He sees no one else in the limo.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS, NOVEMBER 12, 7:18 AM

(Skinner is conducting a briefing with several agents. General Bloch is also in the room.)

SKINNER: Lieutenant General Peter MacDougal was shot dead at extreme close range at 0600 this morning. FBI Forensics reports the wound was not self-inflicted. The murder weapon has not been recovered. The general's driver, Private First Class Gus Burkholder, is currently being held on suspicion of murder.

AGENT HILL: (looking through some papers) Well, it says here NAA tests confirm the private did not do the shooting.

SKINNER: There is suspicion of an accomplice, based on the one piece of evidence found at the crime scene, a so-called "death card" used by soldiers in Vietnam to mark their kills (he holds up the card) and by Private Burkholder's possible ties to a radical paramilitary group called The Right Hand, whose stated aim is violent revolution. After speaking with General Bloch (Mulder and Scully enter) he believes we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this, a unique situation that can result in the very public loss of lives. Dozens of high-ranking military officials are in Washington today for rededication of the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial. Unless we can determine a clear motive, we will consider any one of them to be a target.

MULDER: What if Private Burkholder's telling the truth, that he's innocent?

SKINNER: Until we can find another suspect, the FBI will pursue The Right Hand and their leader, an ex-marine named Denny Markham, in a preemptive strategy to put a stop to any other plans that he might have made. Now you all have Markham's file in front of you. For obvious reasons, our strategy includes keeping this from the media. You'll be working in teams of two. If you encounter any resistance, do not engage - surveil and call for backup. Agent Chandler has your assignments and your field warrants. We have less than 12 hours to prevent any further execution or loss of life. Understood?

(The meeting breaks up. General Bloch shakes Skinner's hand and leaves.)

AGENT CHANDLER: All right, Beckwith and Fontana, you're going to Virginia Beach. Jackson and Miller, you're going to Alexandria.

(Scully and Mulder approach Skinner.)

SCULLY: Was that for the benefit of the general, or have you been able to develop a real strategy?

SKINNER: Right now, I'm flying by the seat of my pants.

MULDER: You mean there's no procedure outlined for an invisible assasin?

SKINNER: (to Scully) Did you talk to Private Burkholder?

SCULLY: I interviewed him and convinced him to take a polygraph test.

SKINNER: And?

MULDER: He passed.

SCULLY: The nature of his claims would suggest a false positive. The tester admitted that the results are hightly interpretive.

SKINNER: You heard his story, Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah. I found his story compelling, personally, but then again I believe the Warren Commission.

SKINNER: Well, if I have to devise a strategy around that story, then there is no strategy. Somebody killed the general, which means somebody is not telling the truth.

SCULLY: The man who heads The Right Hand - Markham. Do you have a warrant for him?

SKINNER: Yes, why?

SCULLY: Let Mulder and I serve it.

(Mulder nods. Skinner eyes them.)

SKINNER: One misstep ... Markham smells a shakedown, he's gonna disappear and find another way to push the button. And I've already seen more dead soldiers than I ever want to see.

(He hands them the warrant and they leave.)



SCENE 4
DEMETER, VIRGINIA, 8:48 AM

(Mulder and Scully drive down a dirt road past a sign with the outline of a hand. They come to a gate with a speaker box. Some distance from the gate are a number of trailers. Mulder pushes the button on the speaker box. There is no immediate response, so Mulder presses it again.)

MULDER: Mr. Markham?

MARKHAM: (on speaker) Who is it?

SCULLY: Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.

MARKHAM: What do you want?

(Scully has been looking around. Her eyes pan across the woods on the far side of a road and catch a fleeting glimpse of a man standing there. When she looks again, there's no one there. She appears to think nothing of it.)

MULDER: It's extremely urgent that we talk to you right now, sir.

SCULLY: Mr. Markham?

MARKHAM: Gate's unlocked.

(They open the gate and approach the compound. Three Rottweilers jump out of the back of a station wagon and run toward them, barking. Mulder and Scully run back to the gate, barely getting the door closed before the dogs reach them. Mulder and Scully stand there, annoyed, as the dogs continue to bark. Markham comes out of the trailer and whistles, and the dogs calm down. He walks to the gate.)

MARKHAM: Now, you wanted to see me about ...?

SCULLY: The murder of General Peter MacDougal.

MARKHAM: Am I under suspicion?

SCULLY: No, but your group is. And Private First Class Gus Burkholder.

MARKHAM: Is that a name I should know?

SCULLY: He's on the mailing list for The Right Hand.

MARKHAM: Two thousand names on that list. I can't keep track of every one of them.

SCULLY: Well, we'd like to go over that list with you, sir.

MARKHAM: No way in hell you'll be getting that from me.

SCULLY: We already have a copy, if you'll just come with us.

MARKHAM: I'm not going anywhere.

SCULLY: Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest if you don't cooperate. (she flashes the warrant) Under the new anti-terrorism law, we can and will hold you until we get the information we want.

(The dogs bark and run away from the fence. Markham looks around and sees two groups of armed soldiers on the outside of the fence, one on each side of the compound. He looks back at Mulder and sighs.)

MULDER: There goes the neighborhood.

SCULLY: You can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir.

MARKHAM: The Right Hand believes in empowering the individual over a corrupt and corrupting federal government. We're prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary. Lives will have to be sacrificed, but that day has not yet come.

SCULLY: Would you take a polygraph, Mr. Markham?

MARKHAM: My word's good enough.

MULDER: What's your "word" on this?

(He holds up an evidence bag containing the "death card".)

MARKHAM: Where'd that come from?

MULDER: I'd like to ask you that.

MARKHAM: More men are gonna die.

(The dogs are now in cages, and soldiers are carrying weapons out of the main trailer in the compound. Scully is outside the trailer and Mulder exits it.)

SCULLY: This guy's a one-man threat to national security. I bet he's got more weapons and ammo than most third-world armies.

MULDER: He told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.

(He shows her a photo of Markham and another man. The other man has long hair and is the same man they were looking for in the teaser, and the man who shot MacDougal.)

SCULLY: Who's this?

MULDER: He says that's who killed General MacDougal.

(They are now talking to Markham next to some cars.)

MARKHAM: Name's Nathaniel Teager. 26 confirmed solo enemy kills. A veritable killing machine. Left for dead by the same government that created him.

MULDER: Left for dead?

MARKHAM: He belonged to Green Beret detachment B-11 - The squad known as the "Bloody Sabers." In 1971, the B-11 was being transported in country when their chopper was shot down. There were no survivors.

MULDER: When was this photo taken?

MARKHAM: December 1995. Just a few hours after The Right Hand liberated him from a POW camp just outside the U-Minh forest.

SCULLY: Mr. Markham, I'm sure that you're aware that in 1973 the Defense Department determined that there were no more POW's in Vietnam.

MARKHAM: Maybe that's why they tried to kidnap Sergeant Teager when we brought him home.

SCULLY: The government kidnapped a US prisoner of war?

MARKHAM: I said they tried ... had their commandoes board our plane in San Diego. When they broke into the cargo hold where we hid him, he was already gone. I never did figure out how.

SCULLY: I think I've heard enough.

(She opens the back seat door of a car and Markham, hand-cuffed, gets in. She closes the door, and she and Mulder walk away.)

SCULLY: You don't believe him, do you?

MULDER: Well, what if he's telling the truth?

SCULLY: A phantom POW left for dead comes back to avenge the injustices?

MULDER: Maybe the war ain't over, Scully.

SCULLY: Or maybe not Denny Markham's war.

MULDER: Well, given the facts of the case and Private Burkholder's polygraph test, this is the closest thing to an explanation that we've got.

SCULLY: Or it's just a clever story being proffered as a cover-up for what is actually an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.

MULDER: (nodding and smiling) Well, there is that possibility, too.

SCULLY: Let Markham take the polygraph.

MULDER: What if he passes?

SCULLY: He won't.

(Renee Davenport stands in front of the Vietnam War Memorial, holding flowers and looking at the name "Gary Davenport" on the wall. The name "Nathaniel Teager" is right below Davenport's. As she sets down the flowers, Teager approaches from behind.)

TEAGER: Mrs. Davenport. Renee Davenport?

RENEE DAVENPORT: Yes.

TEAGER: Wife of Lance Corporal Gary Davenport of the Special Forces?

RENEE DAVENPORT: Yes. I'm sorry, do I know you?

TEAGER: No, ma'am. I've come to act in his behalf for the reason that Gary remains a prisoner of war.

RENEE DAVENPORT: Gary's dead.

TEAGER: No, ma'am. May you forgive me as you forgive him, as a man and as a soldier, for restoring the honor and the memory of the B-11.

(Teager hands her a set of "dog tags" with the name "Davenport, Gary T." on them.)

RENEE DAVENPORT: (looking at them) Oh my God! Where did you get these? Who gave you these?

(She looks up but Teager has vanished.)

RENEE DAVENPORT: Hey, where are you? Tell me, where are you? Where'd you go?



SCENE 5
11:48 AM

(Mulder and Scully approach the War Memorial and flash their badges at Park Security. Workmen are erecting scaffolds for the ceremony for that night. They approach Skinner.)

SCULLY: (to Skinner) Is it true she made a positive ID from the photo?

SKINNER: From a bad fax of it. Do you have the actual photo with you?

MULDER: Yeah, and more copies to distribute.

SKINNER: We have event security checking out all vendors and workmen. We've got it out to local law enforcement, but not to the exclusion of the other suspects.

MULDER: I thought she ID'd Teager?

SKINNER: She did, but I cannot authorize or promote a strategy here that's gonna target a soldier who's officially dead.

(Scully sees Renee Davenport sitting quietly on a bench near the wall.)

MULDER: Because his name's on the wall?

SKINNER: No, because I just got off the phone with the Army Forensics Lab, where Sgt. Nathaniel Teager's remains have been stored since they were recovered from the crash site.

MULDER: They have his remains?

SCULLY: Markham may have staged this whole thing, finding somebody vulnerable like her to pass off his lies.

MULDER: Why go to all that trouble?

SCULLY: To create a decoy, to divert our attention. It seems to be working.

SKINNER: Well, this woman saw someone. I want to know who.

(Scully sits on the bench with Mrs. Markham. She shows her an enlargement made from the photo that Markham provided. Mulder stands nearby.)

RENEE DAVENPORT: Yes, that's him.

SCULLY: Are you sure?

RENEE DAVENPORT: Everything he said made it sound like Gary was still alive. (she looks down at the "dog tags") That can't be true. Can it?

MULDER: You say he just disappeared?

RENEE DAVENPORT: That's what's so strange. One minute he's standing right in front of me, and then he's gone. What if he's telling the truth? What if Gary is alive? (sobbing) I've tried to get on with my life. I've remarried. What am I supposed to tell my husband now? What am I supposed to do?

(Scully sees a small amount of blood near her eye.)

SCULLY: Oh, your eye.

RENEE DAVENPORT: What? (she puts a tissue to it and sees the blood) Oh, my God! What's happening to me?

SCULLY: I think you just burst a capillary.

RENEE DAVENPORT: Oh my God!

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (to Mrs. Davenport) Hold a tissue there.

(She rises and steps aside with Mulder.)

MULDER: Can we give Mrs. Davenport an eye exam?

SCULLY: An eye exam? For what?

MULDER: By all accounts, the man we're looking for - the man she saw - has a knack for vanishing in plain sight. Maybe there's a connection.

SCULLY: Mulder, what she has is a simple sub-conjunctival hemorrhage. It's probably brought on by her emotional state.

MULDER: And how did she reach that emotional state?

SCULLY: What about you? What are you gonna do?

MULDER: I'm gonna see if we're really chasing a dead man.

(He leaves. Scully looks back at Mrs. Davenport, who is still crying.)



SCENE 6
ARMY CENTRAL IDENTIFICATION LAB, 1:22 PM

(Mulder meets Dr. Keyser in a hallway.)

DR. KEYSER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes.

DR. KEYSER: Dr. Benjamin Keyser. (they shake hands) I think I located what you're looking for. It's a small miracle I found it, actually. The record had been partially destroyed.

(They've stepped into a lab. Keyser reaches for a small tray, labelled "Teager, Nathaniel J.", that contains three teeth. He hands it to Mulder.)

DR. KEYSER: Two bicuspids and a molar.

MULDER: This was all that was left of Teager at the crash site?

DR. KEYSER: Well, I've seen findings made with far less. And these are Sgt. Teager's teeth. I cross-checked them with his dental records.

MULDER: Is there any way to tell how the teeth were extracted?

DR. KEYSER: Well, I would assume that they were pulled. On each of these teeth, there's a pronounced scoring in the enamel. (he puts one under a microscope) See for yourself.

MULDER: (looking through the microscope) Can you tell if that was pre- or post-mortem?

DR. KEYSER: No, not really.

MULDER: Well then this is presumptive, isn't it? A finding of death based on inconclusive evidence?

DR. KEYSER: Well, actually it was noted right here, even underlined. (points at the word on the report) "Inconclusive."

MULDER: Whoever signed off on this death chose to ignore the facts, huh?

DR. KEYSER: I couldn't tell you who that was. As I said to you, these records were partially destroyed.

MULDER: Is there any other way to tell?

DR. KEYSER: Well, based on the records and the reports filed at the same time, we can make a pretty good guess.

(Mulder nods.)

(A mobile phone rings and the driver, in military uniform, answers.)

DRIVER: (to phone) Yes. Yes, just a moment. (to General Steffan, in the back seat) It's for you, sir.

GEN. STEFFAN: (to phone) Hello.

(Mulder is on his cell phone, calling from a hallway at the Army Central Identification Lab.)

MULDER: General Steffan, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. I'm calling because we have reason to believe that your life may be in danger.

GEN. STEFFAN: What are you talking about?

MULDER: That the person or persons responsible for the murder of General MacDougal this morning may have chosen to target you.

GEN. STEFFAN: Based on what information?

MULDER: Based on a death certificate that you may have put your signature on. A death certificate for Sgt. Nathaniel Teager.

GEN. STEFFAN: I don't know anything about that, but I'm on my way to the Pentagon right now.

MULDER: Listen, sir, I'm ten minutes away. I gonna have to ask you to trust my risk assessment on this and take every caution.

GEN. STEFFAN: Right.

MULDER: OK, do you know your driver, sir?

GEN. STEFFAN: Yes. He drives me all the time.

MULDER: Good. I'm gonna put two FBI agents there to escort you just as a precaution. They have my mobile phone number, OK?

(At the Pentagon, a female private is giving a tour to a group of small children. They are just outside the metal detectors.)

PRIVATE: How many of you know what a pentagon is? (the kids all shake their heads) A pentagon is a shape of five sides, and the Pentagon is just that. We're standing right now in Section A, built in 1941 through an act of Congress, the Pentagon is virtually a city in itself. Almost 23,000 people ...

(General Steffan, with two FBI agents, approaches and passes through the metal detector.)

SECURITY OFFICER: General, sir.

GEN. STEFFAN: Good afternoon.

(Teager now walks through the metal detector. The security video monitor shows him walking through. The metal alarm sounds, but when the security officer turns, he doesn't see anyone.)

(The two agents, one of whom is Agent Hill, enter Steffan's office and see no one else in there.)

AGENT HILL: All clear, General.

GEN. STEFFAN: Thank you, gentlemen. That will be all.

(The agents step outside. The general puts his hat on the desk and finds a "death card.")

(Mulder is at the Pentagon entrance when his cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.

(Scully is calling. Renee Davenport is with a doctor in the background.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm at a Georgetown medical center.

MULDER: Did you find out what caused her eye to hemorrhage?

SCULLY: No, but the opthamologist discovered something. Something called a transient scotoma.

MULDER: Scotoma?

SCULLY: A floating blind spot.

(Mulder has reached the metal detectors. He hands his badge and weapon to the security officer.)

MULDER: Well, what would cause that?

SCULLY: Well, any number of diseases can scar the retina. Diabetes, glaucoma, macular degeneration. In turn, they, they create a visual field deficit.

(Mulder goes through the detector but it alarms.)

SCULLY: Well, does she have any of those diseases?

(He tosses his keys to the security guard.)

SCULLY: It doesn't appear so.

(Mulder goes through the detector OK. The guard hands him his keys, badge and gun.)

MULDER: Well, don't you think it's odd, Scully, that she'd have a blind spot that she wouldn't, uh, that she wouldn't have noticed before? (to security guard) Thanks.

SCULLY: Well, not necessarily. Uh, the processes of the brain fill in and the visual cortex compensates conceptually.

MULDER: Well, that might account for Teager's vanishing.

SCULLY: I asked the doctor that, and he laughed at me.

(Mulder half-laughs as his phone beeps with another call.)

MULDER: Oh, hold on second, Scully. (he hits a button to switch to the other call) It's Mulder.

(Steffan is calling from his office.)

GEN. STEFFAN: Agent Mulder, this is General Steffan. I found something on my desk ... something very troubling.

MULDER: Where are you?

GEN. STEFFAN: In my office.

MULDER: All right. The agents that I assigned to you - are they with you?

GEN. STEFFAN: No, no, they're just outside.

MULDER: I want you to call them into your office right now, General.

GEN. STEFFAN: Who put this here?

(Teager is seen behind the general. He loads a round into the chamber of his gun.)

MULDER: Listen to me very carefully, OK? I'm on my way over there.

(Mulder hears a gunshot over the phone.)

MULDER: General Steffan? General Steffan?

(He starts running.)

(The two agents burst into Steffan's office, guns drawn. They see no one else there. Mulder enters behind them.)

MULDER: Call an ambulance.

(One of the agents steps out. Mulder walks to Steffan, who is lying on his back behind his desk. He picks up a "death card" from the general's chest. Teager stands several feet away from him, off to Mulder's left. Mulder suddenly looks in that direction, but sees nothing. Mulder closes his eyes and shakes his head. He looks back at the card.)



SCENE 7
3:44 PM

(Still in Steffan's office. Scully shines a light into Steffan's eyes. Several agents and soldiers are in the area. Mulder walks toward Scully.)

MULDER: The general's secretary had been in here organizing his desk no more than fifteen minutes before the general was shot. He never saw this card (shows it to her) and he never saw anyone go in and out of the office aside from the general and the agents assigned to him.

SCULLY: Well, from my cursory exam, nothing about the general can explain your narrative.

MULDER: I was on the phone with the man. He was shot at close range in the forehead. I think he would have seen the shooter.

SCULLY: Not necessarily. He could have turned and been surprised. There's far too little forensic evidence yet to know, Mulder.

MULDER: No scotoma?

SCULLY: It's beyond my capabilities here to make that kind of analysis.

MULDER: I think it's beyond all our capabilities, but somebody's got to explain how a four-star general could be shot and killed in what is symbolically the best guarded military base in the country.

(Skinner enters and approaches them.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: I need both of you out here to see something. Now.

(They follow him out.)

(They are viewing the security video of the metal detector area. The video shows Teager passing through the detector and the security guard turning to look but taking no action.)

MULDER: That's him. That's Teager.

SKINNER: Whoever it is, I want to know how the hell this happened.

SCULLY: Neither of us has a clear explanation, sir.

SKINNER: You were on your way here, Agent Mulder. You knew the general was in danger.

MULDER: I did everything I could. I put two agents with him ...

SKINNER: This is insanity. This man is killing at will.

MULDER: That's correct, sir.

SKINNER: Well, he's unstoppable, is that what you're telling me?

MULDER: I think that Teager has an ability - the ability to effectively erase himself from the visual field.

SKINNER: If he's invisible, then why is he on this video, clear as day?

MULDER: I think he can hide himself from human sight by manipulating something that Scully has referred to as naturally occurring, a blind spot.

SCULLY: That is conjecture, sir.

SKINNER: You mean even if I'm looking at him ...

MULDER: You might not be able to see him. Isn't it true that American soldiers have reported the unexplained appearance and disappearance of V.C. guerrillas? I've read the dispatches myself. I mean, maybe Teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.

(Skinner glances at Scully. She looks mildly uncomfortable with Mulder's theory but doesn't offer any comments either way. He walks away, with Mulder and Scully following.)

SKINNER: I've got 4 miles of crowded streets where 31 military officers are staging for a parade into Freedom Square. If what you're saying has any truth to it, I can't protect these men.

SCULLY: Call it off.

MULDER: Parade or no parade, those men are gonna be vulnerable. The only way to stop this killer is to catch him.

SKINNER: How do we do that?

MULDER: By finding his next victim before he does.



SCENE 8
ARMY DETENTION CENTER,
FORT EVANSTON, MARYLAND, 4:08 PM

(General Bloch, followed by another officer and a security officer, walk down a hallway. The other officer opens the door for General Bloch and leaves him alone in an interview room with Denny Markham.).

GEN. BLOCH: I'm Major General Benjamin Bloch.

MARKHAM: He did it again, didn't he? I told him he would.

GEN. BLOCH: According to the FBI, you know the man they're looking for. Maybe you can tell me why they can't seem to find him.

MARKHAM: The same reason you can't. Which I imagine is the same reason you're here right now.

GEN. BLOCH: I am here because people are dying ... soldiers who dedicated their lives to the defense of this country.

MARKHAM: I guess that's one way of looking at it.

GEN. BLOCH: As it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason. But if both those fall through, there is still enough evidence to convict you for possession and transport of illegal arms.

MARKHAM: Are you threatening me?

GEN. BLOCH: No. I am offering you a deal ... for you and the people you represent.

MARKHAM: If you think I've got any sway with Teager, you're mistaken.

GEN. BLOCH: (leaning close to him) I just need to know what he wants.

MARKHAM: You know what he wants. And we both know you can't give it to him. Not without dragging that nice, clean uniform of yours through the mud.

(General Bloch grabs Markham by the collar and shoves him against the wall.)

MARKHAM: (calmly) Whatever you do to me won't change his mind, General. He's sending a message and making damn sure everyone hears it loud and clear.

(Bloch releases him.)

(A parade is preparing to start. Crowds are lined up on both sides of the street. A marching band is part of the procession.)

BAND LEADER: Men! Mark time!

(The band marches in place and starts a drum cadence. The crowds wave flags and take pictures.)

(Just ahead of the band, Teager stands at the side of the road.)



SCENE 9
LINCOLN MEMORIAL

(Mulder stands in the Lincoln Memorial, looking at the statue of Lincoln. Marita Covarrubias appears nearby and approaches him.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: You told me you were in a rush.

MULDER: Cross-town traffic's all snarled up because of the parade.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: You need information on American prisoners of war?

MULDER: A man named Teager.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: I have no information on him.

MULDER: Then why did you come here?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Tell me what you know.

MULDER: A POW named Teager may be back home carrying out death sentences against the men that left him in Vietnam.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Who are those men?

MULDER: Generals - Steffan and MacDougal.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: They have a connection.

MULDER: What is that?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: A recent news story, extremely embarrassing to the US military, about the disposing of South Vietnamese soldiers.

MULDER: Men employed by our government as spies and commandos and then left behind enemy lines to certain capture and death. The operation was disavowed and their lives were erased from the records.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: By a secret three-man commission who may now be facing charges. Whose testimonies might be used in the calculation of reparations.

MULDER: Are you saying that our government wants these officers dead? Why would they ask us to protect them?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Because they know you can't.

(She walks away.)

MULDER: (following her) Well, who's the third man? I need a name.



SCENE 10
STREET

(Teager continues to stand beside the street, with the marching band still playing and marching in place. Behind the band, a procession of military vehicles carrying officers stretches under an overpass. The band starts to march forward. Skinner and Scully run in the other direction, through the band toward the military vehicles. They head toward General Bloch's jeep.)

SCULLY: General Bloch?

SKINNER: General, sir, stop the car!

GEN. BLOCH: What's going on here?

SCULLY: We need you to get out of the car, sir, for your own safety.

GEN. BLOCH: Why?

SKINNER: We just received information your life might be in danger.

GEN. BLOCH: From who?

(Scully scans the crowd just down the parade route. She spots Teager.)

SCULLY: Shooter! Get down!

(She moves toward Teager, drawing her weapon. People in the crowd duck and scramble. Scully no longer sees Teager.)

SKINNER: (also with gun drawn) Where? Where is he?

SCULLY: He was there! I saw him, I ... It was him, sir! It was the man in the photo!

(She lowers her weapon and walks a few steps forward, looking a bit flustered.)

SKINNER: (following her, also looking at the crowd) Are you sure?

SCULLY: I saw him, sir. It was him.

SKINNER: Are you sure?



SCENE 11
5:05 PM

(An honor guard carries flags on a speaker's stage, with a large American flag behind them. A crowd begins to gather in front of the stage.)

HONOR GUARD LEADER: Right, mount!

(Skinner is in a tent nearby, completing a phone call.)

SKINNER: (to phone) ... when you find out.

(Mulder enters the tent and approaches Scully.)

MULDER: Scully. I heard what happened. They told me you saved General Bloch's life.

(Scully still looks a bit uncomfortable about the experience.)

SCULLY: He's doing all right. He's over there.

(She looks to the side, where Bloch is on the telephone.)

MULDER: They told me you saw somebody on the parade route.

SCULLY: I'm not really sure.

MULDER: You saw him, didn't you? You saw Teager.

SCULLY: I told you. I'm not sure, Mulder.

MULDER: Yeah, but you drew your gun, Scully. You must have been a little more convinced than that.

SCULLY: How are you so convinced that General Bloch was his next target?

(Mulder steps past Scully and raises his voice so Skinner, who is standing just beyond them, can hear.)

MULDER: I found out about General Bloch from the same person who told me that we were never meant to save Bloch's life ... or the other generals.

SKINNER: What are you talking about?

MULDER: This case - why do you think it was dumped in your lap, unless heading up an anti-terrorism detail is all of a sudden part of your job description.

SCULLY: Well, that doesn't prove that he was set up.

MULDER: Well, they knew about Teager. They'd known that he'd be unstoppable from the beginning.

SCULLY: You're saying they wanted Skinner to fail?

MULDER: And us. Given the nature of the case, they knew that you'd bring us in.

SCULLY: Mulder, the government is not about to sacrifice the lives of ranking military officers just to discredit us.

MULDER: Discrediting us in this case is only secondary.

SCULLY: Secondary to what?

MULDER: To maintaining their secret policy of denial about POW's, which required silencing the men who made that policy.

SCULLY: I think Denny Markham's story is having its intended effect. I think you're buying into the lie, Mulder.

MULDER: No, no, Denny Markham may be the only man in this case who's telling the truth. But if you don't believe me, why don't you ask General Bloch himself.

(He points back at Bloch, who is approaching them.)

GEN. BLOCH: Ask me what? (Mulder glances at Skinner) Look, I can't wait around here any longer. I'm delivering the keynote address in five minutes.

(Bloch puts on his hat and starts to leave.)

SKINNER: You might want to reconsider.

MULDER: He won't reconsider. (Bloch stops and turns back to them) Not going out there would be an admission of guilt.

SKINNER: We still have reason to believe that your life is in danger.

GEN. BLOCH: (walking up to Skinner) It's your job to protect me still, isn't it?

SKINNER: That's what we're trying to do.

GEN. BLOCH: (sharply) Then do your job.

(He starts away again.)

SKINNER: General ...

(Bloch doesn't stop. Skinner calls the agents around him.)

SKINNER: All right, people, listen up because we don't have much time here. You all know your responsibilities. You have your sectors and your assignments.

(The ceremony is now beginning, with large crowds on the ground in front of the speaker's stand and in bleachers along the sides. Teager is at the base of the bleachers and starts out into the crowd in between them. A man in the lower rows of the bleachers, Leo Danzinger, recognizes him. The speakers can be heard in the background.)

ANNOUNCER: It's a great pleasure to introduce a very special man, wounded and decorated for gallantry in Vietnam, he had an idea ...

DANZINGER: Teager?

ANNOUNCER: ... a vision, to create a national memorial inscribed with ...

DANZINGER: Hey man, is that you?

(Teager continues into the crowd. Danzinger follows, trying unsuccessfully to catch up with him.)

ANNOUNCER: ... the names of all Americans who gave their lives in the Vietnam war.

DANZINGER: Hey, where are you going?

ANNOUNCER: ... Ladies and gentlemen ...

DANZINGER: Hey!

ANNOUNCER: ... it is with great pride ...

DANZINGER: Hey! Hey, where are you going?

ANNOUNCER: ... that I introduce the founder of the Vietnam Veteran Memorial Fund - Mr. Jan Scruggs.

(Teager has walked behind a fence, behind the crowd. Danzinger follows moments later, but he doesn't see anyone in the darkened area.)

DANZINGER: Teager?

SCRUGGS: Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We are here to rededicate this memorial on this important day. We especially respectfully remember those who cannot share this day with us, the soldiers, the airmen ...

DANZINGER: Hey, Teager?

SCRUGGS: ... and the sailors who remain missing in action from America's longest war. We are gathered here to remember times of war, yet pray for times of peace...

DANZINGER: It's me, Leo Danzinger. I saw you, man. Where are you?

(He has walked farther along the fence, but he still doesn't see anyone.)

TEAGER: Behind you.

(Danzinger turns to find Teager a few feet away.)

DANZINGER: I, I thought you were dead. That's what they told us.

TEAGER: Because that's what they wanted you to believe.

DANZINGER: I don't understand.

TEAGER: You will ... after tonight.

DANZINGER: What are you talking about?

TEAGER: I waited for them, Leo. I waited for them to come. But they never came.

DANZINGER: Maybe they didn't know.

TEAGER: They knew. They just figured letting me die off was easier than admitting the truth.

DANZINGER: It's all over, Teager. It's been over for a long time now.

TEAGER: Not for me. Not for the others.

DANZINGER: You're telling me there's more?

(Teager hands Danzinger a folded piece of paper. Danzinger opens it. It has several dozen names on it, along with their military ID numbers. Danzinger looks up, but Teager has vanished.)

DANZINGER: What are you doing, man? Where are you?

(On stage, the ceremony is continuing.)

ANNOUNCER: It is a distinct honor to present to you now another great American, and a brother in arms. Major General Benjamin Bloch.

(Bloch steps to the speaker's stand. He finds an Ace of Clubs on the stand and turns it over. It is another "death card." He looks at the crowd, then starts to look back at Skinner, who is seated behind him and to his right, but instead starts to speak.)

GEN. BLOCH: Admiral Leitch. Senator Bain. Fellow Americans. And especially, the veterans.

(Teager is now walking through the crowd again.)

GEN. BLOCH: There is probably no audience that understands better that our freedom is not free ...

(Skinner communicates with agents in the crowd by radio. Parts of General Bloch's speech can be heard among their conversations.)

SKINNER: All right, you're my eyes out there. Talk to me. Positions report.

GEN. BLOCH: ... We owe that freedom to the selfless sacrifice ...

AGENT HILL: Sector three clear.

GEN. BLOCH: ... of those whose names ...

SCULLY: No sign of him in four.

GEN. BLOCH: ... are on this wall. And for that, it is our duty to remember them ...

(Scully spots him, heading toward the stage.)

SCULLY: Hold on. I think I have him in section four.

SKINNER: Can you confirm that, Scully.

GEN. BLOCH: ... their sweat, their long hours, their own blood. And for that ...

(She compares the man with the photograph.)

SCULLY: Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three.

SKINNER: Positions hold, three and four. Do you have eye contact?

GEN. BLOCH: ... and not too far from here, there is a statue of a solider ...

(Hill spots him as well and moves quickly toward him.)

AGENT HILL: I have him in three. He's coming toward you, Scully.

MULDER: Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.

GEN. BLOCH: ... and the plaque on that statue reads "not for themselves but for their country" ...

(Scully is closing on him. Teager turns and looks back at her.)

SCULLY: Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth.

AGENT HILL: Copy that. I'm cutting him off.

SKINNER: Talk to me, people. Does anybody have him?

GEN. BLOCH: ... when they were in Vietnam (cheering) This memorial is a place ...

SKINNER: What's happening, Scully?

GEN. BLOCH: ... where we can come and thank those ...

(Scully still sees him.)

SCULLY: I'm closing on him.

GEN. BLOCH: ... men and women who died ...

SKINNER: Do you have him in three?

GEN. BLOCH: ... not for themselves but ...

AGENT HILL: Negative.

GEN. BLOCH: ... for their country.

SKINNER: Scully? Scully?

GEN. BLOCH: ... I'm always struck by something as I walk this mall ...

(Scully no longer sees him.)

SCULLY: I lost him. You got him, three?

AGENT HILL: I don't see him, Scully.

GEN. BLOCH: ... The Vietnam Memorial ...

SKINNER: What's happening, Agent Scully?

(Scully and Hill have come together.)

AGENT HILL: I can't see him anywhere.

SCULLY: He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder?

MULDER: Not yet. (he sees him standing in the crowd) I got him. (then he doesn't see him) I lost him.

(Skinner sees Teager moving forward in the crowd.)

SKINNER: Pick him up, Mulder. He's right in front of you.

(Teager draws his weapon and cocks the hammer. Mulder glimpses him and hears the sound. He draws his weapon.)

MULDER: He's got a gun.

(Skinner lunges toward Bloch, pushing him aside. Those in the crowd near Mulder duck to the ground.)

SKINNER: General, get off the stage!

(Mulder no longer sees him.)

MULDER: I can't see him.

(Scully approaches Mulder.)

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Teager's here. I saw him out of the corner of my eye.

SCULLY: Mulder, he's gone. He's gone.

ANNOUNCER: There's no cause for alarm, ladies and gentlemen. Just a minor disturbance. Let's try and keep some order.

MULDER: Where's General Bloch?

SCULLY: He's with Skinner.

MULDER: We've got to stop him.

(They walk along the front of the stage, in the direction that Skinner and Bloch went.)

SCULLY: What's going on here, Mulder?

MULDER: He can only hide himself in somebody's direct line of sight.

SCULLY: When you're looking directly at him?

MULDER: That's why he killed General MacDougal and Steffan at close quarters - MacDougal in his car and Steffan in his office.

(They go around a fence and see Skinner and Bloch ahead of them, walking toward a car. Mulder draws his weapon.)

MULDER: Get away from the car! He's in the car! Teager's in the car!

(Skinner and Bloch stop. As Skinner looks toward the car, a shot is fired from within it. Skinner pushes Bloch down.)

SKINNER: Get down! Down!

(Five more shots are fired as everyone ducks for cover.)

MULDER: Get out of the car with your hands in the air! It's over, Teager. Come on out.

(Mulder, Scully and Skinner now advance toward the car, crouching and with guns raised. Mulder moves around in front of the car. The engine starts. Mulder rises and points his gun at the windshield but has to jump aside as the car starts forward. The car approaches Hill, who fires four shots at the windshield and then jumps aside. The car crashes into a barrier, knocking the driver's door ajar. As everyone holds their guns on the darkened driver's area, Teager falls out.)

SKINNER: Get an ambulance over here!

(Mulder checks Skinner's arm, which was grazed by a bullet. Scully goes to Teager, who has blood coming from his mouth.)

TEAGER: Teager, Nathaniel J. Sergeant, Green Beret detachment B-11. Service number 82278. Date of birth: March 7, 1952. Teager, Nathaniel J. Sergeant, Green Beret detachment B-11. Service Number 82278. (Whispering) date of birth: March 7, 1952 ...

(The next day, Skinner stands at the wall of the War Memorial as Mulder approaches.)

MULDER: The Pentagon is claiming that the man who was killed was a Thomas Lynch. He's a vet who's been in and out of VA psychiatric hospitals for the last 15 years.

SKINNER: And a sometime member of The Right Hand. His name was on Denny Markham's mailing list. Markham made a positive ID.

MULDER: They must have gotten to him.

SKINNER: Army forensics claims to have multiple confirmation.

MULDER: You heard him! We both did! It's happening all over again. They're covering the lies with more lies, trying to make him invisible. We've got to subpoena Markham and General Bloch, and we've got to petition the State Department to release Teager's body ...

SKINNER: I can't do that, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Why not?

SKINNER: This investigation has been turned over to C.I.D. It's no longer our jurisdiction.

MULDER: Don't let them do this.

SKINNER: Let it go, Agent Mulder. You did your job.

MULDER: So did Nathaniel Teager.

SKINNER: You found the man you were looking for, but now he's dead. It's over.

MULDER: Is that what you believe? Is that what you really believe? They're not just denying this man's life, they're denying his death. (he moves closer to Skinner) And with all due respect, Sir ... he could be you.

(Mulder leaves, and Skinner turns back to wall, looking at the name "Nathaniel Teager.")

[THE END]

                                         TEMPUS FUGIT



SCENE 1
FLIGHT 549

(A nice night outside as the plane soars. The noise outside is deafening, but it is quiet inside. Somebody rings a call bell. The stewardess brings Larold Rebhun a drink.)

STEWARDESS: Here you are, Mister Rebhun, another scotch and soda.

LAROLD REBHUN: It's the only way to fly.

(They laugh. She walks away. Larold talks to his seatmate.)

Used to be just like you. Used to hate flying. I mean, the moment I got on the plane, I'd be gripping those armrests like my teeth were being drilled. Truth is, statistically, you can fly every day for the next twenty-six thousand years before you'd have an accident.

(The man sitting next to him is Max Fenig, sans his ever-present NICAP hat. He is ducking down in his seat warily, avoiding eye contact with everyone.)

You believe that?

(Rebhun finds it humorous. Fenig doesn't. He looks at a man a few seats back, a Dark Man, who glances at him. Fenig looks straight ahead, revealing serious radiation burns on the side of his face. He clutches his bag tighter. The Dark Man unbuckles his seatbelt and heads towards the bathroom in the middle of the plane, glancing at Fenig, who watches him carefully. The Dark Man locks the door, then unscrews his pen. He takes out the spring, then pulls out a few more metal pieces. He is building a gun. He finishes when the plane shakes as if been struck by a cannon. Everyone starts murmuring, a few women screaming.)

Whoa, baby. Settle down now.

(The cockpit's computers are beeping wildly.)

PILOT: What the hell is this?

(The Dark Man steps out of the bathroom, watching people being tossed around. The lights cut, but the plane is illuminated from bright lights outside on all sides. Women and children are screaming. The plane continues to shake violently, the light growing ever brighter. The door shakes rapidly, being ripped off it's hinges. Fenig is right next to the door, watching it, mouth agape in terror.)



SCENE 2
THE HEADLESS WOMAN'S PUB; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Mulder and Scully are sitting at a table, some food and drinks in front of them. Mulder is chewing on his straw. A waiter starts over to them, carrying some strawberry ice cream with a candle, singing. The other waiters and waitresses join in.)

WAITERS: Happy birthday to you... happy birthday to you...

(Scully looks at Mulder and rolls her eyes.)

Happy birthday dear Dana...

(Mulder joins in for one line as they put the dish down in front of her.)

MULDER: Special Agent Dana Katherine Scully...

WAITERS: Happy birthday to you!

(They clap, as does the rest of the patrons in the bar, and walk away. Everyone in the restaurant has been watching them.)

MULDER: I didn't know it was your birthday, Scully.

(The clapping dies down, except for Mulder, who continues clapping.)

SCULLY: Mulder... you have never remembered my birthday in the four years I've known you.

MULDER: That's the way I like to celebrate them...

(He stops clapping.)

It's every four years, it's like dog years that way.

(She tries to blow out the candle, but is distracted by his choice of words and smiles.)

SCULLY: Dog years? Thank you.

MULDER: You're welcome. Oh, I got something for you.

(He digs into his coat pocket, which is on the back of his chair, and pulls out a small white box wrapped in gold ribbon.)

SCULLY: Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

(He hands it to her.)

MULDER: It's just something that reminded me of you.

SCULLY: What, an alien implant?

MULDER: Two, actually. I made them into earrings.

(She sighs and opens the box. It contains a gold Apollo 11 commemorative keychain. She puts her finger through the hole and studies.)

SCULLY: Hmmm... Apollo eleven.

(Mulder smiles widely, enjoying the gift. Scully appears not to understand the idea.)

MULDER: Read the back.

SCULLY: "Commemorating Apollo Eleven and the mission to the moon, July 1969."

(His grin is enormous.)

MULDER: It's, um...

(A woman walks over to them.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: Excuse me, are you Scully? And Mulder?

(Scully looks over to Mulder.)

SCULLY: Oh, promise me this isn't leading to something really embarrassing.

(The woman sits.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: My name is Sharon Graffia. I'm sorry to approach you like this, but I followed you. I was asked to find you if something happened.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

SHARON GRAFFIA: You have no good reason to believe me, but my brother, who I believe you know, he said you'd understand what to do.

MULDER: About what?

SHARON GRAFFIA: If he didn't make it.

SCULLY: Excuse me, who are you talking about?

SHARON GRAFFIA: Max. Max Fenig.

(Mulder and Scully look at each other, wide-eyed.)

He was on his way here to deliver something that made him fear for his life, something he said the government would kill for... but his plane, it went down two hours ago.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 4:02 A.M.

(Mike Millar, head of the recovery unit, is talking to a massive team of workers.)

MIKE MILLAR: What we know right now is that the plane designated as Flight five-four-nine lost radio contact tonight at nineteen-hundred hours E.D.T. and subsequently crashed into a wooded area approximately thirty miles from Albany, New York.

(Mulder and Scully walk in at the back of the room.)

Local law enforcement and E.M.T.s have been on the scene for just under two hours, but initial reports are they've found no survivors yet of the one-hundred and thirty-four passengers and crew listed on the manifest. I wish we could tell you more information about the crash site, but, uh, darkness and terrain are going to make it pretty slow going in the morning.

(Seated at the table is a mustached man named Scott Garrett, who glances up at the agents.)

We have a tape of the last radio exchange before five-four-nine went down, which we're going to play, but I want to stress the need to keep everything you know or learn within the Go-team so that all the information to the press comes from the I.I.C. You keyed-up, John?

JOHN: Ready.

(The man presses play on a tape player.)

PILOT: Copy, Tower, please advise. Do you see a need to adjust?

TOWER: Negative, five-four-nine. Steady airspeed of two-niner-six knots. Maintain heading one-zero-zero and two-niner thousand feet. Go ahead, five-four-nine.

(There is a beeping.)

PILOT: What the hell is this?

TOWER: Five-four-nine, do you read?

(When the pilot's transmission picks back up, the beeping continues.)

PILOT: We've got something... on intercept. Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

(Static. Millar presses stop.)

MIKE MILLAR: And that's all she wrote. The controllers tried to raise five-four-nine on all available frequencies, but the pilots did not respond. Okay, we've got an F.A.A. charter leaving in one hour.

(Everyone starts to pack up. Mulder takes a few steps forward.)

Accommodations...

MULDER: Excuse me, sir. I'm Special Agent Mulder with the F.B.I.

(Everyone stops and looks at him. Garrett seems worried.)

Is there any indication or suspicion that Flight five-forty-nine may have been forced down?

MIKE MILLAR: Forced down?

MULDER: Uh, you can clearly here the pilot say "intercept" on the recording.

MIKE MILLAR: We have absolutely no data to support that, no confirmation of other aircraft in the area. Unless you have something.

MULDER: No, no, but there was a passenger on that plane who was, uh, well-known to our government as an alien abductee.

(Various people chuckle amongst themselves.)

MIKE MILLAR: An alien abductee.

MULDER: Yeah, a man named Max Fenig, a multiple abduction victim, what's known as a repeater.

(The laughing grows louder.)

MIKE MILLAR: Hold on a second. Please, please, can I have some quiet?

(The room quiets down.)

MULDER: He'd predicted the accident, and from the sound of the tape, the plane may have been forced down.

MIKE MILLAR: Forced down by who? Or what?

MULDER: I'm hesitant to speculate.

MIKE MILLAR: Mulder, your name's Mulder?

MULDER: Yes, sir.

MIKE MILLAR: Let me tell you something. I've been doing this for eighteen years. I thought I heard everything.

MAN: I'm looking through the manifest here, and there was no one named Max Fen-ig on Flight five-four-nine.

MULDER: Fenig, and there may be people who want to cover up this evidence.

(Scully stands off to the side, head hung low, embarrassed.)

MIKE MILLAR: Agent Mulder, is this an official F.B.I. position?

(Mulder glances at Scully.)

MULDER: No, sir.

MIKE MILLAR: Because what you're suggesting trivializes this tragedy... and casts these fine people and the work they have to do in a light that I think you would be well-advised to avoid.

MULDER: I think we all share the same goal here, sir, and that's to find out what caused that plane to crash.

MIKE MILLAR: And if any of the capable men and women find... Doctor Spock's phaser or some green alien goo, we'll be sure to give you all the credit.

(Mulder laughs, as does the group.)

All right, then...

(Garrett scratches his head. The men all disperse.)

SCULLY: You sure know how to make a girl feel special on her birthday.

(Mulder shrugs slightly.)



SCENE 4
FLIGHT 549 CRASH SITE; 5:52 A.M.

(A helicopter flies over the wreckage of Flight five-forty-nine. The sight is beyond belief. Black smoke still rises from the crushed parts of what used to be an airplane. Yellow bodybags are lined up in a row off towards the road. Debris is everywhere. Men in yellow contamination suits are walking around in the wreckage. The ground itself is charred. There is a gaping hole in the ground, filled with water, presumably rainfall. The tail section is completely broken off, barely recognizable yet intact. The officials are taking every precaution, wearing protective suits and oxygen masks. A few are in charge of collecting the bodies. Scully looks out upon the scene in horror. Mulder stands next to her.)

SCULLY: You ever seen anything like this?

(Mulder shakes his head.)

MULDER: Where's the plane?

(He starts walking, her following closely.)

SCULLY: They think it hit the ground at over three-hundred miles an hour on an almost vertical descent. Meteorological data is being collected and analyzed and so far they are attributing the cause to... a weather phenomenon...

(A helicopter speeds by overhead.)

To a rapid depressurization caused by a lightning strike or by something called a wind rotor coming off the Adirondacks.

MULDER: But not to Max Fenig.

(They start to step through the underbrush.)

SCULLY: Mulder, even if he was on this flight, looking at this, he'd be in a hundred pieces. I mean, they're going to be lucky if they can I.D. half the bodies they find here.

MULDER: No, he was on this flight, Scully, I'm sure of that.

SCULLY: Well, say we do find him. What's that going to prove?

MULDER: I don't know... but maybe that one man's life was worth sacrificing a hundred-and-thirty-three others.

(They stop and look out at the wreckage. Elsewhere, Garrett uncovers the body of the Dark Man in the wreckage and kneels over it. He is wearing green protective gloves. He takes the gun out of his pocket and puts it in his own as another man kneels over him and sprays a substance on his fingertips, erasing the grime on it, and his fingerprints as well. The man then starts to spray it on his face. Another helicopter races by. Mulder and Scully walk through some of the water until Scully sees a wristwatch attached to a hand and forearm buried in the water. Scully walks over to it, sloshing through the water, and measures the water, unsure if it attached to anything else. Mulder watches, then sees something in a piece of wreckage. Scully sighs as Mulder takes out a tissue and holds the wristwatch he found. He walks over to Scully and kneels down.)

MULDER: Is that a hand?

(Scully nods, disgusted.)

Is that a watch?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: What does it read?

SCULLY: Eight-oh-one.

MULDER: So does this one. What are they listing as the time of the crash?

(Scully looks at her notepad.)

SCULLY: Uh, seven-fifty-two P.M.

MULDER: That's nine minutes difference.

SCULLY: It must be a mistake.

MULDER: Nine minutes, Scully. Do you remember the last time you were missing nine minutes?

(Scully sighs.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no one even reported the plane on radar. These guys are just going off of estimates until they can recover the data recorder.

MULDER: Yeah, something just occurred to me.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: I don't think we're going to find Max Fenig after all.

SCULLY: Just a few minutes ago, you were absolutely certain he was on this flight.

MULDER: Yeah, but I'm beginning to doubt whether he finished this flight with the rest of the passengers.

MAN #1: Hey! Get me a medic over here!

(They look over to see a worker leaning over a body in the wreckage, shouting, his face mask off. The man in the wreckage, Larold Rebhun, blinks.)

This man's alive! This man's alive! Get me a medic over here! Somebody!

MAN #2: Right here!

MAN #3: Let's go, let's go!

(Scully and Mulder run over. Scully kneels over the man.)

SCULLY: We need an airlift to a burn unit as soon as possible! This man needs oxygen and a saline I.V.!

(The man wheezes shallowly as other men run over to tend to him.)

Sir? Can you hear me? Sir?



SCENE 5
FULTON COUNTY AIRPORT; 7:12 P.M.

(Scully waits in the cold as a small airplane pulls up. It's propellers slowing down, Graffia walks over to Scully.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: I got what you asked for.

(Scully looks behind her to see a number of bags being unloaded from the plane.)

SCULLY: All of those are from Max?

SHARON GRAFFIA: Every letter he ever wrote me. You said to bring everything I had, I'm still not sure why.

SCULLY: Sharon, we believe that there are things that you haven't told us. We need to know everything that you know.

SHARON GRAFFIA: About what?

SCULLY: About Max. About where he's been, about where he's traveled, about exactly what it was he was carrying on that flight.

SHARON GRAFFIA: Did you find Max?

SCULLY: No, but we found a passenger with severe burns, severe cellular damage. Burns that we wouldn't see unless the victim was exposed to a high level of radiation.

SHARON GRAFFIA: Something Max was carrying?

SCULLY: We need to know what that was, Sharon. If you're withholding any information, there could be severe consequences.



SCENE 6
HANGAR

(Scully walks through the hangar towards Mulder, who is waving a Geiger counter over some parts of the wreckage.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: This man's name was Larold Rebhun.

(He starts walking, Scully still walking after him.)

The manifest has him listed in seat thirteen-D, which is the aisle seat right here.

(He stops at a crumpled seat.)

My guess is that Max Fenig was in thirteen-F, window seat.

(He points to a seat next to it.)

But the manifest has the passenger listed as a...

SCULLY: Paul Gidney. It's an alias that Max Fenig used in his letters when he went underground. He had many aliases, in fact, one of which he used to get a job at the Rocky Flats Environment Energy Site in Colorado where they handle and store Uranium two-three-five and weapons grade plutonium.

(They walk over to another piece of wreckage.)

MULDER: You think Max was carrying plutonium?

SCULLY: Mulder, the burns on that passenger's face were deep tissue radiation burns. I don't know how else he might have gotten them.

(They are slowly walking, Mulder checking each piece of wreckage with the Geiger counter.)

MULDER: What would Max be doing with that?

SCULLY: I don't know. I mean, he, he wrote hundreds, maybe even a thousand letters describing his abduction experiences, but beginning in January, he started making vague references to a theft. Now, it seems to me from reading it that he'd started to get the idea that he'd come onto something that was very dangerous.

MULDER: So... what caused this crash?

SCULLY: If he was carrying fissile plutonium, Mulder, and it became exposed in the cabin, it very conceivably could have caused the crash.

MULDER: You want to know what I think, Scully?

(They stop at the cabin door. The Geiger counter is going wild. Scully gives no answer.)

I'm going to tell you. I think Max was abducted. Sucked right out of this door at twenty-nine thousand feet. The burns we're seeing are a result of that abduction.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: And all the evidence will point to this conclusion but it will be dismissed because of it's improbability, it's unthinkability.

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: The crash of Flight five-forty-nine will go unsolved unless we find a way to prove it. And when Max is returned, he's going to tell us exactly the same story unless someone gets to him first.

SCULLY: Mulder, Max is returned. I found out a few minutes ago. They found his body a short way from the wreckage earlier today.

(Mulder looks to be in disbelief.)

MULDER: You're positive of this?

SCULLY: Traveling under the name of Paul Gidney, seat thirteen-F, with the same burns as his seat mate.

(Mulder searches for words.)

MULDER: There's still no explanation for this crash.

(He walks away. Scully looks about to say something, but dismisses it.)



SCENE 7
PARADISE MOTEL; NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 10:16 P.M.

(Sharon is looking through the letters. The only sound in the room is her shallow breathing and the clock. All noise stops. A loud rumbling starts, the room shaking. She gasps. A bright light shines through the windows suddenly, the windows rattling. She sighs, scared, and stands. The window blows out and she screams. The papers rustle around. Light shines through every possible point in the door as she starts to sob. The light becomes blindingly intense.)



SCENE 8
HANGAR

(The floor of the room is covered with yellow bodybags, all lined up in rows neatly. Mulder walks down a column, followed by a man and woman. He stops at a bodybag with the tag "Gidney, Paul -- Partial; Flight 549." He unzips the bag and looks at the face. It's Max. Mulder hears a sobbing and looks up to see a man, woman and child checking a body as well, led by an investigator. The woman and child are crying. Mulder looks down at Max sadly and reaches into his front shirt pocket. He pulls out his old business card given to Max long ago, stained in blood. Mulder puts the card away in his coat pocket and looks into the bodybag. Something is strange. He zips up Fenig's bodybag and unzips the next one in the row. The same anomaly, apparently. Mulder checks the next one in the column as well. Elsewhere in the hangar, Millar is conferring with various members of his team as well as Scully.)

MIKE MILLAR: Would you guys be willing to make a determination as to whether there was an explosion pre-impact or... as we can see from the fuel tank parts we've recovered from here...

(Mulder zips up the bag and starts towards Scully, who sees him and starts towards him.)

...whether the data only points to an explosion after the aircraft...

SCULLY: Did you make a positive I.D. on Max Fenig?

(Mulder nods.)

Well, they've located the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder.

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: And the I.I.C. is making a statement to the press, saying that there was a complete systems malfunction on the plane.

MULDER: In other words, there's still no explanation for what brought this plane down.

SCULLY: No, not yet, but they are taking a careful look at the emergency exit door, and while they cannot explain the radiation readings, they are not ready to attribute it as the direct cause.

MULDER: They're not able to, or they're not willing to?

SCULLY: Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?

(Mulder leads her away from the other people, talking low.)

MULDER: Because there are no facts, Scully. What they're telling you, what they're going to report, they're the opposite of the facts. A claim to ignorance of the facts. Claimed steadfastly, ignorance becomes as acceptable as the truth.

SCULLY: What would you like them to report?

(They stop walking.)

MULDER: That there is not one wristwatch on any of those bagged bodies. All of the wristwatches have been stolen.

SCULLY: Are you accusing these men of covering evidence?

MULDER: These men, no. These men are trained to identify moving parts. Hydraulics, electronics. They're trained to reconstruct those parts and the past and arrive at the present. But they can't do that because somebody has stolen the past from them. Nine minutes of it. Nine minutes that became a lifetime for those passengers, and now for their families. Someone has got to figure out what happened in those nine minutes. Somehow, we've got to get them back.



SCENE 9
VON DREHLE AIR FORCE; RESERVE INSTALLATION; 9:37 A.M.

(Mulder and Scully drive down the road to the building and stop the car. Getting out, a man named Louis Frish walks towards them, dressed in fatigues.)

MULDER: Louis Frish?

LOUIS FRISH: Yes, sir. I just got the call from the C.O., said you were coming out with some questions.

MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder.

(They shake hands.)

This is Agent Scully.

LOUIS FRISH: If you're here about the crash the other night, I already told the N.T.S.B. guys exactly what I know about that.

SCULLY: They were already out here?

LOUIS FRISH: Yes, ma'am. Night of the crash.

MULDER: Were you in the tower that night?

LOUIS FRISH: Yes, sir. Me and Sergeant Armando Gonzales.

MULDER: Did Flight five-forty-nine show up on your radar?

LOUIS FRISH: Yes, sir, it did.

MULDER: Did you establish radio contact with them?

LOUIS FRISH: No, sir. We would have no reason to contact a commercial or a civilian airliner unless it crossed into military airspace.

MULDER: Would there be a record of five-forty-nine on your log?

LOUIS FRISH: Yes, sir. I know it by heart. At nineteen-fifty-two, Flight five-four-nine dropped from an altitude of twenty-nine thousand feet. About forty-five seconds later, we got an altitude reading of triple-x. I've never seen anything like it. Hope to never again.

SCULLY: Then what did you do?

LOUIS FRISH: We called five-four-nine, got no response. Then we called A.T.C. in Albany.

MULDER: What was their response?

LOUIS FRISH: We just gave them the information. Last we'd heard.

(Mulder sighs slightly, disappointed.)

Is there something else you're looking for?

MULDER: About nine minutes.

(He starts back to his car.)

SCULLY: We've been traveling a long way.

(She follows Mulder back to the car. As Frish watches, they talk outside the car.)

MULDER: Wasn't the initial report that there was no radar confirmation of the crash?

SCULLY: Yeah, that must have come after our briefing.

(They get in and drive off the way they came. Another man dressed in fatigues, Sergeant Armando Gonzales, walks up to Frish and stands next to him, watching the agents drive off.)

ARMANDO GONZALES: What did you tell them?

LOUIS FRISH: What I was supposed to say.

ARMANDO GONZALES: Somebody's going to figure out what's going on.

LOUIS FRISH: I don't ask. I don't know. I don't want to know.

ARMANDO GONZALES: They find out the truth, you think anybody's going to take the heat for us?

LOUIS FRISH: I'm not the only liar here.

ARMANDO GONZALES: They come back here to talk to me, I'm telling the truth. I'm not going to have no blood on me.

(Frish turns to face him and grabs him by the collar.)

LOUIS FRISH: Then you make me the liar.

(He pushes him away and goes into his army truck. He drives off, Gonzales watching angrily.)



SCENE 10
NORTHVILLE, NEW YORK; 2:32 P.M.

(A police officer is on the wire.)

POLICE OFFICER: Right.

(He walks away. Mulder and Scully pull up to the hotel. The police officer is talking to the motel manager.)

MOTEL MANAGER: We don't want any trouble. Did they find her?

POLICE OFFICER: No, ma'am.

MOTEL MANAGER: Well, we need some answers. The place is a mess.

(The officer looks to Mulder and Scully, who are getting out of the car. Mulder is wearing sunglasses.)

POLICE OFFICER: You'll have to take care of this.

(He walks away. The manager goes over to Mulder.)

MOTEL MANAGER: Hey, you're going to have to take care of this. You're going to have to pay.

(She joins them as they walk towards the room.)

SCULLY: Excuse me?

MOTEL MANAGER: The room you rented for the woman? Well, she trashed it and split.

MULDER: Sharon Graffia?

MOTEL MANAGER: It was under your name.

MULDER: Yeah.

(They reach the doorway and look inside. The door is missing.)

MOTEL MANAGER: Look at this. I don't know what kind of game she was playing in here.

(The agents walk inside, followed by the manager.)

She blew the door right out of the jamb.

(Mulder takes off his sunglasses. No place in the room is clean. Papers are everywhere, the bed is in disarray. Furniture, such as chairs, are wrecked. She sighs.)

I doubt insurance will cover it.

(She sighs again. Mulder runs his fingers over the door leaned against the outside wall.)

MULDER: Does your policy cover the acts of extraterrestrials?

SCULLY: We'll take care of it.

MOTEL MANAGER: Right.

(She sounds less than believing, walking away.)

MULDER: Okay, Scully, hit me with your best shot. What do you think happened here?

SCULLY: I haven't a clue.

MULDER: It looks an awful lot to me like this place fell from twenty-nine thousand feet.

SCULLY: You think Max's sister was...

MULDER: Was abducted, just like Max. Maybe it runs in the family.

(Millar walks in, appalled by the disheveled room.)

MIKE MILLAR: What happened here?

MULDER: You're the experts. Why don't you bring your team down here and work it out?

MIKE MILLAR: They've got their hands full.

MULDER: Yeah, coming up with all that inconclusive evidence.

MIKE MILLAR: I've come to tell you we've found some evidence. Good evidence.

SCULLY: About what caused the crash?

MIKE MILLAR: Quite possibly, though I'm not ready to make an announcement.

MULDER: Why not?

MIKE MILLAR: I'm afraid I'd sound as crazy as you.

(Mulder grins.)

Is there someplace I can show you these? Someplace with a door?

(They walk over to the window, where Millar is showing the agents an x-ray of a part of the plane he posted up. He runs his finger over thin lines in the diagram.)

MIKE MILLAR: These lines you see here, running outward from center, these are what we call fatigue cracks, caused by cyclic stress on the fuselage structure.

SCULLY: From what?

MIKE MILLAR: Wear and tear. Most commercial planes have an average twenty, thirty thousand hours' flight time. Except five-forty-nine was a new plane. Five-forty-nine had no wear and tear.

MULDER: Then what caused that?

MIKE MILLAR: I can't tell you that. But I can tell you this...

(He puts up another diagram up over the first one.)

The way all these cracks radiate from a central point, it looks like the door was shaken and blown outward straight off it's frame. Right off the plane. If it hadn't been for you, we wouldn't have known what to look for.

SCULLY: Sounds like what you're describing is physically impossible.

MIKE MILLAR: In normal operation, it could never happen. Not this way.

MULDER: But it did.

(They stare at the diagram.)



SCENE 11
VON DREHLE AIR FORCE; RESERVE INSTALLATION

(Gonzales is watching the read-outs, facing the window. Frish walks up the stairs and takes off his coat.)

LOUIS FRISH: Hey, man. How you doing?

(He walks over to Gonzales, who doesn't move.)

I'm sorry about before. It's a... I was way out of line. I just...

(He sighs.)

I've just been letting this thing get to me, I guess. Hey, Gonzales.

(He puts his hand on Gonzales's shoulder and sees Gonzales is holding a gun. He spins him around and sees that Gonzales is dead, a bullet wound in his forehead. Frish looks ready to have a nervous breakdown when he sees three cars quickly approaching out the window. Downstairs, an agent opens the door to the tower and numerous agents file in, followed by Garrett. Garrett looks down a hallway, then starts up the stairs. The rest of the agents are running down to him.)

SCOTT GARRETT: Did you find him?

MAN: Not up there.

(They run out the door, carrying flashlights, spreading around the building. On the roof, Frish looks down, then lays flat on the floor, fearing for his life.)

<-7:04 P.M.->

(Mulder is listening to the tape again.)

TOWER: Thirty-five thousand feet. It's negligible. Nothing to be concerned about.

PILOT: Copy, Tower, please advise. Do you see a need to adjust?

TOWER: Negative, five-four-nine. Steady airspeed of two-niner-six knots. Maintain heading one-zero-zero and two-niner thousand feet. Go ahead, five-four-nine.

(There is a beeping.)

PILOT: What the hell is this?

TOWER: Five-four-nine, do you read?

(When the pilot's transmission picks back up, the beeping continues.)

PILOT: We've got something... on intercept.

(Mulder picks up the phone and starts to dial.)

Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

(Static. Mulder presses stop and puts the phone to his ear. There is a dialtone.)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me. I, I just realized something. The, the voice of the air-traffic controller, I've heard it before.

SCULLY: Mulder, we've been up for over thirty-six hours, can't it wait...

MULDER: No, I know, I know, I know, I know, I just need you to come over and listen to this right now, okay?

SCULLY: I'm on my way.

(There is a click on the other end, then Mulder hangs up. Down the hall, Scully leaves her hotel room, tying her robe. As she reaches a corner, a hand reaches out and grabs her. She gasps. The hand covers her mouth, the man firmly holding her in place.)

LOUIS FRISH: Just don't scream. Just listen to me. Listen to me. I'm the man responsible. I'm the one who caused that plane crash.

(She turns around and looks at Frish, shocked.)



SCENE 12
8:21 P.M.

(Millar and a few other officials are going over the tail section of the plane. He looks over to see Scully and Mulder entering the hangar.)

MIKE MILLAR: Uh, give me a second.

(He walks over to the agents.)

You said you had someone who had some information.

(Frish walks in behind them.)

SCULLY: This is Louis Frish, Sergeant Frish. He's the air-traffic controller you heard on the recording that you played for us the other night.

(Frish walks past them, looking out at the wreckage.)

MIKE MILLAR: That was from the Albany Control Center. It was the voice of a civilian air-traffic controller.

LOUIS FRISH: No, sir.

MULDER: There seems to be more than a little discrepancy. What you've been told, what you've been led to believe, was built upon a lie that Sergeant Frish was asked to perpetuate, along with Sergeant Gonzales, who is now dead.

LOUIS FRISH: I was asked to lie. I was ordered to lie about what happened to Flight five-four-nine.

(He walks over to them.)

MIKE MILLAR: By whom?

LOUIS FRISH: My C.O. Flight five-four-nine appeared on my radar at nineteen-hundred hours, when we were asked to give it's coordinates at fifteen-second intervals. About two minutes past thirty degrees north, we saw a second aircraft enter five-four-nine's airspace in an intercept pattern. It shadowed five-four-nine for another ten minutes before we were asked to give a new set of coordinates. A few seconds later, there was an explosion... and five-four-nine disappeared from my radar screen.

(Millar stares at Frish for a few seconds, then looks to the agents.)

MIKE MILLAR: I don't believe this man. There's not one speck of forensic detail to support it. No sign of an explosion, no flashing, no residues, no nitrated or oxidation, nothing.

LOUIS FRISH: I'm telling you what I saw. That we shot down a civilian jet, knowingly and willingly.

(Millar turns to the agents again.)

MIKE MILLAR: I'm going to tell you two something. I have a responsibility to the truth here.

MULDER: And so do we.

MIKE MILLAR: This man can't testify to this story, not without evidence.

MULDER: The military is working to cover up that evidence.

MIKE MILLAR: The sergeant's story makes no sense.

MULDER: Unless the aircraft that was fired on never appeared on his radar screen. A third, unidentified aircraft that engaged the civilian jet which the sergeant never saw.

MIKE MILLAR: A stealth aircraft?

MULDER: Shot down by the intercept aircraft, which, in turn, may have caused the crash of Flight five-forty-nine, which means that the cause of this crash is not here in this hangar, but is out there somewhere at a second crash site.

SCULLY: Somebody would have spotted it.

MULDER: No, they didn't know to look for that. They didn't know about a second aircraft, except the military. Which means that this man's life is in danger because he can put the pieces together.

(He nods in the direction of Frish, indicating him.)

SCULLY: Then somebody has to get him someplace safe.

(Millar looks to Frish, then looks at Mulder, the look on his face indicating that he does not believe.)

MIKE MILLAR: If there's a second crash site... let's find it.

(Millar gets in his car and pulls out. Mulder, Scully and Frish get in their own car, pull out and start driving down the runway. They see a number of cars approaching towards them.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Hold on.

(Tires squeal as Mulder spins the car around and starts driving the other way. Mulder steps on the gas, speeding away from their attackers. Not too far behind is the other vehicles, keeping pace. They look ahead to see a red dot approaching, followed by the airplane it is on. The airplane turns on it's headlights, barreling down towards the agents.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Louis, help me out.

LOUIS FRISH: Don't take your foot off the gas.

MULDER: Is he going to see us?

LOUIS FRISH: No. We've got to get under him.

(The agents pick up speed, but the airplane is much faster, about to touch down. Scully's eyes widen.)

MULDER: We're not going to make it.

(Everyone holds their breath in bated anticipation. The airplane sails over them just barely. They look behind to see cars spinning out, avoiding the oncoming jetliner. They all collectively sigh in relief. The other vehicles have no chance of catching up.)



SCENE 13
FLIGHT 549 CRASH SITE; 10:14 P.M.

(Millar is driving down to the crash site. He slows down and stops slowly, then gets out and looks around. His breath is visible by the cold air. His eyes widen. He is seeing a strange craft hovering over the crash site, a light shining down around the area. He makes his way towards him, walking through the underbrush. He stops at the hole full of water, watching the craft from a distance. The searchlight centers on something, then shuts off. The craft is seemingly not there anymore. Millar looks around until the light shines down upon him. He squints, looking up at the light shining down on him. It holds for a few more seconds, then shuts off. A blur of the craft is all that's left.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: Somebody help me!

(Millar looks to his right to see Graffia, sobbing.)

Please!

MIKE MILLAR: Who's there?

(He walks over to her. She is crying.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: Oh, don't... don't let them take me again...

(She cries into his shoulder. Millar's eyes dart around worriedly.)



SCENE
FULTON COUNTY AIRPORT; 11:17 P.M.

(A small airplane rolls by, preparing to take off. Mulder runs towards another one, where Scully and Frish are.)

MULDER: Scully! Louis! I want to ask you something.

(He runs over to them, holding a map. He unfolds it, showing it to them. The map, as well as their hair, are going wild due to the propellers. Mulder points to the crash site on the map.)

This is where Flight five-forty-nine went down. As far as you know, there's been no substantiation of a second crash site?

LOUIS FRISH: Right.

MULDER: What if that's because there is no second crash site, because that second aircraft never fell to the ground?

(He moves his finger over to Great Sacandaga Lake.)

It came down somewhere around here.

SCULLY: In Great Sacandaga Lake?

MULDER: Yeah.

LOUIS FRISH: Traveling north to south at fifteen degrees... it's a shallower descent. Yeah, that's very possible.

MULDER: Possible?

(Frish nods. Mulder looks to Scully.)

Are you okay taking Sergeant Frish back to D.C.?

SCULLY: By myself?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: You just let me know what's going on, Mulder.

MULDER: As soon as I know.

(He runs out. Frish gets in the plane and Mulder waves. The plane speeds off. Afterwards, Mulder is driving down to the lake. He sees a sign that says "Bearfeld Hunting & Fishing Tours." He pulls up to a man standing next to a pick-up truck and gets out.)

I saw the sign. Are you Bearfeld?

BRUCE BEARFELD: Yeah.

(Bearfeld shines the flashlight in his face. He is agitated.)

MULDER: I stopped by your place. Nobody was home.

BRUCE BEARFELD: Who are you?

MULDER: Fox Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.

(He shows Bearfeld his badge.)

BRUCE BEARFELD: You got anything to do with what's going on out there?

MULDER: What's going on out there?

BRUCE BEARFELD: Some kind of search-and-rescue operation or some damn thing, I don't know.

MULDER: Where?

BRUCE BEARFELD: Out over Democrat Point. Some kind of hovering lights, there and then go.

(Mulder looks out onto the lake and the pier.)

MULDER: Can you show me?

(Bearfeld shines his flashlight in the direction, but Mulder moves his arm down.)

No, no, no. I need you to take me.

(Bearfeld is slightly suspicious.)



SCENE 14
SCULLY'S HOUSE; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Scully walks in and flips on the light, followed by Frish.)

SCULLY: I'm just going to get some things.

LOUIS FRISH: What then?

SCULLY: I'm going to ask for some kind of protective arrangement.

(She walks into her bedroom and pulls some clothes out of a drawer.)

I need to talk to my agent in charge to get a feel for how to go on this, but, uh, I think it's pretty clear you're going to want to talk to the right people.

(She puts the clothes in a suitcase.)

LOUIS FRISH: You think I'll be prosecuted?

SCULLY: For what?

LOUIS FRISH: I gave the coordinates.

(Scully walks towards him.)

SCULLY: You didn't bring that plane down, Louis.

LOUIS FRISH: I lied. I misled a federal investigator, I misled you. A hundred and thirty-four people, Sergeant Gonzales, they're all dead.

SCULLY: It wasn't your fault.

LOUIS FRISH: But I'll have to live with it.

(Scully nods slightly.)

I watched that plane fall out of the sky. It was just a dot on the screen, just a... set of numbers. The wreckage... I can't get that out of my mind. How those people died... how easy it is to lie, just to say it was a dot on the screen... until you see it.

(There is an uncomfortable silence.)

SCULLY: Look, I can't tell you how to feel, Louis, but I can tell you that I will do everything I can to make sure you tell your story to somebody who will do the right thing.

(Frish nods slightly.)

LOUIS FRISH: Yeah. Thank you. You think it's safe to make a phone call? I'd, I'd like to tell my girlfriend that I'm... whatever.

SCULLY: Yeah, um... just tell her you're okay.

(She walks away. He picks up the phone.)



SCENE
GREAT SCANDAGA LAKE; 1:02 AM

(A large motorboat speeds across the water.)

MULDER: Over there.

(Mulder and Bearfeld head towards a spot in the water where bubbles are breaking the surface and stop. Mulder is wearing a wetsuit.)

How deep is it here?

BRUCE BEARFELD: Fifty, sixty maybe.

(He tosses the flashlight down into the water.)

Have you worked at this depth before?

(Mulder puts on his goggles.)

MULDER: Not exactly.

BRUCE BEARFELD: What exactly is your experience?

MULDER: Once, I, uh... I got a quarter off of the deep end at the "Y" pool.

(Bearfeld looks flabbergasted. Mulder nods, secures his mouthpiece and falls backwards into the icy water.)



SCENE 15
THE HEADLESS WOMAN'S PUB; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The bartender leans on the bar.)

BARTENDER: Last call, folks!

(He points to a man in the bar.)

Cocktail?

(The man shakes his head. People yammer on. Scully and Frish walk in.)

SCULLY: We're going to be met here by a federal marshall. You're probably going to end up sleeping in somebody's office.

(Frish sits, back to the door.)

You want a drink? You need a drink.

(She walks over to the bar but is grabbed and turned around gently by a familiar hand.)

PENDRELL: Hey! Birthday girl!

SCULLY: Agent Pendrell, how are you doing?

(Pendrell is obviously drunk.)

PENDRELL: I, I have something for you. Where have you been?

SCULLY: I've been, uh, gone.

PENDRELL: Oh. Can I buy you a drink?

SCULLY: No, you know what? That's okay, I'm with somebody.

PENDRELL: Oh.

(He looks over to Frish, then chuckles drunkenly.)

Let me buy him a drink too.

SCULLY: No, you know what? It's okay.

PENDRELL: No, no, no, I insist, I insist. Bartender, bartender!

(The bartender walks over.)

BARTENDER: Yeah.

PENDRELL: Set me up with, uh, a couple of, uh, birthday girl drinks here.

(Scully starts back to the table.)

Can I have a couple of your finest beers, skip the glasses, and another one of these...

(She sits, facing the door. Someone in the door catches her eye. Pendrell starts back to the table, carrying three beers. The man at the door, Garrett, eyes the group and spots Frish.)

SCULLY: Get down!

(She stands. Garrett whips out his gun as Frish looks behind him. Pendrell turns to look. Garrett's line of fire is broken by a beer bottle. Pendrell's beer bottle. Pendrell groans and goes down, being hit in the chest. As he falls, Scully shoots Garrett in the leg. Men and women empty the bar. Scully bends down over Pendrell, who gags.)

You're going to keep breathing, Pendrell. Do you hear me?

(She checks his pulse, shocked.)



SCENE 16
GREAT SCANDAGA LAKE

(Mulder swims towards the bottom. A dim light shines down from above, presumably the boat. He reaches a large chunk of metal on the ocean floor, what looks to be a part of a construct. He swims down along the side of the sunken machine and looks into a glass casing, where a dead "gray" alien sits. Mulder is taken aback. Suddenly, a bright light shines down and Mulder, who places his hand to try to divert the light. The bright light approaches as Mulder faces the horror that they may have come to claim him.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]



                                    MAX



SCENE 1

(The blinding light approaches Mulder, who shields his eyes. The light breaks into two distinct ones, revealing them to be divers carrying flashlights. The two divers move down towards Mulder, who takes off his airtank and breaks the surface, gasping for air. He glances at the boat waiting for him. He starts to swim away. The search lights on the boat turn on. The two divers break the surface near the boat.)

MAN: He's not here! He's not here! He's not down there! He swum out and is going to shore!

(The boat starts up and turns in the direction of Mulder, the engine revving loudly. Mulder walks onshore and drops the goggles, gasping. He looks back at the boat when more lights pop up behind him. He turns to see a truck with lights attached to the roof. Mulder starts to run as the truth gives chase. The two divers prove to be quicker and rush him, tackling him to the ground. The truck screeches to a halt. Other men wearing stealth clothes run up and point their rifles at the downed Mulder, who looks up at them.)

SCENE 2
THE HEADLESS WOMAN'S PUB; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Women and men scream various "He's got a gun" shouts as Frish looks back at Garrett, but Garrett's line of fire is interrupted by a beer bottle. Garrett pulls the trigger, hitting Pendrell in the chest. As Pendrell falls, Scully shoots twice. The first bullet pierces the cabinet behind Garrett while the next hits him in the leg. Garrett falls in pain. Frish tries to stand, having left his seat, but Scully pushes him back down.)

SCULLY: Get down, stay down!

(Scully goes over to Pendrell and starts to undo his tie.)

You're going to keep breathing. Do you hear me?

(Pendrell breathes shallowly, nodding slightly. Scully, panting, pulls open his shirt to reveal a gaping wound in his chest covered in blood. Scully looks at Pendrell, worried about the seriousness of the wound.)

WOMAN: Hey! He's getting away!

(Scully looks up.)

SCULLY: I'll be right back.

(She starts towards where Garrett was shot, gun aimed, the patrons start to clear a path.)

Back away! Back...

(She looks down at the trail of blood leading out the door. She steps outside and looks around. The sound of sirens grows steadily and a number of police cars pull up to see Scully holding her badge in the open for them.)

I need an E.M.T. in here now!

(She starts back into the bar. The driver follows.)

POLICE OFFICER: Car thirty-nine, requesting an E.M.T....

(The bartender clears a path for Scully back to Pendrell.)

BARTENDER: Come on, let her through, let her through.)

SCULLY: Excuse me.

BARTENDER: Help me with this table.

(He and another man move a table out of the way for easy access for the other law enforcement officials. Frish is standing over Pendrell, and Scully kneels down to the fallen agent. She stands and takes a cloth napkin, then kneels and presses it against the wound. The sound of an ambulance rings out.)

SCULLY: We've got paramedics on the way.

(Pendrell nods.)

You're going to the hospital. You're going to be okay. Look, we still haven't celebrated my birthday, Pendrell. I'm not going to let you off the hook like this.

(He laughs, then resumes his shallow breathing. A pair of E.M.T.s start to wheel a gurney through.)

BARTENDER: Let them through, let them through, please.

(Scully stands.)

SCULLY: This man has a puncture wound to his right lung. He needs to be intubated immediately.

(They paramedic leans over Pendrell and uncovers his gun, then looks up at Scully. She kneels down and takes the gun.)

He's an F.B.I. agent... and he's not going to die.

(He nods. Blood starts to trickle out of Scully's nose. They look down at Pendrell, who has an oxygen mask put on, and Scully wipes her nose nonchalantly. She looks down at the blood on her hand from her new nosebleed. She looks slightly embarrassed and takes out a tissue as she crosses to Frish, wiping her nose.)

Sit down.

(Frish sits.)

LOUIS FRISH: I'm sorry. How did they know?

SCULLY: When you talked to your girlfriend, what did you say?

(Frish shakes his head.)

Did you tell her you were in D.C.?

(He shakes his head again.)

LOUIS FRISH: No.

SCULLY: Then there's someone inside.

(She looks behind her to see Pendrell being wheeled out. Skinner walks in, but steps out of the way as they walk out. Scully walks over to him.)

SKINNER: What happened? Who shot Pendrell?

SCULLY: I don't know.

SKINNER: I got a call about a federal witness being transferred.

SCULLY: That's Sergeant Louis Frish, he was the intended target.

(Skinner looks back at Frish, who watches them from his seat.)

There was supposed to be a federal marshall here to put the sergeant into protective custody.

SKINNER: That order was countermanded.

SCULLY: By whom?

SKINNER: Louis Frish is being put under military arrest.

SCULLY: Military arrest?

SKINNER: Suspicion of murder and providing false testimony in a federal investigation.

SCULLY: He has testimony that is damaging to the military. His life is in danger. He is not going anywhere.

SKINNER: The order to arrest this man came out of the office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff... who've also issued a recommendation on Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: For what?

SKINNER: Agent Mulder's also been put under military arrest on charges of interference with a military investigation into the crash of a commercial airliner.

SCULLY: Sir, the military is responsible for the downing of that plane.

SKINNER: They are admitting as much... but Sergeant Frish's story is not the one they're telling.

SCULLY: What is their story?

(He stares at her for a second, then looks down at the bloody tissue in her hand. She notices and looks away, sighing. He takes her hand and raises it, looking at the tissue.)

SKINNER: I have a responsibility for the safety of the agents under my supervision, Agent Scully. I'm not going to put another agent's life in jeopardy just to keep her on the field.

(Scully stares at him for a few seconds, trying to hide her worry for herself.)

SCULLY: I'm fine.

SKINNER: I suggest you make sure of that when you go to the hospital with Agent Pendrell.

(She looks down at the tissue.)



SCENE 3
VON DREHLE AIR FORCE; RESERVE INSTALLATION

(Scully walks out of a room and turns down a hallway where Mulder is walking in with two military police officers. Mulder is wearing a green shirt and pants, as well as prison boots.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Hey, Scully. You come to spring me from the joint?

(The first MP holds out a clipboard, which Mulder signs with the attached pen. The second policeman walks past them. Mulder and Scully start walking down the hallway as the first policeman walks in the direction Scully came from.)

SCULLY: I came to talk to you.

MULDER: About what? The big old misunderstanding?

(The second MP leads them into a room.)

SCULLY: According to the military, there was no misunderstanding.

(The door closes. Mulder puts his duffel bag down on the table and starts to empty it out.)

MULDER: So all of a sudden, they just decide to take responsibility for the crash of Flight five-forty-nine?

SCULLY: They had no choice, not in light of all the facts that have come out.

MULDER: The facts? Have you heard their cover story? That the control tower gave bad coordinates to a fighter pilot, causing him to collide with Flight five-forty-nine over military airspace?

(Mulder takes off his green shirt given by the military.)

SCULLY: They allowed me to listen to their recordings.

(Mulder takes off his boots. She turns around as he starts to take off his pants.)

If you believe them, the coordinates that Sergeant Frish gave to the fighter pilot were the exact path that five-four-nine was on. Now, they would indicate that Sergeant Frish and his co-controller could not have seen Flight five-four-nine in the airspace until it was too late.

(Mulder starts to put on his button-down shirt.)

MULDER: So they're saying the tower put those jets on a collision course.

SCULLY: Yes, and that they were the only two aircraft on the radar screen.

(Mulder starts to put on his pants.)

MULDER: And realizing his guilt, Sergeant Frish's fellow officer put a gun to his head.

(Scully sighs and walks to the window.)

SCULLY: According to the Air Force, Sergeant Frish lied to save himself. When he found out that his, his fellow officer committed suicide, he came to us to blame the military. That's why they pursued him, to bring him to justice.

MULDER: Then they could conveniently lay the blame on a dead man.

(Scully nods slightly.)

SCULLY: Yes.

(Mulder finishes putting on his shoes and stands, putting on his jacket.)

MULDER: This, uh... second plane... they say it's a military fighter?

SCULLY: It was an F-Fifteen Eagle, according to an Air Force spokesman.

MULDER: You believe that story, Scully?

(Scully looks back at him as he throws on his overcoat.)

SCULLY: I don't know what to believe.

(He walks over to her and pulls back his hair on the right side of his face, revealing small radiation burns on his forehead.)

MULDER: You believe I got this from an F-Fifteen Eagle?

SCULLY: Those look like radiation burns. Where did you get that?

MULDER: At the second crash site, in about fifty feet of water at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake.

SCULLY: You found it?

MULDER: Mm-hmm. I followed a trail of bubbles down to the wreckage, but it didn't look like anything that might take off from an Air Force base.

SCULLY: What was it?

MULDER: What collided with Flight five-forty-nine was a UFO shot down by the military, taking the passenger plane right along with it.

(He starts out and she follows.)

SCULLY: Except it can't be proven.

(They walk out of the room.)

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: Because they haven't been able to find any physical evidence whatsoever that Flight five-forty-nine was involved in a collision.

MULDER: According to who?

SCULLY: Mike Millar, the I.I.C.... the man running the investigation.

MULDER: How do you know he's not lying?

SCULLY: I don't, except he seems to be the one man that truly wants to figure out what downed that plane and who came to me with information he had no reason to share.

(They walk out of the building and start down the steps.)

MULDER: What information?

SCULLY: He found Sharon Graffia wandering in a daze at the crash site the night we left, after seeing lights over the area.

MULDER: Max Fenig's sister?

SCULLY: That's another thing, Mulder. She's not Max Fenig's sister.

MULDER: Well, who is she?

SCULLY: She's an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spent time in-and-out of mental institutions. That's where she met Max.

(They stop at the bottom of the steps.)

MULDER: Why would she lie?

SCULLY: I don't know. All I know is that this plane seems to be killing people as it sits there on the ground.

(He stares at her, a bit confused.)

Mulder, Agent Pendrell is dead.

(He puts his hand on her shoulder, deeply saddened as well.)

MULDER: H, how?

SCULLY: Shot in an attempt on Sergeant Frish on Washington.

(He looks around, putting his hands in his pocket, angry and saddened.)

He saved his life, Mulder, and maybe mine.

(She starts walking.)

MULDER: Wait, Scully, Scully.

(She walks back over to him.)

SCULLY: What are these people dying for? Is it for the truth or for the lies?

MULDER: It's got to be for the truth. If we owe them anything, it's to make sure of that.



SCENE 4
BARNES CORNERS, NEW YORK

(A motorcyclist rolls by. A man is raking leaves. There are a few picnic benches nearby. Mulder and Scully walk over to him.)

MULDER: Excuse me, sir, Max Fenig?

GARDENER: Over there.

(He points to his right.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(They walk over to the camper and walk in. The place remains unchanged.)

Remember this place?

SCULLY: I remember being amazed at what some people will call home.

MULDER: You have to admit, the man had an enduring sense of style.

SCULLY: Only Max Fenig and you would appreciate living like this.

(Mulder chuckles as they walk towards the back of the camper. She rubs some dust off of the stereo and presses play. "Unmarked Helicopters" by Soul Coughing plays. She waits a few seconds before pressing stop.)

I think you were actually kindred spirits in some deep, strange way.

MULDER: What do you mean?

(She sighs.)

SCULLY: Men with Spartan lives, simple in their creature comforts if only to allow for the complexity of their passions.

(Mulder walks past her and picks up a can of food.)

MULDER: Hmmm, beans and weinies.

(He puts the can down.)

SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for here, Mulder?

MULDER: Something to explain what Max was doing on that plane... what he was coming to show me or tell me.

SCULLY: What makes you think he was coming to see you?

(He sits down at the computer and hands her the bloodied business card he pulled out of Max's pocket while checking the body.)

MULDER: Max is the key to all this. He knew that plane was in danger even before it took off, before it entered military airspace.

(He looks through the contents of a folder.)

How would he know that? And what would be worth taking that risk?

(He pulls out a videotape and pops it into the VCR, pressing play. After turning on the television, a picture comes up of Max standing in front of his trailer. He nods, then waits a few seconds.)

MAX FENIG: Hi. Max here. But of course. This is, uh, well, quite obviously, uh, my story, since I'm telling it. Anyway... um... for those of you who know me already, this is going to be ancient history, but for the rest of you, this is... well, what can I say... the story of my life. Actually, all I ever wanted in life was to be left alone.

(He laughs.)

Don't we all? So just my luck that I'd eventually become an alien abductee. Now I'm never alone. Any minute, when I'm least expecting it...

(He motions to the sky.)

And the worst part is, no one believes you. Well, uh... almost no one. So, I've devoted my life to providing all you disbelievers out there with proof. Proof that there are extraterrestrial biological entities right now, as we speak, visiting our planet in alien ships for purposes of a rather troubling agenda known only to certain members of the government, uh, the F.B.I. and certain high-ranking members...



SCENE 5
GREAT SACANDAGA LAKE

(A clean-up crew is in the process of covering-up the evidence that Mulder found. Max continues his tirade over the scene. Machine-gun-mounted trucks race by, as well as different men running to a large area cordoned off by a giant sheet draped over the area.)

...of the military-industrial community who have recovered some of these very craft, not that they'd ever admit to it publicly... uh... of course. Nor, nor would they, uh, admit that they have salvaged some of this alien technology and are using it in military applications.

(There are metal boxes all over inside the area, as well as computers. A man is writing on a blackboard, but stops and starts on the computer.)

No, that would be un-American and they won't admit it until someone conf, confronts them with irrefutable, undeniable proof. Someone like me.

(Other men are going over parts of the newfound wreckage with Geiger counters.)

And, uh... I should probably mention that I should do this at great risk to my own health and safety, but, hey...

(He laughs. Men are still bringing wreckage onshore.)

When every day's just another day you're going to get kidnapped by, by some little gray dudes from outer space, what's a few C.I.A. spooks to worry about?

(A man zips up a bodybag containing an alien body and he, with another man, bring it over to a line of bodybags.)

MAN: Hey!

(Two divers are helping another diver onshore, who is coughing and gagging wildly. He has radiation burns all over his face. They bring him over on a gurney, coughing and wheezing, over to a section of the tent. They all stare at him. A blood-stained bullet hole in his pants, Garrett walks over and stands over the sick man.)

SCOTT GARRETT: We found it.



SCENE 6
HANGAR

(The plane is nearly completely reconstructed. Mike Millar is wrapping up, talking to his team of workers.)

MIKE MILLAR: Recovery and identification of the deceased victims of Flight five-four-nine is at seventy-six percent... which is far better than anticipated, given the kind of destruction we've all seen. We've got a total of nearly three-thousand man-hours logged already in this first wave of investigation... and I wish I could tell you folks that we've come up with something more concrete, but... the evidence... just doesn't support anything more conclusive than the Air Force's assertion that the cause of this crash was a midair collision... or a catastrophic near-miss.

(Millar looks out onto the faces of his workers, some of which look as if they have a hard time believing such a story. He looks down at his folder.)

I'm going to ask you all to wrap-up your reports tonight... and then I want you to go home to your families. You've done a good and thorough job here. You'll be in touch with me or someone from the N.T.S.B. on anything further. I just wanted to thank you all personally. Thank you.

(The man and women start to walk out, a few shaking hands with Millar. Millar looks through the crowd to see Mulder and Scully standing off to the side. They stare at each other for a few seconds before Millar walks over.)

I'd wondered what happened to you. I'd put in a call.

MULDER: You had something you wanted to tell us?

MIKE MILLAR: No. Just, just... just wanted to touch base. Thank you for your help in leading us to the fact of the military's involvement.

MULDER: I think the facts are still a matter of speculation, Mister Millar, and listening to what you just said, I think you do, too.

SCULLY: The military's public claim of fault for the collision and their covert actions to promote that claim have raised some suspicions.

MIKE MILLAR: Suspicions? Of what?

SCULLY: That the story the military is now promoting is a convenient deflection and cover-up.

MIKE MILLAR: Of what?

MULDER: Agent Scully and I agree on some of the motives, but not exactly on the facts.

MIKE MILLAR: Do you have facts that I don't?

MULDER: No, but I do have a story if you're willing to hear it. Feel free to tell me it's bull, as Agent Scully has...

(Scully looks a bit embarrassed.)

...but I think it's as believable as any story I've heard floated, but at least it's the only one that can't be refuted by the facts.

(Millar looks behind him for a second, pondering it.)

MIKE MILLAR: All right.

(They start to walk, Scully close behind.)

MULDER: There was one man who knew what brought this plane down, and he knew it even before he got on the plane, but he got on anyway.

(He points to a seat.)

He sat right here in this seat, thirteen-F. His name was Max Fenig.

(He points to the seat. Cut back to the night of the crash, or at least Mulder's version of it. Max looks a few seats back to see the Dark Man staring over at him.)

There are a number of possibilities for Max's suspicions, but I believe Max had been followed for some time before he boarded Flight five-forty-nine.

(The Dark Man stands and heads for the bathroom in the middle of the plane, glancing at Max, who is staring back.)

And I believe he was followed onto this plane by someone who wanted whatever it is Max had carried onboard with him.

(Max clutches his small green bag tighter to his chest.)

The object that ultimately brought down this plane, the cause which has eluded you.

(Cut back to the present. Millar and Mulder are walking again, Scully still close behind.)

MIKE MILLAR: And what was this object?

MULDER: Physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life and intelligence.

(Millar looks back at Scully in disbelief. Scully has the same look on her face. Cut back to the night in question. The Dark Man builds his gun inside the bathroom. Mulder continues to talk over the scene.)

The person who followed Max on the plane may have been prepared to kill to obtain this object, it's value greater than one human life, greater than the lives of the hundred-and-thirty-four people on that plane. Whether that plan was executed, we may never know because Flight five-forty-nine was intercepted by a second aircraft, an aircraft which did not appear on the military's or anyone else's radar screen.

(The ship starts to shake violently and men and women start to scream. The cockpit's controls are going wild.)

PILOT: What the hell is this?

(Max looks out his window.)

MULDER: Max Fenig knew immediately what this craft was and that he would not be completing the rest of the flight as scheduled.

(The Dark Man walks out of the bathroom, struggling to remain standing.)

Max would have recognized immediately all the signs of a classic abduction scenario...

(The screaming goes louder as the power goes out on the airliner, but line shines in through the windows on all sides.)

The craft taking control of the plane and all it's systems...

(The door next to Max shakes violently as Max continues to clutch his bag to his chest, staring at the window wide-eyed.)

Preparing to take Max.

(Cut to the present. The agents and Millar start walking again.)

But something happened. Something went terribly wrong, something unimaginable.

MIKE MILLAR: Okay.

MULDER: A third aircraft, probably an F-Fifteen Eagle, was given the coordinates to Flight five-forty-nine.

(Cut to the control tower in the past. Frish is talking to the plane, Gonzales is in the back.)

LOUIS FRISH: Heading one-zero-zero at two-niner thousand feet.

(The fighter jet approaches the airliner in a perpendicular pattern on the radar screen.)

MULDER: The flight controllers watched the fighter enter Flight five-forty-nine's airspace on an intercept pattern...

(A beeping grows loudly. Gonzales rushes over and the two watch the radar screen.)

Not knowing what they had set in motion, no way of knowing there was a third craft which was not on their screen.

(Cut to the plane, where Max continues to stare out the window despite the intense light.)

Not knowing that for the next nine minutes, time would stand still on Flight five-forty-nine.

PILOT: We got something... some intercept. Oh my God! My God! Mayday! Mayday, mayday!

(The men and women stare back at Max's position, screaming. The Dark Man is tossed to the floor by the violent shaking. The plane shakes even more as the door is starting to be ripped off the hinges. Max is staring at the door in terror as he convulses slightly. The noise of the air pulling builds when everything stands still. The plane stops moving. The door has been pulled off it's hinges, and no one is screaming now. Everyone is watching, amazed. Max starts to shake and convulse, having one of his seizures that occurs when the aliens come for him. His seat starts to rattle when Max suddenly levitates off his seat a few inches, movement stopping. His radiation burns have grown slightly as his body uncontrollably moves away from the seat and in front of the door, turning to face it. The Dark Man tries to shoot Max, but his gun jams, as guns usually do around the aliens. Max slowly levitates out the door, much to the amazement of the other passengers and crew. Outside, Max is merely a silhouette in the blinding light. Cut to the present, where all are standing still now.)

MIKE MILLAR: You're saying the man sitting in seat thirteen-F was abducted mid-flight without any depressurization of the cabin, without any effect on the plane.

MULDER: If not for factors unforeseen, I believe Max Fenig would have been abducted and returned to Flight five-forty-nine without any loss of life, without a trace.

MIKE MILLAR: Then what happened?

(On the radar screen in the tower a few nights before, the F-Fifteen Eagle and the airliner are about to collide.)

MULDER: Flight five-forty-nine and the alien craft which has taken control of it were intercept by the military fighter which had been given a specific set of orders... take down the UFO.

(In the plane and outside it, people watch as Max is slowly returned to the plane, approaching in the blinding light.)

The missing nine minutes aboard Flight five-forty-nine, the nine minutes which would have been erased from the memories of the hundred-and-thirty-four passengers on board, would prove to be the final minutes of their lives.

(Slowly, Max is back in the ship when an explosion sounds outside. The lights shut out and people start to murmur, but less than a second later, Max's body is sucked out of the plane, along with various papers. Max flails wildly as he disappears from sight. The lights flicker on and off as people hold on for dear life, but one man is not so lucky as he is ripped out of his seat and out the door, screaming. The oxygen masks fall from the ceiling. The passengers clamor for it as a stewardess grabs onto the bottom of a seat to no avail. She falls out of the plane, screaming. Another women falls out. The Dark Man slides down the aisle, barely holding on. The passengers put on their oxygen masks, as does the Dark Man, who continues to hold on. The noise is a mix of a sucking noise and a symphony of screams. One women has taken the oxygen mask off and is praying loudly.)

WOMAN: Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

(A stewardess is crying in the back. The woman's voice grows louder and higher as the impending doom approaches.)

Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death!

(A man and a woman hold hands across the aisle as the lights start to give out, the noise of the plane falling becomes louder.)

Amen!

(On the radar screen, the triangle representing Flight five-forty-nine flashes. A small number about says "549," and there is a line under it. Under the line, the number counts down: "1000," "800," "700," "500," "300," and finally "000" before dropping off the screen. Frish and Gonzales watch sadly, slightly confused. Cut to the present.)

MIKE MILLAR: You're saying that, that Flight five-four-nine was in the grip of... sort of a UFO tractor beam?

MULDER: That's the Hollywood term, but yes.

MIKE MILLAR: And the Air Force shot down the UFO, thereby sending five-four-nine out of control when the beam went off.

MULDER: Yes.

(Millar stares at Mulder, half-believing after what he saw the previous night, but still thinking it is ludicrous.)

MIKE MILLAR: Well, where I come from, that's what we call a "whopper."

(Mulder smiles.)

Even if it were true, I could never in a million years sell that to Washington, and neither could you.

MULDER: Not without the object that Max Fenig was carrying.

SCULLY: Look, I, I had the same reaction to the story as you, but there is one logical area that has yet to be explained and that is that the, the seats and the door did show traces of, of radioactivity. Now, now you found nothing in the wreckage? No source of any emitter?

MIKE MILLAR: I did find something. I think you should look at.

(They walk towards Millar's car. Millar takes out his keys and starts to open the trunk.)

After you'd found the first traces, I had my team see if they could link the radioactivity to a cause.

(He opens the trunk.)

They found no other evidence...

(He pulls out the small green bag Max was carrying.)

Except for this.

(He hands it to Mulder, who opens it and pulls out a familiar object. Max's NICAP hat.)

MULDER: That's it?

MIKE MILLAR: That's all there was. I'm going to have to make my final report. I'll include this if it makes any difference to you.

(Mulder puts the hat in the backpack and puts it back in the trunk.)

SCULLY: But not as a causal factor.

MIKE MILLAR: It's a good story.

(He closes the trunk.)

Maybe you can sell it to the movies.

(He walks away. Mulder and Scully walk away from the car. Mulder paces back and forth slowly.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't know what else you expect him to do.

MULDER: Yeah, I know.

SCULLY: Look, it is a good story, but it's, it's a house of cards built on a shaky foundation. We may never know what Max was carrying.

MULDER: And we may never know who killed Agent Pendrell. And if we don't find out, what meaning did their deaths have? Or their lives? I mean, Max'll be remembered as a...

(He chuckles slightly.)

Disappointing rummage sale or some kook on a home video.

SCULLY: Well, where do we even start?

MULDER: How about Sharon Graffia?

(Scully sighs.)

SCULLY: She's a disturbed person, Mulder. She wasn't even who she claimed to be.

MULDER: Yeah, but she knew Max well enough for him to write her thousands of letters, well enough for him to call her and tell her he was going to die. Do you know where she is?

SCULLY: In a mental institution.

(Mulder's eyes widen slightly in shock. She sighs, knowing what Mulder's is thinking, smiling slightly.)

MULDER: I'd, I'd go with you, but I'm, I'm afraid they'd lock me up.

SCULLY: Me too.

(She sighs. He smiles.)



SCENE 7
BARNES CORNERS, NEW YORK

(Mulder pulls up to Fenig's old camper. The radio is blasting. He looks in to see "Unmarked Helicopters" blaring over the speaker. Max's videotape is playing and the camper is a wreck. The door is wide open. He walks in and looks around, then goes to the stereo.)

LANDLORD: Hello.

(Mulder looks over to see a man standing in the doorway.)

Are you a friend of Max's?

(Mulder turns off the music. The man steps inside. Mulder shows him his badge.)

MULDER: No. My name is, uh, Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.

LANDLORD: You're kidding, right?

MULDER: No, why?

LANDLORD: Well, I manage the park. I know Max had some weird friends and I don't believe the F.B.I. sends men out cause somebody trashed a trailer.

MULDER: Any idea who did this?

LANDLORD: N, no. Is Max in trouble or something?

MULDER: No, Max is dead. He, he died in a plane crash a few days ago.

LANDLORD: Oh, Lord, I... I am sorry to hear that.

MULDER: Uh, did, did he ever mention why he would leave or where he would go?

LANDLORD: No. But he disappeared sometimes. Had... stories. You're sure that's not what happened to him?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm... yeah, I'm sure.

(The manager sighs.)

LANDLORD: Have you, uh, any idea who's going to be taking care of his estate? Where I should, uh, forward his mail?

MULDER: Oh, he has mail?

LANDLORD: Yeah, a small stack of it. I'll run and get it if you want.

(Mulder nods.)

MULDER: Please.

(The manager walks out. Mulder kneels down in front of the television and rewinds it as it plays, then presses pause. In the window of the camper, Mulder clearly sees Sharon filming. The landlord walks in.)

LANDLORD: Here you go.

(He hands Mulder the mail.)

Sure feel sorry about Max.

MULDER: So do I.

(The landlord sighs and walks out. Mulder flips through the letters and finds one with the return address:

"Paul Gidney
Box 4024 Sta A
Washington, D.C.
20001-99."

He opens the letter and finds a small plastic identification key as if some luggage claim. "SYR 4832008.")



SCENE 8
NORTHEAST GEORGETOWN MENTAL HEALTH CENTER

(Scully walks down the hallway and opens the door to a dark room. Sharon is sitting on the bed, facing the window.)

SCULLY: Sharon?

SHARON GRAFFIA: Hello.

(Scully walks in, not closing the door fully.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

(Sharon shrugs slightly, still facing away.)

Are you up to answering some questions?

SHARON GRAFFIA: I'm not Max's sister.

SCULLY: I know.

(She starts to walk around the bed.)

I'm not quite sure why you lied to us, though, Sharon... or what else you might be lying about.

(Sharon looks at her.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: It doesn't matter anymore.

SCULLY: Yes, it does. If you know something, if you know anything about what Max was doing, about what he was carrying on that plane... it could matter a lot.

SHARON GRAFFIA: To who?

SCULLY: To Max.

(Sharon stares at her for a second, then tenses up slightly.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: I can't.

SCULLY: Why not?

SHARON GRAFFIA: Because I could be in big, big trouble.

(She breathes raggedly. Scully turns on the lamp next to her and looks at the radiation burns over the side of her face.)

SCULLY: Max had those same blisters. You both were exposed to something, Sharon. What was it?

(Sharon is hesitant to answer.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: It was something I stole.

SCULLY: From whom?

(Sharon does not answer.)

Max was trying to find physical evidence to prove that the stories about his abductions were true. You worked as an aeronautical systems engineer. You stole something from your employer, didn't you, Sharon? Something radioactive.

SHARON GRAFFIA: Only because I believed in Max.

SCULLY: What was it?

SHARON GRAFFIA: Max said it was alien technology. It was three interlocking parts. We divided it into sections. I had one part. Max had another onboard that flight...

(She shakes her head.)

But they were taken from us.

SCULLY: There was a third part. What happened to it?

(Sharon glances at her, then looks down.)



SCENE 9
SYRACUSE HANCOCK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

(Mulder slides the tag over to the clerk at the luggage claim.)

MULDER: I left a bag here.

CLERK: Big bag, little bag?

MULDER: Short bag, tall bag.

(He smiles.)

I, I don't remember. Little bag, I think.

(The clerk looks around. A number of men-in-black conglomerate at the end of the hallway, staring at Mulder.)

MAN: He's at the baggage claim.

(The clerk puts a brown bag down on the counter.)

CLERK: Is this it?

(Mulder looks back at the men, who eye him inconspicuously.)

MULDER: I'm a federal officer. I need a security entrance to the terminal.

(He shows the clerk his badge.)

CLERK: Right this way.

(Mulder takes the bag and the two of them walk behind the gate and through a door. The other agents start off. Mulder ends up near a Travel Insurance and closes the door. His cellular phone rings.)

MULDER: Mulder.

(Cut to Scully, who is still at the mental hospital.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. Where are you?

(Cut to Mulder, who continues to walk through the terminal.)

MULDER: I'm at the airport in Syracuse, New York. Whatever is it that Max had, I have it now.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: How did you find it?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Luck.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(Cut to Scully, who starts to walk slowly.)

What you're carrying was stolen from a military contractor, Cummins Aerospace.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, what is it?

(Cut to Mulder.)

SCULLY: I don't know.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Well, I'm going to let you know in a minute.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He starts to undo the straps to the bag. Static builds on the phone. Cut to Scully.)

It is extremely important that you do not take it out of its container.

(Cut to Mulder. The static is growing by the second. Mulder keeps walking, undoing the straps.)

MULDER: What's that? I'm having trouble hearing you on the phone here.

SCULLY: Mulder, did you hear what I said?

MULDER: No, hold on a second, I'm going to tell you what it looks like.

(The bag is open. Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: No, no, no, Mulder, listen to me. Do not handle it. Whatever it is...

(Mulder gets in line at the metal detector.)

It is highly radioactive.

(Static keeps interfering. Mulder puts the bag on the conveyor belt and watches it go through.)

MULDER: Hold on a second.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(There is no sound except for static. Then a few beeps. Cut to Mulder, who has just stepped through the metal detector and is stopped by a security guard. He shows the guard his badge, and the guard nods. Mulder looks at the monitor with the bag inside. There is a container with a device that has four circles attached to one another, the two in the middle larger. There is also a few unrecognizable things. He picks the phone back up.)

MULDER: It looks like a small superstructure with three circular pieces inside. It's hard to tell on an x-ray, hold on.

(He takes the bag and starts walking. Cut back to Scully, who sighs in relief that Mulder didn't do something stupid.)

SCULLY: I think that what we've got here, Mulder, is a case of high-tech industrial espionage.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: More people are trying to get their hands on this thing than a "Tickle-Me Elmo" doll. I'm getting on a flight.

(Cut back to Scully.)

SCULLY: What flight number?

MULDER: I think it's five-oh-one.

(He pulls the ticket out of his inner coat pocket, looks at it, and hands it to the gate attendant.)

Yeah. I'm going to need a ride when I get there.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: I don't think that'll to be a problem, Mulder.

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: Thanks.

(He hangs up and walks down the gate. Boarding the plane, he heads towards his seat. Seeing a stewardess, he holds up his overcoat.)

Can I give you this?

STEWARDESS: Certainly.

MULDER: Thanks.

(She takes it as he passes by her. One man watches Mulder in particular, Scott Garrett. Later in the flight, when Mulder has settled in, Garrett walks over and puts a package in the overhead compartment near Mulder. Mulder, looking out the window, half-asleep, doesn't notice.)

SCOTT GARRETT: Excuse me. You look like you have some room here. Do you mind?

MULDER: No, go ahead.

(Garrett sits.)

SCOTT GARRETT: Didn't mean to disturb you.

MULDER: It's all right.

SCOTT GARRETT: You traveling by yourself?

(Mulder glances down at the bullet hole in his pants, then back up at his face.)

You live in D.C.?

(Mulder moves his hand under his coat.)

MULDER: There's a weapon pointed at you right now. If I shoot you at this range, it wouldn't just hit you in the leg. If you so much as raise your arms off that armrest, I'm going to test that theory.

SCOTT GARRETT: What if you miss?

MULDER: I won't.

SCOTT GARRETT: Do you know what happens when a plane suddenly depressurizes at thirty-thousand feet, Mister Mulder? After the cabin fills with fog and all light objects, anything not tied down...

(Mulder sighs.)

...and including your weapon, go flying toward the breach?

MULDER: A pretty lady comes around with honey-roasted peanuts?

SCOTT GARRETT: Presuming the pilot... is even able to keep control of the plane, I put on the lightweight parachute I just stowed in the overhead bin and go out the emergency exit... with the knapsack you're holding.

MULDER: What if the pilot can't get control of the plane? Then you die too.

SCOTT GARRETT: A man, if he's any man at all, knows he must be ready to sacrifice himself to that which is greater than he.

(Mulder laughs to himself.)

MULDER: I'm sure all the other passengers on this plane would appreciate dying for your noble philosophy.

SCOTT GARRETT: Look out your window, Agent Mulder. You see the lights? Now, imagine if one of those lights flickered off. You'd hardly notice, would you? A dozen... two dozen lights extinguished. Is it worth sacrificing the future, the lives of millions, to keep a few lights on?

MULDER: What is this?

(He looks down at the knapsack, as does Garrett.)

SCOTT GARRETT: Stolen property.

MULDER: It's an alien energy source, isn't it? What is it, cold fusion? Over-unity energy? What could be worth killing all those passengers on Flight five-forty-nine?

SCOTT GARRETT: The cause of that crash has been determined as human error.

MULDER: I'm going to see you pay for that error... along with you and your employer and the government that finances its contracts. I want you to stand up very slowly and move to the back of the plane. We're going to go to the bathroom.

(Garrett looks at him. Mulder leans in and whispers.)

Move.

(Garrett stands and Mulder directs him to the bathroom. Garrett walks in and Mulder closes the door. After putting on his suit jacket, Mulder picks up the knapsack and moves the stewardesses' drink cart in front of the bathroom door, holding Garrett in. He picks up the airplane telephone. Cut to Scully, who is walking down the terminal in the airport Mulder is going to when her phone rings.)

SCULLY: Scully.

MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me.

SCULLY: Mulder, where are you?

(Cut to Mulder.)

MULDER: I'm standing outside an airplane bathroom where I've got the man who shot Pendrell locked up.

(Cut to Scully, who stops walking in shock.)

SCULLY: What?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: Yeah, and it looks like I'm going to miss the in-flight movie. Something starring Steve Guttenberg.

SCULLY: Mulder, did you get on that flight...

(Cut to Scully, who covers her other ear to drown out the noise in the terminal.)

...that you said you were getting on?

MULDER: Uh, yeah.

(Cut to Mulder.)

Everything's going according to plan, but I think you should alert Skinner anyway, just in case. I don't want to take any chances of getting this guy off the plane.

(Cut to Scully.)

And I don't think you do either.

SCULLY: Right.

(Cut to Mulder, who checks his watch. It's not moving.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully.

(Cut to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah?

(Cut back to Mulder.)

MULDER: My watch just stopped.

(He drops the phone and runs over to a stewardess.)

SCULLY: What? Mulder? Mulder?

MULDER: Excuse me.

(He grabs her by the arm, forcing her to pay attention.)

I'm a federal agent. I want you to listen to me very carefully. This plane is about to be intercepted.

STEWARDESS: Intercepted.

MULDER: Intercepted, engaged and boarded. I want you to tell the captain to initiate evasive maneuvers immediately.

(She doesn't look sure.)

SCOTT GARRETT: Put the bag down!

(Mulder spins around to see Garrett standing near the bathroom door with gun aimed directly at Mulder. People start to scream.)

Put it down on the floor.

(The people quiet down. Mulder doesn't move. Garrett slowly approaches him. He is holding the same kind of gun that the Dark Man had used. Mulder puts the knapsack down on the floor and starts to back away. Suddenly, the plane is rocked as if it had collided with something. Mulder and Garrett are both nearly thrown off their feet as women and children scream loudly. The stewardess falls. Garrett tries to stay upright and keep his gun on Mulder, who stands. A loud buzzing starts and the power cuts, but a bright light shines in from the right. Garrett slowly approaches Mulder, holding his gun, and kneels slowly. He is parallel to the door, where most of the light is coming in, as he picks up the bag. Mulder whips out his gun as the plane shakes.)

MULDER: Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Drop it!

(Garrett refuses to listen. The door shakes. The woman screaming next to the door sounds like a distant echo. Mulder looks at the door.)

Hey! Let it go!

(Garrett looks at Mulder, scared out of his wits but still keeping his resolve.)

Let it go!

(Garrett looks towards the door. Mulder tries to fire the gun, but it does not fire. The plane stops moving. The door is pulled off it's hinges. The light envelopes the cabin.)



SCENE 10
WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT; WASHINGTON, D.C.

(The plane lands and pulls in to the terminal gate. Scully and Skinner run up the stairs nearby the gate and run down into the plane, followed by four agents. The men and the women of the plane calmly collect their things and start out. Scully makes her way through the crowd to Mulder, who is still sitting, looking out the window.)

SCULLY: Mulder. Where is he?

MULDER: He's not here.

(Mulder stands and steps into the aisle.)

SCULLY: What do you mean? You said you had him on this plane. You said you had what Max Fenig had, the stolen part.

(Mulder takes her wrist and looks at her watch. It reads around 10:56. Skinner walks over and Mulder looks up at him.)

MULDER: What time do you have?

(Skinner looks at his watch.)

SKINNER: Ten fifty-six.

(Mulder looks at his watch. It reads 10:47. Scully looks at Mulder, realizing what has happened. He shows the watch to Scully.)

Would you like to tell me what's going on here, Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: I don't think you want to know the answer.

(She walks out past Skinner, sighing slightly. Mulder opens the overhead compartment and looks at the parachute Garrett left.)

SKINNER: Is this man on the plane?

MULDER: I think he got the connecting flight.

(He slams it shut and walks out, leaving Skinner confused. Max starts to talk over the scene.)

MAX FENIG: But... but nobody ever finds out about it. I mean, there...



SCENE 11
BARNES CORNERS, NEW YORK

(Another tape of Max is playing. He is still talking next to his camper.)

There are scientists in Finland right now who say that they've detected antigravity over the surface of a, a spinning superconducting disc...

(He laughs.)

Technology that is supposedly twenty or thirty years down the road like over-unity energy, um, massless displacement current from cold fusion that we need for space travel. I know, thanks to my inside sources, that this technology, in fact, exists.

(Max talks very excitedly as usual.)

I've seen military aircraft using it hovering right over my trailer.

(He points to the sky above his trailer.)

Why is the U.S. government keeping these facts a secret?

(Sharon watches the tape, smiling.)

I intend to expose these facts to the people. I mean, I'm just one man...

(She turns off the television. Mulder and Scully look at her. She smiles widely.)

SHARON GRAFFIA: These tapes, you don't mind if I keep them?

MULDER: No, I think you, you should consider yourself the sole curator of the Max Fenig Rolling Multimedia Library and Archive, and you should probably get tax-exempt status as soon as you can. This stuff could be worth something someday.

SHARON GRAFFIA: I want to thank you for helping me out, for all you've done.

SCULLY: Max would have wanted it that way. You lost somebody very close to you.

SHARON GRAFFIA: So did you.

(She nods slightly and smiles. Scully manages a small smile, glances at Mulder, and walks out. Outside, Scully is staring up at the stars when Mulder walks out.)

MULDER: You thinking about Pendrell?

SCULLY: I realized I didn't even know his first name.

(She chuckles slightly.)

SCULLY: I actually was thinking about, uh...

(She looks down at the keychain.)

This gift that you gave me for my birthday. You never got to tell me why you gave it to me or what it means... but I think I know. I think that you appreciate that there are extraordinary men and women and... extraordinary moments when history leaps forward on the backs of these individuals... that what can be imagined can be achieved... that you must dare to dream... but that there's no substitute for perseverance and hard work... and teamwork... because no one gets there alone... and that, while we commemorate the... the greatness of these events and the individuals who achieve them, we cannot forget the sacrifice of those who make these achievements and leaps possible.

(She sighs, Mulder watching.)

MULDER: I just thought it was a pretty cool keychain.

(Scully chuckles. They walk off together. The stars are shining brightly tonight.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

(On a dark and damp night, an old man runs frantically through the campus, looking for someone. he passes a clock that shows 11:40. He sees two young men, Jason and Lucas, walking toward him and runs toward them. The two young men are having a heated discussion.)

JASON: You know what he's capable of. Please! McFarland's going to turn this into a witch hunt. And who do you think he's going to burn at the stake?

LUCAS: Yeah, well you should have thought of that before you published your results.

JASON: No, you should have come to me before you went to McFarland!

LUCAS: I did, Jason, more than once, but you ...

JASON: That's bull!

LUCAS: ... you didn't want to hear anything I had to say. You never did.

JASON: So you deliberately went behind my back.

(The old man reaches them and grabs Lucas by the arm.)

LUCAS: I did exactly ... (to Old Man) What? What?

OLD MAN: (to Lucas) I need to talk to you.

JASON: Excuse us, please.

OLD MAN: That street is dangerous.

LUCAS: (to Old Man) Right. Thank you. We'll be fine. (to Jason) Look, I'm not gonna lie about this.

JASON: I'm not asking you to lie.

LUCAS: Then what are you asking me to do?

OLD MAN: I've travelled a long way.

LUCAS: (to Old Man) Here, what, you want some money, is that it? Here. Here's a dollar, it's all I have.

(The old man grabs Lucas by the arm again. Jason tries to pull him away.)

OLD MAN: No. No. Listen to me!

JASON: Hey! Hey! ...

OLD MAN: I'm trying to save your life.

JASON: ... Hey! Take it easy. Calm down.

LUCAS: Let go!

(In the scuffle, Lucas drops his books to the ground. A campus security vehicle stops alongside them and a security cop gets out to investigate.)

SECURITY COP: What's the problem here?

LUCAS: (pointing at the old man) This old guy is harassing me.

JASON: No, he's just a little bit agitated.

OLD MAN: No, he's going to die. at exactly 11:46. The bus ...

SECURITY COP: We're all gonna die, pop. Come on, let's go sleep it off.

(The security cop grabs the old man by the arm and pushes him toward the car.)

OLD MAN: No!

SECURITY COP: Come with me ...

OLD MAN: Jason!

SECURITY COP: ... You'll feel better in the morning.

OLD MAN: Don't let him cross the street!

SECURITY COP: All right.

OLD MAN: His papers, he won't see the bus! at 11:46!

SECURITY COP: All right, into the car.

OLD MAN: Stop him! No! Jason!

(The security officer pushes the old man into the back seat of the car and closes the door.)

JASON: How did he know my name?

LUCAS: How the hell should I know?

(Lucas has retrieved his books and starts back down the street. The security vehicle pulls away, with the old man continuing to shout at them from the back seat.)

OLD MAN: Stop him! You've got to stop him! You don't have to die! You're gonna die! Stop him now! Stop him now!

(Jason has watched the security vehicle pass by him. He then runs to catch up with Lucas.)

JASON: Lucas? Wait! Come on, man, give me a chance!

LUCAS: We have got nothing left to talk about.

(They reach the intersection with another street and Lucas turns one way. Jason is frustrated and turns the other way and walks up the street. Ahead, he sees a bus turn onto the street and approach him. Remembering what the old man said, he turns around and sees Lucas walking away. He looks at his watch and the time is 11:45. The rain has picked up, and Lucas has stopped at the edge of the curb and is trying to open his umbrella, but he drops his books out onto the street, just beyond a parked van.)

JASON: Lucas!

LUCAS: Damn it! [According to the subtitles. The actual word said sure sounds like the s-word.]

(Jason starts running toward Lucas. Lucas is kneeling on the street, just beyond the curb, picking up his books. The bus is approaching, but the van keeps Lucas from seeing it. The bus driver sees Jason running down the street but can't see Lucas because of the van. jason passes a clock that advances to 11:46.)

JASON: Lucas! Lucas!

(Lucas has picked up his books, but one paper has fallen farther out into the street. He steps out beyond the van, into the bus's path, to retrieve it, just as Jason gets within a few feet of him.)

JASON: Lucas! No!

(Jason is too late. The bus slams into Lucas. The driver stops. Because of the van and the poor visibility, it looked to him like Jason pushed Lucas out into the street. He looks at Lucas, lying motionless in the street and bleeding heavily from the head. He turns to confront Jason.)

BUS DRIVER: What'd you do to him? You pushed him! You pushed him right in front of me! You killed him! What the hell did you do?

(Jason stares at Lucas's body in shock. He looks at his wristwatch and the time is 11:46.)

SCENE 2
MULDER'S OFFICE

(Mulder is seated at his desk, while Scully is looking through a case file and at pictures from the scene of the accident.)

MULDER: His name was Lucas Menand, a post-doctoral fellow at MIT. He was a bright and promising researcher, a life dedicated to science cut short by an unfortunate bus accident.

SCULLY: Cause of death was massive head trauma, pronounced on site. But according to the bus driver, it was no accident?

MULDER: He claims that Menand was pushed, by a suspect identified as Jason Nichols (he hands Scully a police photo of Jason), an associate professor of biology as well as Menand's academic advisor.

SCULLY: Says here in the police report they'd been seen arguing earlier that evening, but Jason Nichols has refused to tell police about what.

MULDER: Hmmm ... sounds like a motive, doesn't it?

SCULLY: Between that and the bus driver's statement, why am I looking at this?

MULDER: Would you like to hear his alibi?

(Mulder uses the remote control to start a video tape of Jason's police interrogation.)

JASON (on video): If I wanted to kill him, you think this is how I'd do it?

INTERROGATOR (on video): Then what were you doing, Mr. Nichols?

JASON (on video): Trying to save him!

INTERROGATOR (on video): From getting hit by the bus.

JASON (on video): I told you! There was a man, some old guy, who said it would happen! He warned Lucas about the bus! He knew the exact time and place! He tried telling us! He knew my name!

(Mulder stops the video.)

SCULLY: That's his alibi, that some old man came and warned him that his colleague was gonna die?

MULDER: Well, he goes on to tell a pretty convincing narrative and to give a rather detailed description of the old man.

SCULLY: What was he wearing, a long black robe and carrying a scythe?

MULDER: Well, not when campus security picked him up.

SCULLY: He was arrested?

MULDER: Minutes before the accident, according to Jason Nichols. Packed into a security vehicle, trying to warn Nichols even as he was being hauled away.

SCULLY: Has anybody talked to him?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Has anybody talked to the campus security officer?

MULDER: Can't.

SCULLY: Why not?

MULDER: He's dead.

SCULLY: Of what?



SCENE 3
BOSTON MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE, 11:35 AM

(Scully, Mulder and an autopsy doctor enter an examination room.)

AUTOPSY DOCTOR: I haven't been able to make a definitive determination as to cause or time of death. There's been some internal disagreement over how to proceed.

SCULLY: You mean, with the autopsy?

AUTOPSY DOCTOR: Yes ... but mostly, rather to cut or to saw. (he uncovers the body) You see why we didn't put him in refrigeration.

(The face and hands of the body are frozen in place, covered with frost.)

MULDER: Have you ever seen a body in such an advanced hypothermic state?

SCULLY: Hypothermic? Mulder, this man's an icicle. Did you see this? (points to the ear) His ear. It looks like something's been inserted in it.

AUTOPSY DOCTOR: Something has. I took his temperature. I don't know if the reading was accurate, but the thermometer said his body temp was 15 degrees Fahrenheit.

(The doctor hands Scully an electric thermometer. She inserts the probe into the body's ear.)

MULDER: Where was he found?

AUTOPSY DOCTOR: On campus, inside his patrol car. Parked just off Adams, with one wheel on the curb. Police also found an empty gin bottle under the driver's seat. Apparently, he had a history. He'd been cited for drinking on duty. You'd assume he'd passed out and froze to death, but the low temperature for last night was 28.

(The thermometer beeps and Scully reads a value of 8 degrees.)

SCULLY: And now, his body temperature is 8 degrees.

MULDER: You mean he's actually getting colder.

AUTOPSY DOCTOR: Like I said, we're a little betwixt and between on how to go forward here. We'd be happy to take your lead on it.

SCULLY: I think we're gonna need some time ourselves.

(The doctor leaves.)

MULDER: So what's your medical opinion, Scully?

SCULLY: Well, my best guess would be that he's been exposed to some kind of chemical refrigerant, like liquid nitrogen, possibly even ingested it.

MULDER: Well, you see what happens when you drink and drive?

SCULLY: I don't know what else to say, Mulder, except that what this doesn't do is add any credence whatsoever to the suspect's alibi that the old man was on the scene.

MULDER: Maybe we should ask Jason Nichols if he can explain this.

SCULLY: What if he can't?

MULDER: We'll just hope that he keeps until Thanksgiving.



SCENE 4
6TH PRECINCT, 12:22 PM

(Mulder approaches an interview room and, through the window, sees Jason inside talking to a young woman, Lisa.)

LISA: This is serious, Jason. This couldn't be more serious. They're talking about charging you with second degree murder. (Lisa looks behind her and sees Mulder standing outside) I'll call you as soon as I speak to a lawyer.

(She leaves and Mulder enters.)

JASON: Are you from the FBI?

MULDER: Yeah. Special Agent Mulder. (they shake hands) Is that your girlfriend?

JASON: Yeah.

MULDER: Thanks for seeing me. I know your attorney advised you against it, so I appreciate it.

JASON: I just want to talk to somebody who's going to listen to me. Somebody who's going to tell me they can find that old man.

MULDER: Yeah, people out there looking for him.

JASON: Who? Campus police?

MULDER: I'm sure you know that the man who allegedly detained the man you described is now dead.

JASON: So, are they going to try and blame me for that one, too?

MULDER: Well, not unless, uh, you're capable of killing a man by flash freezing him.

JASON: What?

MULDER: The security officer who's now in the morgue has a body temperature a little south of Frosty the Snow Man.

JASON: (annoyed) You think that's funny?

MULDER: Do I think what's funny?

JASON: (angrily) Coming in here and trying to screw with my head!

MULDER: Does this have something to do with you and Lucas Menand?

JASON: Look! He's the one that had been threatening me, OK!

MULDER: He threatened your life?

JASON: My reputation.

MULDER: How'd he do that?

JASON: By saying he would go public with his claim that I'd falsified data on my research paper.

MULDER: Had you?

JASON: No. (pauses) The theory was sound. If my interpretation of certain data was a little lax, it's because I've been under pressure to produce results. My NSA grant is up for renewal. And Lucas knew how damaging his allegations would be.

MULDER: Was Lucas Menand up for the same grant?

(Jason pauses, then nods.)

MULDER: And what research would this grant have funded?

JASON: Cryobiology. I study the effects of freezing temperatures on biological systems.

(Mulder's cell phone rings.)

MULDER: Oh! Excuse me. (he steps outside) (to phone) Mulder.

(Scully is calling from the examination room.)

SCULLY: Has Nichols said anything?

MULDER: No, I'm right in the middle of it.

SCULLY: Well, I think we may be filing a second murder charge against him.

MULDER: Security officer?

SCULLY: I found Nichols' right thumbprint on his uniform, and forensics also matched his with the prints they lifted off the interior of the patrol car. I think the old man in this story is gonna be Jason Nichols serving 25 to life in a federal prison.



SCENE 5
HOTEL JAMES MONROE, 6:05 PM

(The hotel lobby is very busy. The desk clerk gets off the phone and turns to a young man, Dr. Yonechi, standing at the desk.)

DESK CLERK: I'm sorry, sir, there's nothing more we can do.

DR. YONECHI: My name is Yonechi.

DESK CLERK: Yes sir, you've told me. But I'm not finding a reservation under that name.

DR. YONECHI: But this is where I am supposed to stay.

DESK CLERK: I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what else to tell you.

(The old man approaches the desk.)

OLD MAN: Dr. Yonechi?

DR. YONECHI: Yes?

OLD MAN: There's been a misunderstanding. I'm afraid my assistant made a reservation at the wrong hotel, so I came here myself to make sure you, uh, you got a room. It's, uh, it's a good room with a view of the river.

DR. YONECHI: You are not, uh, Dr. Nichols?

OLD MAN: He apologizes. He was not able to be here to meet you yourself, so he asked me to come in his place.

DR. YONECHI: Excuse me, but who are you?

OLD MAN: A great admirer of your work.

(At another hotel, the bellman opens the door to a room for Dr. Yonechi, who is followed by the old man.)

BELLMAN: (to Yonechi) Here we go, sir.

DR. YONECHI: Thank you.

BELLMAN: (to old man) After you, sir.

OLD MAN: No. Go ahead.

(The bellman steps inside. The old man stands at the door, pulls out a handkerchief and wipes his forehead.)

BELLMAN: (to Yonechi) If you need anything, just give us a call. Here you are, sir. (hands him the room key) Have a good evening, sir.

(The bellman leaves. Yonechi sees the old man at the door, still wiping his face and neck.)

DR. YONECHI: Are you sick?

OLD MAN: No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

DR. YONECHI: May I get you some water?

OLD MAN: If it's no trouble.

DR. YONECHI: Please, come in.

(The old man enters and closes the door. Yonechi is getting a glass of water for him.)

OLD MAN: The, uh, mixup with the reservation? It was actually my fault.

DR. YONECHI: Your fault?

OLD MAN: But I owe you so much.

DR. YONECHI: For what?

OLD MAN: Your contribution to my work. Vitrification. You were the one who solved the problem.

DR. YONECHI: (puzzled) Me? No, not yet. No one has solved vitrification.

OLD MAN: Oh, yes, Yonni. You found a way to substitute water with a sugar - trehalose. Your paper ... it changed everything.

(The old man has pulled a small medical device, with a pointed end, out of his pocket. As Yonechi looks at the glass of water, the old man grabs his other hand and injects something into it, leaving a small blood mark. Yonechi is startled and drops the glass.)

OLD MAN: I am sorry, Yonni. But this is the only way.

(Yonechi sees that his hand is turning white and frosting over. He screams in pain.)

DR. YONECHI: Aaaauuuuggggghhhhh!



SCENE 6
HOTEL ROOM

(Scully is in the hotel room looking at Yonechi's body. Like the first victim, he appears frozen. She notes the drop of blood on his hand as Mulder approaches.)

MULDER: I just spoke with the bellman who brought up the luggage.

SCULLY: What did he say?

MULDER: The iceman cometh. Dr. Yonechi was accompanied by a man in his seventies. It's a description confirmed by the desk clerk. They're working with a composite artist on a sketch right now.

SCULLY: Sounds like Jason Nichols has an accomplice.

MULDER: It sounds like that.

SCULLY: More than that, Mulder, it makes sense. Science is a high-stakes game. Jason Nichols is trying to eliminate his competitors and he's succeeding.

MULDER: Yeah, but what if he's being set up?

SCULLY: He's a cryobiologist. He freezes things for a living. How many people can do that?

MULDER: Just about anybody who's up for that grant money could.

SCULLY: I want to show you something. (she hands him a folder with a specra analysis) This is what's called a nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Dr. Yonechi had a spot of blood on the heel of his hand - a pin prick, something that might have been caused by a small gauge hypodermic needle. Now, I found the same thing on the security officer. This is the analysis.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Well, no one at the lab would even hazard a guess, but we think it's some kind of unidentifiable chemical compound.

MULDER: A lethal injection?

SCULLY: You'll have to ask Jason Nichols.

MULDER: No, there's somebody I want to talk to first.



SCENE 7
BIO-MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITY, 10:22 PM

(Mulder and Scully enter a laboratory and, from behind, approach Lisa. She jumps when Mulder speaks to her.)

MULDER: Lisa Ianelli? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

LISA: No, I was working. Sometimes you just get lost in it.

MULDER: Yeah. You may remember me from this afternoon. I spoke with Jason.

LISA: From the FBI.

SCULLY: I'm Agent Scully. May I show you something?

LISA: Uh-huh. (Scully hands her the spectra) Where'd you get this?

SCULLY: You recognize it? (Lisa doesn't respond) Lisa, you can tell us now or we can subpoena your testimony in court. Either way, we'll find out what you know about it.

LISA: It's a kind of catalyst.

SCULLY: A catalyst for what?

LISA: A self-sustaining endothermic reaction. It's a rapid freezing agent - something Jason's been engineering for years. See, when a cell freezes, its moisture forms into ice crystals, which literally grind up the cell from the inside out. But extreme rapid freezing causes a smoother, glass-like structure to form instead. So the cell can survive being thawed. At least, according to Jason's theory.

(Lisa has walked across the lab and keyed into a secured area. Scully and Mulder follow her to a computer terminal.)

SCULLY: This compound ... has Jason actually tested it yet?

LISA: He hasn't tested it yet because it doesn't exist - except in the computer. So far the work's been limited to generating virtual chemicals - like this. (she points to a model of a molecule on the computer screen) In fact, what we're looking at here is a version of the catalyst you brought me.

SCULLY: Is it possible that he could have synthesized the compound without you knowing about it?

LISA: Not even remotely. The technology to engineer something like that is still five, ten years away - minimum.

MULDER: Not any more, apparently.

LISA: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Traces of the compound were detected in a man who was found dead last night - frozen solid.

LISA: Then there must be some kind of mistake.

SCULLY: And a, uh, a Dr. Yonechi was also found frozen to death.

LISA: What?

MULDER: In his heated hotel room.

LISA: When was this?

SCULLY: Just over two hours ago. Why is that relevant?

LISA: Because he may not be dead.

(Later, Dr. Yonechi is immersed in a controlled-temperature bath. Lisa, Mulder, Scully and a medical team surround the bath.)

LISA: What's his temp?

DOCTOR: His core temperature is up to 97.

LISA: OK. Let's take him out.

DOCTOR: And then what?

LISA: We've got to try to resuscitate him. Let's go.

DOCTOR: All right, on my count ... one ... two ... three.

(They pull Yonechi from the bath and put him on a table. As the medical team connects instruments, Mulder and Scully confer privately.)

SCULLY: This isn't gonna work.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: His body temperature was 8 degrees. The lowest reported body temperature ever survived by a human being was 70.

MULDER: Well, if he's already dead, then he's got nothing to lose.

DOCTOR: OK, we're hooked up. All right, Dr. Ianelli, we're gonna want to start with 300 joules and an amp of epi.

(A nurse gives Yonechi an intra-cardial injection as the defribulator charges.)

TECHNICIAN 1: Charging.

DOCTOR: Clear?

TECHNICIAN 1: Clear.

(They zap him with the defribulator.)

TECHNICIAN 2: Still no pulse.

DOCTOR: Go to 360. Clear?

TECHNICIAN 1: Clear.

(They zap him again.)

TECHNICIAN 2: No response.

DOCTOR: Give him another amp of intracardial epi and atropine 1 milligram. (the injection is given) Try again at 360. Clear?

TECHNICIAN 1: Clear.

(They zap him a third time and the instruments show a pulse.)

DOCTOR: He's got a rhythm.

LISA: Dr. Yonechi, you're in a prototype frostbite bay in Cambridge, Mass. You've been unconscious for almost 12 hours. Dr. Yonechi? My name is Lisa Ianelli.

(Yonechi is breathing and gasping from the tube inserted into his mouth.)

SCULLY: Don't try and talk right now. We've inserted a tube down your throat to help you breathe. Try not to fight the machine. Let it breathe for you.

(Yonechi's gasps become louder and he starts to convulse.)

LISA: Something's wrong.

MULDER: Scully, look at his temperature.

(The instrument reads 106 degrees. Scully feels his forehead.)

SCULLY: Oh my God. He's on fire. He's having febrile siezures.

(Yanechi continues to groan loudly and convulse. His skin shows signs of blistering.)

DOCTOR: This can't be right. He's burning up. Hold him down! Hold him down!

(Yonechi bursts into flames and thrashes about on the table.)

TECHNICIAN: Oh my God! Oh my God!

(Later, firemen are in the room. Yonechi's charred body is on the table. Mulder, Scully and Lisa are off to the side.)

SCULLY: Lisa, what happened? What, what could have happened to create such a violent cellular reaction?

LISA: I don't know. All I can think is the compound used to freeze him must have been unstable.

SCULLY: So raising his body temperature may have catalyzed an opposite reaction, heating him internally.

LISA: Uh-huh. I question now if we should have removed him from the tub. I think we might have saved him.

MULDER: I think the real question is how somebody could have had access to a compound that doesn't exist.

LISA: I'm sorry. I need to talk to Jason.

(She leaves.)

(Later, Lisa is riding a bus across town. She looks behind her and sees the old man in the bus. She gets off the bus and heads down a street. The old man gets off as well and follows at a discreet distance. Lisa approaches a mirror along the street and sees the old man following her. She walks up the steps of a building and goes inside. The old man struggles to keep up, following her up a staircase. Lisa goes through a pair of fire doors upstairs. Seconds later, the old man goes through the same doors but Lisa is waiting behind them. She calls to him after he has passed.)

LISA: Who are you? I said, who are you? What do you want? Why are you following me?

(The old man pauses for a second, but then continues to walk forward, not looking back at her. Lisa follows him.)

OLD MAN: Unless I'm mistaken, you're the one following me.

LISA: I saw you outside.

OLD MAN: I'm afraid you're confusing me with someone else.

LISA: You're the man Jason saw, aren't you? (she grabs his arm and turns him around) You killed Lucas Menand and Dr. Yonechi.

OLD MAN: (grabbing her by the wrist) And I can kill you.

LISA: Let go of me.

(Lisa sees that the old man has pulled out the injection device.)

OLD MAN: I came here to kill you.

LISA: Who are you?

(The old man stares at her with a sorrowful expression. He releases her wrist and walks away.)



SCENE 8
PUBLIC SQUARE

(Mulder, Scully and Lisa are in a public square next to a fountain. Mulder hands Lisa a police sketch that looks very similar to the old man.)

MULDER: You say he followed you off the bus?

LISA: Yes. I noticed him just before my stop.

MULDER: And you were on your way to see Jason?

LISA: Yes. I confronted him inside the library. He followed me in there. And then he grabbed me - hurt my arm.

(She shows them her wrist, which is bruised.)

SCULLY: What did he say?

LISA: That he could kill me. That that's why he was following me. He threatened me with some kind of medical instrument.

SCULLY: But he just let you go? (she nods) Lisa, if you're leaving anything out, if you're hedging the truth, you could be held accountable if Jason committed a crime.

LISA: It wasn't Jason. It was me. I falsified the data to get the grant. Jason's covering for me. He's sitting in jail because of me.

MULDER: That's what he can't tell anyone?

SCULLY: But there are people who could have figured it out - Lucas Menand, Dr. Yonechi. These people are now dead.

LISA: No, it's not what you think.

SCULLY: You know who this old man is, don't you?

LISA: I don't, I swear to you.

SCULLY: But Jason does. He has to, because this man is doing what Jason can't, he's protecting your secret.

LISA: He swore to me he would never confess it to a soul.

SCULLY: If he'd lie for you, what makes you think he wouldn't lie to you.

MULDER: Scully? (they step aside for a private conversation) It doesn't really makes sense, Scully. Why would he threaten her if he's the one who's protecting her secret.

SCULLY: Because it's not just her secret. It's Jason's secret, too, and the old man is protecting Jason.

MULDER: With a medical instrument?

SCULLY: (sighs) I suppose it is an unlikely choice as a murder weapon.

MULDER: Well what if it's not a murder weapon? I'm just speculating, but what if it was designed for some other purpose?

(A policeman approaches.)

POLICEMAN: Agent Mulder? We've been canvassing the area. Hotel manager from a couple of blocks away thinks he's made your guy. It's on McKinney Street. Hotel's called The Lighthouse.

MULDER: (to policeman) Tell the unit to keep watch until we get there. (motions toward Lisa) Make sure she gets home safely.

(Mulder and Scully head off, leaving Lisa studying the police sketch.)

(Mulder and Scully approach a door at The Lighthouse. He knocks.)

MULDER: Federal agents, sir, open the door.

(There is no response. Mulder unlocks the door with a pass key, and they enter. The room shows little signs of occupancy.)

SCULLY: Are you sure this is the room?

MULDER: Hotel manager says he's been living here for five days.

SCULLY: I'm not sure if 'living' is a word I'd use on this place.

(They look around. Scully finds a note pad on the dresser. The words "Pan Oceanic flight #1701" are written on it.)

SCULLY: Yonechi's flight information was taken down on this pad.

MULDER: Hey, look at this.

(Mulder has found a somewhat crumpled photo in the drawer of the nightstand. He hands it to Scully. The photo shows Yonechi, Lisa and Jason wearing lab coats, smiling and enjoying a toast with champagne.)

SCULLY: When was this taken?

MULDER: And what's the occasion?

SCULLY: It's a celebration, but of what?

MULDER: Or something that never happened.

(He gets up to leave.)

SCULLY: What? (she catches up to him at the hall elevator) Mulder, this is a photograph. It is a documented moment in time.

MULDER: In a future that somebody is trying like hell to prevent from happening.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Think about it, Scully. If Lucas Menand never gets hit by the bus, his complaint gets heard before the grant committee. Jason Nichols loses his funding and he never gets to collaborate on his research with Dr. Yonechi. Therefore, this photograph never gets taken because this celebration never happens.

SCULLY: And if your sister is your aunt and your mother marries your uncle, you'd be your own grandpa.

MULDER: The old man couldn't save Lucas Menand, so he had to kill Dr. Yonechi.

SCULLY: OK, so this photo that was never taken, when was it never taken.

MULDER: At least five years in the future, when they first synthesized the freezing compound successfully. (he looks at the elevator and pushes the call button again) Let's take the stairs.

(They continue their converstation as they walk down the stairs and back onto the street.)

SCULLY: Mulder, the compound already exists. We have physical evidence.

MULDER: Only because the old man brought it back with him.

SCULLY: Back from where?

MULDER: From when may be the real question.

SCULLY: You're seriously suggesting that this old man is back from the future?

MULDER: Unless you have a better explanation for how he knew exactly when and how Lucas Menand was gonna be killed, why Jason Nichol's fingerprints are inside that patrol car, and how he knew Lisa Ianelli's secret.

SCULLY: So what you're saying here is the old man is ...

MULDER: Jason Nichols. Although common sense may rule out the possibility of time travel, the laws of quantum physics certainly do not. In case you forgot, that's from your graduate thesis. (smiling at her) You were a lot more open-minded when you were a youngster.

SCULLY: I know what I wrote, Mulder. I also know that the laws of physics would permit the theoretical possibility of time travel, but the limits of human endurance would prevent such a trip from ever happening.

MULDER: Well, there's one sure to prove that theoretical possiblity.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: Show this photograph to Lisa Ianelli and ask her if it was ever taken.

(Later, the old man gets off the elevator at his hotel. He is panting and staggers down the hall to his room. He enters and kneels beside the bed. He injects himself in the wrist with the injectin device and his breathing slowly becomes less labored. Behind him, Lisa enters.)

LISA: Jason? I don't understand. How is this possible?

OLD MAN: Because you made it possible. It was you.

LISA: How? I need to know.

(The old man slowly gets up and turns to her. He sits on the bed.)

OLD MAN: Thirty years ago - ten years from now - you'll be at a conference in Zurich. You'll meet a man named McGuane who's just discovered the first evidence of tachyons - subatomic particles that can travel faster than the speed of light and go back in time - but only for a few seconds and only at a temperature of absolute zero. But from that, and from your correspondence with McGuane, you'll have an idea. A revelation.

LISA: What revelation?

OLD MAN: One so remarkable, it would change the course of history.

LISA: Then why did you ... you said you came back to kill me.

OLD MAN: But I couldn't do it.

(He extends his left hand to her. She takes it.)

LISA: You're cold. Jason ...

OLD MAN: Yes.

(She gasps as he injects her wrist with the device.)

LISA: Uhhh!

(She falls as the old man appears to be crying. Her face turns frosty.)



SCENE 9
POLICE STATION

(At the police station, Jason is at a desk as Mulder approaches.)

CLERK: (to Jason) Sign here.

MULDER: Jason.

JASON: What are you doing here?

MULDER: I arranged for your bail.

JASON: I assumed it was Lisa.

MULDER: Well, that's why I'm here. Something's happened to her.

JASON: What are you talking about.

MULDER: I think it's something you should see for yourself. She's at the Medical Research Facility.

(They start down the hall.)

JASON: Was it the old man?

MULDER: Yes.

JASON: Why haven't you found him yet? Who the hell is he?

(Mulder stops him.)

MULDER: Look, Jason, I don't expect you to get your mind around this completely right now ...

JASON: What?

MULDER: The man we're looking for - the old man - he's you.

(Later, they are headed across town in Mulder's car. Mulder hands Jason the photograph.)

MULDER: If that photo is indicative of a pattern, you may be his next target. It puts a whole new spin on being your own worst enemy, huh?

JASON: Except that I've never met Dr. Yonechi and neither has Lisa. So this must have been altered somehow.

MULDER: Not according to the photo specialist that I had examine it. As far as she can tell, it's the real McCoy.

JASON: Then maybe you should get a second opinion, because I'm not buying your story.

MULDER: Jason, it's your story.

JASON: It's science fiction.

MULDER: So was your rapid freezing agent until two days ago. Now why don't you just consider the evidence as a scientist. How could the old man come to possess a compound that you yourself admit doesn't exist?

JASON: Whoever he is, why would he be trying to prevent my compound from being developed?

MULDER: I'm not sure of that yet.

JASON: But you have a theory.

MULDER: Well, I think it has something to do with the practical application of your compound, though I don't know what that is yet.

JASON: Involving time travel.

MULDER: Physicists like Stephen Hawking have hypothesized the existence of wormholes and closed time loops, actual portals through which matter can travel backward through time. Although, phenomena like extreme heat and gravity would render the trip lethal for any organism.

JASON: So you're saying the properties of my compound will make it possible?

MULDER: Eventually, yes, that's what I'm saying.

JASON: But why stop time travel?

MULDER: That's what I'm hoping the old man can tell us.

JASON: Agent Mulder, if any of this is true ... then what happened to Lisa ... is really my fault.



SCENE 10
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITY

(Jason and Mulder enter.)

JASON: Going up to the cryo lab.

SECURITY GUARD: Mmmm, hmmm.

(Jason places his hand on a palm scanner. The security door slides open.)

SECURITY GUARD: Hey, wait a sec. (looking at his computer screen) Are you Dr. Jason Nichols?

JASON: That's right.

SECURITY GUARD: Then something's wrong. It says you're already in the building.

MULDER: Listen to me, Jason. I need you to get to Scully and tell her that he's here. She's in the frostbite bay with Lisa. Can you do that? All right.

(They go in opposite directions.)

(In another part of the facility, Scully and the medical team are attempting to revive Lisa. She is on the table.)

DOCTOR: Clear?

NURSE 1: Clear.

(They zap her with the defribillator.)

SECURITY GUARD: Let's give her another amp of epinephrine and we'll go again at 360.

NURSE 1: Charging.

NURSE 2: Epi given.

DOCTOR: Clear?

NURSE 3: Everybody clear.

(They zap her again.)

NURSE 1: Increase of dmso.

DOCTOR: We have a rhythm.

NURSE 1: Pulse.

DOCTOR: (to Scully) Now what?

(Scully sees that Lisa's body temperature has risen to 105 degrees.)

SCULLY: Get her back in the tub. Now.

DOCTOR: All right, let's disconnect and get her back in, right away.

NURSE 3: Here we go.

DOCTOR: Let's go.

NURSE 1: All right, here we go.

DOCTOR: Easy ...

SCULLY: How hot's the reading now?

(Lisa is lowered into the tub.)

NURSE 1: 106 ... 107

(In another part of the facility, Mulder crosses a laboratory to the door of a small room in which a researcher is working at a computer. He taps on the door and flashes his badge, and the researcher opens the door.)

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: Is there a problem?

MULDER: Has anybody been through here in the last hour?

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: Well, there was a maintenance guy who fixed the fan, but, other than that, it's just been me.

MULDER: No, I'm looking for an older man, a man in his mid-seventies maybe.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: No, I haven't seen anybody like that. Why, does this have something to do with Dr. Nichols?

MULDER: Do you work with him?

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: I'm one of his research assistants.

MULDER: You have access to his files.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: Yeah.

MULDER: I'd like to pull up some information about his rapid freezing compound.

(The research assistant sits at the computer and begins to work. Mulder's cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.

(Scully is calling from the frostbite bay.)

SCULLY: We've resuscitated her, Mulder. Her body temperature is still high but it seems to have stabilized.

MULDER: Did Jason help?

SCULLY: He's not here.

MULDER: All right, he should have been there five minutes ago, Scully.

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: What is this?

SCULLY: Where are you?

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: This is crazy.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Let me get back to you, Scully. (he hangs up) (to research assistant) What?

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: It's Dr. Nichols' files. They're totally whacked.

MULDER: What do you mean, "whacked"?

RESEARCH ASSISTANT: His data ... it's gone. It's like somebody's completely erased it from the mainframe.

(Mulder runs out of the laboratory and down the hall.)

(In the computer center, the old man is typing frantically on a computer. He wipes his forehead as he works. Jason appears across the room.)

JASON: I knew I'd find you here. (the old man stops typing) I figured this is where I'd go to stop myself.

OLD MAN: I don't have much time. Please, let me finish.

(Jason approaches him and grabs his arm.)

JASON: Let you finish destroying my work?

OLD MAN: It's my work, too.

JASON: I want her back!

OLD MAN: I know.

JASON: Then tell me how to go back so I can save her. Please.

OLD MAN: I don't expect you to understand.

JASON: Understand what?

OLD MAN: What she created. What you - we - helped to create. A world without history, without hope. Where anyone can know everything that will ever happen. I've seen that world.

(Mulder is still running through the halls.)

JASON: (grabbing the old man by the collar) Tell me how to go back.

OLD MAN: I can't

JASON: (shouting) You will! Tell me!

OLD MAN: No, Jason! Try to understand!

(Mulder has reached an adjacent room, separated by a glass partition. He tries the door, but it is locked. He can see that Jason has the old man pushed up against a cabinet.)

MULDER: Jason!

JASON: Tell me how to go back so I can save her!

MULDER: Jason! (he pounds the door) She's alive, Lisa's alive! Don't hurt him! If you hurt him, we'll never know the truth! Open the door.

(Jason releases the old man and starts toward the door.)

JASON: She's ok?

(The old man, now sweating profusely, walks up behind Jason and grabs him in a bear hug.)

OLD MAN: It's better that we never were.

JASON: No!

(Jason struggles to get free but the old man holds on. Mulder grabs a fire extinguisher and starts pounding on the door with it. Just as he breaks a hole in the glass, the old man bursts into flames. He continues to hold on to Jason as they are both engulfed in flames. Jason screams, while Mulder looks helplessly through the glass.)

(Later, Lisa is being wheeled out of the facility on a stretcher by paramedics. Scully is walking alongside.)

SCULLY: Lisa? It's Dana Scully, can you hear me? (Lisa nods) You're going to be fine. We knew to keep you submerged in order to maintain your body temperature. After what happened to Dr. Yonechi, your theory about the compound's instability, well, you proved it yourself.

LISA: (whispering) He said, he said he was Jason.

SCULLY: The old man? (Lisa nods) Look, there's been some incongruous evidence. I've had difficulty explaining myself.

LISA: (still whispering) It was him, Agent Scully. It was Jason.

SCULLY: Lisa, Jason's dead. There was a fire in the mainframe room. I'm sorry. (Scully gives her a comforting look) I'll see you at the hospital.

(The paramedics hoist the stretcher into an ambulance, which then drives away. Mulder comes out of the building and joins Scully.)

SCULLY: You find the second corpse?

MULDER: No, and I'm not holding out much hope that they will, either.

SCULLY: We should put out an APB on the old man.

MULDER: They won't find him. I know what I saw, Scully, and I know what I believe happened.

SCULLY: Even if it can never be proven?

MULDER: Never? Never is a very long time, Scully, you said that yourself. "Although multidimensionality suggests infinite outcomes in an infinite number of universes, each universe can produce only one outcome."

SCULLY: I was 23 when I wrote that.

MULDER: Yeah, but I take that to mean that you were suggesting that the future can't be altered. Which means that the elder Jason Nichols' attempts to stop his own research will fail, and that eventually his compound, and time travel, will be discovered.

(Mulder walks away. Scully pauses a moment to ponder the situation, then follows him.)

(Much later, Lisa is working at a computer terminal. She has the model of Jason's compound displayed on the screen.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TABLERS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
MARTINSBURG, WEST VIRGINIA

(Amanda is being wheeled down a hospital corridor on a stretcher.)

NURSE: How ya doin' hon? Breathe deeply...just like that... there you go. You're doing great!

AMANDA: Yeah. Real great.

(A second nurse runs to catch up with the stretcher.)

SECOND NURSE: Ma'am...ma'am I need your full name and Social Security number.

AMANDA: Amanda Nelligan. 545250809.

SECOND NURSE: And your insurance carrier?

AMANDA: Atlantic Mutual.

SECOND NURSE: Great. Now is there anyone we need to contact? The father of the baby?

AMANDA: I'm not sure I can get a hold of him.

SECOND NURSE: If you give me his name I can try.

AMANDA: He's not from around here.

SECOND NURSE: Is he from out of state?

AMANDA: Another planet.

(The second nurse stops. The stretcher reaches the door of the delivery room.)

NURSE: All right, we're here now. Okay, hold on.

(In the delivery room, Amanda screams twice.)

DR ALTON PUGH: One more push. There we go. We're going to set a speed record here. There's a cute face. (to nurse) Bulb syringe. (the nurse hands him one) This is like the Indy 500 here. Here it comes - the shoulder. Good. Okay Amanda, that'll do it..

(The doctor's smile disappears. The OR nurse drops her scissors.)

DR PUGH: Oh.

OR NURSE: God.

AMANDA: (concerned) What? What is it?

DR PUGH: It's okay. She's just fine. Perfectly healthy. (Amanda smiles) No problem. Everything's going to be a-okay. You've got a healthy baby girl.

(He walks behind a curtain and holds the baby up. The baby has a tail.)

DR PUGH: Good Lord ... not another one.

SCENE 2
HIGHWAY

(Mulder and Scully are driving along the highway in the car. It is raining outside. Scully is looking at an issue of The World Weekly Informer. The main cover photo is of a baby with a monkey head, with the headline "MONKEY BABIES INVADE SMALL TOWN!" Other headlines read "Michael Jackson held captive by exotic pets!" and "ETAP bigshot busted".)

MULDER: (pointing at the monkey baby's head) I admit the photo's a little over the top, but uh, what do you think Scully?

SCULLY: No, seriously.

MULDER: Children born with vestigial tails don't interest you?

SCULLY: Caudal appendages. Fetuses have them. Their coccyx enlargens to contain the spinal fluid and then it shrinks as the child develops. Occasionally, it doesn't. It's extremely rare, but it has been known to happen.

MULDER: Five times within the last three months, all in a town with a population of less than 15,000 people? I'd say that's a little more than a statistical anomaly.

SCULLY: So would I. No, Mulder I think you're right, I think that something about this definitely warrants investigation. Only not by us. I'd say that it's a job for the local health department.

MULDER: I called around. They're already investigating.

SCULLY: So uh, so what else about this interests you? Could it be uh...(looking at the sub-headline below the monkey baby: "Did West Virginia Women Mate with Visitors from Space?") ... visitors from space?

(Mulder smiles at her.)



SCENE 3
AMANDA NELLIGAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM

(In Amanda's hospital room, Mulder and Scully are interviewing Amanda Nelligan, the mother of the baby with a tail. Mulder sits in a chair at her bedside. Scully stands behind him.)

AMANDA: The doctor said that my baby, she's gonna be fine. She's really healthy. Once she gets to be a few months old, it's just a matter of a snip.

MULDER: That's good to hear.

AMANDA: Yeah.

SCULLY: Did you experience any unusual complications during your pregnancy, Amanda? Did you undergo any kind of fertility treatment?

AMANDA: No. I wasn't trying to get pregnant. I guess you could just sort of say I'm a single mom now.

MULDER: When you were admitted you said that the baby's father was from another planet. What did you mean by that exactly?

AMANDA: You know, that he's not from this planet.

MULDER: Were you abducted?

AMANDA: Huh? No, no, he dropped by my apartment one day, and one thing sort of led to another..

MULDER: But the baby's father is an alien?

AMANDA: No, no, I didn't say he was an alien, I said he was from another planet. His name is Luke Skywalker. He's what's known as a Jedi Knight.

(Mulder leans back in his chair and looks over his shoulder at Scully.)

SCULLY: Did he have a light saber?

AMANDA: No, he didn't bring it. He did sing me a song for me though. Da dum da da da da dum... (hums the Star Wars theme)

(Mulder stands and heads for the door.)

SCULLY: (interrupts Amanda) How many times have you seen Star Wars, Amanda?

AMANDA: Three hundred and sixty eight. I should break four hundred by Memorial Day.

(Mulder exits.)

SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.

AMANDA: Oh wait a minute, wait. You know these four other babies that were born around here with tails?

SCULLY: Uh huh.

AMANDA: There couldn't be any chance Luke's the father, is there?

(Scully looks thoughtful.)

(Mulder looks in the viewing room, where Amanda's baby is wagging its tail. Scully walks down the hall, on her cell phone. Mulder walks toward her.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Okay. All right, I got it. Thank you. (she hangs up)

MULDER: Take your best shot, Scully, but I think there's more going on here than Luke Skywalker and his light saber.

SCULLY: I think you're right, Mulder. (she opens the door. Mulder stands in the hall, surprised by her response) Coming?

(In a medical room, Mulder and Scully are looking at medical charts)

HEALTH DEPARTMENT DOCTOR: Here are the PCR's we ran of the five children. We put calls into the parents. We'll blood test all the husbands hopefully by this afternoon, just to double check.

SCULLY: Good.

DOCTOR: They'll be none too happy. I have to confess, this answer seems so strangely obvious, I probably wouldn't have even checked for it. (She leaves)

MULDER: (Whispers to Scully) What answer?

SCULLY: (Points to the charts) You see here, these identical band trait matches all showing a small loss of a part of chromosome number eight? Each of these five children, born to five different women, all share the same father.

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: I should have thought of it sooner. This kind of appended birth defect is often passed on within a family.

MULDER: Meaning the father had a tail as well?

SCULLY: Though he most likely had it surgically removed somewhere along the way.

MULDER: How would this happen?

SCULLY: Birds and the bees and the monkey babies, Mulder.

MULDER: Birds do it, bees do it, even educated MD's do it. All five of these women shared the same OB-GYN, didn't they?

SCULLY: Well yeah, he's the only one in town.

MULDER: And four of the five women, the four married women not including Amanda Nelligan, were on record as receiving insemination therapy as a means of conception.

SCULLY: So you're thinking that the doctor might have something to do with it.

MULDER: So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket.



SCENE 4
OFFICE OF DR. ALTON PUGH, OB-GYN

(As Mulder and Scully pull up in front of the doctor's offices, a couple is walking toward the office and having a conversation.)

FRED: Baboo, look. Just let me handle it, okay?

BABOO: I think we should find the best lawyer we can because I definitely plan to sue. That's all I'm saying, Fred.

FRED: Baboo look, just let me do the talking. All right?

BABOO: Okay. Just tell him we're going to sue.

FRED: (seeing Mulder and Scully also heading into the office) Oh! You too, huh?

(Mulder and Scully exchange a glance. In the office's hallway, there are several other angry couples surrounding the doctor)

FRED: What the hell did you do?

BABOO: Yeah, Alton!

OTHER VOICES: Yeah! What did you do?

DR ALTON: I didn't do anything. Now folks, we're going to figure this out here, I promise. Look, everybody just relax.

FRED: Don't you tell me to relax. What the hell happened to my sperm?

MAN #2: Yeah mine too!

WOMAN #2: Whose did you use?

MAN #2: It's bad enough having a boy with a tail and you find out it's not even yours! (looking back at Mulder and Scully walking in) For God's sake Alton, how many of us are there?

MULDER: Uh, I'm Special Agent Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and this is Agent Scully. (he flashes his badge)

FRED: Great! Arrest this son of a bitch.

MAN #2: Yeah, arrest this guy.

SCULLY: Settle down, nobody's going to be arrested.

MULDER: Yeah, we're just here to find out what's going on.

FRED: Alton didn't use my sperm.

DR ALTON: I most certainly did. Each of you women was inseminated with your husband's own sperm, and nobody else's.

MULDER: Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases?

DR ALTON: It was a sperm motility issue. The intrauterine process that I used has about a 40% chance of success. I was surprised, it seemed to work all four times. Now the only thing I can think of is...

MAN #3: What?

DR ALTON: Maybe it never worked at all.

BABOO: (moving in on Alton) What are you saying, Alton?

FRED: Honey ...

BABOO: No, I want to know what he means by that. I haven't been with a man since 1989, I mean not counting you.

(Mulder wanders off down the hall.)

DR ALTON: Look, I'm not accusing anyone of anything. I'm just saying this latest patient of mine who just gave birth to a baby with a tail, she didn't even undergo insemination. So you folks are blaming the wrong baby doctor!

(Mulder walks into a room and notices a janitor fixing the sink.)



SCENE 5
ROOM

MULDER: Hey.

EDDIE: Hey.

(Eddie bends over to get under the sink, and Mulder sees scar tissue at the top of Eddie's butt crack.)

MULDER: Excuse me. I'm an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'd like to ask you a few questions.

EDDIE: Uh, yeah okay.

(He suddenly bolts out of the room and toward the front of the clinic. Mulder sighs and rolls his eyes, but takes off after him. He tackles him in the hallway, not far from Scully and the rest of the crowd.)

MULDER: Scully, check it out. (He pulls the back of Eddie's pants back to show the scar)

WOMAN #2: Oh my God.

WOMAN #3: It's him? He's the one?



SCENE 6
INTERVIEW ROOM

(In an interview room, the paternity test results are on the table, Eddie looks at the label: "Paternity test: Van Blundt, Edward H.")

SCULLY: Five out of five.

EDDIE: They spelled my name wrong. It's Van Blundht with a silent "H". B-l-u-n-d-H-t.

MULDER: Oh, we'll get right on that.

EDDIE: Lots of people spell it wrong. It's like Dutch or something. Can I go now?

SCULLY: No. There's a few things we have to clear up first.

MULDER: Yeah. Like how'd you do it?

EDDIE: What do you mean, how'd I do it?

SCULLY: You're the father of five children Mr Van Blundht. Is that not news to you? (Eddie shrugs) Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm?

EDDIE: You make it sound so romantic.

MULDER: So you're saying there was romance involved?

EDDIE: Why is that so hard to believe? Just cause I was born with a tail no woman would want me? Maybe I got...personality. Ever think of that?

SCULLY: You had sex with these women? How is it that none of them have any recollection whatsoever of that happening?

EDDIE: Look, I'm not saying anything one way or another. I'm just saying hypothetically, if some women wanted to have kids, their husbands weren't...capable, and everybody was happy and no one got hurt, well hypothetically, where's the crime?

(Scully walks out. Mulder looks at Eddie for a few moments, then picks up the test results and follows her.)

(Mulder and Scully are outside the interview room.)

MULDER: Well, if you're waiting for my usual theory as to what's going on, I don't have one.

SCULLY: I do. (crosses her hands over her chest) On, uh, on behalf of all the women in the world, I seriously doubt this is anything to do with consensual sex. I think it involved some form of Rohypnol rape.

MULDER: A tranquilizer? I didn't think of that.

SCULLY: It's been called the date rape drug. High doses of it cause a loosening of inhibitions, memory loss. Now if Van Blundht was somehow able to slip the drug to these women especially in conjunction with alcohol...

MULDER: Yeah, but when and where would he have had the opportunity to slip it to them?

SCULLY: Well he identified these women through his janitorial job at the medical park. He could have followed them anywhere, to a club, to a bar.

MULDER: Those women don't look like the type that do a lot of solo drinking.

SCULLY: I think it's enough to keep him in custody while we check it out.

(She walks away. Mulder glances at the door to the interview room and sees Eddie staring at him through the door window.)

(In the police station, Eddie is being interviewed by a police officer, who is typing his name into the computer. He spells it "Blundt".)

EDDIE: Uh, you spelled my name wrong. It's B-l-u-n-d-H-t. Silent "H".

DEPUTY: Address. (Eddie doesn't respond but stares intently at him) I strongly suggest you stop eyeballing me and tell me your address.

EDDIE: Seventeen Prospect Parkway, Martinsburg, 25401.

DEPUTY: All right, Mr Van Blund-Ht. Give me your phone number.

(Eddie doesn't respond, and the deputy looks at him. Eddie has morphed into the deputy's likeness.)

DEPUTY: What the hell?

(Eddie picks up a desk ornament - a statue of a pig in uniform - and bashes it over the head of the deputy.)

EDDIE AS DEPUTY: (looking down at the deputy) The H is silent.



SCENE 7
POLICE STATION

(A few hours later at the police station, Scully is talking to another officer. The deputy is to the side, his head wrapped in a bandage.)

OFFICER: I could have sworn Curtis clocked out hours ago. He said good night to me and everything. This morning I find him shoved underneath the desk.

SCULLY: Deputy, are you sure you don't remember what happened last night?

DEPUTY: The guy coldcocked me. Except he wasn't the guy. He was me. My head hurts.

MULDER: (Mulder rings the bell at the desk, and Scully walks over to him) I found Van Blundht's clothes in the locker room. He must have walked out of here wearing the deputy's spare uniform.

SCULLY: After hitting him over the head.

MULDER: I have a theory. Do you want to hear it?

SCULLY: Van Blundht somehow physically transformed into his captor then walked out the door leaving no one the wiser?

MULDER: Hey Scully, should we be picking out china patterns or what?

SCULLY: Mulder, why can't you just go for the simple answer? With that blow to the head the deputy might just as well have identified McGruff the crime dog as his attacker.

MULDER: What about what the sheriff saw?

SCULLY: Two men, roughly the same build, same coloring. The addition of a uniform goes a long way to explain how one person can mistake one man for another at 3 o'clock in the morning.

MULDER: Conversely my theory goes a long way to explaining how four married women could mistake Van Blundht for their husbands, and how Amanda Nelligan could think it was Luke Skywalker. We've both seen something like this before, Scully.

SCULLY: But what are you saying, that that Van Blundht is an alien?

MULDER: Not unless they have trailer parks in space. This is something different.



SCENE 8
SEVENTEEN PROSPECT PARKWAY

(Mulder and Scully walk toward Van Blundht's house)

MULDER: Hey Scully, if you could be somebody else for a day, who would it be?

SCULLY: Hopefully myself.

MULDER: So boring! I mean, wouldn't you even be tempted to try out someone else's existence for a day, live your life as somebody else?

SCULLY: Looking like someone else, Mulder, and being someone else are completely different things.

MULDER: Well, maybe it's not, I mean everybody else around you would treat you like you were somebody else, and ultimately maybe it's other people's reactions to us that make us who we are.

(They reach the porch of the house.)

SCULLY: All right, then. Eleanor Roosevelt.

MULDER: It can't be a dead person.

SCULLY: Why the hell not?

(Mulder is looking at a man in the next yard running a leaf blower. The man bears a slight resemblence to Mark Hamill.)

MULDER: Because.

(Beside the door are letters that spell "VAN BLUNDHT". As Mulder walks past it, the "H" falls off. The door opens.)

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: What are you doing sneaking around my porch?

MULDER: We were uh...we're with the FBI. (she flashes her badge) Is this the home of Edward Van Blundht?

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Yeah, that's me.

MULDER: We're looking for your son, Eddie junior.

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Eddie? What did that moron do now?

(Inside the house, Mulder is looking out the window, again at the man who looks like Mark Hamill)

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Five women? Oh, Lord. Anything else?

SCULLY: Yes. He, uh, attacked a sheriff's deputy during his escape from custody.

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Hurt bad?

SCULLY: Fortunately not.

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Well, thank heavens for that at least.

SCULLY: Sir, do you have any idea where your son might be?

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: I wish I did. I'm sorry. I haven't seen him for the last two days.

(Mulder is now looking at a poster on the wall that shows a man with a tail. The poster reads "See Eddie the Monkey Man".

MULDER: Is this...is this you?

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: (strikes a similar pose to the poster) One and the same! Hey, you want to see?

(Eddie starts to undo his belt. Mulder nods eagerly.)

SCULLY: No! (she looks at Mulder) No. No thank you.

(Both Eddie and Mulder look disappointed.)

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: My son had his removed when he was uh, just a kid. Kept bugging me and bugging me, till I finally let him do it. There you go.

(He hands them a copy of Glimpse magazine, which shows a teenage boy lying face down on an exam table while a doctor holds up his tail. The headline reads "The Tale of a Tail".)

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: I told him it was a mistake. I said son, you ain't much to look at. You ain't no athlete, and you sure the hell ain't no Einstein. But at least you got that tail. Otherwise you're just small potatoes. But he didn't listen.

MULDER: Does your son have any other unique medical conditions, I mean, aside from the tail?

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: Mr Mulder, that boy was born sickly. We used to have this condition down in the south called pellagra -

MULDER: Excuse me, sir, how did you know my name was Mulder?

EDDIE AS EDDIE SR: She told me it was.

SCULLY: Uh no, actually I didn't.

(Mulder eyes "Eddie Sr" suspiciously. Eddie runs off toward the back of the house, realizing that he's been caught)

MULDER: (giving chase) It's him!

(Scully runs out the front door. Mulder finds the discarded red robe that Eddie was wearing. He sees several men nearby - one walking a dog, one taking out garbage, one cutting the grass and one pruning a hedge. He picks up the robe just as Scully walks up.)

MULDER: Pretty spry for an old guy, huh?

SCULLY: Eddie junior, not senior.

MULDER: Well, whichever one he is, wouldn't you say he's a man with a secret?

(He lays the robe over Scully's shoulder.)

(Nearby, Baboo is putting a diaper on her baby. The baby also has a bandage where the tail used to be. Eddie, as Fred, runs into the house and quickly closes the door behind him.)

BABOO: Honey, what are you doing here so early?

(Eddie as Fred locks the door. He says nothing, but points down the hall, then walks quickly in that direction. He walks into the bathroom at the end of the hall and closes the door behind him. Baboo picks up the baby and walks in the same direction.)

BABOO: Fred?

(Eddie as Fred turns on the water in the bathroom.)

BABOO: (outside the bathroom) Honey? Fred, is everything okay?

(Eddie has morphed back to himself.)

EDDIE: Everything's fine.

BABOO: What happened to the clothes you were wearing this morning?

EDDIE: I'll explain later. Just give me a little privacy okay? Uh ... Baboo.

BABOO: Okay, Sugar Patootie.

(Back at Eddie Sr's house, Scully and Mulder are looking around.)

MULDER: I'll check upstairs.

(He goes upstairs while Scully remains below. Mulder opens a cabinet and lots of stuff falls out, making a loud noise.)

MULDER: I'm all right!

SCULLY: (from downstairs) What?

(Mulder sees the pull string for the attic stairs and gives a slight tug just as Scully comes upstairs. A white powder falls from the attic door. Some of it falls onto his face and he backs off, spitting.)

MULDER: Ohhh. It's quicklime. Move back over there.

(Mulder opens the entrance to the attic, and amidst more quicklime, a body rolls out. The body has a long tail.)

MULDER: Not so spry. You think the fall killed him?

(Back at the Fred's and Baboo's residence, Eddie is still in the bathroom as the real Fred returns.)

FRED: Baboo! I'm home!

EDDIE: Oh...crap.

FRED: I'm home early. (to Baboo, who is staring at him in disbelief) What?

BABOO: You were just here. You went into the bathroom.

FRED: What?

(While Eddie ponders his next move, Fred and Baboo quietly approach the bathroom. They see a shadow beneath the door.)

FRED: Someone is in the bathroom!

(Fred reaches for the door, but it quickly opens from the inside. Eddie has morphed into Mulder.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: It's all clear.



SCENE 9
MORGUE

(In the morgue, Scully is wearing a face shield and using a motorized saw on the body of Eddie Sr. She stops as Mulder enters with a cup of coffee)

MULDER: So what killed Eddie the monkey man?

SCULLY: It's difficult to say. The quicklime burned the tissue even as it preserved it, so what killed him is one of two things I haven't figured out yet.

MULDER: What's the other thing?

SCULLY: That would be this. It's striated muscle tissue.

(She shows him a micrograph on a computer screen.)

MULDER: What's unusual about that?

SCULLY: In and of itself, nothing. Where I found it however -

MULDER: Where did you find it?

SCULLY: Everywhere. His entire body. As far as I can tell, this man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin. That's not normal. This man's body is quite a scientific specimen, and thankfully it's preserved and intact.

(Mulder has walked over to Eddie Sr's body and touches his tail. It snaps off in his hand. He makes a face and looks back to see if Scully saw it. She didn't, and Mulder is between her and the broken tail.)

SCULLY: In other words, there are six hundred and fifty four muscles in the human body, and this man essentially has six hundred and fifty five.

MULDER: Um, could that somehow be related to his uh, having a tail?

SCULLY: Possibly. It could be a linked gene birth defect.

MULDER: What would be the, uh, purpose of, of this, uh...muscle?

(Mulder desperately tries to stick the broken piece back onto the body.)

SCULLY: You got me, Mulder. Maybe none. It appears to be atrophied, although it may look that way as a result of the mummification.

(Mulder has turned toward Scully but is still fumbling with the broken tail behind his back.)

MULDER: Could this be a "like father like son" kind of a thing?

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Uh, could Eddie junior have, uh, the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here?

SCULLY: Maybe. What are you suggesting?

MULDER: Well, um, if this musculature underlies the entire skin, then maybe it could be utilized to remold the skin's shape and texture. Which would go a long way to explaining why we're looking for a man who can appear to be his own father, or anyone else for that matter.

SCULLY: Isn't it much more likely, Mulder, that this man simply has an identical twin?

(Mulder has managed to delicately balance the tail on the body.)

MULDER: Check that out. (he heads for the door)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: Something about Van Blundht's MO confuses me. His victims were four married women who wanted to get pregnant ...

SCULLY: ... and one single woman who didn't.

(Mulder nods, and quickly leaves. As the door closes, the tail falls off of the body and onto the floor. Scully stares at it.)



SCENE 10
AMANDA NELLIGAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM

(In Amanda's room at the hospital, the nurse has brought Amanda's baby to her. There's a knock on the door.)

AMANDA: Come in!

EDDIE AS MULDER: Sorry, Ms. Nelligan. I'm sorry to bother you.

AMANDA: No, no, it's no bother.

EDDIE AS MULDER: I just have uh, a few additional questions I wanted to ask you.

AMANDA: Okay. (she hands the baby to the nurse.)

NURSE: Here we go sweetie.

AMANDA: Bye bye!

NURSE: We'll just come back later. (she leaves with the baby)

AMANDA: You know, I thought they were letting me stay in the hospital so long because I have really, really great insurance. Turns out they're just keeping me here because they think I'm sort of crazy. They want to make sure I'm safe to be around my baby.

EDDIE AS MULDER: Free cable. (she chuckles. He sits on the bed) I want to ask you... do you recognize this man? (He shows her a particularly goofy looking photo of Eddie)

AMANDA: Ohhh...yes...eww. That's Eddie Van Blundht.

EDDIE AS MULDER: What can you tell me about him?

AMANDA: We went out all through high school. (he smiles) Oh, brother...

EDDIE AS MULDER: (stops smiling) What?

AMANDA: Nothing, he's just sort of a loser. (he gets a pained expression) He's one of those guys you look back on, you know, and oh my God, what was I thinking? WHAT was I thinking?

EDDIE AS MULDER: Well...what, uh, specifically made him a loser?

AMANDA: I don't know. Everything. He had like one million annoying personal habits. You know, just no sense of romance, no ambition, no direction. I mean, I hear he's like a janitor or something now. He had this weird family, his dad was in the circus or something. I don't know. He never let me meet him, thank God.

EDDIE AS MULDER: (looking hurt) He must have had some good qualities?

AMANDA: Well, yeah, sure, everybody's got a few. Yeah, we had some good times. We really loved Star Wars so we used to go and see it every weekend. That was nice. (he smiles) He was no Luke, that's for sure. (the smile disappears) Why do you want to know about Eddie?

EDDIE AS MULDER: (Softly) That's official FBI business.

AMANDA: Wow!

EDDIE AS MULDER: (Gives her a rose) I wanted to congratulate you on this ... blessed event. (He dejectedly heads for the door.)

AMANDA: Thank you. May the force be with you!

EDDIE AS MULDER: Uh-huh.

(As 'Eddie as Mulder' walks out into the hall, the real Mulder arrives at the nurses' station.)

MULDER: (to nurse) I'm here to see Amanda Nelligan?

('Eddie as Mulder' sees Mulder and ducks across the hall.)

NURSE: Straight down the hall, there.

(Mulder knocks on Amanda's door.)

AMANDA: Come in! (Mulder enters) No, seriously though, why do you want to know about Eddie?

MULDER: What about Eddie?

AMANDA: Why were you asking me all those questions about him?

(Mulder looks puzzled. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.

(Fred and Baboo are calling from their house.)

FRED: Agent Mulder, this is Fred Nieman. Is it okay for us to get into our bathroom now?

MULDER: Excuse me, sir?

FRED: Well, I was hoping we could get into our bathroom sometime this evening. You said the police were going to come by and dust it for some fingerprints but that was over four hours ago.

MULDER: Uh huh.

FRED: We want to help you catch this guy, but I gotta say I'm having a real hard time here. I mean, how exactly do you wind up chasing a suspect into my bathroom?

BABOO: (to Fred) Don't forget the suit.

FRED: And what do you need with my charcoal suit?

MULDER: I'm sorry Mr Nieman, I'm going to have to call you back. (To Amanda) I was just here. Where did I go?

AMANDA: Huh?

(He waves goodbye and goes into the hall, where he runs into the nurse.)

MULDER: (to nurse) There was a man. He looked exactly like me. Did you see where he went?

NURSE: (looking puzzled) Down the hall ... men's locker room.

MULDER: Thank you.



SCENE 11
LOCKER ROOM

(Mulder enters the locker room and draws his gun. On the other side of a set of lockers, a security guard is pulling his pants up.)

MULDER: Hey.

SECURITY GUARD: Hey.

(The guard sees that Mulder has a gun, and he reaches for his gun which is on a bench in front of him, but Mulder aims his gun at him.)

MULDER: Van Blundht ...

SECURITY GUARD: Who?

MULDER: (holding his gun on him) Think about it. Get your hands up. Turn around.

(The guard complies, and his pants fall to the floor.)

MULDER: Keep them up there. Put your hands down now. (he handcuffs him) If it's not you, I apologize in advance.

MAN: What are you doing?

MULDER: Pull your pants up.

(Dr. Pugh comes out of the shower, wearing a towel. Mulder whirls and aims his gun at him. Pugh drops the towel. Mulder's eyes drift down, then he looks at the two men.)

(Mulder has handcuffed the two men to a support pole in the locker room.)

DR PUGH: What? What did I do now?

MULDER: You're the only ones here?

SECURITY GUARD: Yeah.

MULDER: I apologize. Only one of you is the man I'm looking for. I hope. I gotta wait for some blood tests to come back and then I'll release the other one. So why don't you just sit back and relax? Keep your clothes on, huh?

(He calls Scully on his phone)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: Yeah, hey, it's me. I think you should get down to the hospital right away, okay?

SCULLY: I'm on my way.

(He hangs up, but hears a noise overhead. He looks up and sees a bank of flourescent lights flickering and a ceiling tile slightly ajar. He reaches up and pushes the tile aside.

EDDIE: (in the ceiling) You're a damn good looking man.

(Eddie falls out of the ceiling onto Mulder.)



SCENE 12
HALLWAY

(Later, Scully walks down the hall towards Mulder, who is holding a bag of ice to his head. He is arguing with the two men he handcuffed)

SECURITY GUARD: I mean, you draw a gun on me. You handcuff me.

EDDIE AS MULDER: I know what I did.

SECURITY GUARD: I take issue with that.

EDDIE AS MULDER: I'm sorry.

SECURITY GUARD: I have a serious problem with that.

EDDIE AS MULDER: I'm sorry.

DR PUGH: I still don't understand. Do we look like criminals to you?

EDDIE AS MULDER: Look, I said I ...

SECURITY GUARD: Exactly. What the hell was on your mind?

EDDIE AS MULDER: I said I was sorry.

SCULLY: What's going on?

EDDIE AS MULDER: (to a cop) Am I done here?

COP: Yeah. We've got enough description. Come on guys.

(Scully and 'Eddie as Mulder' walk away from the others.)

SCULLY: What the hell happened?

EDDIE AS MULDER: Van Blundht surprised me. He cold cocked me and then he got away.

SCULLY: You got a lead on him?

EDDIE AS MULDER: No, but the local authorites are already on the warpath for going after one of their own. They'll catch him eventually.

SCULLY: So what? That's it for us?

EDDIE AS MULDER: I know I dragged you out here Scully, but I'm beginning to think this whole thing is just a waste of time.

SCULLY: Now you think there's no X-File here?

EDDIE AS MULDER: (confused) No. No, I think the only thing here is uh... small potatoes.

(Mulder walks away, and now Scully looks puzzled.)

(Down in the utility room in the hospital basement, Mulder is locked in a small cage. The cage is padlocked and has a sign on the front that reads "See janitor for keys".)

MULDER: (yelling) Hello? Hellooo!! Get me out of here!



SCENE 13
HOSPITAL BASEMENT

(Mulder is still in the locked cage.)

MULDER: Hello! Hello! I'm down here! Help!

(He kicks at the door without success. In the cage is someone's lunch: a sandwich, an apple and an opened can of Perk cola.)



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS WASHINGTON. D.C.

(Mulder and Scully are in Skinner's office. Skinner is reading their report. 'Eddie as Mulder' glances at Scully, then crosses his legs and folds his arms like her.)

SKINNER: (sighs) Which one of you wrote this?

EDDIE AS MULDER: I did, sir.

SKINNER: You spelled Federal Bureau of Investigation wrong.

EDDIE AS MULDER: It was a typo.

SKINNER: Twice. Agent Scully, what about the body you found. Did you establish a cause of death?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. The subject, Edward Van Blundht senior, died of natural causes ... specifically heart disease and advanced age.

EDDIE AS MULDER: We think the son hid the father in the attic so he could continue to cash in on the old man's social security checks.

SCULLY: Most likely.

SKINNER: So the son wasn't a murderer?

EDDIE AS MULDER: (quickly) Oh no, not at all.

SKINNER: But he was a rapist.

('Eddie as Mulder' frowns.)

SCULLY: I entered him into the national sex offenders database. The West Virginia state police have a photo and a description and they will coordinate with local authorities. There should be an arrest soon.

('Eddie as Mulder' has an odd grimace on his face. Skinner looks at him and his expression returns to normal.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: That about wraps it up.

('Eddie as Mulder' and Scully are walking down the stairs to the basement office. 'Eddie as Mulder' pats Scully on the shoulder)

EDDIE AS MULDER: So Scully, what are you doing tonight? Any big plans?

SCULLY: Well, seeing as how it's Friday, I was thinking I could get some work in on that monograph I'm writing for the penology review.

EDDIE AS MULDER: Oh.

SCULLY: "Diminished Acetylcholine Production in Recidivist Offenders".

EDDIE AS MULDER: Uh huh.

SCULLY: Though actually I might bag that though.

EDDIE AS MULDER: (hopefully) Really?

(He is trying various keys in his office door but can't find the right one. Scully has her head buried in the case file and doesn't notice.)

SCULLY: Yeah, I have to say, Mulder, the anomalous musculature in the corpse we found really has me intrigued. In fact, I think I'm gonna go to Quantico and have some tissue samples run. I'll see you Monday.

(She walks away. Mulder watches her wistfully.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: Monday morning.

(He finally finds the right key, and enters the office and looks around. He picks up the nameplate on the desk.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: Fox? Brother.

(He sits in the chair, and puts his feet on the desk like Mulder does. He leans back too far, though, and has to grab the back and side tables to keep from falling. He sits up and straightens the desk, then swivels around and looks at the back bulletin board, including the "I Want to Believe" poster.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: Good night! This is where my tax dollars go? Where do I live?

(He gets Mulder's wallet out of his suit and looks at the driver's license. It lists 42-2630 Hegal Place, Alexandria as his address.)

(Later, 'Eddie as Mulder' enters Mulder's apartment)



SCENE 15
MULDER'S APARTMENT

EDDIE AS MULDER: (looking around) Where the hell do I sleep?

(He pushes the button on Mulder's answering machine. The first message is from Langly. He feeds the fish during the message.)

LANGLY: Mulder. Langly. You gotta see this. An online associate of ours, who will remain anonymous, has figured out a way to digitize the Zapruder footage so he can extrapolate a birds eye view of the Dealey plaza at the exact moment of the assassination. You'll never believe where the third shot came from.

FROHIKE: (in background) Tell him about the cheese steaks.

LANGLY: Oh yeah! Frohike, Byers and me are going out for cheese steaks. Are you down with that? Uh, erase this when you hear it.

(He picks up a basketball and tries to dribble it, slapping it a couple of times before it rolls away.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: Geeks for friends.

(The second message begins.)

CHANTAL: Hello Marty? Chantal. It's been so long since we've spoken and I've been so lonely not hearing your sexy voice. (he walks back to the desk and grabs a pencil to write down the details) Marty, just for you we've lowered our rates to 40 cents a minute, (he throws down the pencil) 2.99 for the first minute, all long distance rates apply. Do give me a call, lover-man. I'll be waiting.

(He walks over to a mirror and practices his technique. He pulls out his badge and flashes it, upside down.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: FBI. F-B-I... (he turns the ID the right way up) FBI.

(He now does a DeNiro impression.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: You looking at me? There ain't nobody else here, you must be lookin' at me. You want a piece of this?

(He unbuttons his jacket and displays his gun to the mirror. Then he tries a quick draw, but the clip falls to the ground. He retrieves it, points the gun at the mirror and then twirls it cowboy-style before putting it back in the holster. Then he straightens his tie.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: You're a damn good looking man.

(He practices a few facial expressions, ending with an arched-eyebrow "puppy dog" look.)



SCENE 16
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully is sitting on the floor in front of the sofa in her apartment. She has a book and papers in front of her. There is a knock on the door, and she gets up to answer it. Through the peephole, she sees 'Eddie as Mulder", who flashes a wide grin. She opens the door.)

SCULLY: (looking alarmed) Mulder, what's up?

EDDIE AS MULDER: Scully? Is this a bad time?

SCULLY: No. No uh...come on in. (she sees that he's carrying a wine bottle) Who's that for?

EDDIE AS MULDER: Uh...us.

(She stares at him for a second, then takes the wine bottle.)

SCULLY: Okay. Have a seat.

(She goes to the counter, throwing a confused glance over her shoulder at him.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: So uh...what are you working on?

(He grabs a spoon and examines himself in the reflection, while Scully gets wine glasses from her cupboard.)

SCULLY: More autopsy data. You know, everyone at the lab found Mr Van Blundht pretty fascinating. (he makes a sour expression) We discovered an additional anomaly related to the hair follicles in his scalp. I can't even begin to guess at the nature of it until we can run it through the transmission electron microscope.

(Scully pulls the cork from the bottle. 'Eddie as Mulder' awkwardly puts his elbow on a pillow, then reconsiders and throws it aside.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: Sounds very interesting.

(She brings the wine and glasses back and sits on the sofa next to him. She studies him for a second, then pours the wine into the glasses.)

SCULLY: Yes, it is. So seriously Mulder, what's going on? You okay?

(She hands him a glass and pours her own.)

EDDIE AS MULDER: (nods) Mm. I was just kind of knocking around, I was (they click glasses together) just thinking... (they take a sip. He coughs.) Uh, good. We never really...uh...talk much...do we?

SCULLY: What do you mean like...really talk? No, no we don't, Mulder.

EDDIE AS MULDER: Well what's stopping us?

(She looks at him, draws a breath, looks away, looks at him again, looks away again and sighs.)

(A while later, a fire is blazing in the fireplace and Al Green's "Ain't It Funny How Time Slips Away" is playing in the background. 'Eddie as Mulder' is pouring the last few drops of wine into her glass, and the wine seems to have had the usual effect.)

SCULLY: So there we are at two o'clock in the morning, me and my moire taffeta dress and Marcus in whatever the hell it was he was wearing - (he pounds the bottle to get the last drop out) thank you very much. It had a um... a kelly green cummerbund on it. Anyway, so, I know that Marcus is thinking that it's now or never, (he nods) and I'm thinking...

EDDIE AS MULDER: What are you thinking?

SCULLY: I'm thinking "what is that siren I hear getting louder?"

EDDIE AS MULDER: No way! Who called the cops?

SCULLY: It wasn't the cops it was the fire department. My friend Sylvia and her idiot prom date ...

EDDIE AS MULDER: Berwood?

SCULLY: ... had built this campfire that went totally out of control and so we all had to ride back on the um... what do you call it? The um, the pumper truck. Yeah. Marcus was the twelfth grade love of my life. (she laughs into her glass) I can't believe I'm telling you this!

EDDIE AS MULDER: I don't believe you haven't told me before.

SCULLY: No, I'm seeing a whole new side of you, Mulder.

EDDIE AS MULDER: Is that a good thing?

SCULLY: I like it.

EDDIE AS MULDER: Do you ever wish things were different?

SCULLY: What do you mean?

EDDIE AS MULDER: The person you wanted to be when you grew up, when you were in high school. How far off from that did you end up?

SCULLY: Career wise? Miles off target.

EDDIE AS MULDER: No, no, not just that. Do you ever wish...that you could go back and do it all differently?

SCULLY: Do you? (Eddie nods sadly)

('Eddie as Mulder' scoots closer to her on the sofa. Her eyes widen for a moment and she lets out a quick sigh of surprise. He leans closer to her and her lips part in another sigh. Just as their lips are about to touch, the real Mulder bursts in the door. She looks at him in amazement, and he looks at the two of them on the sofa in equal amazement. Scully looks at 'Eddie as Mulder', then pushes him away with a slight yelp and quickly stands. While the real Mulder continues to stare at them, 'Eddie as Mulder' slumps back dejectedly and morphs back into himself. Scully stares at him in amazement, while Eddie gives her a shrug.)



SCENE 17
CUMBERLAND REFORMATORY
ONE MONTH LATER

(Eddie, wearing a baseball hat, sits on one side of the window as Mulder enters and sits on the other side.)

EDDIE: Thanks for coming.

MULDER: What's with the hat? (It reads: Superstar!)

EDDIE: My court-appointed therapist makes me wear it. She says it's meant to bolster my self-esteem.

MULDER: Does it?

EDDIE: Not really. The other inmates just beat me up and take it from me. Which would be okay except that every week she brings me a new hat. Plus they keep me on some kind of muscle relaxant so I can't make faces the way I used to. Did you tell them to do that? (Mulder doesn't respond) Is uh... (arching an eyebrow) is Agent Scully here?

MULDER: What did you want to talk to me about, Eddie?

EDDIE: I just think it's funny. I was born a loser, but you're one by choice.

MULDER: On what do you base that astute assessment?

EDDIE: Experience. (Eddie leans forward) You should live a little. Treat yourself. God knows I would if I were you.

(Mulder gets up and leaves. Scully is in the hallway. She has watched and heard the conversation on a TV monitor. He signs out with the guard.)

GUARD: Good day, sir.

(They walk down the hall together, neither looking very happy. Scully's arms are folded, but then she unfolds them and puts her hands in her coat pockets. Mulder is fiddling with his sleeves and looking down at the floor as he walks.)

SCULLY: I don't imagine you need to be told this Mulder, but you're not a loser.

MULDER: Yeah, but I'm no Eddie Van Blundht either. Am I?

(He glances quickly over at her. She doesn't respond and stares straight ahead. Mulder continues to fiddle with his hands and looks ahead as well.

[THE END]

SCENE 1
TRANSCONTINENTAL EXPRESS ROUTING CENTER
DESMOND, VIRGINIA

(Two postal workers, Jane and Missy, are scanning and sorting packages.)

JANE BRODY: Cover for me in case dork-face comes back around, will you?

MISSY: Where you going?

JANE BRODY: I need a cigarette.

MISSY: You had one 15 minutes ago.

JANE BRODY: 45 minutes.

MISSY: Why don't you get yourself one of those patches or that gum?

JANE BRODY: (showing her gum between her teeth) What do you think I'm chewing?

MISSY: Then maybe you should just quit. Ever think of that?

JANE BRODY: Look. Just cover for me, OK? Tell her I've got a stomach bug or something.

(She walks away from the line and enters the bathroom, where another employee is at the sink. She enters a stall, closes the door and gets out a cigarette. After the other employee leaves, she sits, lights the cigarette and reads a magazine. Several bees coming out of the sink drain. Moments later, there are thousands of bees on the sink, the floor and the walls of the stalls. When Jane lowers the magazine, stands, and drops her cigarette to step on it, she sees many bees on the floor and door and gasps. The bees swarm around her. As she tries to swat them away, she knocks the door of the stall open. The bees continue to swarm, and she falls against the back wall.)

(Out on the line, Missy's supervisor walks by. Missy becomes impatient and heads to the bathroom and opens the door.)

MISSY: Jane! Come on, you're gonna get in trouble! (there is no response and she enters) Jane?

(She looks beneath the stall walls and sees a smoldering cigarette in the last stall. She opens the door.)

MISSY: Hey, Jane ...

(She sees Jane slumped against the back wall. Her face is red and swollen, and there are welts all over her arms and face. She appears dead. Missy screams.)

(A photograph of Jane's body in the stall is being viewed on a computer. Skinner is at the keyboard. As he types, a window appears on the screen that says "You have chosen files currently open. Delete all?" He selects yes and turns off the computer. As he walks away, Fox Mulder's nameplate is seen on the desk as well as other familiar features from Mulder's office.)

SCENE 2

(In his apartment, Skinner, wearing all black, takes his phone off the hook and leaves carrying a satchel.)

(Then he is peeling off a sticker that says "Do not enter, Office of the Audrey County Coroner" from the ladies room door of the Routing Center. It is after hours, and he enters the stall where Jane was attacked. He picks up the cigarette from the floor and flushes it down the toilet. He scrapes up debris from the floor and gathers it with a portable vacuum. Wearing latex gloves, he sprays something on the tiles and then scrubs the floor as well as the mirror. He sees an orange substance where the wall meets the ceiling and sniffs it, then cleans it up.)



SCENE 3
AUDREY COUNTY MORGUE, 12:22 AM

(Skinner picks a lock and enters. He finds where Jane Brody's body is stored, opens the vault and slides her body out. At the security desk, a guard hears a thump and goes to investigate, while Skinner is wrapping Jane's body in a sheet. The guard unlocks the door to the morgue and hits the light switch but the lights do not come on. He walks across the room and tries another switch and the lights come on, but there is no one there. Skinner, with Jane's body over his shoulder, is hiding in a small room off the main room. Once the guard leaves, Skinner comes out.)

(A car pulls up to an industrial plant. Skinner, still carrying Jane's body, goes up a freight elevator. He gets off and goes up a metal staircase. At the top, he sets the body down and opens the door to an incinerator. He picks up the body, shoves it in and closes the incinerator door.)



SCENE 4
POLICE FORENSIC LAB, DESMOND, VIRGINIA, 2:35 AM

(Skinner, still dressed in dark clothes and now wearing a baseball cap, talks with an officer at the counter.)

OFFICER ROBBINS: Brodie, Jane L. Yeah, we've got the pathologist's work, but the, uh, techs haven't been over the crime scene yet.

SKINNER: Let me see what you've got.

OFFICER ROBBINS: Your name?

SKINNER: (showing an FBI badge) Special Agent Fox Mulder.

OFFICER ROBBINS: Working the late shift, Agent Mulder?

SKINNER: Yeah. Somebody's got to.

OFFICER ROBBINS: You need to sign that.

(Skinner signs the log while the officer fetches a plastic tray with compartments holding a variety of samples. Jane Brody's name is on the label of the tray. The officer sets it on the counter and walks away. Skinner checks to be sure that no one is watching, and he removes a vial of blood and replaces it with another one, which he handles with a handkerchief. He then wipes the pen that he used to sign the log with the same handkerchief. The log shows Fox Mulder's name.)

SKINNER: I'm all set here.

OFFICER ROBBINS: (returning to the counter) Finished?

SKINNER: Yeah. Thanks.

OFFICER ROBBINS: No problem.

(Outside, Skinner walks across the lot. As he stops to stuff the vial of blood into a dumpster, a man calls and runs across the parking lot to see him.)

DETECTIVE THOMAS: Agent Mulder! I'm glad I caught you.

SKINNER: Who are you?

DETECTIVE THOMAS: Detective Thomas. (Skinner doesn't respond) Ray Thomas. I'm the one who contacted you, who e-mailed the pictures to your office. (Skinner now nods) I ran into Officer Robbins. He said you'd come down here to take a look at some of the forensic evidence.

SKINNER: Yeah, that's right.

(Skinner continues across the lot, with Thomas walking with him.)

DETECTIVE THOMAS: So ... does that mean you think you found something here, something worth looking into?

SKINNER: I'm afraid not.

DETECTIVE THOMAS: (surprised) No?

SKINNER: I didn't find anything to recommend my further involvement in this case.

DETECTIVE THOMAS: What about the woman? How do you explain what happened to her? She walks into a bathroom, a minute later, she turns up ... You saw the pictures!

(Skinner has reached his car and stops.)

SKINNER: I saw them.

DETECTIVE THOMAS: I was told you were part of something called the X-Files, you'd look into stuff like this. So if there's really nothing to this, why come all the way down here in the middle of the night?

SKINNER: I'm just doing my job, Detective, same as you.

(Skinner gets into his car, leaving a suprised Thomas standing there. As he drives off, the Gray-Haired Man watches from a nearby car.)

(Back in his apartment, Skinner sheds the dark pants and shirt and stuffs them into a trash bag. Moments later, he comes down dressed normally, puts the phone back on the hook, picks up the trash bag and opens his door to find Mulder walking toward it.)

MULDER: Oh, you are home.

SKINNER: Yeah, what are you doing here?

MULDER: I was trying to reach you. I think your phone's off the hook.

SKINNER: Uh, I needed some sleep.

MULDER: (noticing the trash bag) Is that why you're taking the garbage out at 4 in the morning?

SKINNER: What do you want, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I want some answers.

(He walks in. Skinner closes the door.)

SKINNER: Concerning?

MULDER: The unexplained death of a postal worker that somebody is apparently going to great lengths to keep unexplained. (hands him something) These photos were sent to me by a detective who thought I might have a fresh take on the case, but when I went to retrieve them from my e-mail, somebody had hollowed out the files.

SKINNER: Then where'd you get them?

MULDER: From his partner.

SKINNER: When?

MULDER: After he finished questioning me about the detective's death.

SKINNER: What, what are you talking about?

MULDER: He was killed, shot in the head execution-style. His body was found near the precinct two hours ago ... possibly by the same person who forged my name to gain access to evidence from the forensics lab.

SKINNER: What do you want from me?

MULDER: Well, I'd like your help on this, sir.

SKINNER: What about Agent Scully?

MULDER: Agent Scully is in the hospital.

SKINNER: Has something happened that I should know about?

MULDER: She's undergoing some imaging tests. Her, uh, her oncologist was concerned about some microscopy results that, uh, her tumor may be metastasizing. Anyway, I, I'd like you to take a look at those photos, please.

SKINNER: Yeah, I will, first thing in the morning.

MULDER: (looking at the trash bag) Want me to, uh, dump this on my way out?

SKINNER: No, I got it.

MULDER: All right.

(Mulder leaves. Skinner looks puzzled, sighs and closes his eyes.)

(Later, Skinner walks into the parking garage and looks around. Moments later, a car comes squealing around the corner and speeds right up to him. The Cigarette Smoking Man is in the passenger seat, while the Gray-haired Man is driving. CSM steps out of the car.)

SKINNER: Was it you? Did you pull the trigger, or did you have him (pointing at the Gray-haired Man) do it for you?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN (CSM): I'm not here to answer your questions.

(As he approaches, Skinner grabs CSM by the shirt.)

SKINNER: (angrily) You murdered him! You killed an officer of the law!

CSM: (calmly) I suggest you keep your voice down, Mr. Skinner, unless you want your neighbors to know the hours and the company you keep.

SKINNER: (releasing him) I won't be a party to murder.

CSM: I wouldn't get too comfortable on your moral high ground, Mr. Skinner. This only happened because you left your job unfinished.

SKINNER: I handled him just like I've handled everything else you've asked me to do. I followed your instructions.

CSM: You failed to neutralize a potentially compromising situation.

SKINNER: You didn't have to kill him. He didn't have to die.

CSM: You're in no position to question the terms of our arrangement.

SKINNER: Then we have no arrangement.

(Skinner walks away.)

CSM: You'll find it's not that easy to walk away from, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: (stopping) No?

CSM: A man digs a hole, he risks falling into it.

(Skinner stares at him and then the Gray-haired Man, then walks away. CSM drops his cigarette and steps on it.)



SCENE 5

(Skinner is sitting back on his sofa, dozing. The phone rings and he awakens.)

SKINNER: (to phone) Skinner.

MULDER: (on phone) Her body's gone, sir.

(Mulder is calling from the morgue.)

SKINNER: What are you talking about?

MULDER: The postal worker in the photos that I gave you. Her body was stolen from the morgue last night, along with any other evidence that might explain how or why she died.

SKINNER: Slow down, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm playing catch-up here, and I'm already two steps behind. The man who impersonated me at the forensics lab last night, apparently he replaced a blood sample.

SKINNER: How do you know?

MULDER: I had them run a test. The blood sample in the police forensics lab is B-positive, as is the postal worker's, but she suffered from a mild form of anemia characterized by a folic acid deficiency. The blood sample at the police forensics lab has a normal folate serum level.

(Skinner looks like he has a headache, then appears to say a naughty word to himself.)

SKINNER: Are there any suspects?

MULDER: No, but I do have a place to start. The gun that killed Detective Thomas - ballistics has identified it as a Sig-Sauer P228. (Skinner walks across the room to his desk) I'm having ballistics run comps on all weapons registered to federal agents and, uh, local officers.

(Skinner sees that his desk drawer has been pried open and that his gun is missing. He picks up the empty holster.)

MULDER: Sir?

SKINNER: Let me know what they find.

MULDER: I will.

(They hang up and Skinner throws down the holster in disgust.)

(The phone in CSM's home rings and he answers.)

CSM: (to phone) Yes.

SKINNER: (on phone) You can't do this!

(Skinner is calling from his home.)

CSM: You sound agitated, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: Was it my gun?

CSM: Your gun?

SKINNER: Used to kill the detective?

CSM: Well, if it was, I'd think you'd want to report it to the police immediately.

SKINNER: Oh, don't think that I won't.

CSM: Then why are you calling me? Perhaps because you realize that you'd be admitting to the obstruction of justice, criminal conspiracy, and destruction of evidence? The consequences could be very serious for you, even in the unlikely event that you were able to persuade the authorities that you didn't kill the detective.

SKINNER: What did you have me cover up?

CSM: I think the less you know the better, under the circumstances.

SKINNER: I need to know what that man died for.

CSM: He died for you, Mr. Skinner. He died so you could have what you wanted - a cure for Agent Scully. Isn't that what you want?

SKINNER: Agent Scully is in the hospital. If you can do anything for her, I want it done now.

CSM: I'm fully aware of Agent Scully's progress.

SKINNER: If anything happens to her, I will expose you. I'll turn state's evidence. I don't care what happens to me.

CSM: Agent Scully stands to live a long and healthy life. I would hope the same for you, Mr. Skinner.

(CSM hangs up.)



SCENE 6
9:14 AM

(At the Routing Center, Skinner is walking with Jane's supervisor. They pass Missy, who is working on the line. She watches the supervisor take Skinner into the ladies room where Jane died.)

SUPERVISOR: Police said we could put the bathroom back in service. But the truth is, no one wants to use it. Not after what happened yesterday. You mind my asking what you're looking for?

(Skinner has stepped onto the sink and is feeling along where the wall meets the ceiling. He finds a small amount of the same orange substance that he found the previous night.)

SKINNER: I need a hammer.

(Shortly afterward, Skinner tears into the sheetrock with a hammer. Behind it, he finds large quantities of the orange substance as well as a honeycomb.)



SCENE 7
ELSINORE, MARYLAND, 1:15 PM

(Skinner is at the residence / office of Dr. Valedespino. He has brought a jar containing the honeycomb.)

DR. VALEDESPINO: Is there any reason you're not running this through the FBI lab?

SKINNER: Uh, this evidence is classified. We've had some controversy over security at the Bureau. I'd appreciate your discretion.

DR. VALEDESPINO: (looking at the honeycomb) Oh, certainly.

SKINNER: Can you tell what kind of bees made that?

DR. VALEDESPINO: Uh, it's hard to tell with just the comb, but I might be able to give you an answer.

SKINNER: If I told you there was a chance that the bees that made that could be lethal, would that be helpful?

(Valdespino has opened the jar and is poking the comb with tweezers.)

DR. VALEDESPINO: Any kind of bee can be lethal, provided you get stung by enough of them. Even Africanized honey bees, the so-called killer bees, basically have the same venom as the European honey bee. It's just that they tend to attack in swarms. Ah, we may be in luck.

SKINNER: What is it?

DR. VALEDESPINO: Royal jelly, a highly nutritious secretion of the honey bees' pharyngeal gland. It's fed to the very young larvae in the colony. Here, see for yourself.

(He shows Skinner a larva under a magnifying glass.)

SKINNER: Is that gonna hatch?

DR. VALEDESPINO: (nodding) Once they pupate, I should be able to give you some definitive answers.

SKINNER: The minute you learn something, I'd appreciate a call.

(Skinner starts to leave.)

DR. VALEDESPINO: Is this related to that other case? If you don't mind me asking ...

SKINNER: What other case?

DR. VALEDESPINO: I got a call from another agent about six months ago asking me all about killer bees.

SKINNER: Who was it?

DR. VALEDESPINO: Uh, the name was Fox Mulder. I wonder if there's any connection?

SKINNER: No.

DR. VALEDESPINO: Anyway, I'll call you.

(Skinner is alone in Mulder's office, going through his files. He opens a folder and sees photos of an agricultural complex and a bee and reads a note referring to ground reconnaissance and "no evidence found of bee hives". The name on the note is "Marita Covarrubias, Special Assitant to the Secretary General of the United Nations". [This file is from the episode "Herrenvolk", 4x01] He replaces the folder and goes to Mulder's desk, looking through his Roladex and finding a card for Marita Covarrubias. He gets a piece of scrap paper and is writing down the information when Mulder appears in the doorway.)

MULDER: Sir? You looking for me?

SKINNER: Uh, I was just writing you a note. Where've you been?

MULDER: First Nations Bank of Virginia.

(Mulder shows him a pair of grainy photos showing the parking lot outside the Desmond Police Forensic Lab. One of the photos shows two men talking next to a car. One is wearing a baseball hat.)

SKINNER: What am I looking at?

MULDER: The bank is adjacent to the police headquarters where the detective was killed. Their parking lot surveillance camera caught this image. That man there - that's Detective Thomas. This man in the baseball hat - he was identified by the officer on duty at the forensics lab as "Agent Mulder".

SKINNER: Can you get a usable image of this?

MULDER: I'm gonna hand deliver it to Special Photo right now. What did you want to talk to me about? You were writing me a note.

SKINNER: I was, uh, I was just checking on your progress.

(Skinner walks away. Mulder looks slightly puzzled.)

(Skinner is phoning from his office.)

SKINNER: (to phone) Miss Covarrubias? This is Walter Skinner. I'm an Assistant Director here at the FBI.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: (on phone) Yes?

(Marita Covarrubias is in her office.)

SKINNER: I was hoping you could help me. I understand Agent Fox Mulder has been in contact with you about a project.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: A project?

SKINNER: A Canadian agricultural project involving bees and bee husbandry.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Yes, but, I wasn't able to give him any information.

SKINNER: Why was that?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: The project he cited turned up no viable evidence.

SKINNER: Evidence of what?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Bee hives ... or bee husbandry.

SKINNER: What if I told you I had access to that evidence?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: You have access to these bees?

SKINNER: I may, soon. Very soon.

(Dr. Valedespino enters his laboratory. He tries the light switch but it doesn't work. As he walks in, he doesn't notice that there are hundreds of bees overhead. He walks to his lab bench and inspects his experiment, but he finds that the mesh screen over the sample has been breached. He shines a lamp toward the window and sees the bees. The bees attack and he falls over his desk, screaming. He struggles to swat them away, moving to his window. Covered by bees, he pounds on the glass.)



SCENE 8

(Skinner enters a morgue to meet Mulder.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Thanks for getting down here so quickly.

SKINNER: What is it?

MULDER: A break. Maybe even a lead.

(He uncovers Valedespino's body, which is covered with gray discolorations.)

MULDER: I wanted you to get a look at this body before somebody tried to steal it. See these pocks and blisters? They're the same as we saw in the photo of the deceased postal worker.

SKINNER: Symptoms of what?

MULDER: Smallpox. The first reported case in over seven years.

SKINNER: Smallpox?

MULDER: According to the coroner, an especially virulent strain caused by a mutated variola virus.

SKINNER: Caused how? I mean, how could this man contract a disease that doesn't even exist any more?

MULDER: From these.

(Mulder hands him a small bottle partially filled with a clear liquid and containing some solids.)

SKINNER: What are they?

MULDER: Bee stingers and venom sacs recovered subcutaneously from the victim's face, arm and neck.

SKINNER: You're saying this man was stung by bees carrying smallpox?

MULDER: He was a forensic entomologist. I consulted with him several months ago about a similar fatality.

SKINNER: Then you've seen this before?

MULDER: Yeah, but I've never had any hard evidence. Not until now. I think that's what somebody's gone to great lengths to try to prevent.

SKINNER: Why?

MULDER: I can only guess. But I think that somebody is trying to engineer a method of delivery ... for a disease that has killed more people throughout history than any other contagion known to humankind. If you want me to suggest an appropriate response ...

SKINNER: Can they be stopped?

MULDER: How can we stop them? We don't even know who these people are, and we won't until we know the identity of that shooter.

SKINNER: How close are you?

MULDER: Hopefully, very. I've got one of the photo techs pulling an all-nighter on that surveillance video so he can show me something this morning. I told him that you'd authorize the overtime.

SKINNER: Of course.

MULDER: I'm gonna go over there right now.

SKINNER: Tell me what you find.

(In the break room at the Routing Center, Missy is getting a snack when Skinner approaches her.)

SKINNER: Missy Nagata? (flashing his FBI badge) My name is Walter Skinner.

MISSY: I was just getting up. They only give us a 10-minute break, and my supervisor's pretty strict.

SKINNER: I need to talk to you, Misty. About your co-worker.

MISSY: If this is about what happened to Jane, I already told the police everything I know.

SKINNER: Everything?

MISSY: (pauses, then quietly) I don't want to lose my job.

SKINNER: You're not going to lose anything. I'm asking you to cooperate in a criminal investigation.

MISSY: Jane? What do you mean?

SKINNER: Jane's death may not have been an accident.

MISSY: What? (she pauses) She was my best friend.

SKINNER: I'm sorry.

MISSY: We worked it out so that our vacations overlapped. We were going to Palm Beach. Both of us were trying to lose weight so we could buy new bathing suits. The men who came here - they said if I talked to anyone, I'd lose my job.

SKINNER: Did these men say who they were?

MISSY: No, and I didn't ask. They just wanted the package.

SKINNER: What package?

MISSY: Damaged packages are routed here for inspection before they get reshipped.

SKINNER: The place where the damaged packages are kept - how close is it to the restroom where you found Jane?

MISSY: It's just the next door down the hall. They've got a storage room.

SKINNER: The damaged package that they wanted - do you remember where it would be sent?

MISSY: No, not off-hand.

SKINNER: Is there any way of finding out?

MISSY: I can look up the tracking number.

SKINNER: That would be a big help to me, Misty. And maybe to Jane.



SCENE 9
FBI SPECIAL PHOTOGRAPHY UNIT

(Mulder stands behind a photo tech who has been working on the surveillance tape.)

PHOTO TECH: We went through every inch of that tape to find the best angle for identification purposes. Now remember it was videotape, shot at a distance under extreme low light.

MULDER: So this is the best you can do?

PHOTO TECH: It's better than I thought it would be, believe me. I tried every trick that ...

MULDER: I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just this is very important to me. I need to be sure.

(As the image on the screen becomes clearer, Mulder recognizes Skinner in the photograph. He is stunned. His jaw drops and he puts his hand over his mouth for a moment.)

MULDER: (somewhat shaky voice) I need you to print out a hardcopy of that for me.

(At a syndicate gathering, CSM shows a small jar containing a single bee.)

CSM: This is the last remaining specimen. The bees from the scientist's house - it's been contained and destroyed.

1ST ELDER: And the body?

CSM: It also has been sanitized.

1ST ELDER: How did this happen?

CSM: It's been taken care of. The details are unimportant.

1ST ELDER: Details are everything. Much more important than your vague assurances.

CSM: Well, you'll have to trust my assurance that any other breaches have been handled.

1ST ELDER: Handled by whom?

CSM: I have a man in place. A man with no other choice but to succeed.

1ST ELDER: What assurance can you give us that he can be trusted?

2ND ELDER: We can't risk even the slightest exposure.

CSM: He has nothing to expose ... except his own duplicity.

1ST ELDER: Should we assume that the trial run is proceeding as planned?

CSM: It's already begun.



SCENE 10
J.F.K. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, PAYSON, SOUTH CAROLINA

(Young children are playing on the playground. As the kids are swinging on bars, a bee flies above them.)

DAVID: Hey, it's my turn!

BILLY: No, it isn't! (he starts swinging across but drops from the bar halfway across) Ow. Ow.

(Billy is on his knees rubbing his hand. David comes to look.)

DAVID: (shouting) Ms. Kemper! Billy got stung by a bee!

(Ms. Kemper is tending to another girl who appears to have been stung on the leg. Two other girls run toward her as well.)

YOUNG GIRL: Ms. Kemper!

(As Ms. Kemper stands, she sees several bees around her. Many children are now screaming.)

MS. KEMPER: Everyone get inside! Everyone inside! Move it! Move it! Come on!

(The kids are all running toward the school. David trips and his glasses fall off in front of him. Ms. Kemper looks back and sees him left on the playground. She rushes back to him.)

MS. KEMPER: Oh, my God! David!

(David finds his glasses and gets to his feet just as she reaches him. She pushes him toward the school.)

MS. KEMPER: Quick! Run!

(The bees swarm around her. David gets inside the school and turns to see Ms. Klemper fall to the ground. She screams and writhes in pain on the ground as the bees cover her.)



SCENE 11
PAYSON COMMUNITY HOSPITAL

(A nurse removes the breathing mask from David and his mother kisses him before the nurse pulls the sheet over his head. The ward is full of other children being treated. Skinner enters and approaches a doctor.)

SKINNER: Dr. Linzer? My name's Walter Skinner. (he flashes his badge) The administration office informed me you were overseeing the treatment of these children.

DR. LINZER: (walking away from him) Yes.

SKINNER: I think you'll want to hear me out.

DR. LINZER: I'm right in the middle of it.

SKINNER: You've been treating these children for bee stings. You've misdiagnosed them.

DR. LINZER: Then what should I be treating them for?

SKINNER: Smallpox.

DR. LINZER: Is this a joke?

SKINNER: Every child in this town who hasn't already been infected needs to be vaccinated immediately.

DR. LINZER: We don't vaccinate kids against smallpox any more because there is no smallpox.

SKINNER: Run whatever tests you need if you don't believe me.

DR. LINZER: I don't need to run any tests. Smallpox has an 8-day incubation period, and these kids were stung just a few hours ago. How do you reconcile that?

SKINNER: I can't.

(Linzer sees several military personnel entering.)

DR. LINZER: Let me know when you come up with an answer. (he walks away) In the meantime, I've got things to do.

SKINNER: Doctor ...

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Mr. Skinner?

(Marita walks toward him.)

SKINNER: How do you know who I am?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Because you contacted me. I'm Marita Covarrubias.

SKINNER: What are you doing here?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Your call about those bees prompted me to make some inquiries.

SKINNER: Into what?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Seven packages that were sent from Canada to a PO box in Peyson, South Carolina. I came here to find out what was in those packages.

SKINNER: (looking around the ward) You're a little late to do anything about it.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: So are you, apparently. What brought you here? (he doesn't respond) You came to me for information, Mr. Skinner, but you still haven't told me what you know about this. My office has to answer to the Secretary General of the United Nations. This is a very serious matter. I need to know what's going on.

SKINNER: I think it's some kind of experiment.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: An experiment?

SKINNER: Using bees as carriers.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: That's what was in those packages? ... Have you told Agent Mulder this?

SKINNER: Not yet.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Why not?

SKINNER: I can't.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Why? (he doesn't respond and looks away) Are you involved in this, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: I didn't ... No, I'm not involved.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Then what are you doing here? What aren't you telling me, Mr. Skinner?

SKINNER: Nothing.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: If you know who's behind this, you have to come forward, Mr. Skinner. No one else can.



SCENE 12
CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA, 11:02 PM

(Skinner returns to his home, picks up the phone and starts to dial. He sees that his desk drawer is ajar and hangs up. He opens the drawer and picks up his holster, finding that his gun has returned. Mulder steps in, with his gun aimed at Skinner.)

MULDER: Put the gun down and move away from the desk.

SKINNER: I was just calling ...

MULDER: (shouts) I said put the gun down!

(Mulder cocks the hammer of his gun. Skinner puts down his holster.)

SKINNER: You don't understand.

MULDER: No. I do now.

SKINNER: No you don't.

MULDER: Is that the gun you used to shoot the detective?

SKINNER: No.

MULDER: How's it feel to shoot an innocent man in the head?

SKINNER: I didn't kill that man!

MULDER: You're a liar! You've been working with the Smoking Man all along. You knew when he had my father killed, and you knew when they took Scully.

SKINNER: Listen to me!

MULDER: I've heard enough of you.

SKINNER: He set me up! He stole my gun and then he put it back! Which means the police are probably on their way right now.

MULDER: I don't believe you.

SKINNER: Look at my desk drawer, Agent Mulder. (shouts) Look at it! (Mulder looks down, seeing the marks on the drawer where it was pried open) Why would I force my own lock? If I lied to you ... I have lied to you, and I won't make excuses for those lies, but there's a reason that I did what I did - one that I think you're in a unique position to understand. (pauses) I advised you against a certain course of action some time ago ... concerning Agent Scully. I didn't follow my own advice.

MULDER: Give me the gun.

(The FBI ballistics technician is test firing a gun into a water tank. He fires a half dozen rounds, while Skinner and Mulder stand nearby. After he finishes, all remove their hearing protection.)

MULDER: How soon will you be able to determine if that's the weapon that killed Detective Thomas?

BALLISTICS TECH: As long as it takes me to put one of these slugs under the scope and run a comp.

(The technician is now showing a closeup of the slugs on his computer monitor.)

BALLISTICS TECH: Now, this is the slug that we recovered from the detective's body. See this stria here and here? (he points to that slug as well as to the test slug) They're rifling patterns imprinted from the barrel of the same gun.

MULDER: So this is definitely the murder weapon?

BALLISTICS TECH: If I were called to testify I'd say without a doubt. So where'd you find it?

(Skinner is staring at the floor. Mulder stares at Skinner for a moment.)

MULDER: In a sewer grate ... (Skinner looks up quickly at Mulder, who returns his look) ... around the corner from the crime scene. Sometimes you get lucky.

BALLISTICS TECH: Sometimes you don't, right?

MULDER: What do you mean?

BALLISTICS TECH: The serial number - it's been filed clean off. Well, unless forensics pulled a print, this gun is virtually untraceable.

(Skinner looks at Mulder again. Mulder fakes a disgusted look for the benefit of the ballistics tech. Skinner walks away, looking briefly at Mulder as he passes. Mulder turns and watches him leave.)

(CSM enters his home and looks toward the light switch. Skinner is seated in a chair.)

SKINNER: Leave it off. (he stands and aims his gun at CSM) I'm starting to get used to the dark.

CSM: Is this part of our deal?

SKINNER: We never had a deal.

CSM: No?

SKINNER: Agent Scully is dying, and you haven't done a damn thing about it. (CSM smirks) You think that's funny?

CSM: I'm just enjoying the irony, Mr. Skinner. Only yesterday, you said you wouldn't be a party to murder and now here you are. Yours isn't the first gun I've had pointed in my face, Mr. Skinner. I'm not afraid to die. But if you kill me now, you'll also kill Agent Scully.

SKINNER: You have no intention of saving her. You never did.

CSM: Are you certain? I saved her life once before, when I had her returned to Agent Mulder. I may save her life again. But you'll never know if you pull the trigger, will you? (his phone rings) Now, unless you intend to kill me, I'd like to answer my phone.

(Skinner fires three shots. As he leaves, he passes CSM, who has bullet holes in the wall behind his head. After Skinner closes the door, CSM swallows hard and then answers the phone in a shaky voice.)

CSM: (to phone) Yes ... He was just here. He threatened to kill me. I'm sure Mulder will be contacting you. He'll want to know if Skinner's seen all there is to see.

(It's Marita Covarrubias on the other end of the conversation. Behind her, an out-of-focus figure stands, apparently listening in on the conversation from another extension. She looks quickly toward the other person.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: I'll tell him what you want me to tell him.

CSM: Tell him what he wants to hear.

[THE END]


                                    ELEGY



SCENE 1
ANGIE'S MIDNIGHT BOWL
WASHINGTON DC

(It is after hours, and Angie Pintero is cleaning up. He walks by a counter where Harold Spuller is very slowly putting bowling shoes back into bins on the wall.)

ANGIE: Oh gosh, go home Harold.

HAROLD: I'm not done yet.

ANGIE: Harold, you hear me? You should have gone home already.

HAROLD: I'm not done yet.

ANGIE: For praying out loud Harold, this ain't so difficult.

(Angie starts quickly shoving shoes onto the shelves. Harold becomes increasingly agitated.)

HAROLD (shouts): I'M NOT DONE YET!

ANGIE: (gently putting his hands on Harold's shoulders) Harold, it's past your bedtime. It's ok. And the doctors will be worried about you. You did a good job today now you go home c'mon.

(Harold walks away, mumbling)

HAROLD: 16 21 37 45 60 71 86 ...

(Angie sees the pin setter cycling on one lane. He walks over and presses the reset button on the lane, and a bowling ball returns. He picks it up and sees blood on it.)

ANGIE: What the hell?

(He walks down the lane and sees a pool of blood next to one of the pins.)

ANGIE: Jeez.

(He crouches down and looks up into the pin setter and sees a pale image of a young girl, caught in the mechanism. Her eyes are open and her mouth is moving slowly but there is no sound.)

ANGIE: Oh God, oh my God! No! I'll get help! Oh!

(He runs to the phone and dials 911 but just then hears a siren outside and runs out toward a police officer standing just across the street.)

ANGIE: Officer, officer!

OFFICER: Sir, this don't involve you.

ANGIE: There's a woman inside, she's bleeding, she's ...

(Angie looks beyond the officer and sees the body of a young woman lying on the pavement with her throat cut. It is the same girl that he saw in the pin setter mechanism.)

ANGIE: God. That's her! That's the girl I saw!

SCENE 2
ANGIE'S MIDNIGHT BOWL

(It is during normal business hours. Scully is putting on bowling shoes. While bowlers are celebrating in the background, Scully walks down the lane toward Mulder and Angie, who are lying in the lane, looking up at the pin setter.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.

(Scully joins them underneath the pin setter.)

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

MULDER: The pin setter. You see the way it's wedged and broken?

SCULLY: Yep.

MULDER: Mr. Pintero said the only way that would happen would be if considerable weight or pressure was placed on it from above.

SCULLY: (to Angie) This is where you saw the body?

ANGIE: Yes ma'am, she was caught up in the machinery. Her neck was cut.

SCULLY: And the blood from the victim was pooling where?

ANGIE: (pointing to a spot beneath the pin setter) Right here.

SCULLY: But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned?

ANGIE: Yeah, but like, like I said, the woman in the parking lot ...

SCULLY: Was the same woman that you saw caught up here in the machinery?

ANGIE: That's right.

(Scully gives Mulder a brief glance, then backs out from beneath the pin setter. Angie follows. Mulder lays his head down on the lane, studying the area carefully. He then backs out and stands. Scully is writing notes on a pad.)

ANGIE: Look, I'm not making this up!

MULDER: No one's suggesting that you are, Mr. Pintero.

ANGIE: I saw the look on her face.

MULDER: Can I ask you a favor? Can I get a soda, a cola, something like that?

ANGIE: Sure.

MULDER: Thanks.

ANGIE: Yeah.

(Angie walks back to get Mulder's drink. Mulder and Scully start walking back to the head of the lane.)

MULDER: What is that look, Scully?

SCULLY: I would have thought that after three years you'd know exactly what that look was.

MULDER: What, you don't believe in ghosts?

SCULLY: You're saying that what this man saw was the victim's ghost?

MULDER: Sounds more like a disembodied soul.

SCULLY: Which is just another name for a ghost.

MULDER: Except according to Mr. Pintero, this one was trying to communicate. It was speaking to him as if she was trying to tell him something. It sounds more like a death omen.

SCULLY: A death omen?

MULDER: Yeah. It's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger of death.

(Mulder grabs a bowling ball and bowls a strike. Scully shows mild surprise.)

MULDER: This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks ... and as many murders. Each time the victim appearing near the crime scene trying to communicate, trying to say something.

SCULLY: Communicate what?

MULDER: I don't know yet but, uh, ... (to Pintero, who has returned with a drink) ... thank you. (To Scully) If you hold on a second I may have an answer for you.

(Mulder walks back toward the pin setter, with Scully and Angie following. Mulder lies down beneath the pin setter and pours the cola onto the area that Angie had pointed out.)

ANGIE: Hey! What are you doing?

MULDER: She is me.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Written onto the wax - she is me - look at this!

(Scully moves closer and also sees the words "she is me" showing up darkly in the pool of cola.)



SCENE 3

(A darkened police meeting room)

(Detective Hudak is showing slides and briefing a group of about a dozen policemen.)

HUDAK: Three victims ... all women ... all approximately the same age, height, weight, hair and eye color ... all attacked within the same six block area of each other. Our FBI profiling model suggests a white male, late twenties / early thirties. His victims were probably strangers to him... symbols representing other women in his life ... perhaps all women. (He notices Mulder whispering something to Scully) Hey you in the back! Are we boring you?

MULDER: No, not at all.

HUDAK: Because if you have nothing to contribute to this profile ...

MULDER: No, actually I do have something to add. I think that following the FBI model in this case will not only fail to turn up the killer but will undoubtedly lead to more victims and more deaths.

HUDAK: You want to tell us who you are and what you base that on?

MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. We're from the FBI. We're here following up a lead that seems to have been dropped - a statement made by the proprietor of the bowling alley that ...

HUDAK: ... the guy that claims that he saw the victim ...

MULDER: No, no, not the victim. Her apparition, what the Irish call a fetch, what is more commonly known as a wraith.

HUDAK: Oh, ok.

MULDER: Were there any written messages in any of these other cases?

HUDAK: Written messages?

MULDER: Do the words "she is me" have any meaning to you?

HUDAK: You mean Penny Timmons last words?

MULDER: Those were her dying words?

HUDAK: According to a 911 call we received ...

MULDER: Well who made that call?

HUDAK: A nut.

MULDER: What do you mean?

HUDAK: There were no dying words. Penny Timmons larynx was severed. She couldn't cry for help even if there was help to cry for.

MULDER: And no one followed up on this lead?

HUDAK: No but, uh, I'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up on it.

MULDER: I'd appreciate that.



SCENE 4
NEW HORIZON PSYCHIATRIC CENTER

(A gathering room, where patients are engaging in various activities. Among the patients is Howard Spuller. Mr. Alpert, the facility head, enters with Mulder, Scully, and Nurse Innes.)

ALPERT: People! People! Listen up now. I've brought some folks who want to talk with you. Nurse Innes, could you gather the group?

INNES: All right everyone! Let's go, you know the drill. Get your seats. Group seating. Go on in. (to Harold, who is slow to get up) Harold, come on. Harold.

(All the patients get settled into chairs.)

ALPERT: Good morning, everybody.

PATIENTS: (together) Good morning, Mr. Alpert.

ALPERT: I've brought visitors today. They're investigating a crime. (Several patients look alarmed) It's OK. They just want to ask you a few questions.

MULDER: Hi. I wanted to ask if anybody used the pay phone out in the hallway there on Friday night - because somebody called the police and reported a murder.

(There is no reaction from any of the patients.)

ALPERT: (whispers to Mulder) Sloppy Joe night.

MULDER: That was Sloppy Joe night.

CHUCK (a patient): Oh, that was me. I did it. I admit it, I did it. I'm just a human being, after all.

ALPERT: Chuck! Tell the truth.

CHUCK: No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it. I ... I lied. I lied but I'm just a human being.

ALPERT: Has anyone used the pay phone to call the police?

(Again no response from the patients. Howard Spuller is in the back, rocking quickly back and forth and looking agitated.)

MULDER: (holding up a picture of the latest victim) Anybody recognize this woman?

(Several patients slowly raise their hands.)

CHUCK: That's the lady that got murdered.

VARIOUS PATIENTS: Yeah she's the one ...I recognize her ... I know her ... She was murdered ...

(Mulder notices that Harold Spuller is not responding and has a pained look on his face.)

SCULLY: (holding up a TV Guide with Jay Leno's picture on the cover) And, does anybody recognize this man?

VARIOUS PATIENTS: Oh, yes, yes, he did it ... He did it ... He's the murderer ... He's a very funny man ... He smiles a lot.

(Scully glances at Mulder and walks out.)

MULDER: (to Alpert) The quiet man in the back.

ALPERT: Harold Spuller.

MULDER: The only one who didn't raise his hand, yeah. Has he ever been a problem?

ALPERT: Harold? No. He has a tendency to get a little worked up.

MULDER: Do you think I could talk to him.

ALPERT: Yeah, sure.



SCENE 5
THE HALLWAY IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CENTER

(Scully is examining crime scene photos. Harold, Nurse Innes and Mulder are walking toward her. Harold and Innes continue toward a meeting room while Mulder stops to talk to Scully.)

SCULLY: Yeah, I found something here Mulder ... in these photos taken by the forensics team. The third victim, her left hand, that band of pale skin. It looks like she wore a ring on that hand.

MULDER: (looking at the photo) A wedding ring, yeah.

SCULLY: Yeah. But she wasn't married.

MULDER: So what, he stole her ring?

SCULLY: No, not at all.

(Scully shows him another photo of the same victim, showing a ring on her right hand.)

MULDER: Oh, he switched it.

SCULLY: (shuffling through some other photos) And in all the other murders he repeated the same ritual, changing the ring on each of the victims.

MULDER: Nice catch, Scully. Any idea about the psychology at work?

SCULLY: Well, there's something called ego dystonia. It's a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person has the persistent and inescapable impulses to change things, to organize, to reorganize. But it's not ordinarily something that escalates to a murderous impulse.

MULDER: Not ordinarily unless there was a more complex psychology at work, like pronounced mental illness.

SCULLY: You really think that the killer is a patient here?

MULDER: I'm not sure if the killer is here, but certainly the person that made that phone call is, and I think his name is Harold Spuller.

SCULLY: Did he cop to making the call?

MULDER: No but he's about to.



SCENE 6
A MEETING ROOM AT THE CENTER

(Mulder and Scully are questioning Harold, who appears upset. Nurse Innes is also in the room.)

HAROLD: I don't know anything. I didn't do anything. Leave me alone.

MULDER: You made that phone call, didn't you Harold?

HAROLD: No!

MULDER: Did you say the words "she is me"?

HAROLD: No!

MULDER: Have you ever heard those words?

HAROLD: No!

MULDER: Have you ever seen a ghost, Harold?

HAROLD: No! No! (He starts rocking back and forth and repeating "No" more loudly and rapidly) Please leave me alone.

(Mulder and Scully step back, and Nurse Innes moves in to try to calm Harold, but he continues to shout "No")

SCULLY: Well ... when you're right, you're right.

HAROLD: (now crying) 17 ... 30 ... 37 ... 45 ... 53



SCENE 7
AN OFFICE IN THE PSYCHIATRIC CENTER

(Scully is seated reviewing medical records as Mulder walks in.)

SCULLY: Harold Spuller suffers from pervasive developmental disorder, which is sometimes called atypical autism. He's spent his entire life in and out of facilities just like this one. He has been medicated, he has received shock therapy and, aside from his other disabilites, he has been diagnosed with severe ego dystonic obsessive-compulsive disorder ... which would explain the switching of the victims rings.

MULDER: So why all of a sudden?

SCULLY: You mean what made him snap? Why, I think his outburst clearly showed a frustrated impulse towards violence when he was put in a challenging situation.

MULDER: That outburst didn't come until after I'd asked him if he'd ever seen a ghost.

SCULLY: Mulder, the man is disturbed. You could see the pressure building in him from the moment the interview began.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Why are you now so unconvinced that Harold Spuller is the man we came here looking for?

MULDER: I'm sure Harold Spuller is the man that made that phone call. But what led us to him still remains unexplained.

SCULLY: "She is me."

MULDER: Uh huh, and the other apparitions, like the one Mr. Pintero saw at the bowling alley.

SCULLY: Well, I think I have an idea about that if not an explanation. Howard Spuller is at this facility voluntarily, which means he can come and go as he pleases, to kill those women or to hold down a job or both.

(Scully points to a page from Harold's records, which shows Angie's Midnight Bowl as his place of employment. A droplet of blood falls onto the paper next to her finger. Scully's nose is bleeding. She wipes at her nose with her hand.)

MULDER: Oh Scully ...

SCULLY: Yeah. It's ok.

MULDER: You sure?

SCULLY: Yeah, it's just, um, I'm fine. I just need to find a washroom.

(She walks out leaving Mulder with a pained look on his face.)



SCENE 8
A WASHROOM AT THE CENTER

(Scully enters and gets a paper towel from the dispenser and holds it to her nose. She walks over to the sink, looks in the mirror, and leans over to run some water on the towel. She holds it to her nose and looks back up at the mirror. The words "She is me" are written on the mirror in blood. As she stares at the mirror, a low moaning sound is heard. She walks around a partition in the washroom and sees a ghost-like figure of a young woman next to the window. The woman is wearing a college sweatshirt and her mouth is open, although no words can be heard. As Scully watches, a line across the young woman's throat opens up and blood flows down her neck.)

MULDER: (knocking on the door of the washroom) Scully?

(Scully glances at the door, then looks back toward the window and the ghost-like figure is gone.)

MULDER: Scully, you in there?

(Scully walks back around to the sink and the words are no longer on the mirror.)

SCULLY: (in a shaky voice) Yeah.

MULDER: (opening the washroom door) They found another victim. A college student with her throat cut. Just about a half block from here.

(He closes the door, leaving a stunned Scully in the washroom.)



SCENE 9

(A city street near the center, the scene of the latest murder)

(Scully looks at the body. The young woman is the same one she saw in the washroom, wearing the same sweatshirt.)

MULDER: Her name was Loren Heller, age 21. She's single, apparently she was on her way home from a bar that she part-timed at after school. She had a ring on her left hand, switched to her right hand, pinky finger. She was dead less than an hour when she was found.

SCULLY: That would rule out Harold Spuller as the killer, huh?

MULDER: No, actually it doesn't. Harold's not at the home. He's nowhere to be found. His nurse locked him in his room after we left, but he managed to escape unnoticed.

SCULLY: I don't imagine he'd be too hard to find.

MULDER: Yeah, but I think we should be the ones to find him, if only to find out what "she is me" means.

(Scully seems distant and distracted.)

SCULLY: Mulder ... I ...

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: I think I'm going to let you take care of that. I, uh, I think I'm gonna get this checked out just, you know, just to be safe.

MULDER: You want me to drive you?

SCULLY: No, no, I'm fine really. I've had the doctors keep a close watch and it's just, just precaution.

MULDER: You're sure?

SCULLY: I'm fine.

(She walks away, watched by a concerned Mulder.)



SCENE 10
A DARK AREA

(Harold is applying paste to the back of a piece of paper and mumbling numbers under his breath. He attaches the paper, a bowling scorecard, to a wall. He looks just to the left and sees the words "She is me" written in blood across some scorecards. He slowly turns around and sees the ghostly images of four young women.)

HAROLD: No ... no ... I just want to be left alone!



SCENE 11
A LABORATORY AT A HOSPITAL

(A nurse is taking a blood sample from Scully's arm. Scully stares ahead somberly. The nurse finishes and leaves the room. Scully stands and fetches her coat. She walks slowly across the room, looking up at her reflection in a mirror.)



SCENE 12
COUNSELLOR KAREN KOSSEFF'S OFFICE

KOSSEFF: We've spoken about your fear. You've been afraid to express it to others, to Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: This is different.

KOSSEFF: How?

SCULLY: Several months ago, I was diagnosed with a cancerous mass - a nasal pharyngeal tumor that can not be operated on and, uh, cannot be treated by conventional medicine.

KOSSEFF: I'm sorry.

SCULLY: I don't mean for this to sound too dire. My health has been good. I have been checked up on a weekly basis.

KOSSEFF: You've kept working?

SCULLY: Yes. It's been important to me.

KOSSEFF: Why?

(Scully seems surprised by the question and is slow to answer.)

SCULLY: Why? Um ...Agent Mulder has been concerned. He's been supportive through this time.

KOSSEFF: Do you feel that you owe it to him to continue working?

SCULLY: (quickly) No. (pauses) I guess I never realized how much I rely on him before this ... his passion ... he's been a great source of strength that I've drawn on.

KOSSEFF: What happened last night, Dana?

SCULLY: I saw something. I, I don't know what to trust. If I saw it because of the stress, because the image had been suggested to me or if it was a suggestion of my own fears.

KOSSEFF: Your fear of failing him?

SCULLY: (exhales emotionally) Maybe.

KOSSEFF: What did you see?

SCULLY: I saw a woman who had recently been murdered. I saw her. It appeared as if she was trying to tell me something.

KOSSEFF: Do you know what?

SCULLY: No.

KOSSEFF: Are you sure?

(Scully pauses, then looks up at Kosseff, her eyes moist.)



SCENE 13
ANGIE'S MIDNIGHT BOWL

(Mulder enters and looks around. Angie sees him from behind a counter.)

ANGIE: Hey, you're back.

MULDER: Yeah, I'm looking for Harold Spuller.

ANGIE: Harold? What for?

MULDER: Suspicion of murder.

ANGIE: You think Harold killed those women?

MULDER: You obviously don't think so, huh?

ANGIE: Harold's worked for me for 10 years. He might be crazy but he couldn't kill anyone. He's a sweet kid.

MULDER: You know where he is now?

ANGIE: He was here this morning when I arrived, arranging the shoes.

MULDER: He has a key?

ANGIE: No, he's got some damn way of getting in here through an abandoned building next door.

(Mulder looks around again. We see Harold crouched below the pin setter in the service area.)

MULDER: Did you ever get lane 6 working?

ANGIE: No, not since I saw the girl.

(Mulder looks back toward lane 6 just as a couple of pins falls from the pin setter onto the lane. He starts toward the pin setter and spots Harold.)

MULDER: Harold? (Harold ducks back into the service area and climbs a ladder. Mulder slides under the pin setter into the service area and pursues.) Harold? (He follows Harold up the ladder.) Harold, I just want to talk to you. Harold?

(Mulder finds Harold sitting on the floor against the wall.)

HAROLD: (softly) She is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ...

MULDER: Harold?

HAROLD: (softly) She is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ... she is me ...



SCENE 14
AN INTERROGATION ROOM

(Harold, an attorney and Detective Hudak are seated at the table, while Mulder stands. Harold is rocking and mumbling.)

ATTORNEY: I want to make this clear from the start. My client is suffering from a mental disorder which impairs his judgement. He will not answer any questions regarding his guilt or innocence.

HUDAK: I'd be real happy if you'd quit talking right now.

ATTORNEY: (pointing a pen at Hudak) Any time Harold becomes upset or unwilling to cooperate, this interrogation will end. Detective Hudak?

HUDAK: (in an agressive tone) Tell me why you did it, Harold, huh? Come on, tell me why you killed those women.

ATTORNEY: What did I just say? This is totally unacceptable. I am prepared to tell my client not to cooperate.

MULDER: (gently) Harold? Harold, you knew those women who were murdered, didn't you? That's why you're scared. You're afraid they've come back to visit you. Penny Timmons.

HAROLD: 8 17 30 37 45 53 71 80 92 99 108.

MULDER: Missy Shapiro.

HAROLD: 14 29 38 57 71 79 88 101 117.

MULDER: Michelle Chamberlain.

HAROLD: 17 32 49 69 78 87 99.

MULDER: What was her shoe size?

HAROLD: Six and a half.

HUDAK: There you have it.

ATTORNEY: This is not a confession.

HUDAK: He killed them. He stalked them, he fixated on them, and he slit their pretty little throats. Isn't that right, Harold, huh?

ATTORNEY: Harold, as your paid attorney, I'm advising you not to respond to any more questions nor to cooperate with this investigation any further.

MULDER: Harold, there are people who think that you murdered these women. I'm not one of them. But I need your help for me to prove that. You think you can do that? I think you can.



SCENE 15
ANGIE'S MIDNIGHT BOWL

(Mulder enters followed by Harold, the attorney, Hudak and two uniformed officers.)

MULDER: Mr. Pintero? I'd like to search the building for any ways in or out that Harold might have of the bowling alley.

ANGIE: Oh sure.

MULDER: Thanks.

ANGIE: You OK, Harold?

HAROLD: The shoes are out of order, Mr. Pintero. I'm sorry.

ANGIE: Hey. It's OK, buddy, don't you worry about it. You get this straightened out with these folks, then you'll come back and keep me in line.

HAROLD: OK, Mr. Pintero.

(Mulder, Hudak and the attorney are being led by Harold through a dark area in the adjacent building.)

HUDAK: I want to know why the hell we're being led around like this.

MULDER: I'm hoping it will become clear to us when we find it.

HUDAK: Is that right? He's going to show us something that's going to exonerate him?

MULDER: I think so.

HAROLD: Here.

(Harold points to a scorecard pasted to the wall that has "Michelle C" as one of the bowlers.)

HUDAK: Here what?

HUDAK: My God! They're all here, every victim.

(They see another scorecard with "Penny T". The whole wall is covered with scorecards.)

ATTORNEY: This proves nothing.

HUDAK: He fixated on them.

ATTORNEY: I see hundreds of scorecards up here, thousands of names.

MULDER: Choose a name. Pick a name, pick any name up there.

HUDAK: (looking at a scorecard) Fred Graham.

HAROLD: 17 42 67 88 107 122 131 166 178 201.

(The numbers match the frame-by-frame score for Fred Graham's scorecard.)

MULDER: 200 game. that's not bad.

HUDAK: You're saying he has all these scores in his head?

MULDER: Including the victims.

ATTORNEY: You said this proves his innocence. How?

(Harold looks down the wall and sees a pale image of Angie in the corridor.)

MULDER: I'm not sure exactly, but I think that ...

HAROLD: No! No!

(Mulder looks toward the same area and sees nothing. Harold still sees the image, and Angie's mouth is moving.)

HAROLD: No! No! No!

(Harold dashes off back in the direction that they came. The other three start after him.)

(Back at the front of the alley, Harold is on his knees, crying loudly, as Mulder catches up. One of the officers is performing CPR on Angie, who is lying on the floor.)

OFFICER: He just keeled ... fell right over. I've done what I can. Must have been a heart attack.

(Harold continues to cry loudly as Mulder places a hand on his shoulder.)



SCENE 16
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully, with hands clasped in front of her chin, is somberly staring into space. The doorbell rings. She goes to the door, looks through the peephole, unchains and opens the door and lets Mulder in.)

MULDER: Hey Scully. Is it too late?

SCULLY: No. What are you doing Mulder?

MULDER: I needed your help on something. I needed your medical expertise.

SCULLY: On what?

MULDER: Harold Spuller. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even ask you. What did your doctor say?

SCULLY: I'm fine.

MULDER: Good.

SCULLY: What's up, Mulder?

MULDER: Angie Pintero, the bowling alley guy? He's dead.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: Natural causes. Congestive heart failure. Just keeled over right in the bowling alley.

SCULLY: That's what you need my medical opinion on?

MULDER: No. Howard Spuller had a preminatory vision of his boss's death.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

MULDER: Harold saw an apparation - what may have been Angie Pintero's disembodied soul at the moment of or just prior to his death.

SCULLY: How do you know?

MULDER: Because I was standing right there when he saw it.

SCULLY: But you didn't see it yourself?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: I don't have that facility, that kind of connection to the victims that would have made such a vision possible.

SCULLY: What's Harold Spuller's connection?

MULDER: I don't know its exact nature but I think it has something to do with his autism ... that Harold experienced a profound attachment to these victims but because of his disability was unable to express the depth and power of those relationships, so somehow a psychic or preconscious bond was formed that went beyond the temporal.

SCULLY: Oh, wait a minute, so Harold knew the people that were killed?

MULDER: Yeah, from the bowling alley, going back seven years.

SCULLY: Even if what you're saying is true, Harold wasn't the only one who claims to have seen these apparitions.

MULDER: No, but he does have something in common with those who've had the visions that is quite powerful in its own right.

SCULLY: Which is what?

MULDER: Well, they were all dying ... one of emphysema, one of cancer and now Angie Pintero.

SCULLY: Harold Spuller is dying too?

MULDER: Well that's what I need your medical opinion on.

SCULLY: Well, what if he isn't?

MULDER: I would be very surprised. What is a death omen if not a vision of our own mortality? And who among us would most likely be able to see the dead? Harold's at the resident home right now.

SCULLY: I'll meet you there.

(Mulder leaves.)



SCENE 17
NEW HORIZON PSYCHIATRIC CENTER - 11:42 PM

(Chuck Forsch is lying in bed and hears Harold's name called and voices in hall. He goes to the door and looks out into the hall as two police officers are bringing Harold to Alpert.)

ALPERT: Well, you're back. Everything's going to be all right now, Harold. They just want us to keep you here for a little checkup. Nothing to worry about. (to the officers) Thanks, officers.

(The officers leave and Alpert and Harold start down the hall. Chuck opens the door wider and Harold stops to look at him. Harold appears agitated.)

ALPERT: All right, Chuck. Go to bed. You can see Harold in the morning.

(Chuck closes the door and Harold and Alpert continue down the hall.)

ALPERT: See. Everyone's so glad to see you back, Harold. You'll be able to talk to Chuck in the morning.

(In the exam room, Alpert hands Harold a cup with a half dozen tablets. Harold is still agitated and is mumbling numbers and rocking.)

ALPERT: You still have to take your meds, Harold. Keeps you flying straight and level. Come on. It's the way we always do it.

(Harold nervously takes the cup as Nurse Innes enters.)

ALPERT: Atta boy. Good stuff. (to Nurse Innes) Hi. We just brought him back.

INNES: Is he acting up?

ALPERT: No, I think he's just a little scared. I've been trying to get him to take his meds.

(Harold continues to mumble and rock. He is holding the cup but hasn't taken the pills.)

INNES: Why don't you let me sit with him for a bit.

ALPERT: OK, sure.

(Alpert leaves. Innes waits until he has closed the door on his way out.)

INNES: Take your poison, Harold. Go on. What you got to live for now, huh? What did you tell them, Harold? Did you tell them about your little girlfriends? Huh? Did you tell them how you were in love?

(Harold becomes increasingly agitated.)

HAROLD: No!

INNES: Did you show them your pictures?

HAROLD: No!

INNES: What do you think those girls thought of you, Harold? Do you think they loved you back? No one could love you, Harold. (points at a mirror) Look at yourself. They looked at you and saw an ugly toad. A retard.



SCENE 18
THE FRONT DESK AT THE CENTER

(Mulder enters and sees Alpert.)

ALPERT: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Thanks for accomodating us again.

ALPERT: Not a problem. We're all concerned for Harold.

MULDER: I understand.

ALPERT: You're bringing a doctor?

MULDER: Agent Scully's a doctor. If you can arrange to have Harold's medical records made available, that would expedite the ...

(A scream is heard from down the hall. Mulder and Alpert hurry toward it. Several patients come out into the hallway as well.)



SCENE 19
THE EXAM ROOM

(Nurse Innes is alone, lying on the floor. She is bleeding from a head wound.)

ALPERT: Oh God. What's happened to you? Don't touch that. Don't touch that. It's just a cut.

(Scully walks down the hallway. There is a crowd of patients outside the exam room. Scully slips between them and into the room. Nurse Innes is sitting on the exam table.)

MULDER: Tell me exactly what happened.

INNES: Like he just went wacko. I was trying to get him to take his meds and he went beserk. He jumps me, he starts pounding me like he wants to kill me.

MULDER: Did he say anything?

INNES: No, he just started screaming like a lunatic. Something's gone wrong with him. I think he's lost it for good. (to Alpert) I'll be damned if I'm gonna to take care of him any more.

ALPERT: Look, I think you should get this cut on your head looked at.

INNES: Maybe, just give me a few minutes to get my nerves back.

(Alpert, Mulder and Scully walk out of the room, leaving Innes alone.)

ALPERT: (to several patients who are in the hallway) OK everybody, everything's fine now. Come on, back to bed. That's right. Go on now. We'll see you in the morning. Night-night everybody. (to Mulder) What can I do to help?

MULDER: I want you to call the police. Ask for Detective Hudak. Tell them what happened, tell them to look for Harold down at the bowling alley.

ALPERT: Are they going to arrest him?

MULDER: I don't see that there's any way around that. Sorry.

(Alpert leaves.)

SCULLY: Maybe you were wrong.

MULDER: Well, that's a superficial head wound, Scully. He didn't mean to kill her or maim her. That's not the work of a murderer if you ask me.

SCULLY: Then why would he do it?

MULDER: Maybe Harold is sicker than we thought he was.

SCULLY: Maybe. We won't know until we can examine him.

(Mulder notices Chuck Forsch looking at them from up the hall.)

MULDER: I think there's someone you can talk to about it. Why don't you talk to his roommate and I'll see what I can do about finding Harold.



SCENE 20
THE EXAM ROOM

(Alone, Nurse Innes slips a scalpel into her pocket.)



SCENE 21
CHUCK FORSCH'S ROOM

(Scully enters.)

CHUCK: Oh hi.

SCULLY: Is your name Chuck?

CHUCK: Yes. Yes it is. Uh, Chuck Forsch. F-O-R-S-C-H. Chuck Forsch.

SCULLY: Do you, uh, do you share this room with Harold?

CHUCK: Yes, he's my friend.

SCULLY: Do you know where he is?

CHUCK: He's dying, isn't he? Harold is dying.

SCULLY: Why do you say that?

CHUCK: Nurse Innes, she's, she's trying to poison him.

SCULLY: Who told you that?

CHUCK: Harold. He said she told him she was putting poison in his meds.

SCULLY: Harold hasn't been taking his medication?

CHUCK: I don't know. I don't know everything, I'm only a human being. But I do know that Harold's my friend. He wouldn't hurt anybody. You know, he really loved them.

SCULLY: Who?

(Chuck crosses the room and removes a book from a drawer.)

CHUCK: Harold. He gave them to me. He was afraid.

(Chuck takes several photographs from the book and hands them to Scully. The pictures are of the murdered women.)

SCULLY: Does anybody else know about these pictures, Chuck?

CHUCK: Nurse Innes.



SCENE 22
THE LADIES' RESTROOM AT THE CENTER

(Nurse Innes is alone at the sink. She has Harold's medications and nervously takes a drink of water, swallowing some of them. She is startled as Scully enters.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

INNES: I'm, you know, shaky.

SCULLY: Understandable.

INNES: Working with these people starts driving you crazy too. I'm just looking forward to going home.

SCULLY: Will your family be a comfort?

(Scully notices that Nurse Innes is holding something in her left hand.)

INNES: I live alone.

SCULLY: No children?

INNES: Just the one my husband ran off with.

(Innes drops the pills onto the floor.)

SCULLY: Nurse Innes, I'm afraid I'm gonna to have to ask you to step out into the hallway.

(Innes takes the scalpel from her pocket and slashes at Scully, driving her to the wall. Scully catches Innes's arm and they struggle. Scully forces Innes to drop the scalpel by slamming her hand against the wall. They continue to struggle, and Innes grabs Scully's coat and uses it to sling her across the room and to the floor. As Innes retrieves the scalpel, Scully draws her gun and aims it at her.

SCULLY: Stay where you are! Drop it! Let it go!

(Innes pauses for a moment, then raises the scalpel and lunges forward. Still lying on the floor, Scully fires.)

(From a ramp in the center, Mulder hears the shot and runs back to the restroom. He is joined by Alpert. Scully is standing over Innes, who is bleeding from a gunshot wound in the shoulder.)

SCULLY: She's alive. Let's get a paramedic in here.

ALPERT: Yeah.

(Alpert runs back to summon help.)

MULDER: (looking at Scully's hand) You're cut.

SCULLY: Yeah, she attacked me. (Mulder starts to pick up the scalpel). You might want to bag that. I'm pretty sure it's the murder weapon.



SCENE 23

(Later, Mulder and Scully are walking down the hall as Nurse Innes is carried out on a stretcher. As they talk, Mulder and Scully walk down the ramp in the front part of the center.)

SCULLY: She had been taking Harold's meds ... clonazepam and clozapine ... the unregulated effects of which are violence and unpredictable behaviour.

MULDER: Yeah, but why did you even suspect her?

SCULLY: Well, I went in to talk to Harold's roommate and he said that Harold thought that she'd been poisoning him. So I went in to confront her and she just went off.

MULDER: Why do you think she killed those women?

SCULLY: I don't know. I mean, maybe in some drug-addled way, she was trying to kill happiness, Harold's happiness, his love for those women, maybe trying to destroy something she thought she'd never have again.

MULDER: She is me.

SCULLY: I don't know. Have they found Harold?

MULDER: Yeah. They found in an alley a few blocks from here, face down on the pavement. They worked on him for twenty minutes but he couldn't be revived.

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: Well, preliminary diagnosis is apnia - respiratory failure.

SCULLY: As a result of what?

MULDER: Well, the paramedics are at a loss to explain that, but if what you're saying is true, that Harold stopped taking his medications, then that could have been a factor in his death - at least in the visions that he was seeing.

SCULLY: Well, Harold Spuller wasn't dying, Mulder. He, he was killed as a result of what that woman took away from him.

MULDER: Is that your medical opinion?

(Scully pauses. They have stopped walking and are standing on the ramp.)

SCULLY: I saw something Mulder.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: The fourth victim. I saw her in the bathroom before you came to tell me.

MULDER: (in a slightly annoyed tone) Why didn't you tell me?

SCULLY: Because I didn't want to believe it. Because I don't want to believe it.

MULDER: Is that why you came down here, to prove that it wasn't true?

SCULLY: No, I came down here because you asked me to.

MULDER: Why can't you be honest with me?

SCULLY: (defensively) What do you want me to say? That you're right, that, that I believe it even if I don't. I mean, is that what you want?

MULDER: Is that what you think I want to hear?

SCULLY: (softly) No.

MULDER: You can believe what you want to believe, Scully, but you can't hide the truth from me because if you do, then you're working against me ... and yourself. (his voice softens) I know what you're afraid of. I'm afraid of the same thing.

SCULLY: The doctor said I was fine.

MULDER: I hope that's the truth.

SCULLY: (whispers) I'm going home.

(Scully walks down the ramp, leaving Mulder leaning against the wall. Outside, she walks to her car. There are flashing lights from police cars and an ambulance a couple of blocks down the street. Scully gets in the car and slowly breaks into tears. She sees the ambulance driving away, and as she follows it with her eyes, in her rear-view mirror she sees a pale image of Harold in the back seat. Wide-eyed, she turns around to look but there is nothing there. She turns back, shocked.)

SCULLY: Hello?

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, what time is it?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: It'S ALMOST 5:00 AM. Is something wrong?

MULDER: I think so.

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I think I'm in a... a motel room in Providence, but...

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: Rhode Island.

SCULLY: What are you doing there?

MULDER: I don't know. There's... t-there's blood all over me.

SCULLY: Are you hurt, Mulder?

MULDER: I don't think so. I don't think it's my blood.

SCENE 3
PROVIDENCE, RI
APRIL 12
6:15 AM

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder? Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: You okay?

MULDER: I can't get warm.

SCULLY: You're in shock. Dry yourself off. I'll get you a blanket. Do you feel sick? Nauseous or dizzy?

MULDER: N-no, but I, uh... I woke up on the floor with a pounding headache.

SCULLY: Were you here alone?

MULDER: I think so. I don't know. I don't remember anything.

SCULLY: Track my finger. Do you know what day it is?

MULDER: Uh... No, what day is it?

SCULLY: It's Sunday. What's the last thing that you remember?

MULDER: I was in my apartment. I talked to you on the phone.

SCULLY: That was Friday.

MULDER: I've been here since Friday?

SCULLY: I don't know, but you packed a bag. There's a change of clothes in there. Do you feel any pain? Did you receive a blow to your head?

MULDER: No. No.

SCULLY: Did you take anything, Mulder?

MULDER: No. No.

SCULLY: Are you sure you didn't cut yourself?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Where's your weapon?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: Two rounds have been fired.

MULDER: I don't remember that.

SCULLY: Mulder, I need to get you to a hospital. You have to be examined by a neurologist. You have had a serious cerebral event. It could be a viral infection, or possibly the early stages of encephalitis.

MULDER: If there was a crime committed, I need to know what happened.

SCULLY: Mulder, the first thing that you need to do, is to take care of yourself. Mulder, listen to me. We are going to figure this out, but first, we have to determine the cause. You cannot take something like this lightly. If this is an aneurysm, it could drop you in a second.

MULDER: Are these your keys?

SCULLY: No.

SCULLY: You checked in alone around noon on Saturday. The manager's got no record of any phone calls made from the room. No visitors.

MULDER: Well, then, how did I get here?

SCULLY: You drove. He's got a license number of a car registered. Do you have those keys you found in your room?

MULDER: That's not my car.

SCULLY: There's blood on the steering wheel, Mulder. Car's registered under a David Cassandra. The address is right here in Providence.

MULDER: Who's Amy?

SCULLY: That's what I'm gonna find out, Mulder, but first, I'm checking you out, because you have no business even walking around here.

MULDER: No, Scully. If I've shot someone, if my weapon's been used in a crime, I need to know.

SCULLY: You are taking a big risk, Mulder. I feel strongly about this.

MULDER: I know you do, but it's my risk.



SCENE 4
CASSANDRA RESIDENCE
PROVIDENCE, RI

WOMAN: Can I help you?

MULDER: Are you Amy?

WOMAN: No, she's not here right now.

SCULLY: Is this David Cassandra's house?

WOMAN: This is Dave and Amy's house.

MULDER: And who are you?

WOMAN: I'm the housekeeper. Who are you?

SCULLY: We're with the FBI.

WOMAN: Why do you have Amy's keys? Is something the matter?

SCULLY: Possibly. Is Amy or David reachable in anyway?

WOMAN: They're out right now. I don't know where they are.

MULDER: That, uh, painting... behind you. Uh... do you think I could take a look at it?

WOMAN: Yeah.

MULDER: Who painted this?

WOMAN: Amy.

SCULLY: Mulder, what's up?

MULDER: I know this house.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: I don't know. I've seen it before. Does this house have any special meaning to Amy or David?

WOMAN: I know it's her favorite subject. It's the house that she grew up in. Actually, it's all she paints.

MULDER: I've been to that house.

SCULLY: When?

MULDER: I don't know, but I've been there.

SCULLY: Do you know anything else about this house?

WOMAN: I know it's out in Chepachet.

SCULLY: Where's that?

MULDER: It's about 20 miles from here, on route eight. My parents had a summer house out there when I was a kid, in Rhode Island.

SCULLY: If you've been here, Mulder I don't think it was any time recently. The place looks abandoned and completely overgrown. Mulder? Mulder?! Do you hear me? Mulder? Mulder?



SCENE 5

(FLASHBACK)

MRS. MULDER: How can you do this to our family?!

MR. MULDER: I'm not doing it! It's not just me. These orders are coming down from...

CANCER MAN: You're a little spy.

(END OF FLASHBACK)



SCENE 6

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, can you hear me? What happened?

MULDER: I don't know. It just hit me.

SCULLY: You fell to your knees and you grabbed your head, like you were in terrible pain. You were completely non-responsive. Do you remember any of that?

MULDER: No. I remember what I saw.

SCULLY: What do you mean, what you saw?

MULDER: I had a very vivid flashback to my childhood. Except, I was there.

SCULLY: Do you remember anything else?

MULDER: No, just that it was very real.

SCULLY: Your heart is racing.

MULDER: What do you think it was?

SCULLY: It was some kind of a seizure. Some kind of acute physiological disturbance. I couldn't tell if you lost consciousness but, it was definitely some kind of clonic event. Kind of an electrical storm in the brain.

MULDER: Brought on by what?

SCULLY: That's what a specialist is going to have to tell you, Mulder.

MULDER: I feel really good right now.

SCULLY: Mulder, you are not really good.

MULDER: I think I've been here before.

SCULLY: What, in your childhood?

MULDER: Maybe.

SCULLY: I don't think anybody's lived here in a long time.

MULDER: I'm going to check upstairs.

SCULLY: Mulder. There's a gunshot wound to her heart. This must be Amy Cassandra. And her husband.

SCULLY: They'd like to ask you some questions. I told them about your condition. You don't have to speak to them if you don't want to.

MULDER: You mean, not without my attorney present?

SCULLY: Mulder, I refuse to believe that you had any part in this.

MULDER: I had those people's blood on shirt, Scully. I was missing for two days. I have no recollection of my actions during those two days. There were two rounds discharged from my gun. I had the keys to this house, the keys to their car. Do the words "Orenthal James Simpson" mean anything to you?

CURTIS: How you feeling, agent Mulder?

MULDER: I'm a little confused.

CURTIS: Your partner says you're suffering from some kind of a seizure, that you had one right here in the yard. What brought you to this house, agent Mulder?

MULDER: I don't know. I, uh... I think I may have come here as a kid.

CURTIS: You think?

MULDER: Well, my parents had a summer house in Quonochontaug, so...

CURTIS: But you don't know anything about David or Amy Cassandra, the victims?

MULDER: I don't ever remember meeting them, no.

CURTIS: So what you're saying, then, is--the first time you saw them was when you walked into this house, using their keys, and you found them there on the floor.

MULDER: That's what I'm saying.

CURTIS: We got plenty of prints in that house--some with blood on them. Now, we're going to run those prints, agent Mulder. Is that the story you want to stick with?

MULDER: For now.

CURTIS: Would you like to come down to the station, and elaborate on that statement?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder's not going anywhere but to a hospital.

CURTIS: Okay. But we're all going down there together. Agent Mulder, I'd like you to ride with us.

SCULLY: Mulder, I'd advise you not to say anything more--not until I take a look at those bodies and the forensics reports.



SCENE 7

ME: Amy Anne Cassandra, caucasian female. Birth records indicate her age at 62 years. The subject is 165 pounds, 67 inches in height. Preliminary exam indicates cause of death due to a gunshot wound to the chest. Powder burns and flashing at the point of entry, approximately four inches below the clavicle, indicating the shot was delivered at point-blank range. Dorsal beveling of the shoulder blade is visible at the exit wound. The surrounding tissue is jagged and torn. There are no other signs of trauma present on the body. [ONLY IN CC:] Rigor mortis is present in the extremities...

SCULLY: Did you see this?

ME: Yeah. From the scabbing, it looks like a preexisting, superficial puncture wound.

SCULLY: Do you mind?

ME: What are you looking for?

SCULLY: I'm not sure. Do you have a magnifying glass? Thanks. I just want to make sure that in addition to the autopsy, you also do a craniotomy and a histological examination.

ME: I think it's clear what killed these people.

SCULLY: Yeah. I think it is, too, but what I'm more interested in right now is why they died.



SCENE 8

MULDER: What's that?

CURTIS: Have you jogged your memory at all, agent Mulder? You wanna change your story?

MULDER: No. Why?

CURTIS: Because I have evidence here that contradicts what it is you've told us.

MULDER: Well, I haven't really told you anything.

CURTIS: You told us you haven't been to that house since your childhood, and you didn't know Amy or David Cassandra.

MULDER: And you're telling me what's in that bag is evidence that I'm a liar?

CURTIS: I'm not saying you're a liar, agent Mulder. I would like to believe that this memory lapse was real, and that you murdered these two people in some fit of blind insanity.

MULDER: What's in the bag?

CURTIS: It isn't your gun... which in our preliminary forensics analysis seems to be the murder weapon. Judging from the slugs we pulled from the floor and the wall, the execution-style point-blank range. Is any of this coming back to you, agent Mulder?

MULDER: No. Can I see what's in the bag now?

CURTIS: Be my guest. There are two blood types on that shirt, agent Mulder--one matching Amy Cassandra's, the other matching David Cassandra's. Is that your shirt, agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes.

CURTIS: Can you explain to me how the blood of two people you claim not to know got onto your shirt?

MULDER: No. What about the prints... in the house? Were they my prints? Look, you're not going to get a confession out of me, because I can't answer your questions, because I don't remember.

CURTIS: You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney, and have an attorney present during questioning. If you so desire and cannot afford one, an attorney will be appointed for you without charge before questioning. You understand each of the rights I have explained to you?



SCENE 9

SCULLY: Mulder. I'm going to get you out of here.

MULDER: You're a doctor, not a lawyer, Scully.

SCULLY: Did you make a confession?

MULDER: No. Only to my own ignorance.

SCULLY: Detective Curtis, before you go through all that trouble, I need you to consider evidence that I think casts doubt on agent Mulder's involvement in this crime.

CURTIS: What kind of evidence?

SCULLY: Medical evidence. The toxicology report on Amy Cassandra indicates there was a rapid-acting anesthetic called Ketamine in her system.

MULDER: Ketamine? That's a veterinary drug, isn't it?

SCULLY: Typically, but when ingested by a person, it can cause hallucinations.

CURTIS: So?

SCULLY: So, I went down to the hospital to go over agent Mulder's medical charts and his blood work, and there are traces of the same drug in his system.

MULDER: How would that get there?

SCULLY: Probably injected--there was a bruise from an injection on Amy Cassandra's right hip. Now, I think if you were examined again--that we would find a corresponding puncture.

CURTIS: Given by whom?

SCULLY: I don't know, but the presence of such a powerful drug could explain his memory loss or the blackouts.

CURTIS: Given the weight of all the other evidence... I think that's all it explains.

MULDER: Scully... you don't have to do this.

SCULLY: Mulder, you have to help me out. There is nothing here that points directly to your guilt. I mean, unless somebody can show me with absolute certainty that you were holding the weapon

that killed those two people, the rest of the narrative is far too convenient and suspect. The drug in your system already suggests other explanations.

MULDER: What? That I was partying with a few senior citizens?

SCULLY: You're jailing an innocent man.

CURTIS: Yeah, well, this way he won't get lost for two days and do something else he won't remember.

MAN: Shot fired!

SCULLY: I'm a doctor. Somebody call the paramedics. He's dead. I need to speak with detective Curtis right now.

SCULLY: Did this officer have a history of depression or mental illness?

CURTIS: He'd been remanded from his beat assignment to a desk job a year ago. His former partner had complained on a number of occasions about his tendency toward extreme irritability, and confabulation of the truth.

SCULLY: How do you mean?

CURTIS: The man we're talking about had become something of a joke on the force, one of those guys who believes in... you know, extraterrestrials? Stuff like that.

SCULLY: Do you see these photos?

CURTIS: Yeah.

SCULLY: Does this mean anything to you?

CURTIS: Should it?

SCULLY: Well, I think that it speaks to a pronounced mental illness. The compulsive and repetitive act of removing his own image from these photos leads me to believe that he not only believed these stories, but was traumatized by them.

CURTIS: I thought you told me this was going to help explain something about your partner's crime. What's that?

SCULLY: Amy Cassandra. Both your officer and Amy Cassandra had identical puncture wounds at the top of the frontal lobe. Now, in her autopsy, Amy Cassandra's was a deep puncture through the cranium to the dura matter.

CURTIS: And my officer had the same thing?

SCULLY: Yes. I think your officer knew of Amy Cassandra, and somehow his suicide is linked to her death, which leads me to believe that what we're dealing with here is not murder. It's something else. It's possibly even a suicide pact.

CURTIS: You're going to have to prove that to me.

SCENE 11

MULDER: Guard! Guard! I need to talk to someone! Guard!



SCENE 12

CURTIS: According to the corrections officer, agent Mulder kept everybody awake last night. He was demanding to talk to you. He finally shut up about an hour ago.

SCULLY: Did he say about what?

CURTIS: I think your partner's memories are coming back to him.

SCULLY: I need to talk to him alone, if you don't mind. [to Mulder] I heard you didn't get much sleep.

MULDER: I didn't kill those people, Scully.

SCULLY: I know that, and I think I've gathered enough proof and evidence of your innocence to get you out of here.

MULDER: From where?

SCULLY: The forensics reports. The, uh, the shirt that you were wearing did have the victims' blood on it, but the blood-spatter pattern doesn't match the point-of-entry detail. In fact, detective Curtis and his team have been able to put together enough contradictory evidence to make a statement to the press saying that the Cassandras' death was as a result of a murder-suicide.

MULDER: But I was there.

SCULLY: Yes.

MULDER: And I still don't remember why.

SCULLY: I think I have an idea about that, too. Amy Cassandra believed that she was an alien abductee.

MULDER: And I contacted her.

SCULLY: Yes... apparently. According to an article I read on Amy, she had begun psychiatric treatment that was effectively recovering her past. The repetitive behavior exhibited in those paintings that we saw, was an expression of that treatment.

MULDER: But why shoot herself and her husband?

SCULLY: I can't say definitively, but judging from an almost identical suicide of a police officer who was receiving the same psychiatric care, I believe that the victims were suffering from something called Waxman-Geschwind syndrome, the symptoms of which are trance-like states, leading to vivid dreams about the past-- dreams that are more detailed than the conscious mind can recall. It's also called Dostoyevsky syndrome because the Russian novelist was suffering from it, too.

MULDER: What was I doing there, Scully, and why didn't I do anything to stop it?

SCULLY: I can't explain that. I've arranged for your arraignment in one hour. I think that by then, detective Curtis and I will have gathered enough forensics data that you'll be released.

MULDER: I still need to know why, though.



SCENE 13
WARWICK, RI

SCULLY: This is the office of the psychologist that treated Amy Cassandra. Have you been here before?

MULDER: I don't know, but we found my car.

SCULLY: It's been here for a few days.

MULDER: What was the name of that psychologist?

GOLDSTEIN: Hello.

MULDER: Dr. Goldstein? My name is Fox Mulder. Have we met?

GOLDSTEIN: I don't believe so. My receptionist says you're from the FBI?

SCULLY: Yes. We're investigating the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra. We understand that Amy was a patient of yours.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Please, sit down. I was very upset to learn about Amy. She was a troubled woman who'd struggled through an unfortunate period of darkness in her life.

SCULLY: Are you referring to her belief that she was an abductee?

GOLDSTEIN: This term "alien abductee..." Although I recognize there is an associated syndrome, and a rather remarkable collection of shared experiences for those who believe in the phenomena, my treatment of Amy was simply an aggressive method to access buried or repressed memories.

MULDER: How do you mean, "aggressive"?

GOLDSTEIN: I use a method of therapy that simulates an electrical impulse in the brain, using light and sound.

SCULLY: Did you also use this treatment on a police officer named Michael Fazekas?

GOLDSTEIN: Yes. Why?

SCULLY: Mr. Fazekas shot himself in the head last night.

GOLDSTEIN: Oh, my god.

MULDER: Is this an accepted form of medical treatment?

GOLDSTEIN: It's unconventional, but it's not invasive.

SCULLY: Are you familiar with Waxman-Geschwind syndrome?

GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

SCULLY: Did you know Amy Cassandra suffered from it?

GOLDSTEIN: Waxman-Geschwind...if you know anything about it, it is not necessarily a destructive condition. In fact, Amy, after undergoing treatment, experienced periods of extreme happiness and creativity.

MULDER: But you had no idea--you had no indication she might have taken her own life?

GOLDSTEIN: No! Of course not. I have been in practice for over 40 years. I have a very good ethical and professional reputation, if you'd care to check.

MULDER: That won't be necessary.

SCULLY: I know what you do.

MULDER: I have been here before. I met Dr. Goldstein with Amy Cassandra.

SCULLY: This man is lying about more than that. I think that he administered the Ketamine to Amy and to you. I think that you were treated by him, and I think that your blackouts--these seizures--are a result of that.

MULDER: I think you're right.

SCULLY: Why would you do that, Mulder? Why would you undergo something as crazy and dangerous as this? Mulder? Mulder! Mulder?



SCENE 14

(FLASHBACK)

MRS. MULDER: My baby!

(END OF FLASHBACK)



SCENE 15

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: I'm fine.

SCULLY: No, I am not going to take that for an answer. You do not belong at work. You need to be somewhere where you can be monitored. You are a danger to yourself, and a danger to me. Are you hearing me?

MULDER: Give me the car keys.

SCULLY: No, you're not driving. You're not doing anything until these symptoms go away.

MULDER: Scully, I don't want these symptoms to go away. Whatever's happening to me, whatever treatment I've received, is allowing me to go back into my unconscious. The truth is in there, recorded, and I've gotten access to it. What happened to my sister--the reason she was taken--is becoming clear to me, and I need to know that. Now give me the keys.

SCULLY: To go where?

MULDER: To my mother's, in Greenwich.

SCULLY: Okay... but I'm driving.



SCENE 16

MRS. MULDER: Fox.

MULDER: I need to speak to you.

MRS. MULDER: What's happened, Fox? Why have you come here?

MULDER: You've kept things from me. You've kept secrets from me.

MRS. MULDER: What's the matter with him?

SCULLY: He's undergone a treatment. He believes it's helped him to remember things.

MRS. MULDER: Remember what?

MULDER: You told me that, when they took Samantha, it was because you had to make a choice, but that's not how it happened. It wasn't your choice to make.

MRS. MULDER: What do you want to hear from me?

MULDER: I wanna know what happened that night on Quonochontaug, and I need to speak to you privately. You had some kind of relationship with him.

MRS. MULDER: Who?

MULDER: You know who. The man who worked with my father, the man who came to you that night when I was 12, and forced you to choose Samantha.

MRS. MULDER: No, Fox...

MULDER: Yes! You betrayed my father, your husband.

MRS. MULDER: Never!

MULDER: How far back did it go?

[slap!]

MRS. MULDER: How dare you! How dare you come here and accuse me!?

MULDER: Who is my father?

MRS. MULDER: What do you want, to kill him again?!

MULDER: Just answer the question, mom. Just answer the question!

MRS. MULDER: I am your mother, and I will not tolerate any more of your questions. You're bleeding, Fox.



SCENE 17
9:25 PM

MULDER: What did you do to me?

GOLDSTEIN: I told you...

MULDER: You treated me. I asked you to treat me to recover my past.

GOLDSTEIN: I did nothing wrong.

MULDER: You put a hole in my head.

GOLDSTEIN: A slight electrical stimulation.

MULDER: It triggered my memory.

GOLDSTEIN: Yes, as you had hoped.

MULDER: Now I want you to finish the job. Let's do it. I wanna remember.

CURTIS: Dr. Charles Goldstein? Dr. Goldstein, you're under arrest. Please, keep your hands where they are. Bag those gloves as evidence. Someone, read him his rights. Where is he? Mulder.

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

CURTIS: He's not here.

SCULLY: Did you ask Dr. Goldstein?

CURTIS: Goldstein wouldn't say one way or the other.

SCULLY: Stop that car! Hey! Open the back door. What did you do to him? Look, I know he came back here. This is the only place he would have gone. Did you treat him? Damn it! Answer me!

GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

SCULLY: Where is he now?

GOLDSTEIN: I don't know where he went.

SCULLY: What was the last thing he said to you?

GOLDSTEIN: He said he was going to exorcise his demons.



SCENE 20
QUONOCHONTAUG, RI

IMHOF: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah.

IMHOF: Frank Imhof.

SCULLY: Is he in there?

IMHOF: Saw a light go on a couple of minutes ago. Got to be somebody in there. We got here as soon as you called.

SCULLY: All right... that man in there is armed. He is a federal officer in dire need of medical attention. He is not himself. Now, I'm going in there. If at any time he should flee that house, you need to tell your officers not to shoot.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Leave me alone, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: Scully, leave me alone.

SCENE 24

MULDER: Get away!

SCULLY: Are you going to shoot me, Mulder? Is that how much this means to you? Mulder, listen to me. You have been given a powerful hallucinogen. You don't know that these memories are yours. This is not the way to the truth, Mulder. You've got to trust me.

MULDER: Shut up!

SCULLY: Put down the gun. Let it go.

IMHOF: We got shots fired. Move!

MULDER [only in CC]: I'm so tired. I need to know, Scully. I just need to know.

SCULLY: Although cleared of any wrongdoing in the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra, agent Mulder still has no recollection of the events that led to their deaths. His seizures have subsided, with no evidence of permanent cerebral damage, but I'm concerned that this experience will have a lasting effect. Agent Mulder undertook this treatment hoping to lay claim to his past--that by retrieving memories lost to him, he might finally understand the path he's on, but if that knowledge remains elusive, and if it's only by knowing where he's been that he can hope to understand where he's going, then I fear agent Mulder may lose his course, and the truths he's seeking, from his childhood, will continue to evade him...driving him more dangerously forward in impossible pursuit.

SCENE 1
ON TV SCREEN (NASA Symposium Boston University November 20, 1972)

PANELIST: Some feel that contact with other civilizations is no longer beyond our dream, but is a natural event in the history of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of us.



SCENE 2
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Early morning. There are people milling around his living room. We see Scully's badge, then her worried face.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. (The people part and let her into the room)

VOICE: Let her through. (Scully walks from the foyer to the living room where there is a photographer taking pictures. She walks in to see a body with a sheet over it on the floor in front of the couch.)

DETECTIVE: Detective Rempulski, Alexandria P.D. Thanks for coming down to do this. (The detective is standing by the entry to the living room and walks with her to the body and kneels down by it's face. He lifts the sheet over the face and looks at Scully.) It him?

SCULLY: Yeah. (She looks away and leaves the room.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(In an official room with a rectangular table and low level lighting, there are people seated around the table. A door opens that fills the room with light from the hall. Agent Scully enters)

BLEVINS: Agent Scully, please have a seat. (She sits in the nearest chair at the opposite end of the table from Blevins) Agent Scully, we've had a brief discussion, that will you restate the matter we're here to put to rest?

SCULLY: Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X Files. As I am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical prospective on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, who's investigations into the paranormal were fueled by a personal belief that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12. I come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is my scientific opinion that he became over the course of these years a victim. A victim of his own false hopes and of his beliefs in the biggest of lies.

SCENE 4
SAINT ELIAS MOUNTAINS YUKON TERRITORY, CANADA

(Over the snow capped mountain, a helicopter flies over. In another helicopter, an older man, Arlinsky and a younger man, Babcock.)

ARLINSKY: We're meeting the guide at base camp. He'll take us to the site.

BABCOCK: Has he seen it?

ARLINSKY: Oh, yeah. He said it's unbelievable. (Babcock looks in the distance and sees yellow tents, base camp.)

BASE CAMP (A man waits for the helicopter to land and when it does, rushes to meet them. He helps the older man with his bag and the helicopter takes off.)

BABCOCK: How soon til we can get to the site?

MAN: Right now? We'd be pushing it to get to the camp by nightfall.

BABCOCK: I'd rather sleep seeing it than lay awake all night wondering.

MAN: It will take some work.

ARLINSKY: I've waited all my life for this day.

BABCOCK: Let's do it.

LATER (The men hike up the mountain.)

LATER (It's dark and the men trudge through a narrow crevice to get to a mini camp in the cave.)

MAN: We're here. (They greet others, introduce themselves and shake hands. They walk to the north wall and in the ice, there's a grey alien body.)

ARLINSKY: My God, it's beautiful.



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Back to the meeting)

BLEVINS: Agent Scully, I presume you have a basis for this break from Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: Yes Sir. Recent events have shed new light on the factual and physical evidence that would serve to prove the existence of extra terrestrial life, which was the foundation of Agent Mulder's consuming devotion to his work.

BLEVINS: What factual evidence?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder was recently contacted by man who's pursuit of this evidence seemed to coincide with his own. In his intense desire to believe, Agent Mulder was duped by this man. He was fooled by an act of scientific slight of hand calculated to perpetuate false truths, a larger lie. I am here today to expose this lie. To show the mechanism of deception that drew him and me into it. And to expose Agent Mulder's work for what it is.



SCENE 6
MRS SCULLY"S HOUSE

(There's a dinner party going on. A maid is rushing through the room. It's candle lit and tastefully festive. Mrs. Scully lights the last of the candelabra candles and walks toward Scully's voice in the living room. She's mingling.)

SCULLY: So he toppled over me and down the stairs.

MRS. SCULLY: Hi.

SCULLY: Speaking of Bill, is he coming? (The maid opens the door and it's Bill.)

MRS SCULLY: There he is. (She goes to greet him. Scully turns to him, it may have been a long time since she's seen him. He's wearing a Naval uniform and hugs his mother. Scully walks over)

SCULLY: Look at you, my big brother. (They hug)

BILL: Sorry I'm late. My ship got stuck in traffic. (Everyone laughs.) You get my birthday card?

SCULLY: Yes, I did. Thanks for remembering this year.

BILL: Well, once a decade... (Mrs Scully greets someone at the door. Scully looks over to see her greet Father McCue. Scully's smile for her brother fades)

BILL: How are you feeling?

SCULLY: I'm fine. Let's get some dinner, huh?

BILL: Yeah, starving. (They walk to the dining room while Scully looks back at her mother and the father.)

LATER (Everyone is seated at the table. Mrs. Scully refills wine glasses. Scully is sitting between Bill and the father.)

BILL: Mom, I'll open some more wine.

MRS SCULLY: Okay. (She hands him the empty and he goes to the kitchen)

FATHER: I feel awkward sitting here. I'm sure you do too.

SCULLY: No, I'm sorry.

FATHER: I've known your family so many years. Your mother asked me to come. That I might have a word with you. (Scully looks at her mother, laughing with the guests.) I know it's been some time since we've spoken ourselves, since you drifted from the church...

SCULLY: Father McCue, I...

FATHER: But a time of personal crisis, a threat to your health, going back to your faith is important and essential.

SCULLY: Father McCue.. I appreciate my mother's concern, and yours. But I'm being treated for my cancer and taking every precaution.

FATHER: Faith can make you stronger.

SCULLY: I haven't felt the need. I have strength and I...(the phone rings) I'm not going to come running back now. It's just not who I am. I'd be lying to myself, and to you.

BILL: (He's holding the phone receiver, half in the kitchen and half in the dining room with a sort of disgusted look on his face.) Dana... phone.

SCULLY: Excuse me. (She gets up and takes the phone from Bill in the kitchen.) Hello? (Cut to Mulder at the office)

MULDER: Hey Scully, it's me. Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

SCULLY: No, is something the matter?

MULDER: Well, I need your help on something. I was just contacted by Doctor Arlinsky from over at the Smithsonian.

SCULLY: Contacted you about what?

MULDER: About something he found on a mountain in Canada.

SCULLY: What? (Bill's peeved)

MULDER: I'd rather not talk about it the phone, I just need you to meet me over at the Smithsonian.

SCULLY: When?

MULDER: Right away. (Scully looks at Bill, who leaves the kitchen with a new bottle of wine. Scully exhales deeply.)

SCULLY: I'm on my way.



SCENE 7
SMITHSONIAN

(Mulder and Scully walk up the stairs)

MULDER: You're going to have to apologize for me to your brother and mother. This is something that just couldn't wait though.

SCULLY: It's okay. Who's this... Arlinsky?

MULDER: He's a forensic anthropathologist that I've been in contact with over the last four years. Several years ago he was involved in an embarrassing UFO photo enhancement scandal. But he continues to profess his innocence.

SCULLY: What am I coming to see?

MULDER: I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to let you decide for yourself.



SCENE 8
LAB

(There is a picture of the alien in the ice. Mulder walks in front of the screen projecting the image.)

ARLINSKY: By my rough estimate from the sediment in the ice core sample, the body you're looking at is over 200 years old.

MULDER: Perfectly intact.

ARLINSKY: Yeah.

MULDER: That doesn't make sense. There should be signs of gradation. (Mulder walks to Arlinsky. Scully is standing in the corner.)

ARLINKSY: The position it was found in. Stuffed in a crevice at high altitude. He may have frozen fast enough to avoid being eaten. (Mulder looks to Scully, who expectantly is not amused)

MULDER: Does that fit geologically?

ARLINSKY: The area where it was found, is in the terminal moraine of a glacier that has since receded. Over 200 years ago, where the alien was frozen was in the tree line so there might have been a thaw.

SCULLY: Who found him?

ARLINSKY: A Canadian geodetic survey team. (He joins Scully, who is looking through paperwork. He shows her a picture of the men on the mountain.) Along with a colleague of mine, Babcock. They're all still up there on the mountain.

MULDER: Who all knows about this?

ARLINSKY: I know what your first thought was. But the St. Elias range? It's an awful long way to go for a hoax.

MULDER: If you're going to go, why not go all the way?

ARLINSKY: I circumspect myself. But the ice core samples that I took. They can't be faked.

SCULLY: You have the ice core samples here?

ARLINSKY: Yeah. (He walks to a fridge and takes out a cylinder.) One taken from each side of the body. 360 degree matching the integrity of the sediment. It's my sincere belief that what we have here is the complete corpus of an extra terrestrial biological entity. Absolute and unrefutible.

MULDER: Qualitatively indefensible. You go public with this nobody is going to believe you. You also risk never knowing for sure because the same people who bury the truth so assiduously will be in charge of its authentication.

ARLINSKY: That's why I came to you. I need to get the specimen out so I can authenticate it. This body means everything to you, Agent Mulder. You could have the proof in your hands.

MULDER: And what do you want?

ARLINSKY: I just want the credit.



SCENE 9
STAIRWAY

(Mulder and Scully are leaving and putting on their coats as they walk, Scully ahead of Mulder)

MULDER: You think it's foolish?

SCULLY: I have no opinion, actually.

MULDER: You have no opinion?

SCULLY: This is your holy grail, Mulder. Not mine.

MULDER: What's that supposed to mean?

SCULLY: It just means proving to the world the existence of alien life is not my last dying wish.

MULDER: What about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny? This is not some selfish pet project of mine, Scully. I'm as skeptical of that man as you are, but proof... definitive proof of sentient beings sharing the same time and existence with us, that would change everything. Every truth we live my would be shaken to the ground. There's no greater revelation imaginable, no greater scientific discovery.

SCULLY: You already believe, Mulder. What difference would it make? I mean, what would proof change for you?

MULDER: If someone could prove to you the existence of God, would it change you?

SCULLY: Only if it were disproven.

MULDER: Then you accept the possibility the belief in God is a lie?

SCULLY: I don't think about it, actually, and I don't think it can be proven.

MULDER: But what if it could be? Wouldn't that knowledge be worth seeking? Or is it just easier to go on believing the lie?

SCULLY: I can't go with you, Mulder.

MULDER: Can you at least take a look at those core samples? Tell me if they're a lie? That's all I'm asking.



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Back to the meeting)

SCULLY: What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder, what I had only learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized. And the doctors told me, sort of a miracle, it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day toward the inevitable.



SCENE 11
CAVERN

(Workmen are using chainsaws cutting the alien body free from the ice. One of the men walk to Babcock's tent. He's loading a gun.)

MAN: What's that for?

BABCOCK: I don't know these men well. Do you?

MAN: Well enough.

BABCOCK: I'm going to be up here alone until you get back. I hope I don't have to use it. (Another man walks to the tent)

OTHER MAN: I think you'd better have a look at this. (They walk to the alien body wall.)

OTHER MAN: We were doing a lateral cut in the back quarter when I saw something in the ice. (He points to a hole about an inch and a half diameter in the ice) Right here.

MAN: What do you think that is?

BABCOCK: I don't know. A bubble... a weak spot... (The other man lifts up a chunk of ice with demarcation on it.)

OTHER MAN: Or a casing channel. A pour hole. Liquid poured in from the side or above somehow.

BABCOCK: Poured from where?

OTHER MAN: I don't know.

BABCOCK: The angle wouldn't make sense.

OTHER MAN: Yeah, you're right. (The other man walks away.)

BABCOCK: We'll never know until we get it out of there. (The workers start cutting again)

LATER ON MOUNTAIN (The guide goes down the mountain.)



SCENE 12
PALEOCLIMATOLOGY LAB AMERICAN UNIVERSITY

(The ice core sample is on a slab.)

LAB TECH: The iron concentration density and temperature profiles are all consistent. There's a tight matrix of crystals of approximable center. (Scully and the lab tech are looking at the ice core sample.) Suggesting the quick freezing scenario we mentioned. Here at the terminus, you've got some particular hydro carbons, jet fuel pollutants found just about everywhere in the world.

SCULLY: But not in old ice.

LAB TECH: Don't misunderstand. This is old ice. This sample has numerous levels of sedimentation like the rings on a tree essentially.

SCULLY: So it hasn't been tampered with?

LAB TECH: No, not that I can see here. Can I ask why you're having this ice sample tested?

SCULLY: Another agent asked me to.

LAB TECH: Do you know where this sample came from?

SCULLY: From a site in the Yukon Territory, why?

LAB TECH: Some cellular material within the matrix...

SCULLY: Plant or animal?

LAB TECH: I don't know. It's what I'd have to classify as a chimera. A hybrid cell.

SCULLY: From what?

LAB TECH: As I said, I don't know.

SCULLY: Is it capable of cell division?

LAB TECH: I don't know that either. I just now found them. I'd like to get them under our electron microscope. If that's okay.

SCULLY: Yes. Please.



SCENE 13
BASE CAMP - NIGHT

(Feet walk slowly to the tents. A shotgun is cocked. Shots fire into the tents.)



MORNING
(A helicopter lands. Mulder and Dr. Arlinsky get out.)

MULDER: I thought you said there was someone meeting us.

ARLINSKY: Yeah, a guide named Roston. (The helicopter takes off. Mulder looks around, there's no one. They start walking to the tents in the distance.)



SCENE 14
COMMUNICATIONS TENT

(Mulder and Arlinsky enter and take off gloves. Arlinsky puts his hand on the camp stove.)

ARLINSKY: I don't get it. This had all been arranged. (Mulder is looking over another table.) I don't know what to do.

LATER (Mulder and Arlinsky walk up the mountain to the base camp.)

ARLINSKY: We should be able to follow this track all the way up to the site.

LATER (On their way up, they find a man laying on the ground.)

MULDER: Funny place to take a nap. (They run to him. It's the man who was walking alone earlier.)

ARLINSKY: God.

MULDER: He's been shot. He's our guide? (They walk on.)



SCENE 15
LAB

(Scully walks into the room she was in before with the lab tach. It's darker and only a strange man at a computer.)

SCULLY: Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Vitagliano. (No response) Dr. Vitagliano, is he here?

KRITSCHGAU: No, I'm afraid not.

SCULLY: I'm supposed to meet him here. Actually, I a little late.

KRITSCHGAU: Sorry. (Kritschgau picks up an ice core tube and walks out. Scully looks at that and looks around. She sees the fridge holding the samples is open and messy. She rushes out the door. She looks down the hallway. No one around, but a stairwell door closes. She goes through the door. She looks up and down. She tries another door to the floor. It seems to be locked. But it opens and pushes her down. She struggles with Kritschgau and she ends up going down the stairs. She groans as Kritschgau goes out the door.)



SCENE 16
BASE CAMP - NIGHT

(Mulder and Arlinsky arrive. It's quiet. They leave their packs outside and turn on flashlights and enter the cave. They see dead men in the tents.)

ARLINSKY: Oh, my God! They're all dead! They've been shot. (They look in all the tents. Arlinsky gets to Babcock's. He's still.)

ARLINSKY: Babcock! (He pauses and thinks) The body...! (They go to the wall containing the alien, it's gone.) It's gone! They took it! (Mulder is disappointed to say the least.) No one knew. We didn't tell a soul. (They walk down to the tents.)

MULDER: They had radio communication. Maybe it was being monitored. (They stop. They hear a groaning.) Someone's still alive. (They rush to Babcock's tent.)

ARLINSKY: It's Babcock.

MULDER: Get him some water. Look's like he took a shotgun hit, but it didn't open him up too badly. The bleeding stopped.

ARLINSKY: Who did this? (Mulder squirts water into his mouth.) They took the body, Babcock.

BABCOCK: No. I buried it.

ARLINSKY: Where? (Later, they move Babcock's tent and push some snow away. There it is.)



SCENE 17
ROOM

(Scully is buttoning her shirt after an exam I suppose. The door opens.)

BILL: Dana?

SCULLY: Bill. What are you doing here?

BILL: I picked up the phone when you called Mom's. They said you could use a change of clothes. (He gives her a hung up, plastic wrapped blouse)

SCULLY: Thank you. Um. Where's Mom?

BILL: I didn't tell Mom what happened. So, what did happen?

SCULLY: I was ... ahhh ... knocked down a flight of stairs, but I'm okay, luckily.

BILL: You're not okay, Dana. I know about your cancer.

SCULLY: I told Mom not to tell you.

BILL: Why?

SCULLY: Because it's very personal... Because I don't want sympathy.

BILL: You think you can cure yourself. Mom tells me that you've gotten worse, that your cancer's gone into your bloodstream. What are you doing at work, gettin' knocked down, beaten up? What are you trying to prove? That you're gonna go out fighting?!

SCULLY: Oh, now come on, Bill...

BILL: Do you know what Mom's going through? Why do you think I didn't tell her when they called?

SCULLY: What should I be doing?!

BILL: We have a responsibility! Not just to ourselves, but to the people in our lives!

SCULLY: Hey, look, just because I haven't bared my soul to you, or to Father McCue, or to God, it doesn't mean that I'm not responsible to what's important to me!

BILL: To what?! To who? This guy, Mulder? Well where is he, Dana? Where is he through all this? (Scully takes the clothes from Bill)

SCULLY: Thank you for coming. (She goes into another room)

BILL: Dana...



SCENE 18
SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON, DC

(A truck backs up to a warehouse door. A man opens it and another man comes to the back. There's a crate in the back)

INSIDE WAREHOUSE (Using crowbars, they open the crate, Mulder and Arlinsky. It's the block of ice with the alien. They lower it into hot water)

ARLINSKY: We should be able to do a good enough examination of the body right here to remove any doubt.

MULDER: We won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating test.

ARLINSKY: Well, I'm betting his physiology alone will be tell tale. (Babcock listens nearby)

MULDER: The Piltdown Man Hoax wasn't uncovered for forty years until it failed the carbon dating test. And that wasn't even very good.

BABCOCK: If this were a hoax, there are 6 dead men up there on that mountain. There sure as hell is somebody else who believes it wasn't.



SCENE 19
FBI SCI-CRIME LAB
WASHINGTON, DC

(A tech is sitting in front of a computer and Scully is standing behind her)

TECH: You well imagine it's a heavily traveled stairwell. We went back to the Bio Lab where we found an anomalous had latents. We found a partial match in the stairwell just four centimeters from one of yours.

SCULLY: Have you run it through the NCIC?

TECH: Yep. This is your assailant, unfortunately he doesn't have a criminal record.

SCULLY: Try the federal data base. (She hits some keys. A match is found)

TECH: I'll be damned! How did you know it would be a government employee?

SCULLY: Where does he work? (She hits some more keys)

TECH: Right here in Washington. Michael Kritschgau... formerly of the US Army... now attached to the Pentagon Research division in Virginia. (She hits more keys. A picture of the attacker Kritschgau appears on screen) Is this the man? (Scully nods yes)



SCENE 20
WAREHOUSE

(Arlinsky is doing the autopsy, talking to Mulder, Babcock filming Arlinsky as he speaks. As he talks of body parts, we are shown them on the alien)

ARLINSKY: The body is 147 centimeters long. Weighing 24 kilograms deliquesced. Derma is hairless, grey with an elephantine texture. There are small eruptions on the surface of the skin most likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice. Otherwise, there appears to be no scarring... no identifying marks... the circumference of the head is 64 centimeters. There are four digits on each hand. Three on each foot. Sex is... undeterminable. The eyes are black covered by what appears to be a thin membrane which I am now removing. (He slices through the membrane to the eyeball) The tissue underneath seems to be semi gelatinous with a fine network of veins through out. (He removes the ribs) Examination of the chest cavity confirms the presence of what appears to be a cardio-pulmonary system... heart, lungs, all identifiable. Within a mass of white string like tissue that doesn't appear to correspond to human physiology.



SCENE 21
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE RESEARCH FACILITY
SETHBERG, VA

(Scully waits in her car across the street from the building. She sees Kritschgau leave and enter the parking garage. She turns the car on and drives to it)

PARKING GARAGE (Kritschgau enters through a door. We hear tires screeching. Kritschgau turns and sees a car coming at him full speed. It's Scully. She puts the brakes on just inches from his knees. He looks at her, recognizes her and runs. She gets out of the car, gun raised)

SCULLY: STOP! FEDERAL AGENT! HOLD IT! (She runs after him. She runs around the bend and she doesn't see him. She raises her gun as she quickly looks between cars) MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU?! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST! Identify your location! (She hears a car start. She runs to it. Kritschgau is about to get away. She runs in front of the car. Gun raised. He screeches to a stop just in time, good thing, cuz she wasn't moving) GET OUT OF THE CAR! NOW! (He parks the car and raises his hands) MOVE! (He gets out of the car with his hands raised. She moves to the side to meet him)

KRITSCHGAU: Please don't shoot. I didn't mean to hurt you. I had no choice.

SCULLY: Put your hands on the car. (She slams him onto the side of the car. His hands go to the roof. She starts frisking him)

KRITSCHGAU: If you arrest me, they'll kill me.

SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.

KRITSCHGAU: The same people who are trying to kill you. The people who gave you your cancer.



SCENE 22
WAREHOUSE

(After the autopsy)

ARLINSKY: There's tissue culture to be done. DNA sequence and then analysis. And it would be wise to run a gas cromatograph and that carbon dated you suggested. But if this isn't alien, I don't know what it is. (Mulder's cell phone rings. He answers it)

MULDER: Mulder...



SCENE 23
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Back to the meeting)

SCULLY: I had reached agent Mulder at a warehouse just outside of Washington in Sethburg, Virginia. They had managed the frozen corpse by helicopter down the side of the mountain and across the Canadian border in a refrigerated truck. After conducting a limited physical examination Agent Mulder was ready to believe that the body was that of an extraterrestrial biological entity. That he had finally found the proof which had eluded him. Which would confirm not only the existence of alien life but of his sister Samantha's abduction.

BLEVINS: But this man Kritschgau had convinced you otherwise. How?

SCULLY: He told me a story which detailed, point by point, the systematic way in which Agent Mulder had been deceived and used and how I as his partner I had been led down the same path. Losing a family member due to my allegiance and contracting a fatal disease which I was told was engineered by the men who responsible for Agent Mulder's deception.

BLEVINS: Were you able to convince Agent Mulder of these facts?

SCULLY: I was only able to convince him to meet me so that he might hear the story the way I had.



SCENE 24
OUTSIDE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

(Mulder goes to his car and leaves. There is a car of men watching him leave. The driver cocks a shot gun)

WAREHOUSE (Arlinsky and Babcock are covering the alien in ice once again. There's a noise at the door. It opens. The shadow of the driver, the assassin walks into the warehouse.)

ARLINSKY: What the hell is this?

ASSASSIN: Right there, Pork. (The assassin stops, shotgun pointed at Arlinsky and talks to Babcock) How's the wound?

BABCOCK: I'll live.

ARLINSKY: What is this Babcock?

ASSASSIN: Get the door. (He shoots Arlinsky as Babcock walks to the door. After the shot, Babcock walks back) Where did Mulder go?

BABCOCK: He got a call.

ASSASSIN: Is he a believer?

BABCOCK: Oh, yeah.

ASSASSIN: Then we're the only ones who know.

BABCOCK: Right.

MULDER'S APARTMENT (Kritschgau sits on a chair across from Mulder on the sofa. Scully is leaning against the doorway between the dining and living rooms)

KRITSCHGAU: The lie you believe, that they have cleverly led you to believe, Agent Mulder, is that there is intelligent life, other than our own, and that we have had contact with these life forms.

MULDER: So you're saying this has all been orchestrated? A hoax?

KRITSCHGAU: Which you've been used to perpetuate.

MULDER: You come by this knowledge how?

KRITSCHGAU: Working for the DOD Watching a military industrial complex that operated unbridled and unchecked during the Cold War, create a diversion of attention from itself and its continued misdeeds by confabulating enough believable evidence to convince passionate adepts like yourself... that it really could be true.

MULDER: And just by chance, you run into Agent Scully?

KRITSCHGAU: (gives the comment a snort and smile) I was just like you, Agent Mulder, suspicious of everything but what you should be. I ran the DOD's agitprop arm for a decade. I can show you records of disinformation dating back to the Korean War, before you were even born.

MULDER: Why come to me now? Why not four years ago?

KRITSCHGAU: I have a son who's very sick. He served in the Gulf War... The lies are so deep the only way to cover them, is to create something even more incredible. They invented you. Your regression hypnosis, the story of your sister's abduction, the lies they fed your father. You wanted to believe so badly. And who could have blamed you?

MULDER: And the thousands of UFO sightings?

KRITSCHGAU: Above top secret military aircraft, concept designed to feed hysteria.

MULDER: Evidence of alien biology?

KRITSCHGAU: Unclassified, but naturally occurring biologic anomalies science will eventually explain.

MULDER: The body that was found?

KRITSCHGAU: Meticulously constructed out of biomaterials created through the hybridization of differentiated cells. What are called chimeras. Frozen into place over the course of a year using sentiment and materials that would bear out its age, poured through a small channel drilled in the rock above.

MULDER: They would have known that the body would be carbon dated, that it would be proved a fake.

KRITSCHGAU: The body will never be tested, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What do you mean?

KRITSCHGAU: You were only meant to see it, to make you believe the lie, so that you might finally commit and go public with the news.

MULDER: (to Scully) This man is a liar.

KRITSCHGAU: You can see for yourself, Agent Mulder. The body is already long gone.



SCENE 25
WAREHOUSE

(Mulder and Scully walk in and Mulder is devastated by the empty room. The alien is gone. But Arlinsky's body is found)

SCULLY: Mulder... (Mulder almost trips over Arlinsky's body)

MULDER: Ah...

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Arlinsky's dead.

SCULLY: So is this man. (She motions to the hot water bath. Mulder walks over and sees Babcock's body floating in the bloody water)

SCULLY: Who did this, Mulder? Mulder? (He starts to angrily walk away)

MULDER: What we had here was proof, Scully, there's no way it could be anything else.

SCULLY: You said it yourself, Mulder. More tests needed to be run.

MULDER: Yeah, but, the ice core samples checked out. If the ice hasn't been tampered with, how could the body within be a fake?

SCULLY: Cellular material found in the ice core samples were a direct match for what this man Kritschgau described. Hybrid cells, chimeras within the matrix.

MULDER: Do we know for sure that those cells are not extraterrestrial?

SCULLY: Mulder, everything this man described. You can't just guess at these details. I'm sorry, but the facts here completely overwhelm any argument against them!

MULDER: Facts overwhelmed by the lies created to support them!

SCULLY: Mulder, the only lie here is the one that you continue to believe.

MULDER: After all I've seen and experienced, I refuse to believe that it's NOT true!

SCULLY: Because it's easier to believe the lie. Isn't it?

MULDER: What the hell did that guy say to you, that you believe his story!?

SCULLY: He said that the men behind this hoax... behind these lies... gave me this disease to make you believe. (Mulder walks off and leaves her alone)



SCENE 26
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder sits alone on the couch, same as opening scene, watching the video)

ASHLEY MONTAGUE: What we generally mean is, of course, intelligent life, something resembling our noble selves. It's entirely probable that there ARE such intelligent forms of life in other galaxies, in the universe. And it is even more probable that many of these forms are vastly more intelligent than we.

ANOTHER MAN ON VIDEO: I think there's no question but that we live in an inhabited universe, that has life all over it. (Mulder is crying)

CARL SAGAN: By finding out what the other planets are like, by finding out whether there are civilizations on planets among the stars, we reestablish a meaningful context for ourselves. (Mulder is in pain)

ASHLEY MONTAGUE: I don't think we should wait until the encounter occurs, but that we should do all in our power to prepare ourselves for it.

ISSAC ASIMOV: I can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying as establishing such communication with a so-called superior or, if you wish, advanced technology in outer space. (We see a close-up of Mulder's crying face, which morphs into Scully's face at the hearing, also beginning to cry)



SCENE 27

SCULLY: Earlier this morning, I got a call from the police, asking me to come to Agent Mulder's apartment. The detective asked me ... he needed me to identify a body...

BLEVINS: Agent Scully ...

SCULLY: Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]
                                     REDUX PART I



SCENE 1
24 HOURS EARLIER THAN THE END OF GETHSEMANE
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder is watching the tape of the astronomers speculating on the existence of extra terrestrial life. Mulder is crying.)

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: I've held a torch in the darkness to glance upon a truth unknown. An act of faith begun with an ineloquent certainty that my journey promised the chance, not just of understanding, but of recovery. That the disappearance of my sister, 23 years ago, would come to be explained. (Mulder stands and puts his hands to his face) And that the pursuit of these greater truths about the existence of extraterrestrial life might even reunite us. A belief which I now know to be false... and uninformed... in the extreme. My folly revealed by facts which illuminate both my arrogance and self-deception. (He picks up his gun from the coffee table. He looks at it in his hand) If only the tragedy had been mine alone, might it be more easy tonight to bring this journey to its end. (He checks the clip. There are bullets in it. He loads it...the phone rings. He picks it up but doesn't say anything)

KRITSCHGAU ON PHONE: Agent Mulder? (No answer.) Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes...

KRITSCHGAU: There's a matter of security. Something I hadn't anticipated. Just after I left your apartment

MULDER: Who are you? (Cut to Kritschgau in a phone booth at night)

KRITSCHGAU: Just after our last conversation, I was followed by people

MULDER: Who are you?!

KRITSCHGAU: Are you listening to me, Agent Mulder? Are you hearing me? We can't talk now. I have reason to believe

MULDER: Did they give... Agent Scully this disease? Did they do this to her because of me?

KRITSCHGAU: They may be listening, Agent Mulder. They may be watching you. Everything you do and say. (Mulder starts to look around his apartment.) Are you listening, Agent Mulder? (Mulder looks to the ceiling at the light.) Agent Mulder? (There's a little pin hole next to the ceiling fixture. Mulder hangs up. We see through the surveillance camera at Mulder looking at the camera. Mulder runs out of the apartment.)

UPSTAIRS

(Mulder runs up the stairs and kicks in the door to the apartment right above him. He has his gun pointed. There is a man, Scott Ostlehoff, who is burning evidence: papers, videos, etc.)

MULDER: Back away! (He does. Mulder tries to stomp out the fire. Mulder looks up to see Ostlehoff grab a shotgun. Cut to the hallway outside. A gunshot. Camera pans to the door which is ajar. A hand closes the door.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
SCULLY'S APARTMENT

(Scully walks into her apartment and locks the door. She walks through the dark. She plays her answering machine. No new messages. She takes off her coat. In Scully's darkened bedroom as she is just about to take off her top)

MULDER: Keep going, FBI woman.

SCULLY: Mulder? What are you doing? Why are you sitting in my bedroom in the dark?

MULDER: It was too crowded in my apartment, I couldn't sleep.

SCULLY: I'm not kidding, Mulder.

MULDER: Good, cuz neither am I. There's a dead man on the floor of my apartment, and it's only a matter of time before he starts to stink the place up.

SCULLY: What are you talking about, Mulder? What's going on? (Mulder stands from his chair in the corner and walks to the window, looks outside, shuts the blinds and turns on a lamp)

MULDER: Apparently somebody thinks my life is interesting enough to put on video tape. My apartment's been under an electronic surveillance for at least 2 months. Look at this, courtesy of the US government. (He hands her Ostlehoff's ID card)

SCULLY: That's the dead man in your apartment?

MULDER: Yeah, he works ... he worked for the Department of Defense.

SCULLY: How did he die, Mulder?

MULDER: Gunshot wound to the face.

SCULLY: Have you contacted anybody at the Bureau?

MULDER: I can't do that, Scully, I can't go to the authorities with this.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: This man, Ostelhoff, worked for the military. Are you beginning to get the picture? Do you see what's happening here?

SCULLY: That the hoax is connected to the military, just like Kritschgau said it was.

MULDER: This hoax, your cancer, everything! It just doesn't lead back to the military, it leads right back to the FBI!

SCULLY: What?



SCENE 3
SCULLY'S DINING ROOM

(Mulder and Scully walk into the dining room. Mulder switches on the light and Scully sits at the table.)

MULDER: This man, Ostelhoff, was set up in the apartment directly above mine. I caught him trying to destroy phone records on which the same number was called 17 times. (Scully looks at a phone log Mulder shows her.)

SCULLY: This is a PBX operator at the Bureau.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Who would he be calling at the FBI?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: Mulder, how long has this been going on?

MULDER: Maybe since the beginning, since you joined me on the X-Files.

SCULLY: That would mean that for 4 years we've been nothing more than pawns in a game, that it was a lie from the beginning. Mulder, these men... You give them your faith and you're supposed to trust them with your life. (He kneels down beside her)

MULDER: There are those who can be trusted. What I need to know is who among them is not. I will not allow this treason to prosper, not if they've done this to you.

SCULLY: Mulder, we can't go to the Bureau making these accusations.

MULDER: No, but as they lie to us, we can lie to them. A lie to find the truth.



SCENE 4
MULDER'S APARTMENT BUILDING
6:47 AM

(The elevator lights are shown. The car is going up. It opens to reveal Scully as she was in Gethsemane going into Mulder's apartment.)

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: Let the truth be known though the heavens fall. The web of lies entangling us can now be connected back to the very institution which brought us together. (Scully shows her ID to the cops in Mulder's apartment and she is let through.) The facts supported by a byzantine plot, executed by someone inside the FBI who, if named could be tied to the hoax meant to destroy me. (Scully sees the body on the floor in front of the couch.) And to the terminal disease inflicted on Scully. In four years, I have shared my partner's passionate search for the truth. And if my part has been a deception, I have never seen her integrity waver... (The detective pulls the sheet up from the dead man's face) or her honor compromised. (Scully nods and leaves) But now, I ask her to lie, to the people that lied to us. A dangerous lie to find the truth. To find the men who would be revealed as its enemy... (Scully enters the hallway) as OUR enemy. As the enemy within.



SCENE 5
HALLWAY

(Scully now meets Skinner in the hallway.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully. Is it true?

SCULLY: Yes, sir. (She can't look at his face.)

SKINNER: Are you all right?

SCULLY: I'm um.... I don't know what to say. They asked me to come down and identify the body.

SKINNER: How did you make the ID? Word has it from Alexandria P.D. that it was self-inflicted. A shot gun blast to the face.

SCULLY: I saw Mulder earlier this morning. He was wearing the same clothes. (Skinner takes a minute to size her up. He's not sure it's the truth.)

SKINNER: I'm very sorry. (Scully walks past him to the elevator.) Agent Scully... (She turns around) Section Chief Blevins wants you in for questioning about this. He believes you have information you haven't come forward with.



SCENE 6
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

(Mulder enters and walks through like he belongs there. Blends in.)

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: The military connection to the conspiracy we had pierced was now undeniable. The man who lay dead in my apartment worked for the Department of Defense at its Advanced Research facility. (He goes to security area) What I might find here, I was uncertain of. But my crime had provided me access. As long as they believed Scully's lie, that it was me lying on my floor, I might learn truths here. (Mulder sees that everyone is using a code card to get in. He puts Ostlehoff's through the scanner) But, if our lies were discovered, both Scully and I would be discovered with them. (The light turns green and Mulder can enter)



SCENE 7
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON DC
8:41 AM
BLEVINS' OFFICE

(Scully opens the door and Skinner is behind her. There is a senior agent by Blevins seated at his desk. Blevins looks up.)

BLEVINS: Agent Scully. Please have a seat. (She comes in along with Skinner. The senior agent by Blevins sits in a seat next to the desk, facing the chair opposite which Scully sits at. Skinner stands behind Blevins) Some time has past since you were first in this office.

SCULLY: Yes, sir. Four years.

BLEVINS: From all reports, your work on the X Files has brought you very close to Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

SENIOR AGENT: We're awfully sorry about what's happened, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: But that's not why I'm here.

BLEVINS: You're here because we've been informed by the Department of Defense that prior to Agent Mulder's accident, you may have been notified by a DoD employee.

SCULLY: Yes, that's right.

OTHER GUY: And he may have given you classified information.

SCULLY: He had information about the discovery of what Agent Mulder believed to be alien corpse. He said the body was part of a hoax.

BLEVINS: He provided evidence?

SCULLY: No... hard... evidence, no.

BLEVINS: Agent Scully, I suggest you tell us everything you know. If you have any knowledge of this man, you should speak up now.

SCULLY: What knowledge?

BLEVINS: His name. (She just looks at Blevins. All three men look at Scully.) Whatever you're withholding, you'll be asked to explain yourself tonight at a joint FBI panel I've asked assembled on this matter.

SKINNER: Is this the man? Michael Kritschgau? (She looks at a photo that Skinner is showing her. It's a photo of Kritschgau sitting on Mulder's chair in his living room. The angle is from the ceiling)

SCULLY: Yes.



SCENE 8
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

(Kritschgau is walking down the hall. Across a great room, hall in the building, he sees Mulder. He catches up to him and grabs him on the shoulder to stop him.)

KRITSCHGAU: Hey! (With a nervous smile) How did you get in here?

MULDER: Through the front door.

KRITSCHGAU: You can't bypass security.

MULDER (Mulder shows him the code card) You can if you have the card.

KRITSCHGAU: Put it away. Put it away. (He's looking around serious.)

MULDER: You knew my apartment was being surveilled. How? (He smiles again)

KRITSCHGAU: Come with me.



SCENE 9
OFFICE IN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

(Kritschgau and Mulder enter. Kritschgau turns on the light and shuts and locks the door.)

KRITSCHGAU: I was followed from your apartment the night we spoke.

MULDER: Someone at the FBI is involved, this man Ostelhoff, was in contact with somebody ...

KRITSCHGAU: How'd you get his card?

MULDER: I found it on a dead man.

KRITSCHGAU: You know what that is? What you have in your hand? That gives you Level 4 clearance.

MULDER: Level 4 clearance, that means I get to dine at the officer's club?

KRITSCHGAU: You have access to everything, Mr. Mulder. Things I don't, things I can only tell you about.

MULDER: I need to know who did this to Scully!

KRITSCHGAU: What you can have, what you may find, is so much more than that.

MULDER: What?

KRITSCHGAU: What you want most desperately of all.

MULDER: The cure for Scully's cancer? (Notice how he doesn't say anything about his sister, Samantha? Kritschgau nods.)



SCENE 10
MULDER'S APARTMENT
10:02 am

(The door opens and a pick locking devise is put into a suit pocket. It's Cancerman. He shuts the door behind him. He looks around the apartment. He sees the chalk outline of the dead man. He sees a framed picture of Fox and Samantha as kids. He cries softly. He puts the picture down. He looks at the blood on the floor. He looks at the ceiling peep hole.)



SCENE 11
X FILES OFFICE

(Scully walks in and picks up the phone, pushes a button and sits at the desk.)

VOICE ON PHONE: Federal Bureau of Investigation. How may I direct your call?

SCULLY: Communications center, please. (She takes the phone log out of her pocket)

HOLLY ON PHONE: Communications Center. This is Holly.

SCULLY: Holly, this is Dana Scully.

HOLLY: Dana, I'm so sorry about what's happened. I just heard.

SCULLY: Holly, I need your help on something. I was hoping you could help me with some information.

HOLLY: Sure, what do you need?

SCULLY: I have some calls placed to the Bureau on consecutive dates. On the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth. They came into the pbx operator. The first was at 11:21, the next was at 11:14, 03:07, (Holly is typing in on her computer as Scully rattles them off.) 02:02, and 05:12. They would have all been transferred to the same extension.

HOLLY: And you're looking for that extension?

SCULLY: Yes.

HOLLY: I've got five calls matching those times and dates transferred to an executive level extension.

SCULLY: Whose?

HOLLY: It's a branch extension. It could be any of them at that level.

SCULLY: Would Assistant Director Skinner be at that extension? (Holly types again)

HOLLY: Yes.

SCULLY: (Scully is wounded.) Thank you.

HOLLY: Okay. You take care now Dana. (As soon as Scully hangs up, the phone rings)

SCULLY: Yes?

DR VITAGLIANO ON PHONE: Special Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes.

VITAGLIANO: This is Dr. Vitagliano over at the paleoclimatology department over at American University. You had, ah, me look into these ice core samples for you?

SCULLY: Right. I...ah... I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you.

VITAGLIANO: I think you want to come down here to the lab. There's something I know you're going to want to see for yourself.



SCENE 12
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
11:04 am

(Mulder and Kritschgau are walking down the hall)

MULDER: What am I looking for?

KRITSCHGAU: Level 4 is a biological quarantine wing. It houses a series of labs and medical facilities, and an elaborate facility for the storage of mass quantities of DNA.

MULDER: DNA from whom?

KRITSCHGAU: Virtually every American born since 1945. Every immigrant, every indigenous person who's ever given blood or tissue to a government donor. This is what I was telling you. This is the hoax into which you've been drawn. The roots go back 50 years to the end of World War II. Playing on a virulent national appetite for bogus revelation and a public newly fearful of the atomic bomb... (During the rest of the monologue by Kritschgau, we see old film and pictures of what he's talking about) the U.S. Military Command began to fan the flames of what were being called flying saucer stories. There are truths that can kill a nation, Agent Mulder. The military needed something to deflect attention away from its arms strategy - global domination from the capability of total enemy annihilation. The nuclear card was fine as long as we alone could play it. But the Generals and Politicos knew they could not win a public relations war. Those photographs from Nagasaki and Hiroshima were not faces Americans wanted to see in the mirror. Oppenheimer knew it, of course, but we silenced him. When the Russians developed the bomb, the fear in the military was not for safety at home, but for armistice and treaty. The business of America isn't business, Agent Mulder, it's war. Since Antitam, nothing has driven the economy faster. We needed a reason to keep spending money, and when there wasn't a war to justify it, we called it a war anyway. The Cold War was essentially a fifty year public relations battle... a pitched game of chicken against an enemy we not much more than called names. The Communists called us a few names, too. "We will bury you," Kruschev said, and the public believed it. And after what McCarthy had done, they ate it with a big spoon. We faced off a few times in Cuba, Korea, Vietnam, but nobody dropped the bomb - nobody dared.

MULDER: But what does all this have to do with flying saucers?

KRITSCHGAU: The U.S. Military saw a good thing in '47 when the Roswell story broke. The more we denied it, the more people thought it was true - aliens had landed. A made-to-order cover story for generals looking to develop the national war chest. They opened official investigations with names like Grudge, Twinkle, Project Blue Book, Majestic 12. They brought in college professors and Congressmen and fed them enough bogus facts and fuzzy pictures and eyewitness accounts that they believed it, too. They even hooked Doug MacArthur, for God's sake. I can't tell you how fortuitous it was. Do you know when the first supersonic flight was, Agent Mulder? 1947. Soon every experimental aircraft being flown was a UFO sighting. When the abduction stories started up, it was too perfect. We almost got caught in Korea, an ambitious misstep. China and the Soviets knew it. The UN got all heated up at us.

MULDER: Germ warfare. We were accused of using it in the Korea.

KRITSCHGAU: It was developmental then, nothing like what we and the Russians have now. The bio-weapons used in the Gulf War were so ingenious as to be almost undetectable. Developed in this very building. (They walk through a door)

MULDER: What about all the reports of abductions? You're saying they've all been lies?

KRITSCHGAU: Not lies exactly, (We see a woman laying on a table with a big stomach and a grid pattern of lights shining on her, like Scully during her abduction) but citizens taken unsuspecting and tested. A classified military project, above top-secret and still ongoing. You've heard the recent denials about Roswell by the military and the CIA. What's been the effect? Even wilder and more widespread belief. The American appetite for bogus revelation, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: But I've seen aliens. I've witnessed these things.

KRITSCHGAU: You've seen what they wanted you to see. (They go into an elevator) The line between science and science fiction doesn't exist any more. This is about control, of the very elements of life. DNA - yours, mine, everyone's.

MULDER: Then why a hoax? Why create hard evidence, an alien body that could be disproved?

KRITSCHGAU: The body you found was so good, so believable, that only a directed scientific examination could have proven the fraud.

MULDER: Scully would have known.

KRITSCHGAU: The timing of the hoax was planned so Agent Scully wouldn't be alive to do the examination.

MULDER: You went along with all this. You let them do this to Scully.

KRITSCHGAU: I paid the price, Agent Mulder. When my son came back sick from the Gulf War, that was my retribution. I'm helping you now, but not unselfishly.

MULDER: You believe there's a cure for him in here, too.

KRITSCHGAU: I have to think there is. (Mulder uses Ostlehoff's code card to enter Level 4 clearance. Kritschgau watches. When Mulder enters, Kritschgau walks away but is met by two men in fatigues)

SOLDIER: Michael Kritschgau... May we talk to you?

KRITSCHGAU: What about?

SOLDIER: DOD is detaining you for questioning. Would you come with us, Mr. Kritschgau? (He doesn't have much of a choice)



SCENE 13
RACE TRACK
12:11 PM

(A rider is working out a horse on the track. The stands are empty except for the Fat Man Elder. Cancerman walks to him and sits next to him)

ELDER: I was told that you needed to see me, that there was some urgency.

CSM: It seems I've been left out of the loop.

ELDER: Left out?

CSM: You've been watching Mulder. You had a man on him. No one bothered to inform me of this. (He lights a cigarette)

ELDER: I know nothing of this man.

CSM: I will not be cut out like this. You need my expertise. Is this being run from the DOD?

ELDER: If it is, I am unaware of it.

CSM: I've always kept Mulder in check. I put this whole thing together. I created Mulder.

ELDER: Agent Mulder is dead. Our FBI source confirmed it this morning. Mulder killed himself. Mulder was an asset. Without his partner, you may have underestimated his fragility.

CSM: I've never underestimated Mulder. I still don't.



SCENE 14
PALEOCLIMATOLOGY LAB AMERICAN UNIVERSITY

(Scully meets with Dr. Vitagliano)

VITAGLIANO: As you've asked, I've tested some of the cellular material found in the ice core sample. Because we couldn't classify it as either plant or animal, only as some kind of chimeric hybrid, I put some of the cells in media containing fetal bovine serum. And the cells began to divide.

SCULLY: Well then they were animal cells that you found.

VITAGLIANO: They are not classifiable.

SCULLY: What do you mean? You said there was mitotic cell division.

VITAGLIANO: When the cells began to divide they didn't just multiply, they began to go through the stages of morula, blastula, gastrula.

SCULLY: They began somatic development?

VITAGLIANO: The beginning of a life form. Growing into what, I don't know.



SCENE 15
LEVEL 4

(Mulder walks to doors, try them, locked as he talks in voice over)

MULDER: I had come here looking for answers hoping not only to lay bare this conspiracy against the country and the men behind it but to finally learn the truth about the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life. (A door at the end of the hall opens and two security men enter. Mulder tries more doors and finds one and enters and closes the door as he talks) Now with what I've heard my beliefs seem more and more improbable. The possibility of a cure for Scully somewhere inside these walls is my only hope but if I might find it and somehow save her the very existence of such a cure would mean with certainty that I had believed in a lie from the start. (He's relieved when they walk away. The room he entered is a big, dark one filled to the brim with tables containing grey aliens)

(Mulder walks through the room looking at the comatose aliens as Scully speaks in voice over)

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: I had no way to reach Agent Mulder to tell him what I had discovered - an unidentified microscopic life form whose very existence held the possibility of revelation. Was this organism extracted from the ice which had entombed the alien corpse, the germ cell that might give proof of extraterrestrial life, or was it just the opposite? The scientifically engineered creation of a chimera, an unclassified biological product designed to set up a hoax manufactured to create a false set of beliefs that have long driven Agent Mulder? (Mulder reaches another door with a window and he sees women on tables with big stomachs and grid pattern lights shining on them) I now begin to realize that the answer to this question might exist within the life form itself, biological proof of this connection to the cancer invading my body to a virus living inside this organism to which I had been exposed during my abduction three years ago.



SCENE 16
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
2:04 PM

(Vitagliano is taking blood from Scully)

VITAGLIANO: I'm still not sure what you're trying to find here.

SCULLY: I need to do a Southern Blot to run a culture of what you showed me against my own DNA. You said that the unclassified cells you looked at under the EM were full of virus.

VITAGLIANO: Right. What are you looking for?

SCULLY: A match. And I need it before seven.

VITAGLIANO: Tonight? Not going to happen. Not unless we have a blazing hot probe.

SCULLY: It's got to happen. Everything in my life depends on it. (Vitagliano leaves her with her blood. She look at the window on the door and sees Skinner looking at her and leaving. She gets up and goes after him)



SCENE 17
HALLWAY

(Scully meets up with Skinner in the hallway)

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

SKINNER: I was going to ask you the same.

SCULLY: No, you weren't. You followed me here. Why are you following me? Is this more dirty work you're doing for the DOD?

SKINNER: Why don't you tell me something, Agent Scully. Why don't you tell me what you're doing here.

SCULLY: I want an answer from you.

SKINNER: I want an answer from you!

SCULLY: This isn't your job!

SKINNER: My job is to direct the agents under me, to question their motives when they're lying about investigations, To take steps to cease or censure their actions. Your lie is on record, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: And what about yours?

SKINNER: On my desk, I have the pathology and forensics reports for the body found in Agent Mulder's apartment. Now you have to answer for yourself in five hours. As you compound the lies, you compound the consequences for them.

SCULLY: All lies lead to the truth, isn't that right?

SKINNER: And what about your lie, Agent Scully? What does it lead to?

SCULLY: The truth. About the men behind what happened to me, about my abduction and the tests, about being exposed to something against my will, about being put on a table and having something implanted in me, and then having my memory stolen, only to have it return along with a disease that I was given.

SKINNER: Is that your justification? Is that what you're going to tell the joint panel tonight?

SCULLY: Are you afraid of that?

SKINNER: Well, considering the dead man in Mulder's apartment was murdered in cold blood and you willfully misidentified him, yes. I am afraid. But I'm afraid only for you.

SCULLY: You're going to use that against me, aren't you. You're going to use me as I've been used all along. To preserve the lies.

SKINNER: Where is Agent Mulder? (She just walks back to the door she came out of) Your silence won't save you. Not with these people. And if you lie, I don't know if anything can.

SCULLY: Except proof.



SCENE 18
LATER

(Scully goes through an actual Southern Blot test being done with her blood.

SCULLY: The cruelest ironies are those consecrated by the passage of time, chanced and occasioned by shocking discovery. I had joined Agent Mulder because of my background in the medical sciences. My assignment was to question his work, to debunk his investigations, and rein him back into the FBI mainstream. Now, as fate would have it, I am calling on these very same skills to prove that he has been the target of a scheme orchestrated by someone close to us in the FBI. Someone we have trusted above all others. Involved in a highly organized plot to keep a dangerous secret from the light of day. (We see Mulder going through Level 4, in a hallway, lower ceilings, air ducts and pipes exposed) I could only guess at what Agent Mulder may have uncovered on his own, what he may have found to confirm or deny what he has long held to be a conspiracy to control the public inquiry into government's knowledge and contact with an alien race or races. (Back to Scully) If he had hoped, as I do, to learn the identity of those who sought to destroy us, I had, with the discovery of this unidentified microorganism, what could amount to forensic evidence. Hard and undeniable genetic evidence of the connection between the conspirators and the cancer which has now metastasized in my bloodstream. (Mulder gets to the door Cancerman used in the Pilot! The vast room of shelves of files and evidence in the Pentagon. He uses the code card. It opens. He goes inside. He walks through the rows of shelves) I have few short hours to conduct these tests before I must appear before an FBI panel to explain myself. And as I am ready to lie to them about Agent Mulder, I am also ready to confront them with proof. (Back to Scully) Proof extracted from this tiny organism that could blow open a conspiracy of global consequence. (Mulder's turn for voice over as he walks through the room)



SCENE 19

MULDER: If Agent Scully and I had been led to believe that the conspiracy meant to destroy us has its roots in the Department of Defense, that fact seems all but irrefutable now. I have gained access to a large storage facility by a hallway connecting underground to the Pentagon. On hundreds of rows of shelves are materials that reveal nothing to me of a cure for Scully's cancer. And now, as I have reached the terminus of this space, what appears to be an old and antiquated filing system seems my only hope of finding what this man Kritschgau has assured me exists. (He pulls a ladder over and climbs to higher on a wall of little filing drawers) If his own desperate hope for his son's cure has eluded him, I now share his desperation. That among these drawers is a sign, a glimmer, some small confirmation that the journey which has brought me here has not been in vain. (He opens SCU-SCY. There are two rows of index cards. He flips through and sees Scully, Dana Katherine with her date of birth, 2-23-64, her position number 2317-616 and four rows of other numbers. He takes the card and then opens another card file and pulls out Kritschgau, Michael Jr. It's blank)



SCENE 20
LOCATION UNKNOWN

(It's a dark room and Cancerman is smoking a cigarette. The phone rings. He answers it)

CSM: Yes?

MP: Yes sir. (It's the security soldier from the Level 4 Clearance security area Mulder went through with Kritschgau watching) I had orders to contact you in the event Scott Ostelhoff entered the building.

CSM: Is he there?

MP: His keycard was scanned through the level four entrance. He used the subterranean access to breach the Pentagon.

CSM: Are you sure it's him?

MP: I can't ascertain that. Do you want me to apprehend him?

CSM: Don't do anything, don't say anything. I'm on my way.



SCENE 21
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY

(Scully is continuing her test)

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: If my work with Agent Mulder has tested the foundation of my beliefs, science has been and continues to be my guiding light. Now I'm again relying on its familiar and systematic methods to arrive at a truth, a fact that might explain the fate that has befallen me. An investigation that began without, now turning within. Taking cellular material from the unidentified life form and isolating a virus contained within it, then matching the DNA from this virus with that which I believe has caused my cancer. I hope a picture will develop. A picture that might confirm my darkest suspicions about the source of this disease invading my body in hope of obtaining evidence that its cause is not without blame, even though its cure remains unknown. If science serves me to these ends... it is not lost on me that the tool which I've come to depend on absolutely cannot save or protect me... but only bring into focus the darkness that lies ahead.



SCENE 22
PENTAGON FILE ROOM

(Mulder walks through an aisle with Scully's card in his hand. He's looking for the matching set of files of the number printed in red in the upper corner. MN 1068-06. He finds a box. Looks inside. Finds a tray of metal tubes)



SCENE 23
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY

(Scully is conferring with Dr. Vitagliano)

SCULLY: There it is.

VITAGLIANO: I don't understand.

SCULLY: My DNA hybridized with the viral DNA from the cell culture.

VITAGLIANO: But that means the material form the ice core sample you'd have to have DNA from the unclassified chimera cells in your own body.

SCULLY: I know.

VITAGLIANO: But how? How did you know?

SCULLY: I believe that I was exposed to this material and that it is responsible for giving me a serious illness.

VITAGLIANO: What kind of illness?

SCULLY: One which cannot be cured.



SCENE 24
PENTAGON FILE ROOM

(Mulder takes one of the metal tubes. It matches the number on her card)

OUTSIDE PENTAGON FILE ROOM

(The door opens and Mulder sticks his head out. No one is coming either way so he closes the door and walks down the hall)

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: If I did indeed have the cure for Scully's cancer, I was now as dependent on her as she was on me. As I had breached this facility I needed to find my way out to safety... (Cut to Scully walking down the hallway in FBI Headquarters in the blue suit from Gethsemane hearing) depending on Scully to weave her story, to tell her tale, to make them believe the lie.



SCENE 25
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(The door opens of the meeting and Scully enters. This is the replay of the hearing in Gethsemane)

BLEVINS: Agent Scully, have a seat. Agent Scully, we've had a brief discussion, but will you restate the matter we're here to put to rest?

SCULLY: Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X-Files. (A flash of Scully sitting in a chair in Blevins office in the Pilot) As I am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective (Scully entering the X Files office for the first time in the Pilot) on the work of Agent Fox Mulder, whose investigations into the paranormal (Flash of Mulder looking for the file in Paper Clip, the Strughold Mining Company) were fueled by a personal belief that his sister (A flash of Samantha's file in Paper Clip) had been abducted by aliens when he was twelve. I come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is my scientific opinion that he became through the course of these years, a victim. A victim of his own false hopes, and of his belief in the biggest of lies.

SENIOR AGENT: (from Blevin's office earlier): You were contacted by a man who claimed that he worked for the Department of Defense. A Michael Kritschgau. He told you that Mulder had been taken in by a hoax.

SCULLY: Yes, sir. (Mulder comes out of the door he ducked through earlier to get away from the security guys) He told me a story which detailed point by point the systematic way in which Agent Mulder had been deceived and used. (Mulder walks quickly down the hallway) And how I as his partner had been led down the same path, losing a family member due to my allegiance (Mulder reaches the code card slide thing) and contracting a fatal disease, which I was being told was engineered by the men who were responsible for Agent Mulder's deception. (Mulder slides the card through and waits)

BLEVINS: Were you able to convince Agent Mulder of these facts? (It refuses Mulder's card)

SCULLY: What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder what I had only just learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized. And the doctors told me short of a miracle it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day towards the inevitable. (Mulder looks down the hall. Two security men enter and walk down the long hallway toward him. He tries the card again. It refuses it again. Mulder winces and looks at the two coming closer. He tries it again. No good. The two are closer. Mulder slides the card through again, fast. He waits. It works. He goes out the door and away. Cancerman is standing by the door in the security booth. Mulder didn't see him)

MP: I'll have security stop him at the entrance.

CSM: No, it's okay, that's okay - let him go.



SCENE 26

(Back at the meeting)

SCULLY: Early this morning, I got a call from the police... asking me to come to Agent Mulder's apartment. The detective asked me... He needed me to identify a body.

BLEVINS: Agent Scully...

SCULLY: Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. (There, she's said it. She sniffs. The door opens. She turns to see Skinner enter with the autopsy results)

BLEVINS: Agent Scully, these accusations you've made... You've been given a disease?

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

BLEVINS: They're extremely serious charges.

SCULLY: Yes, sir. But I have proof against the men behind this... of the lies that I believed. What I have here is proof undeniable... that the men who gave me this disease were also behind the hoax. A plot designed to lead to Agent Mulder's demise and to my own. Planned and executed by someone in this room.. (She opens her file on the table and it's the result of the Blot) What I have here is scientific evidence-- (Blood drips on the result. She looks at Blevins. She has a bloody nose. She feels woozy. She falls back into the chair, helped by Skinner. She looks at Skinner) You...

SKINNER: Somebody get a doctor. (She faints)



SCENE 27
LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE

(Byers opens the metal tube and pours its contents into a vial. He tests it as Frohike, Langley and Mulder watches and waits. Byers punches into the computer. A graph appears. He looks at Mulder)

MULDER: What? What is it?

BYERS: It's deionized water. It's nothing more than that.

WASHINGTON
5:13 AM

(Mulder walks down the hall with a purpose, to find Scully. He meets up with a nurse)

MULDER: Can you help me? I'm looking for a woman... (Nurse, busy, walks away. He goes to the nurses station) Excuse me, I'm looking for a Dana Scully who was brought into ... (The nurse, on the phone, holds her hand up for him to be quiet. He continues down the desk to another nurse)

Excuse me, I'm looking for a patient, Dana Scully... (When she doesn't acknowledge his presence, he continues) Is there an admitting nurse here? (No response) Look! Can someone help me here? (An intern walks down the hall towards Mulder)

INTERN: Look, Sir. You're going to have to calm down.

MULDER: I will calm down when someone gives me a reason to calm down. Now I'm looking for a patient who was admitted to the ER!

INTERN: Dana Scully.

MULDER: Yes.

INTERN: I heard you the first time.

MULDER: Well, where is she?

INTERN: I have her in the ICU.

MULDER: Where is that?

INTERN: You have to tell me who you are first.

MULDER: Where is she?

SKINNER: Agent Mulder...

(Mulder turns to see Skinner and two suited men walking down the hall towards him. Mulder walks past where Skinner came from. Skinner walks with him)

Where you going?

MULDER: ICU.

SKINNER: You're looking pretty good for a dead man.

MULDER: I'm only half dead.

SKINNER: You have a lot to answer for, Agent Mulder!

(Mulder goes through a door, Skinner turns to the suits)

You guys hold here.

(Skinner goes through the door. Mulder walks through a hall with X Ray screens and a doctor examining them. He sees Scully laying in bed with a tube down her throat through a glass in the wall. He stops and looks and bends and the waist and grabs his knees. Skinner joins him)

MULDER: What happened to her?

SKINNER: She went into hypo vilemic shock.

MULDER: Due to what? (No answer) Do to what?!

SKINNER: She's dying! Let's go. (Skinner takes Mulder's arm. Mulder shakes him off)

MULDER: Let go of me. (They struggle)

SKINNER: There's nothing you can do. (Mulder punches at Skinner's chest)

MULDER: Get the hell off of me! (Skinner grabs him by the lapels)

SKINNER: Don't do this! Don't!

(A suited guy and Skinner push Mulder back and Mulder just looks at the sleeping Scully in bed)

WASHINGTON,DC
9:15 AM
BLEVIN'S OFFICE

(Mulder is escorted by Skinner into the office. Mulder sits in the chair, Skinner stands to Mulder's right)

BLEVINS: I'm still at a loss here in going forward. This situation developing unexpectantly during a formal inquiry into your reported death, Agent Mulder. The fact of your being here today, very much alive it gives the effect of reshaping this investigation into something all together different. As we're not put upon to verify the identity of this body found in your apartment and the circumstances which led to this. (The senior agent is sitting to Blevin's right)

SENIOR AGENT: Would you care to enlighten us on these circumstances?

MULDER: Are you suggesting that I can?

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, we are here informally to give you the chance to help yourself.

MULDER: Help myself, how?

SENIOR AGENT: By allowing any fact or details which might serve to let us go forward with this inquiry in a more informed manner.

MULDER: That helps you, how doesn't that help me?

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, this is going to quickly become a murder investigation. Criminal charges are going to be made.

SKINNER: We have only one other suspect. But she may no longer be able to testify on her own behalf.

BLEVINS: Agent Scully lied to us. Why? (Slight pause)

SENIOR AGENT: Who's protecting whom, Agent Mulder?

BLEVINS: Your choice is your own, but your failure to answer these questions will reflect poorly on the record of the formal inquiry.

MULDER: Are we finished then?



SCENE 3

HALLWAY

(Skinner follows Mulder out of the office and through the hallway)

SKINNER: Word of advice from a friend, keep playing it the way you are.

MULDER: Thanks, buddy.

SKINNER: Hey, right now, you need a buddy, you need all the help you can get.

MULDER: You should have mentioned that at the hospital when you were hauling my ass off!

SKINNER: Hey, I saved your ass, Agent Mulder! I've been withholding forensic evidence about the body found on your apartment floor. Until you showed up last night, I was the one keeping your secret, I had no choice but to bring you in. Scully'll verify all that.

MULDER: That's a good place to lay it, considering her condition.

SKINNER: You want me to lay it where it belongs, Agent Mulder? Pathology turned up two gunshot wounds to the dead man in your apartment. One fired point-blank through the left temple with a handgun, the second a post-mortem wound to the face to remove the man's identity. Now, I'd be happy to verify the ballistics on that first shot.

MULDER: How can you help me?

SKINNER: Tell me why Scully lied for you.

(Mulder thinks, goes to the window, Skinner follows, there's no one listening to them)

MULDER: The disease she has was given to her by somebody connected to the FBI, to a mole working here.

SKINNER: Who?

MULDER: I failed to find that out, sir.

SKINNER: You don't want to forget who your friends are, Agent Mulder. To remember who you can trust.



SCENE 4

RACETRACK - ON TV

(On WWN, there's a hearing going on about cloning)

MAN ON TV: I don't think there are any appropriate limits to human knowledge. As long as science is done openly, and with free will, then I don't think there are any limits.

CHAIRMAN: Senator Kennedy...

KENNEDY: Doctor... you've ah... stated that the ah... cloning humans would be ah... ill considered and technically ah... difficult to accomplish. Can you expand a little bit on what you see as the biggest ah... technical obstacle to human cloning.

(Sound drifts away as the camera pulls back to see the Elder is sitting at his box at the empty racetrack watching the TV. Cancerman walks up to him)

CSM: I trust you've heard.

ELDER: Mulder is alive.

CSM: As I said, he's not to be underestimated.

ELDER: Yes, as you said. Though I hear he has you to thank in some part for his new freedom.

CSM: Using a stolen ID, Mulder was able to get inside the Advanced Research Project Facility.

ELDER: And you allowed him to escape.

CSM: Yes.

ELDER: We're too vulnerable. Our man in the FBI is exposed, what Mulder may have seen could expose our plans.

CSM: What Mulder's seen only serves us. Serves to ensure our plans. Mulder's in trouble, he needs help, and we can give it to him.

ELDER: In exchange for?

CSM: His new loyalty. To us. As I've said all along, Mulder's much more valuable to us alive.

(Cancerman walks away with a little jaunt to his step. Elder turns to acknowledge the goon sitting a couple of rows behind him)

ELDER: You can proceed now. (The goon, assassin nods)



SCENE 5

SCULLY'S ROOM

(Mulder walks in)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing here?

MULDER: I heard you were being moved out of the ICU, that you were feeling better.

SCULLY: Mulder, somebody's going to see you here.

MULDER: It's okay. (He clutches her hand. He kisses her on the cheek) I'm officially among the undead.

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: I did not come here to talk about that.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't try and protect me. I need to know.

MULDER: Well, there's not much to talk about anyway, I'm going to testify to everything I know in front of the FBI assembly. The conspiracy, the men behind it, what I believe is its purpose.

SCULLY: Did you find out who in the FBI is involved?

MULDER: No. But that doesn't matter now.

SCULLY: Yes it does.

MULDER: Hey, Scully, how about those Yankees, huh?

SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner has evidence against you. He knows that you killed that man they found in your apartment.

MULDER: Yeah, Skinner's withholding it.

SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner's dirty. He's not your friend. I'm almost certain that he's the man inside on this.

MULDER: I don't believe that.

SCULLY: If you testify, he will use it to ruin you. (He puts his hand to her face)

MULDER: No, not Skinner.

SCULLY: He's been in a position to know everything from the beginning, everything that we've done over the past four years.

MULDER: But if I don't testify now they'll start to bury the truth.

SCULLY: Well then, you have to lay it on me. You have to tell them that I was the one who killed that man.

MULDER: I can.... (He smiles and shakes his head) I can't do that.

SCULLY: Yes, you can. Mulder, if I can save you, let me. Let me at least give some meaning to what's happened to me.

(Mrs. Scully and Bill enter)

MRS SCULLY: Dana?

SCULLY: Hi, Mom.

MULDER: Hi, Mrs. Scully.

MRS. SCULLY: I hope I'm not interrupting...

MULDER: No. I was just on my way out. (Mulder kisses Scully on the cheek. He stands and sees Bill) Hi, I'm Fox Mulder, I don't think we've ever met.

BILL: Bill Scully. (they shake hands)

MULDER: I'm sorry about your sister.

BILL: Mr. Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

BILL: I know something about you, about what Dana's been through with you, so let's leave the work away from here, okay? Let her die with dignity.



SCENE 6

STAIRWELL

(Assassin walks up the stairs with a case. He sets it on the stairs and opens it. It's a shotgun in pieces.)



SCENE 7

HALLWAY

(Mulder leaves Scully's room and walks down the hall. He sees Cancerman)

MULDER: Please tell me you're here with severe chest pains.

CSM: You should be glad for why I'm here, pay you some respect.

MULDER: Go to hell.

CSM: For your cleverness, and your resource, what you managed to do for Scully.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

CSM: Well, breaching the security at the Defense Department Facility. Finding the cure for her
disease.

MULDER: What I found was useless.

CSM: On the contrary, it's essential to her survival. If you like, we could step outside and I might explain myself? (Mulder hesitates) I'm here tonight as a friend, Agent Mulder. (Mulder follows him outside)



SCENE 8

LONE GUNMAN'S OFFICE

(Mulder and the Gunmen are around a table)

MULDER: He promised me it would be in here.

(Byers taps the metal tube from last episode on a petri dish. Little splashes of the deionized water come out, and a little metal disk)

BYERS: I'll be damned. (They look at it through a microscope. It's a computer chip) It never occurred to me what the deionized water might be for.

LANGLEY: It was a microchip we were looking for.

FROHIKE: This is a cure for cancer?

MULDER: It may be for Scully's.

BYERS: How?

MULDER: Shortly after she was abducted she discovered a small metallic chip implanted subcutaneously in your neck... It was a short time after she had it removed that she developed cancer.

BYERS: It's unreal.

FROHIKE: Too freakin' amazing!

MULDER: Watch your language, Frohike, and grab me some tweezers.



SCENE 9

FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Kritschgau is called in to the assembled meeting like Scully. Skinner and Blevins is there)

BLEVINS: Mr. Kritschgau, thank you for being here today and for cooperating with this investigation. We hope you can provide information that will allow us to make formal charges for the murder of Defense employee, Scott Ostlehoff. Mr. Kritschgau, we have learned that you were in contact with Agents Mulder and Scully just prior to this man's death.

KRITSCHGAU: That's correct.

BLEVINS: And that you may have given them classified information... What motivated this?

KRITSCHGAU: My knowledge of government involvement in a conspiracy against the American people.

SENIOR AGENT: Now before... before we go into any specifics on the subject, I'd like to ask you a more pointed question. Do you know who killed Scott Ostlehoff?

KRITSCHGAU: No I don't.

SENIOR AGENT: Do you know of any connection between his death and Agents Mulder or Scully?

KRITSCHGAU: No. (pause) I'm aware of one death in connection though... My son who died early this morning. (Long pause around the table)

SENIOR AGENT: Mr. Kritschgau, you're employed by the Department of Defense. Is that correct?

KRITSCHGAU: Technically. Part of my remuneration has come from another source. A Congressional lobbying firm. Something called 'Roush'.

SKINNER: Roush? You have any idea what that is?

KRITSCHGAU: No, sir. (Skinner writes Roush and underlines it in his notes)



SCENE 10

SCULLY'S ROOM

(Mulder, Bill, Mrs. Scully and the doctor are standing around Scully's bed as she holds that metal tube in her hand)

BILL: Crazy. This is crazy.

MULDER: Crazy in what sense? In that it might save your sister's life?

BILL: You're not a doctor. You have no place in even suggesting this .. this science fiction...this

MULDER: This is not science fiction.

BILL: You've never heard of it!

MRS SCULLY: Bill... I think there's an obvious... difference of opinion.

BILL: Yeah.

SCULLY: I think ... that everybody here has their heart in the right place. But I need it to be my
decision.

BILL: Dana...

SCULLY: I know you're only looking out for me, Bill. But I don't think you have all the facts.

(Pause)

MRS SCULLY: Don't you think you should listen to your doctor?

SCULLY: Yes. I am.

MULDER: Would she have to stop her conventional treatment?

DOCTOR: To be honest, at this point... the only approach I have left... with her particular cancer is quite unconventional.

(Pause)

SCULLY: I'd like to try this.



SCENE 11
STAIRWELL
10:30

(Assassin puts the gun together)



SCENE 12

HALLWAY

(Mulder is sitting in a chair by Scully's door. Bill Jr. comes out of Scully's room and stands before Mulder)

BILL:MULDER: Yes, I do.

BILL: You see, she's your big defender, but I think the truth is, she just doesn't want to disappoint you.

MULDER: If it works, I don't care what you think she thinks.

BILL: You're a real piece of work, you know that, Mr. Mulder.

MULDER: Why is that, because I don't think the way you think? Because I won't just sit passively back and watch the family tragedy unfold?

BILL: You're the reason for it. And I've already lost one sister to this quest you're on, now I'm losing another. (Bill has to fight back tears) Has it been worth it? To you, I mean, have you found what you've been looking for?

MULDER: No...

BILL: No. (He nods) You know how that makes me feel?

MULDER: In a way, I think I do. I lost someone very close to me. I lost a sister, I lost my father, all because of this thing I'm looking for.

BILL:MULDER: Yeah. Little green aliens.
(Notice how he doesn't give his usual - no they're grey yada yada yada)

BILL: You're one sorry son of a bitch. Not a whole lot more to say.
(Bill leaves. Mulder sits. His cell phone rings and he answers it)

MULDER: One sorry son of a bitch speaking.

CSM: How's our patient? (Cancerman is in his apartment, I think) You did find the chip, didn't you Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes.

CSM: I can imagine there must have been a question as to it's medical value.

MULDER: There still is.

CSM: And so I have yet to earn your trust... in spite of my gesture.

MULDER: You could say that, yeah.

CSM: Well I have something else to offer you. I've arranged a meeting I think you'll want to attend, Mr. Mulder.



SCENE 13
RESTAURANT
9:33 PM

(Mulder is sitting at the counter. A waitress is putting condiments at all the places on the counter. She sets a tabasco sauce bottle by Mulder)

WAITRESS: Tabasco sauce. Cures anything.

MULDER: I'll keep that in mind.

(She walks on. Mulder looks at the clock. A car pulls up outside and the headlights shine on Mulder. He walks to the door. It's bright until the headlights are turned off. Cancerman is in the driver's seat. The waitress comes up behind Mulder and looks at the car)

WAITRESS: You know him or something?

(Mulder looks at the passenger seat. It's Samantha! Or the clone from Colony with better hair)

MULDER: I think that's my sister. (He goes outside. Samantha gets out of the car) Samantha?

SAMANTHA: I was afraid I'd never see you again. He always told me something had happened to you that night.

MULDER: Who? Who told you that?

SAMANTHA: My father.

(she turns, indicating Cancer Man in the car as he lights a cigarette, Mulder looks confused and upset)



SCENE 14
RESTAURANT
(41 minutes later)

SAMANTHA: I never really knew what happened. I could never put the memories all back together. But, as much as I tried to remember, I tried more to forget.

MULDER: Why?

SAMANTHA: I was 8 years old, and frightened to death. And they told me that I was an orphan.

MULDER: But you called that man your father?

SAMANTHA: Some time later, I don't know how long, my foster parents took me to a hotel room and said that I was gonna see my father.

MULDER: But you knew who your father was?

SAMANTHA: I thought I knew. But, he told me that it had all been a secret, and that he and Mom hadn't told anyone to protect the family.

MULDER: And you believed that.

SAMANTHA: He was so kind to me, and he was the only one I could remember from before what happened.

MULDER: You don't remember anything about that night?

SAMANTHA: I remember ... you ... I remember something ... men and ... and then nothing.

MULDER: I can help you. You were abducted, Samantha, I can help you to remember.

SAMANTHA: I don't want to, Fox. I don't.

MULDER: Then why come here at all?

SAMANTHA: My father told me that he'd found you, you wanted to see me very badly, that you'd been looking for me for a long time. Is that true? (Mulder begins to cry) I'm so sorry, Fox. And I wish that I'd known how to find you.

MULDER: What you've been told ... I want you to listen to me, okay? What you've been told by that man may not be true.

SAMANTHA: Why do you say that?

MULDER: Because the man that brought you here has known where I've been for a very long time.

SAMANTHA: I don't understand. Why wouldn't he tell me?

MULDER: I don't know, but I think he's kept a lot of things from you.

SAMANTHA: I don't believe you. He's been a good father to me. He's given me a life and he cared for me when there was no one else.

MULDER: Then I want you to come with me, come with me to see Mom.

SAMANTHA: Mom is alive?

MULDER: Yes. And I know she'd like to see you very much.

SAMANTHA: I can't.

(Side bar - there's a big discussion with friends wondering why she wouldn't want to see Mom. Is she only a clone and Mom would know that? My sister insists that if she saw her daughter after 25 years, she'd still be able to tell. I rebutted to her, well, Mom didn't figure it out in Colony-End Game, so is she really the sister or a clone and evil trick of CSM's? Questions, questions, questions.... Sorry to interrupt! Back to the show!)

MULDER: Why not?

SAMANTHA: It's too much. I didn't want to come here at all, Fox. I was afraid to see you. I have
another life now, I have children of my own. (She stands and Mulder grabs hold of her hand)

MULDER: No, please, don't go.

SAMANTHA: I can't stay here right now.

MULDER: Alright, just tell me how I can find you.

SAMANTHA: I need some time.

MULDER: Just ... just tell me where to find you.

SAMANTHA: Please don't, Fox!

MULDER: We will do this on your time, just...

SAMANTHA: Please? Please let me go. (He reluctantly lets her go) I promise you, I'll think about it.

(Samantha goes out to the car and gets in. Cancerman puts his hand through her hair. Mulder is stunned as they drive off)



SCENE 15
HOSPITAL

(The doctor is giving Scully a shot)

DOCTOR: Doing okay?

SCULLY: Um... either it's my head or I'm a long way from med school but I can't remember what you're injecting me with.

DOCTOR: Flouro-dioxy-glucose. (Scully repeats that under her breath) If you're making any progress, it might show up first in the PET scan.

SCULLY: You're not holding your breath are you?

DOCTOR: I'm going after your cancer as aggressively as I know how, Dana. If I could just start your immune system... If I could get your cidalitic cells to recognize your tumor as something to
attack... Then there's a chance.

SCULLY: Have you ever witnessed a miracle, Dr. Zuckerman?

DOCTOR: I don't know that I have. But I have seen people make recoveries. Come back from so far back, I can't explain it.

SCULLY: Isn't that a miracle?

DOCTOR: Maybe there are miracles... But I don't dare call them that.

SCULLY: Thank you.



SCENE 16

CITY STREET

(Mulder meets CSM and they walk and talk. The assassin's view from the shotgun is shown. He has the gun trained on them as they talk)

CSM: My apologies for the rather hasty departure last night.

MULDER: What do you want from me?

CSM: Want from you?

MULDER: You give me these things, the only things I ever wanted and I can't think of any reason for you to do so.

CSM: Well that's true, no act is completely selfless. But I've come today not to... not to ask, but to offer. To offer you the truth that you've so desperately sought. About the project, about the men who've conspired to protect it.

MULDER: I know the truth.

CSM: Do you?

MULDER: I spoke to one of your men.

CSM: And you know that he's not a liar.

MULDER: I've seen enough to know he's not a liar, yeah.

CSM: He's seen but scant pieces of the whole.

MULDER: What more can you show me?

CSM: This man you spoke to, Michael Kritschgau, he has deceived you with beautiful lies. He's told you that everything you've ever believed about the existence of extraterrestrial life is untrue.

MULDER: What are you saying?

CSM: As I said, I'm offering you a chance to know the truth.

MULDER: In exchange for what?

CSM: Quit the FBI, come work for me. I can make your problems go away.

MULDER: No deal.

CSM: After all I've given you?

MULDER: What have ... what have you given me? A claim of a cure for Scully, is she cured? You
show me my sister only to take her right back. You've given me nothing!

CSM: I intend to keep my promises, I just need something from you.

MULDER: You murdered my father, you killed Scully's sister, and if Scully dies, I will kill you. I don't care whose father you are, I will put you down.

CSM: Well, you're certainly capable, so I've been told. I understand you have a hearing tomorrow where you'll have to testify to these murderous impulses of yours. (Mulder looks shocked. Then nervous. Then walks away) When you reconsider, the offer still stands!



SCENE 17

SCULLY'S ROOM

(Mrs. Scully walks in. Scully is laying in bed. She's been crying)

MRS SCULLY: Dana? (Scully turns to her) Dr. Zuckerman called. He ah... he said that you wanted to see me? (She sits on Scully's bed and they hug. Scully is crying)

SCULLY: I'm so sorry... I fight and I fight and I fight... But I'm so stupid.

MRS SCULLY: What? What is it?

SCULLY: I've come so far in my life on simple faith, and now when I need it the most I just push it away. I mean, why ... why do I wear this? (Scully holds up the cross necklace) Why do I wear this, Mom? I put something that I don't even know or understand under the skin of my neck. I will subject myself to these crazy treatments, and I keep telling myself that I'm doing everything I can, but it's a lie!

MRS SCULLY: You have not lost your faith, Dana.

SCULLY: But I have. In a way. And when you asked Father McCue to dinner to administer to my faith... I just closed off to him.

MRS SCULLY: What's important now is that you save your energy.

SCULLY: I'm not getting better, Mom.

MRS SCULLY: You don't know that...

SCULLY: Yeah. The PET scan shows no improvement.

(They hug again and both cry)

MRS SCULLY: I know you're afraid... I know your afraid to tell me, but you have to tell someone.



SCENE 18

LOCATION UNKNOWN

(Elder is watching the conference on WWN)

MAN ON TV: I'll make a statement right here. Cloning will continue. The human mind will continue to inquire into this. Human cloning will take place in my lifetime. I think it's right and proper.

(Skinner walks in front of the camera in the hearing. Elder is not pleased and picks up the phone. Skinner sits behind the speaker to congress and talks to the man next to him)

ELDER: Turn on your television. Are you watching the hearings? Do you see who's there? He's
gathering information. For who? Our colleague was supposed to have fixed the FBI problem. You will fix it now. Do you understand me? Then I will fix it for good.



SCENE 19

SCULLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

(Mulder enters her dark room. She's sleeping. He walks to her bed side. He touches her hair. He gets down on his knees and cries while holding her hand)



SCENE 20

BLEVIN'S OFFICE

(Mulder enters. The senior agent is there along with Blevins)

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, will you please take a seat. Something urgently important has come to the fore. (He does) As you're set to testify on your own behalf later today, I've received alarming forensic evidence from the man's body found in your apartment. I have here in my hand ballistic data matching your service weapon, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Where did you get that?

BLEVINS: I'm not at liberty to say. But unless you can offer up someone else who might have fired the kill shot, everything points to you as this man's murderer. Are you prepared to give testimony about the man who fired the shot?

MULDER: Why am I here?

BLEVINS: The man worked for the Department of Defense, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: The man was spying on me.

BLEVINS: Do you know for whom? (Pause) Agent Scully was prepared to name the man at the FBI who was involved in this plot against you and her. We believe she was about to name Assistant Director Skinner, whom we have learned has been working inside the FBI with a secret agenda.

MULDER: I refuse to believe that.

BLEVINS: We've accumulated some substantial evidence against him.

MULDER: Can you show it to me?

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, if you name this man today in your testimony... we can file charges against him. Charges which may very well exonerate you.

MULDER: Name Skinner and save myself?

BLEVINS: That's what I called you here to recommend. As a friend.
(Long pause)

MULDER: I'll see you at the hearing.
(They nod to each other)



SCENE 21
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Scully is laying in bed, not looking very good. Mulder comes in and sits on her bed)

MULDER: Good morning.

SCULLY: What are you doing here? You have a hearing.

MULDER: Yeah. I came by last night, but I... I didn't have the heart to wake you.

SCULLY: Came by for what? Mulder, what is it?

MULDER: I was lost last night. But as I stood here, I thought I'd found my way. I've been ... ah .. I've been offered a deal, a deal that could save my life in a way. And though I'd refused the deal earlier, I left here last night with my mind made up to take it.

SCULLY: A deal with who?

MULDER: It doesn't matter, I'm not taking the deal, I'm not taking any deal. Not after what happened this morning.

SCULLY: What happened this morning?

MULDER: Section Chief Blevins directed me to implicate Skinner. To name him as the man inside in the FBI. Who may have deceived us both. And if I name him, they'll protect me.

SCULLY: Are you going to name him?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Then they'll prosecute you.

MULDER: Yeah, they have evidence against me, they know I killed that man.

SCULLY: Mulder, even with the ballistics evidence, I can still be the shoot...

MULDER: Scully, I can't let you take the blame. Because of your brother, because of your mother, and because I couldn't live with it. To live the lie, you have to believe it. Like these men who deceive us, who gave you this disease. We all have our faith, and mine is in the truth.

SCULLY: Then why'd you come here if you'd already made up your mind?

MULDER: (Huge heart- melting grin and laugh) Because I knew you'd talk me out of it if I was making a mistake. (The door opens and Scully's smile turns to kind of fear and she grabs Mulder's hand)

SCULLY: You'll be in my prayers. (Mulder leans in to her ear)

MULDER: Have the Father say a few Hail Mulders for me, okay? (He kisses her on the cheek and leaves. She looks at Father McCue with mixed emotions)



SCENE 22
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON DC

(Same meeting room, hot seat is open. Senior agent slams his file shut and stands)

SENIOR AGENT: He's a no show. I'm going to ask for a bench warrant.
(Mulder enters)

MULDER: Sorry I'm late.
(Senior agent sits. Mulder is now in the hot seat)

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder... the assembled members of this review panel first convened to address your reported death. Only to find shortly that this report had been a lie. That you were indeed very much alive... and that the body found in your apartment, believed to be yours was a murder victim. Killed with a weapon issued by the FBI and registered to you.

MULDER: Respectfully, Sir. I've come here today to set the record straight so that this process
you've begun came be completed and the guilty parties can be named.
(Blevins is happy)

SKINNER: Respectfully, Sir. I'd like to ask for a short break.

MULDER: I'm... ready to proceed please sir.
(Mulder looks at Skinner. Skinner squirms and his eyes dart back and forth between Mulder and Blevins)

BLEVINS: Go on, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Four years ago, while working on an assignment outside the FBI mainstream, I was paired with Special Agent Dana Scully, who I believed was sent to spy on me. To debunk my investigations into the paranormal. That Agent Scully did not follow these orders is a testament to her integrity as an investigator, a scientist, and a human being. She has paid dearly for this integrity.

BLEVINS: Agent Mulder, Agent Scully lied straight face to this panel about your death.

MULDER: She did lied because I asked her to. Because I had evidence of a conspiracy. A conspiracy against the American people.

SENIOR AGENT: We've already heard testimony to these allegations, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: AND a conspiracy intended to destroy the lives of those who would reveal it's true purpose. To conduct experiments on unwitting victims to further their secret agenda for someone further into the government operating at levels without restraint or responsibility.
(Assassin has Cancerman in his sights as he walks through the courtyard)
Without morals or conscience... Men who pretend to honor as they deceive.. The price of this betrayal, the lives and reputations of those deceived. Agent Scully... is now in a hospital bed

[Father McCue holds a rosary]

right now diagnosed with terminal cancer. The victim of these same tests. Conducted without her knowledge or consent. By these same men who are trying to cover their tracks who suborn and persecute the same people they've used in their plot I will now call by name!

SENIOR AGENT: Agent Mulder, did you or did you not shoot the man found dead in your
apartment?

MULDER: I will answer

(Scully prays with the Father)

Sir.

SENIOR AGENT: Did you shoot Scott Ostlehoff? Employee of the Department of Defense?

MULDER: I will answer that question, Sir.

SENIOR AGENT: Answer the question asked, Agent Mulder!

MULDER: I will answer the question after I name the man!

SENIOR AGENT: AGENT MULDER!

MULDER: I will answer that question after I name the man who's responsible for Agent Scully! The same man who directed that my apartment be surveilled by the DoD. A man I want to see prosecuted for his crimes! Who's sitting in this very room as I speak!

SENIOR AGENT: Agent Mulder, the Section Chief asked you a question you are going to answer!

MULDER: I can't do that.

SENIOR AGENT: You can and you will!

MULDER: I can't do that sir, because the Section Chief is the man I'm about to name!

(Blevins eyes shoot wide open. All look at him. Skinner looks at Mulder. Mulder sits back in his chair, there, he's done it)



SCENE 23

CANCERMAN'S APARTMENT

(He's standing in front of the window holding the picture from Mulder's apartment of Fox and Samantha. A shot is fired from across the street)



SCENE 24

BLEVIN'S OFFICE

(Blevins rushes in and shuts the door behind him. There's a man in at his desk on the phone. He hangs up and stands. Blevins rushes to the desk to confront him, he's confronted with a bullet to the chest instead. The shooter puts the gun in Blevins hand and leaves.)



SCENE 25

CANCERMAN'S APARTMENT

(Cancerman is on the floor with the photo on the floor next to him with a bullet hole through it. Cancerman shuts his eyes)



SCENE 26
TRINITY HOSPITAL
12:00 AM

(Mulder is sitting in the chair outside Scully's hospital room again. Skinner walks down the hall and sits next to him)

SKINNER: The Smoking Man's dead.

MULDER: How?

SKINNER: Shot through his window. (He pulls out the blood-streaked picture of a young Fox and Samantha - BLOOPER ALERT!!! - No bullet hole - Skinner hands it to Mulder) Forensics found it at the scene. We're assuming it's his blood.

MULDER: Assuming?

SKINNER: Well... no body was found but there was too much blood loss for anyone to have survived. This afternoon when you named Blevins... how did you know?

MULDER: I didn't. I just guessed.

SKINNER: Well, it was a hell of a guess. Blevins had been on payroll for four years to a biotechnology company called Roush, which is somehow connected to all this.

MULDER: I'm sure whatever connections there were, they're being erased right now.

SKINNER: They're cleaning up, taking everything away.

MULDER: Not everything. (He smiles) Scully's cancer's gone into remission.

SKINNER: That's unbelievable news.

MULDER: It's the best news I could have ever heard.

SKINNER: What turned it around?

MULDER: I don't know. I don't think we'll ever know.

SKINNER: Can I see her?

MULDER: Yeah, she's in there with her family right now, but I'm sure she'd love to see you.

(Skinner gets up and opens the door to Scully's room. Her family is around her bed. She notices Skinner looking at her. She smiles cautiously as if to say thank you and I'm sorry I thought you were the one at the same time. He smiles back, relieved she's fine  Back in the hallway, Mulder looks down at the picture and begins to cry)

[THE END]


                                 UNUSUAL SUSPECTS



SCENE 1
FELLS POINT INDUSTRIAL PARK
BALTIMORE, MD
NIGHT

Some police are armed and bent walking toward a warehouse. The lead one gets to a car with a man in the front seat of the patrol car.

COP 1: Yeah, how're ya doing?

GUY IN CAR: Quite a little party. What do you know?

COP 1: Reports that there were shots fired. The door looks like it's been jimmied. The alarm wasn't tripped.

GUY IN CAR: You see anybody come out?

COP 1: Not a soul. Whoever it is, he's still in there.

COP 1 motions for his men to go into the building. In the building, they walk up the stairwell with their flashlights on. One by one, covering each other, they enter a warehouse room filled with crates, dark.

COP 2: Lieutenant, over here.

COP 1 turns with his gun at ready and looks at the ground. Blood.

COP 2: Look here. Looks like someone got hit.

COP 1: So where'd he go? Stay low and keep looking.

They slowly search again. COP 1 hears groaning. He turns and sees a large piece of cardboard leaning against a crate. The moaning is coming from underneath. He slowly walks toward it. He talks into the headset communication.

COP 1: Davis! Gonzalez!

DAVIS AND GONZALEZ: Yeah.

They join him. He slowly lifts the cardboard. A naked man. He's groaning with his arm over his face. It's Mulder.

MULDER: They're here....

COP 1: Are you all right?

MULDER: They're here...

COP 1: Who's here?

He motions for the two to check it out. We follow one of them as he moves to another section and lifts a wooden slat door. Three figures pop up and run away.

COP 2: Hey, stop. Police!

One of the men falls and the other two stop by him with their arms raised. It's Frohike on the floor, Langly and Byers!

LANGLY: Don't shoot!

FROHIKE: We didn't do it.

COP 2: Didn't do what?

BYERS: Whatever.

COP 2: Face down on the floor!

They slowly kneel down as the other MP comes with his gun pointed at them. They go stomach to the floor.

COP 2: Get down! Get down! All right. Cuff 'em. Spread 'em.

The cops frisk them as they hear the shouting again.

MULDER: THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE!

BALTIMORE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT
MAY 1989

In the jail cell, Byers leaning against the front, hands through the bars, looking at his fingerprint ink stained fingers. Langly and Frohike are on separate benches in the cell.

LANGLY: We're screwed. Thank you so much for getting me involved in this, DOO-hickey.

FROHIKE: Frohike, you hippie jerk.

LANGLY: DOO-hickey!

Frohike stands with his finger pointed. Langly stands and towers over him.

FROHIKE: Ya know, with that long blonde hair, you'll be the first one in here that gets traded for cigarettes. I'm gonna be laughing my ass off.

LANGLY: Oh yeah? Ya wanna cha-cha.

FROHIKE: Anytime, any place.

Byers turns.

BYERS: Both of you relax!

LANGLY: Shut up, ya narc!

FROHIKE: It's your fault we're here.

GUARD: You, you with the suit. You're first.

Byers turns, scared.



SCENE 3
INTERROGATION ROOM
Byers is sitting at the table as Munch walks around him and sits across from him.

MUNCH: Detective Munch, Baltimore Homicide.

BYERS: Did they find her?

MUNCH: And a good evening to you. Sorry, no sign of your mystery lady.

BYERS: She is real, the FBI agent saw her.

MUNCH: Yeah well, Special Agent .. (checks his notes) Mulder? Is currently being held under five-point restraints and jabbering like a monkey. And the FBI's not talking either. So, what I'm looking at here is a warehouse break-in with nothing stolen, a shoot-out but no guns, lots of blood but no bodies. And an FBI agent who likes to take off all his clothes and talk about space aliens. Fill me in. From the top, start with your name and birth date.

BYERS: John Fitzgerald Byers, 11/22/63.

MUNCH: Seriously.

BYERS: I was named after JFK. Before the assassination, my parents were going to call me Bertram.

MUNCH: Lucky you. Occupation?

BYERS: I work for the government... for the moment.

MUNCH: What do you do for the government?

BYERS: I'm a public affairs officer for the Federal Communications Commission. It was in that capacity that I was attending the Computer and Electronics Show at the Baltimore Convention Center.



SCENE 4
BALTIMORE CONVENTION CENTER - COMPUTER AND ELECTRONICS SHOW
Lots of booths around. Byers stands at his, blue curtain with an FCC sign.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: Just this morning. We at the FCC enjoy forging positive ties with the American public. It's our way of saying 'Communication is just another word for sharing'.

He lifts a glass jar full of buttons to two hippies walking past. .

BYERS: Hi, guys. Like a button?

HIPPIES: Up yours, narc.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: Of course some people don't see it like that.

They walk right on by. In the distance, he sees a blonde woman wearing sunglasses walking toward him. It's slow motion as she gets closer. Byers is awestruck.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: At any rate, that was where I first saw her.

She gets to the booth, lowers her glasses, flashes her eyes at Byers.

BYERS: Would you like a... a button?

She walks on.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: I'm still not sure why I did what I did. It was so unlike me. There was just something about her.

Byers goes behind the curtain to a man at a computer playing Dig Dug.  Byers bends to him.

BYERS: Ken, I'm going to take a short break, okay?

KEN: Yeah, all right.



SCENE 5

FROHIKE'S BOOTH AT COMPUTER AND ELECTRONICS SHOW
Susanne arrives at Frohike's booth, Frohike Electronics Corp.

FROHIKE: Hello pretty lady!

He kicks into his salesman mode.

FROHIKE: Picture this, crystal-clear television, 33 channels worth with no monthly cable bill.

SUSANNE: Excuse me?

FROHIKE: Now! (He cuts her off) Now I know what you're thinking. Melvin? Are you out of your mind? No cable bill? That's exactly what I'm saying, and I'm talking premium channels here too. You got your HBO, you got your Cinemax, you got your Showtime. All courtesy of this modestly priced marvel designed and built by the Frohike Electronics Corporation.

He pulls out what looks like a VCR/TV splitter. Langly comes up from behind a dividing curtain to his own booth.

LANGLY: There's a name that inspires consumer confidence.

FROHIKE: Shut up, punk!  (To Susanne) Where were we?

Langly pulls the curtain away, we see his booth and name, Langly Vision.

LANGLY: Hey lady, if you want to watch Matlock with Andy Griffith all blue and squiggly, go right ahead and buy from this guy. But, if you want quality bootleg cable, you talk to me.

FROHIKE: If you want a converter that'll short out and burn your house down, definitely talk to this guy.

LANGLY: It was a one time fluke. I heat cinque every mother board.

FROHIKE: Yeah, well what about coax laws? Use the RG6U or the 52 All Mar GH?

LANGLY: Trick question.

They continue their discussion as Susanne walks on, Byers following. Susanne turns a corner and bumps into Byers. Her purse falls to the floor.

BYERS: Sorry.

He bends to help her pick up the belongings of her purse. He picks up a picture of a little girl.

BYERS: She's very cute.

SUSANNE: Yeah. She is. Thank you.

BYERS: Wait!

She turns.

BYERS: Um, ah... You just look like you could use some help.

TABLE
Susanne and Byers are talking over coffee.

SUSANNE: So my daughter turned 3 years old last week. Last Tuesday was her birthday. I hope he remembered that...

She softly cries.

BYERS: Her... her father... took her from you?

SUSANNE: My former boyfriend. He kidnaped her.

Byers is surprised.

SUSANNE: It's a long story. Basically I got involved with a man who turned out to be a complete psychotic.

BYERS: Yeah?

SUSANNE: We were only together a few months... I was attracted to him because he was dark and mysterious. And then he just kept getting darker and more mysterious. I got pregnant and he left.

She sniffs back a sob.

SUSANNE: And then he suddenly came back and took her about 6 months ago.

BYERS: That's terrible. Did you call the police?

SUSANNE: Of course. The police and private investigators. They were surprisingly unhelpful.

BYERS: That's unbelievable.

SUSANNE: Yeah... well. At least I managed to get a couple of leads. I was told he was in the Baltimore area. So here I am.

BYERS: Well, that's a start...

SUSANNE: Yeah... Except that he now knows that I'm looking for him. And the closer I get the more dangerous he becomes.

BYERS: Are you... worried he might... harm your daughter?

SUSANNE: Let's just say I want to find her, not him.

She hands him a piece of paper with the words "Arpanet/Whtcorp/" written on it.

SUSANNE: This is the only other lead I've got. That's why I'm here today. This has something to do with computers. Doesn't it? The internet?

BYERS: Actually, the Orpanet. It's a government network created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency... You can access it through the internet.

SUSANNE: Somehow this means something to my ex-boyfriend. I was hoping it was a means to finding my daughter.

Long pause as Byers decides if he's going to get involved.

BYERS: If you want...

Bingo!

BYERS: I could go online... try to find out for you.

SUSANNE: Would you? That... I would really, really appreciate that.

BYERS: Um, by the way, my name's John.

Susanne sees a packet of Holly brand sugar on the table.

SUSANNE: Holly.

She smiles.

SUSANNE: Nice to meet you.

BYERS: Holly.

He smiles.

BYERS: Just like the sugar.

SUSANNE: Yeah... just like the sugar.

BYERS: Funny...



SCENE 6
FCC BOOTH BEHIND CURTAIN
Ken is still playing Dig Dug. Byers comes up behind him.

BYERS: Ken, can you take a short break?

Ken loses the game and shrugs.

KEN: Whatever...

Ken gets up and leaves. Byers sits in the chair.

BYERS: Ok... let's see.

He logs onto the net.

BYERS: So your ex-boyfriend is into computers?

SUSANNE: I don't really know. I knew very little about him. Except that he's psychotic.

BYERS: Somehow this kicked us into the Defense Data Network.

He looks at the screen. Need ID.

BYERS: I'm sorry, I think this is the end of the line.

SUSANNE: Isn't there something you could ... how do you say it? Hack into?

Byers is shocked!

BYERS: Hack into? No! I... I mean, technically, yes. I probably could. But this belongs to the Department of Defense. This is a secured site. I mean I work for the FCC. This is the kind of thing we're trying to stop.

SUSANNE: Thank you, John. I appreciate your time.

She starts to leave.

BYERS: Wait...

He stops and thinks.

BYERS: You didn't see this.

He punches on the keyboard. They're in.

SUSANNE: What did you do?

BYERS: Oh, government system. I know a couple of logon tricks with VMS Version 5... Never mind.

He punches some more keys.

SUSANNE: Can you look up Susanne Modeski? That's my daughter.

BYERS: I'll try. There's just no way of telling...

A strange screen comes up.

SUSANNE: What is that?

BYERS: It's an encrypted file. Why would your three year old have an encrypted file with the Secret Defense Department Data Base?

SUSANNE: Can you decode it?

BYERS: I'd need some help.

SUSANNE: Can you print it out for me?

She walks to the printer as Byers punches more keys. After it prints and she tears it off, she looks through a gap in the curtain.

SUSANNE: My God!

BYERS: What?

Byers and Susanne gather at the curtain gap.

SUSANNE: My ex-boyfriend is out there.

BYERS: The psychotic?

SUSANNE: He must have tracked me here. He's looking for me. Damn it! There he is.



SCENE 7
OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN
There is a group of people stopped, looking at booths and walking around. There is one man with his back to the curtain that's just looking at the people. He turns and his body faces the curtain, but his face is still scanning the crowd. It's Mulder!



SCENE 8
FROHIKE'S BOOTH
Mulder passes in front of Frohike's booth.

FROHIKE: You look like a gentleman who could appreciate 33 channels crystal-clear television.

MULDER: No thanks, handsome.

Mulder keeps walking.

FROHIKE: Oh, a man of distinction ... (after he's gone) Punk ass.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: It was at this point we enlisted the help of one Melvin Frohike... computer hacker.

Susanne and Byers go to Frohike's booth.

FROHIKE: Hello pretty lady... Yeah.  What's with the narc?



SCENE 9
INTERROGATION ROOM
Byers is still relating the events to Munch.

BYERS: I continued to tell him the entire story. I hoped he could assist me in deciphering the encrypted file.



SCENE 10
FROHIKE'S BOOTH

BYERS' VOICE OVER: It was at this point however that Mr. Frohike raised an interesting question.

FROHIKE: I don't understand, why don't you just kick this guy's ass?

BYERS: What?

SUSANNE: No. I just want these pages decoded, can you do that?

FROHIKE: Sure, baby, my kung fu is the best, but it could take hours, I say cut to the chase. If pretty boy out there can tell us where your daughter is, we just need to go beat it out of him.

SUSANNE: Bad idea. He's very dangerous.

FROHIKE: Lady, I'm dangerous. All right, so, we just won't. For all we know he's got the girl here somewhere.

BYERS: Holly, it makes sense.

SUSANNE: No! Just stay away from him.

FROHIKE: We'll stay back a ways. Just wait for us here. Come on!

Frohike and Byers leave. Susanne is worried. Not about them getting beat up, but rather they'd
find out the truth.

LATER
They hide from Mulder but Byers watches him from a distance. Frohike has a virtual reality helmet on.

FROHIKE: What's he doing?

BYERS: Talking to somebody.

Frohike lifts the face plate and looks at Mulder.

FROHIKE: This dude doesn't look so tough.

Mulder turns and walks toward them. Frohike flips the face plate down.

FROHIKE: Act casual.

BOOTH
As they walk on, a voice from a booth booms out at the people milling around.

VOICE: Alien presence is among us... They're here.



SCENE 11
BASEMENT
Frohike and Byers follow Mulder to the basement. Mulder turns and surprises them.

MULDER: So, fellas... You looking for somebody?

BYERS: Just um.... the bathroom.

MULDER: I don't think it's down here. (He notices Byers' button) Hey, you with the FCC?

FROHIKE: What's it to you?

MULDER: I think we share the same credit union. (He takes out his badge) Special Agent Fox Mulder I'm with the ... a... Federal Bureau of Investigation. I was hoping maybe you could help me. I'm ... m... looking for a girl. I was wondering if you've seen her.

He shows them a picture of 'Holly'. Byers' eyes go wide. Frohike, ever the smoothy, is surprised but doesn't show it.

FROHIKE: Sorry.

BYERS: What did she do?

MULDER: What's it to you? Thanks, guys. All right?

A loud cell phone rings. Mulder takes this humongous old time cell phone out of his pocket and answers it.

MULDER: Yeah, Mulder... Oh hey, Reggie... What's up?

Frohike and Byers walk away.

FROHIKE: What the hell was that all about?

BYERS: He's with the FBI?



SCENE 12
CONVENTION CENTER
Frohike and Byers make their way back the main floor.

FROHIKE: Hey, where'd she go?

MP: Here we go.

Byers' Dig-Dug buddy is dragged away by the MP's.

KEN: Just take your hands away from me.

MP: Make way. Let him through.

KEN: Come on.

BYERS: Ken?

KEN: All I did was play Dig Dug. I didn't hack into anybody's computer. Seriously guys. I have like a circulatory problem. I have a tendency to...

BYERS: Wait!... It was me.

FROHIKE: What are you doing?

BYERS: *I* hacked into their computer.

Frohike pulls him aside.

FROHIKE: So you're gonna turn yourself in, are you crazy? A hacker never turns himself in!

BYERS: I am not a *hacker*.

FROHIKE: Listen, we got FBI agents running around, military police. Whatever the hell is going on around here, it's big. And your lady friend is somehow at the center of it all.

BYERS: She needs my help. How can we learn what's going on?

FROHIKE: The FBI are looking for her, hack into the FBI mainframe. I know just the guy who can do it.

BYERS: You are talking about a pre-meditated crime against the United States government.

FROHIKE: Hey, your second one today. (He rips off Byers' FCC button) Welcome to the dark side.



SCENE 13
DARK ROOM - LOCATION UNKNOWN
Men seated around a table, we hear Langly's voice as the camera pans over the men's faces.

LANGLY: Okay ladies, who's down for fifty? ... Fifty bucks ... Anyone? ... Fifty bucks ... Oh man, my diaper-wearing granny would bet fifty! ... Come on! ... There's no game here.

MAN: Alright, fifty.

LANGLY: Elron the Druid bets fifty. Cash only, Elron, I don't take no personal checks from the Bank of Middle Earth.

Langly takes dice and begins to rattle them in his hands.

LANGLY: Come on natural 20, Daddy needs a new sword of wounding.

The door opens letting light flood into the room, Frohike and Byers are standing there, Langly jumps up and rushes to the door.

LANGLY: What's the big idea bringing the narc in here?

FROHIKE: Me and the narc have a proposition for you.

LANGLY: What proposition?

FROHIKE: The coolest hack in the world.

ANOTHER MAN: Lord Manhammer...

LANGLY: Say it .... Say it.

FROHIKE: Your kung fu is the best.

Langly grins.



SCENE 14
HOTEL ROOM
Langly and a lot of computer equipment are jammed into a hotel room with Byers and Frohike.

LANGLY: Here... make yourself useful.

He hands the plug to Byers.

BYERS: What does this do?

FROHIKE: Besides over heat? Burn the hotel down?

LANGLY: It's a lube line shunt. Anyone who tries to trace will get passed around by CMT. It call forwarding software. My personal invention.

He clicks onto the computer.

BYERS: Oh, I'm going to get fired... I'm going to go to jail... I deserve to go to jail.

FROHIKE: Shut up already. (To Langly) What do you need me to do?

LANGLY: Just watch and learn.

He clicks around and a screen pops up.

LANGLY: Bingo. Government hack is a snap. Last week I got into the Maryland DMV. Changed my endorsement so I can handicap park.

Pause.

LANGLY: I got tinnitus. What now?

FROHIKE: Look up the FBI agent. What'd he say his name was?

BYERS: Mulder.

Langly types in. Screen pops up with generic information on Agent Fox Mulder with a picture of him.

LANGLY: That your boy?

FROHIKE: Fox William Mulder.  Born 10-13-1961. Degree in psychology from Oxford University. Top of his class at Quantico. Commendations up the ying yang. Currently attached to the Violent Crimes Unit. Single. Nothing in here about him being a psycho or having a daughter.

BYERS: Try under active cases, Holly Modeski.

Langly enters the information.

LANGLY: Nada. No case file.

BYERS: Try the daughter, Susanne Modeski.

Langly enters and a file turns up with 'Holly's' picture.

BYERS: She's Susanne Modeski?

FROHIKE: Employee at the Army Advanced Weapon Facility at White Stone, NM.

BYERS: Whtcorp ....

LANGLY: Oh, man. Look at this... Says here she blew up one of their labs, killed four people. Including the MP who tried to stop her at the gate.

FROHIKE: Subject Modeski is considered unstable and delusional. Intellectually brilliant yet prone to confabulation and fits of violent behavior.

LANGLY: Psychotic and profoundly paranoid.

FROHIKE: Armed and extremely dangerous. Do not approach. Call immediately for back up.

The door knob turns. The men gasp. The door opens. It's Susanne. She enters and locks the
door behind her.

SUSANNE: You're reading about me.

Pause. She looks at Byers.

SUSANNE: My name is Susanne Modeski not Holly. I'm ... I was an organic chemist for the Advanced Weapons Facility... But I never blew up any lab and I certainly never killed anybody. All I did was try to quit. Not have a job, just quit.

BYERS: What about your daughter?

SUSANNE: I don't have one. I'm sorry...

BYERS: The photo?

SUSANNE: It came with the wallet. You wouldn't have believed the truth, obviously and I desperately needed you to help.

BYERS: With what, exactly?

SUSANNE: To get this.

She holds the print out.

SUSANNE: I still need it deciphered. This has in it everything I need to expose the United States government's plot against it's own people. One I unwittingly helped to form by developing the Ergotimene histamine gas.

LANGLY: Ergotomine...

SUSANNE: EH for short. It's an aerosolized gas which in small doses caused anxiety paranoia in it's subject.

FROHIKE: Paranoia. Got ya.

SUSANNE: Secret forces within the government plan to test this gas on the American people right here in Baltimore!

The Lone Gunmen all look at each other, figuring she's flipped her lid.

SUSANNE: I am not making this up. Don't you get it, nobody is safe! Look what they did to JFK!

BYERS: What did they do to JFK?

SUSANNE: Dallas? 1963? Hello?! They want to control every aspect of our lives, from the cradle to the grave. They practically do already.

She starts pulling open the drawers next to the hotel beds as the boys exchange looks, and finally pulls out a Bible.

SUSANNE: Hotel Bible, who do you think put this here?

LANGLY: The government?

SUSANNE: One in every hotel room in America, it's the perfect vessel for electronic surveillance. No one ever questions its presence.

FROHIKE: Now, I'm sorry, you're telling me that the US government, the same government that gave us Amtrak...

LANGLY: Not to mention the Susan B. Anthony dollar.

FROHIKE:  ... is behind some of the darkest, most far-reaching conspiracies on the planet?! That's just crazy!

LANGLY: I mean, like, this guy works for the government.

SUSANNE: I'll prove it to you, just help me decipher this.

As she picks up the file, her gun falls to the floor, startling the boys.

SUSANNE: What do you say guys?

BYERS' VOICE OVER: Of course, at that point, we didn't feel like we had much choice.



SCENE 15

LATER
Drapes are pulled. Langly's hacking.

FROHIKE: Langly, what's taking so long?

LANGLY: I should be up any second.

FROHIKE: Oh, yeah. Here we go.

He types.

FROHIKE: Thank God for super computers.

BYERS (reading the file): Surprise defection of Dr. Susanne Modeski is a blow to the program but not a fatal one. The time table remains unchanged. First EBO will occur in the Baltimore-Washington area within one week's time.

LANGLY: What's an EBO?

SUSANNE: Engineered Biological Operation. Toxic organic agents used on humans.

BYERS (reading): Security risks are being attenuated. Dr. Modeski's team has been processed and plausible denial constructed.

SUSANNE: Which is another way of saying that they murdered my research associates and placed the blame on me. Now do you understand?

She looks at the screen again.

SUSANNE: Wait.  Here it is. EH product is presently warehoused at 204 Falls Point Road. Lot number A900 awaiting EBO. This is it...

BYERS: "Subject Modeski currently monitored around the clock. Covert electronics installed per Dr. Michael Killborn 11-6-88." Who's Dr. Michael Killborn?

SUSANNE: My dentist. Excuse me.

She takes a pair of pliers and goes into the bathroom.

BYERS: What do you think?

LANGLY: That... thing about her dentist...

BATHROOM
Byers opens the door and cautiously looks inside.

BYERS: Dr. Modeski?

He goes into the room. Susanne is standing at the sink with blood all over, and a tooth in the pliers.

BYERS: Get in here!

He rushes to her and Langly and Frohike appear at the door.

BYERS: My God!

SUSANNE: Look at it... (she has trouble talking because of the pain) Look at it!

FROHIKE: Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?

We see a bug in the filling of the tooth.

BYERS: What was the address of that warehouse?



SCENE 16
INTERROGATION ROOM

MUNCH: Where's the tooth?

BYERS: We flushed it. We were afraid it would give away our location.

Munch just looks at him.

BYERS: So... we broke into the warehouse.



SCENE 17
WAREHOUSE

LANGLY: Here it is!

There's a carton with a large sign reading A9000.

LANGLY: A9000, right?

Susanne cuts the carton open. She takes out a small box the carton is full of.

BYERS: Asthma medicine...

SUSANNE: This is how they plan on distributing the gas. It's asthma inhalers. This is their random test! Now I've got proof.

MULDER'S VOICE: Stay where you are.

They turn and see Mulder walking toward them with his gun pointed at them.

MULDER: Federal agent. Susanne Modeski, you are under arrest for the murders of four people at White Stone Army Base.

BYERS: She didn't do it!

FROHIKE: She's innocent.

LANGLY: Yeah.

MULDER: You three are under arrest also.

Susanne starts to move away.

MULDER: Ma'am, stay where you are.

BYERS: Just listen... There's more going on here than meets the eye.

MULDER: You three get on the ground now! Ma'am, stop moving. I'm not going to ask you again.

The men get on the floor. Determined footsteps are coming in the building. Two men walk up to them.

MAN: Susanne Modeski, please come with us.

MULDER: Federal agent, identify yourself.

MAN: Ma'am, come with us.

MULDER: Step forward and identify yourselves, NOW!

Shots ring out, Mulder dives for cover. The Gunmen run behind some other boxes across the room. The inhaler carton is riddled with bullet holes. Mulder lies on the ground by it. The chemical that spills out of the carton gets on Mulder, who starts moaning and wreathing around on the floor. He takes his shirt off. The man walks up to Mulder and is about to shoot him. Susanne shoots the guy first. Mulder is in a daze. Lone gunmen come out from behind the boxes.

BYERS: Susanne!

Behind them, a large garage door opens and light filters into the room. MPs walk in with detectors of some sort. Another man walks in and ahead of the cops. He walks past the Gunmen with another man. It's X. He stops at Mulder.

X: Sanitize it.

Mulder hallucinates. The clean up men are aliens. Their voices are distorted.

MULDER: They're here.

The man shot by Susanne is put into a body bag.

MAN: I'm alive!

They zip him up anyway. He keeps screaming "I'm alive!" from inside the bag.

BYERS: Who are you people?!

A crate mover is driven in.

FROHIKE: Whoa!

They move out of its way. The boxes are taped up. The floor is vacuumed and cleaned. X supervises.

BYERS: What authority do you have to do this?

LANGLY: Shut up, Byers!

X glares at them and walks over to Mulder lying on the floor.

CLEAN-UP GUY: Bag him?

X leans over Mulder.

X: No one touches this man.

BYERS: Excuse me.

LANGLY: Byers...

BYERS: Sir!

X looks at him and walks over.

BYERS: Why are you doing this? You people framed Susanne Modeski, you plan to test that chemical on an unwitting public. Why? For what possible reason?

FROHIKE: Byers, shut up!

BYERS: Who gives you the authority?

X: No bags.

The boys are forced to their knees, hands in the air, X checks the gun and walks behind them. He points his gun at Byers' head, pulls the trigger and ... click. The gun was empty.

X: Behave yourselves.

He begins to walks away.

BYERS: That's it? Just trying to intimidate us, to scare us so we'll keep quiet?

FROHIKE: Byers, I swear to God, I'll shoot you myself.

BYERS: It's all true what Susanne said about you people, isn't it? About John F. Kennedy? Dallas?

X: I heard it was a lone gunman.

X walks out as the door shuts and distant cop sirens are heard.

BYERS' VOICE OVER: That was the last we saw of him.



SCENE 18
INTERROGATION ROOM

BYERS: Almost immediately, the police got there. We panicked and hid. You know the rest.

MUNCH: Do I look like Geraldo to you? Don't lie to me like I'm Geraldo, I'm *not* Geraldo!



SCENE 19

CELL
They are in the cell like earlier in the show. Langly stirs from a bunk.

LANGLY: Oh man, not all a bad dream. I am in hell.

He sits up.

FROHIKE: Women...

LANGLY: Ain't it the truth.

BYERS: What do you mean, women?

LANGLY: You know exactly what he means. Your molar pulling girlfriend pulled us in and left us swinging in the breeze.

Byers looks at Frohike.

BYERS: Is that what you meant?

FROHIKE: Look... she is hot. But you've got to admit, we're here because of her.

BYERS: I'm here because I wanted to know the truth. I assumed that was the same for you. Susanne opened my eyes to it. She doesn't owe me anything. It there was some way I could... help her still, I'd do it in a second.

MUNCH: Apparently Agent Mulder came to and verified your warehouse story, or at least what little he seems to recall of it. (He opens the door) Three cheers for the FBI, you guys are free to go. Come on, let's go. (As they walk out by him) Here's a tip, aluminum foil makes a lovely hat and it blocks out the government's mind control rays. Keep you guys out of trouble.



SCENE 19
CHECKOUT
The officer on duty is doling out their belongings.

COP: One green nylon wallet containing 38 dollars in cash.

Langly takes it. The cop puts a whatever the hell this is on the desk.

COP: One ... whatever the hell this is.

Munch looks at it. It's I think a splitter. He takes it. Another cop comes in.

OTHER COP: Detective?

Munch turns.

OTHER COP: We got a stolen car that turned up at the train station. It's the one that the FBI agent was driving.

Munch nods and leaves with the other cop.

BYERS: Susanne must have taken Mulder's car last night. She left it at the train station.

LANGLY: So?

BYERS: So maybe we can catch up with her.

FROHIKE: Where? She took a train.

BYERS: She's too smart for that. You see... she... she just meant to throw them off.

LANGLY: She said she wanted to go public.

FROHIKE: The Baltimore Guardian is only a couple of blocks down from the train station.



SCENE 20
SIDEWALK OUTSIDE BALTIMORE GUARDIAN
Susanne is walking out of the building dejected. The gunmen run down the sidewalk to her. Byers catches her.

BYERS: Susanne!

Langly and Frohike knock a guy down on the sidewalk and help him get up.

FROHIKE: You okay?

SUSANNE: They didn't believe my story. Not a word of it. Who in their right mind would?

FROHIKE: What are you going to do now?

SUSANNE: Try other newspapers... TV stations... Not give up. Keep trying to find people who will listen. People like you... I appreciate what you did for me. All three of you.

BYERS: We still want to help.

Susanne touches his cheek. They kiss.

SUSANNE: You already have.

A pay phone rings next to them.

LANGLY: Guys...

SUSANNE: No matter how paranoid you are, you're not paranoid enough. Tell the truth. Reach as many people as you can with it. That's your weapon.

She walks away. At the end of the block, a black car comes around the corner and stops. Another car stops at the end, blocking her path. She runs back and men from the first car get her.

BYERS: Susanne!

She is put into the first car and they drive off in slow motion. The back smoked glass window is
closed but the gunmen see X clearly.



SCENE 21
CONVENTION CENTER
The building is being cleaned up after the convention. The gunmen are sitting at the remains of their booths. Mulder walks in.

FROHIKE: Ya feeling better?

MULDER: Yeah I am, thank you, I just ... mmm ... I have these weird ideas in my head that I can't seem to shake.

FROHIKE: What kind of ideas?

MULDER: Weird ones.

LANGLY: Ya gonna bust us?

MULDER: I'm not sure yet, I just spoke with my ASAC and he tells me that Dr. Susanne Modeski is no longer wanted by the FBI. She's still missing, but the case has suddenly closed. What I need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night.

BYERS: You want the truth?

MULDER: Yeah, I want the truth.

BYERS: You might want to sit down, this is gonna take a while.

They all sit down.

BYERS: The truth is ... none of us is safe. Secret elements within the United States government seek to surveil us and control our lives.

MULDER: What?!

LANGLY: Tell him about the hotel room Bibles.

BYERS: Yeah, I'm coming to that. Okay, it all started with Susanne Modeski...

[THE END]


                       DETOUR



SCENE 1
LEON COUNTY
NORTH FL

(Two surveyors walking through Canadian .... ooops North Floridian forest with survey gear. They speak using radios.)

SLOAN: All right, lets shoot this, Marty.

MARTY: Hold it still. Hold it still, Sloan.

SLOAN: (fighting off bugs) Id like to see you hold it still. The sooner they pave over this swamp, the better.

MARTY: Its not a swamp. Youre standing in a forest with indigenous plant and animal species youre obviously too ignorant to appreciate. Mark it and give me another position.

SLOAN: All right, lets shoot this next one real carefully, Marty, 'cause this is where theyre gonna put the Blockbuster.

MARTY: Youre a real moron, Sloan, you know that?

SLOAN: Tree hugger.

MARTY: You should be sad to see the demise of an ecosystem thats lasted a thousand years. We all should be. Give me four feet to your left.

SLOAN: I cant.

MARTY: What do you mean you cant?

SLOAN: I mean I cant because its stuck.

MARTY: Then unstick it.

(SLOAN touches ground where his survey pole is stuck. Looks at his fingers covered in blood.)

SLOAN: This is weird.

(SLOAN sees two glowing red eyes open in ground. He begins to scream.)

MARTY: Sloan! Sloan!

(SLOAN has disappeared from the viewfinder. Movement in bushes coming toward MARTY. He starts to run. He hides behind log. Relaxes. Red eyes open in log. MARTY screams and disappears behind log.)

SCENE 2

(Same forest. ASEKOFF family, FATHER and SON, LOUIS, and dog are hunting.)

FATHER: Louis, let Bo do the work.

LOUIS: (releases dog) Hows he know how to find a possum?

FATHER: Shhh. Animals sense things that we cant. Its how they survive.

LOUIS: Well, so is that how Bo knows how to hunt?

FATHER: Yeah. Our ancestors were hunters, too. But most of us have lost those instincts. Thats why we need a little help. (indicates shotgun)

LOUIS: Dad, whats that?

FATHER: Surveyors equipment. Someone left his stuff out here. (dog barks) Stay close, Louis.

(FATHER sees dog looking at surveyors bloody jacket.)

LOUIS: What is it, Dad? Dad?

FATHER: Come here, Bo. (Pulls dog away.)

LOUIS: What.....

FATHER: Quiet. (hears rustling) Listen to me. I want you to take Bo, and I want you to run straight home.

LOUIS: Whats the matter?

FATHER: I want you to run straight home and I dont want you to stop for anything.
(Loads shotgun.)

LOUIS: I just .....

FATHER: Louis? You understand? All right. Go.

(LOUIS runs off with dog.)

LOUIS: Come on, Bo, come on. (Pauses when he hears two shotgun blasts.) No, no. Come on, Bo. Come on. Come on! Come on! (Keeps running)



SCENE 3
ROUTE 43
LEON COUNTY

(Car driving on lonely road.)

MALE FBI AGENT (MIKE KINSLEY): Last year was something of a personal revelation. We were doing an exercise called team builders? Where we were given two minutes to build a tower out of ordinary office furniture.

FEMALE AGENT (STONECYPHER): When I stood on Mikes shoulders and I put that electric pencil sharpener on top of the pile, we both knew, we could never have done it alone.

MULDER: (in backseat with SCULLY, to SCULLY) Kill me now.

(SCULLY tries not to smile.)

KINSLEY: You ever been to one of these team seminars, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Ummm.... I think I went to a constructive problem solving course when I first joined the Bureau.

STONECYPHER: Oh, did you play that game where, um, you cant use any negative words?

KINSLEY: I couldnt believe how hard it was not to use the word "but."

MULDER: (In hell) Im having that same problem right now.

(SCULLY again tries not to smile.)

STONECYPHER: Have you ever been to a team seminar, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: No, you know unfortunately around this time of year I always develop a severe hemorrhoidal condition. (SCULLY tries not to laugh.)

KINSLEY: Well, it builds muscles you didnt even know you had.

STONECYPHER: Communication. Thats the key.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

(They are stopped at a road block.)

OFFICER: Sorry, folks, itll be a few minutes.

KINSLEY: Whats going on, officer?

OFFICER: Got a little situation is all.

(MULDER opens car door and gets out quickly.)

MULDER: (quietly) Thank you, Jesus.

KINSLEY: Wheres he going?

(SCULLY watches MULDER leave. She looks worried.)

(MULDER Stretches.)

MOTHER (ASEKOFF): Oh, excuse me. Are you from search and rescue?

MULDER: No, Im sorry, Im not. Im just stretching my legs.

MOTHER: They said theyd have word for us about what happened to my husband. I need somebody to tell me whats going on.

MULDER: Just slow down. I - I dont know what youre talking about.

MOTHER: My husband, Michael, he was teaching our son to shoot, and he said the dog got spooked and then he heard gunshots and now hes said theyve found a jacket with blood on it, but they wont tell me anything about my husband...

MULDER: Ill try to find out whos in charge, all right?

MOTHER: Oh, thank you.

(MULDER heads off into woods.)

STONECYPHER: Now wheres he going?

(SCULLY doesnt answer, just follows her partner.)

KINSLEY: (looking at a cross section of a felled tree with dates on the rings) Hey, Stonecypher! Take a look at this. This tree was here twenty years before Ponce De Leon landed.

STONECYPHER: Were going to be late for the wine and cheese reception.

(In woods at crime scene.)

OFFICER: Officer Fazekas?

MICHELLE: Yes? (Sees MULDER) Can I help you?

MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder. Im an agent with the FBI.

MICHELLE: FBI? Who called you guys out?

MULDER: (showing badge) Nobody. We just got stopped at your roadblock. It sounds like you had a shooting.

MICHELLE: Shots were reported, but we have no evidence of anyone being shot.

MULDER: Well, what do you have evidence of?

MICHELLE: A survey team working these woods didnt report in last night We found one mans bloody jacket pretty torn up. And this morning, a boy got separated from his father.

MULDER: Separated by what?

MICHELLE: It looks, maybe, like some kind of animal attack.

MULDER: What kind of animal?

MICHELLE: Im not sure yet. I followed good tracks for the two surveyors but the trails became confused as they moved into the brush. There was a third set of tracks leading away. I.... I couldnt identify.

(SCULLY arrives and waits impatiently.)

MULDER: Couldnt identify as the surveyors?

(SCULLY checks watch.)

MICHELLE: As man or animal.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Oh, just, uh ... (SCULLY give him "come on" look.) Hold on a second.

MULDER: (to MICHELLE) What about the boys father?

MICHELLE: I tracked him all the way down to where he fired the shots. The grounds rocky, but from the depressions in the underlying soil, I can tell you that he entered the bushes from over there where I pick up another set of tracks  two distinctly different sets of tracks that from the way the grounds upset that is probably where the man was attacked.

(SCULLY follows them.)

MULDER: But no other sign of him? Do you have panther in these woods?

MICHELLE: Theres panther. Bear

MULDER: But these tracks look like neither of those.

MICHELLE: No, sir.

MULDER: You know of a good motel in the area?

MICHELLE: Excuse me. I think we can handle this very well on our own. Thanks. (She leaves.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Weve got this conference. Theyre waiting.

MULDER: Yeah. How do I say this without using any negative words, Scully?

SCULLY: You want me to tell them that youre not going to make it to this years teamwork seminar.

MULDER: Yeah, you see that? (Grabs her arms) We dont need that conference. We have communication like that, unspoken. You know what Im thinking.

(SCULLY shakes her head and watches him walk off.)



SCENE 4
ASEKOFF RESIDENCE
9:22 PM

(Night. LOUIS is watching B&W version of The Invisible Man. MOTHER kisses him and shuts off TV)

LOUIS: Hes not coming back, is he?

MOTHER: Why would you say that?

LOUIS: Dads a good shot. If he hit what he was aiming at hed be home by now.

MOTHER: You got to be brave, Louis. We both got to be brave. Well find out more about it in the morning. Get some sleep now.

(MOTHER clears dinner plates. Dog whimpers at door.)



SCENE 5

(MULDER in hotel room with amazingly fast laptop looking at pages of predators. Knock at door.)

MULDER: Its open. (SCULLY enters with tray of cheese and mini bottle of wine.) Who cut the cheese?

SCULLY: Since you wont be making it to the conference ....

MULDER: Partaaayyy!

SCULLY: However, I must remind you this goes against the Bureaus policy of male and female agents consorting in the same motel room while on assignment. (opens wine)

MULDER: Try any of that Tailhook crap on me, Scully, Ill kick your ass. Pop quiz. What animal will attack the strongest leaving the weakest to escape? The answer is none. Not one of the over 4,000 species native to North America will attack the strongest when the weak is vulnerable.

SCULLY: Well, what does that have to do with anything?

MULDER: It makes me think that what were dealing with here is no ordinary predator.

SCULLY: I thought this was just a ploy to get out of the conference.

MULDER: I think what we stumbled upon here is something more that what local authorities realize. The scenario described by that boy sound to me like a primitive culling technique.

SCULLY: Mulder, were in Western Florida. The closest thing to primitive down here is living in a beachfront retirement condo.

MULDER: Those woods are as old as anything in the south and theres 800 square miles of them. Theres no telling whats alive out there. (Gets up to leave)

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: I got to check something out.

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, sometimes I think some work on your communication skills wouldnt be such a bad idea.

MULDER: Ill be back soon, and we can build a tower of furniture. (smile) Kay?

(Puts on jacket and leaves. SCULLY drinks gulp of wine.)



SCENE 6

(Asekoff residence again. Night. Dog barks at the door.)

MOTHER: What is it, Bo?

LOUIS: (Upstairs) Mom?

MOTHER: Its all right, Louis. You go back to sleep now. (Looks out window, unlatches door, follows dog out, closing door behind her. Dog runs into bushes, barking.) Bo? Bo? Bo, whered you get to? (Rustling in the bushes. She gets close.) Bo is that you? (Dog leaps up and barks at her.) Come on boy. Lets go back in. (dog growls) All right, all right. You ... stay there tonight.

(She goes back to door, but deadbolt has been locked. She pounds on door.)

MOTHER: Louis? Louis? Louis?! Louis?!!! Louis!!!!

(Upstairs, LOUIS gets out of bed, goes into dark hall.)

LOUIS: Mom?

(He sees CREATURE running at him. He runs down stairs to back door. CREATURE follows. LOUIS crawls through the dog door. MULDER catches him.)

LOUIS: Ahhhhhh!!!

MULDER: What is it, Louis?

LOUIS: Its in the house.



SCENE 7

(Asekoff house, day. SCULLY enters Louis bedroom and takes Invisible Man tape out of the VCR. 7:03 am. I never had a VCR in my bedroom. She goes downstairs where MULDER and police are interviewing LOUIS and MOTHER. MULDER sees SCULLY.)

MULDER: (to others) Be right back.

SCULLY: Hows the boy?

MULDER: Hes still freaked out.

SCULLY: I think I might have some insight into this invisible creature he said was chasing him. (Shows MULDER the video tape.)

MULDER: The Invisible Man was invisible.

SCULLY: Right.

MULDER: Yeah, he said he was chased by a creature with glowing red eyes.

SCULLY: (Rolls eyes)

MULDER: Let me show you something. (Takes her to door.) Mrs. Asekoff said she went outside with the dog?

SCULLY: Mm hmm.

MULDER: But when she came back, the door was locked from the inside.

SCULLY: And?

MULDER: Look at this. We got some tracks here.

SCULLY: Where?

MULDER: Here, and here .... dried mud against the tile, tracked in from the outside.

SCULLY: That could have been brought in by the dog.

MULDER: No, no. You see, uh, the ball of the foot here? A large foot and I count five toes.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. I thought you said it wasnt human.

MULDER: Well, Im not saying it is. The weight distribution is all wrong. People walk heel to toe. Whatever this thing is it walks on the ball of its foot.

SCULLY: (pause) Youre putting me on.

MULDER: No. My dad and I were Indian Guides. I know these things.

SCULLY: So, if its not man and its not animal, what the hell is it?

MULDER: (Shakes his head.)

MICHELLE: (entering) Guess Im a little late to this dance.

MULDER: I found some tracks  right here.

MICHELLE: Same as I saw before.

SCULLY: Where was that?

MICHELLE: In the woods. Weight distributions strange. They appear to be human, but whoever left these uses the balls of his feet more like an animal.

(MULDER nods at SCULLY. She glares back.)

MULDER: Well, whatever it is, its attacked three grown men, presumably in broad daylight disposing of its prey without detection. And it wasnt shy last night about coming out of the woods to try again. What weve got here is a predator with low visibility and a high degree of motivation. And its got one advantage we dont have  the entire Apilachacola National Forest.

MICHELLE: Then how do you stop it?

MULDER: By identifying it. Finding it before it finds somebody else.



SCENE 8

(Road beside forest. JEFF GLASER the TECHHEAD is showing heat sensor machine thing. It has a camera and monitor that shows warm bodies.)

JEFF: Its called FLIR for Forward Looking InfraRed. It was developed for chopper pilots in Vietnam. Detects body heat at 300 yards.

MULDER: Thats pretty sophisticated for government issue. (MICHELLES body appears on the monitor.)

MICHELLE: I see you two have met. Jeffs our local Tech Head. Some people prefer searching with dogs, I prefer an extra pair of hands if I get in trouble. Are we ready to go, here? (SCULLY is having trouble on her cel phone.) Once we start in, you can put away your cel phones. The only communication in these woods is with short-wave radios. So stay close, maintain visual contact. If you get lost, initiate oral contact. That means holler. If nobody responds, sit down  dont move. I will find you. Dont go looking for me. I know it sounds obvious, but folks still get lost. (They enter forest.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Okay. I get you. Thank you. All right. (Hangs up) (To MULDER) Local PD has all their resources looking out for a transient, a drifter whos wanted for a double homicide in Gasden, Alabama. They were amused when I told them what we were doing.

MULDER: I dont think its a drifter, Scully, and we may be looking for two individuals.

SCULLY: Why do you say that?

MULDER: Well, that thing lured that woman out of the house last night to separate her from her son.

SCULLY: But for what purpose?

MULDER: Divide and conquer. If your enemy has greater numbers than you, you divide and conquer it to diminish those numbers.

SCULLY: What enemy would that be?

MULDER: Encroaching development. Thats what I suspected when I went to check on Louis and his mother.

SCULLY: You think this is about a housing tract?

MULDER: That survey team was staking out a new 100,000 acre plot. Civilization is pushing very hard into these woods. Maybe something in these woods is pushing back.

(As they walk, MICHELLE places small white pebbles to mark their path.)

SCULLY: Anything?

JEFF: No. No, nothing at all. Not even wildlife.

SCULLY: Isnt that a little strange?

JEFF: Yeah. This forest is usually alive with sound. Im not like an expert, but Ive never seen it like this before.

SCULLY: Well, it sure is beautiful, though.

JEFF: Well, thats what happens. People get to looking around, next thing they know, something eats em.

SCULLY: What do you think killed those men?

JEFF: Nature is populated by creatures either trying to kill something they need to survive, or trying to avoid being killed by something that needs them to survive. If we become blinded by the beauty of nature, we may fail to see its cruelty and violence.

SCULLY: Walt Whitman?

JEFF: No. When Animals Attack on the Fox Network.

(CREATURES hand appears as it steals MICHELLES white stones.)

JEFF: Wait, Ive got something. (MULDER and SCULLY draw guns.) Its about twenty yards ahead.

MICHELLE: Where? I dont see it.

JEFF: Its just sitting there. (We see creature in the monitor.) Its on the move! (They chase.) Its moving fast! Its ... its going to the right! (Chase.) Wait, wait. Theres two of them now. Theyre moving in opposite directions. There and there.

(MICHELL and SCULLY run one way, MULDER and JEFF the other.)

MULDER: Where is it?

JEFF: Its about 40 yards ahead of you!

MULDER: I dont see it.

JEFF: Now its .. gone. I dont know where it went.

(In another part of the forest ....)

SCULLY: What is it?

MICHELLE: I dont know.

SCULLY: Theyre trying to separate us  pull us away from the others. Lets go back.

(They start back slowly, MICHELLE leading. As they pass a tree, we see a face and red eyes against the bark. Suddenly, MICHELLE goes down and vanishes.)

MICHELLE: Ahhhhh!

SCULLY: Michelle? Michelle?! (whisper)Jeez. (yells) Mulder, I need help! Mulder!

(MULDER and JEFF running.)

MULDER: Scully!!

SCULLY: (voice) Over here!

MULDER: (voice) Scully!

SCULLY: Over here!

MULDER: What happened?

SCULLY: I dont know.

JEFF: Wheres Fazekas?

SCULLY: She was walking right ahead of me. She was right here, and then she was just gone.

JEFF: Im getting no reading.

SCULLY: What the hells happening here?

MULDER: They separated us. That was on purpose. They divided us so they could go after her. She was in the lead and presumably the strongest. They take the strongest first.

JEFF: They take them where? That doesnt make any sense. You cant just disappear out here.

MULDER: Youre right. We got to find her.

JEFF: How we gonna do that?

MULDER: I dont know! Well form a line and beat the bushes. Maybe youll pick up a signal.

JEFF: No, we need help. We need man power. (SCULLY pulls out cel phone.) Thats not going to work out here! We need to get out of here. Listen to me!

MULDER: The longer we wait, the less chance we have of finding her.

JEFF: This is nuts. This is loony tune, man. We got to go back out of the woods before it gets dark.

MULDER: Okay. Youre right. You go back. You leave me the FLIR and you go back.

JEFF: We got to go together.

MULDER: We have to find her.

JEFF: Yeah, but if we stay here, they may not find any of us.

SCULLY: Mulder, hes right. We werent prepared for this. We have no way of telling them where we are. We dont have any food. Michelle had our only water. Look, Id like to find her, too, but I think the risks of that are just way too foolish.

MULDER: (pause) All right. We all go then. (to Jeff) You lead the way.

(Walking back.)

SCULLY: (to MULDER) I dont have much faith that this device will do us any good.

MULDER: So far all its done is split us up.

SCULLY: Whatever it is that we were chasing did show up on the screen at first.

MULDER: What does that tell you?

SCULLY: Nothing.

MULDER: Mm hmm.

SCULLY: Except that were going in the right direction.

MULDER: Maybe it can regulate its temperature. Do you know of any animal that can?

SCULLY: Ticks. Ive heard that they can halt their metabolism for up to 18 years, essentially going into suspended animation until something warm-blooded comes along.

MULDER: Thats interesting.

SCULLY: Why is that interesting?

MULDER: 30 years ago, the, uh, the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia was terrorized for over a year by something  killing livestock and terrorizing the people. Witnesses described them as primitive looking men with red piercing eyes. Became known as the "moth men." Ive got an X-File dating back to 1952 on it.

SCULLY: What would that be filed next to - - "The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati?"

MULDER: No, "The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati" is in the Cs. "Moth Mens" over in the Ms.

JEFF: This isnt the way.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

JEFF: Michelle always marks her route with little white stones.

MULDER: This is the same path. This is the way we came.

JEFF: I havent seen one of her stones for twenty minutes.

MULDER: Thats because youve had your nose glued to that screen the whole time.

JEFF: Im telling you  were on the wrong trail! Somehow, we got off track. Oh man, this is not happening. This is not happening.

SCULLY: (seeing movement in the trees) Everybody stand still. Theres something out there.

(MULDER and SCULLY draw guns.)

MULDER: Where?

SCULLY: About 40 or 50 yards out.

MULDER: Jeff?

JEFF: Nothing. (Checks FLIR)

SCULLY: I saw it. The woods have gone silent again.

(Rustling behind them makes the turn.)

JEFF: I got it!

MULDER: Where?

JEFF: I got it on my screen!

MULDER: Where?

JEFF: About 30 yards ahead. Its just sitting there. (MULDER enters trees.) What is he doing?

SCULLY: Talk to him.

JEFF: This is not a good idea!

SCULLY: Talk to him, Jeff!

JEFF: Uh, go to your right. (CREATURE is hidden against tree. ) It just disappeared.

SCULLY: Mulder, its not on the screen.

(MULDER sees camouflaged CREATURE near a log. It runs. MULDER pursues, fires five shots.)

MULDER: Scully, I lost it.

SCULLY: I got it. (Fires 6 times.)

MULDER: Did you hit it?

SCULLY: I dont know. It just stopped.

MULDER: Wheres Glaser?

(SCULLY doesnt see JEFF.)

(JEFF, running through woods disappears just like MICHELLE.)

MULDER: How many shots did you fire?

SCULLY: Six, maybe seven.

MULDER: Is that your only clip?

SCULLY: Yep.

MULDER: Dont fire again unless youre sure youre gonna hit it. It may be trying to spend our advantage.

SCULLY: What the hell is it, Mulder?

MULDER: I dont know. But what ever it is, its smarter than us  at least out here.

(MULDER gets jerked down.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder!! (Runs toward where he was.)

MULDER: (voice in pain) Scully! Scully!

SCULLY: Mulder!!

MULDER: Scully!

(SCULLY sees MULDER wrestling with a CREATURE. She fires four shots. CREATURE runs off. SCULLY goes to MULDER. He is bleeding from the left shoulder. She stands over him, gun drawn.)

SCULLY: You okay?

(MULDER nods, weakly.)



SCENE 9

(Forest. Night. SCULLY is trying to start a fire with what appear to be just two rocks over a stack of sticks. MULDER is huddled up against a log.)

SCULLY: You were an Indian Guide. Help me out here.

MULDER: Indian Guide says maybe you should run to the store and get some matches.

SCULLY: I would, but I left my wallet in the car.

(SCULLY sits beside him and picks up her gun.)

MULDER: What are you doing.

SCULLY: Trying to open my gun. (Her clip pops out.) If I can separate the shell from the casing maybe I can get the powder to ignite.

MULDER: Oh. And maybe itll start raining weenies and marshmallows.

SCULLY: Do I detect a hint of negativity?

MULDER: No. Yes ... actually. Yeah.

SCULLY: Mulder, you need to keep warm. Your bodys still in shock.

MULDER: I was told once that the best way to regenerate body heat was to crawl naked into a sleeping bag with some body else whos already naked. (Snuggles closer.)

SCULLY: Well, maybe if it rains sleeping bags, youll get lucky.

(MULDER looks up at her.)

SCULLY: Have you thought seriously about dying?

MULDER: Yeah, once, when I was at the Ice Capades.

SCULLY: When I was fighting my cancer, I was angry at the injustice of it and its meaninglessness. And then I realized that that was the struggle  to give it meaning.
To make sense of it. Its like life.

MULDER: I think Nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or die. I mean, if youre lucky you get 75 years. If youre really lucky you get 80 years. And if youre extraordinarily lucky, you get to have 50 of those years with a decent head of hair.

SCULLY: (chuckle) I guess its like Las Vegas. The house always wins. (She breaks the bullet open.) Oh! Ta-da.

MULDER: Go, girl.

(SCULLY gets up and sprinkles gunpowder on the pile of wood.)

MULDER: Hey, who did you identify with when you were a kid? Wilma or Betty?

SCULLY: I identified with Bettys bustline.

MULDER: Yes! I did, too.

SCULLY: Could never have been married to Barney, though. The kids were cute.

MULDER: But where are they today?

(Gunpowder explodes in one bright flash, then is gone. The wood didnt catch. MULDER smiles. SCULLY turns to him.)

SCULLY: Moth Men? Really?

MULDER: (nods) Yeah. But there seem to be only two of them.

(SCULLY sits back down and tries to pull MULDER onto her lap.)

MULDER: I dont wanna wrestle.

SCULLY: (suppressing a laugh) Get over here. Im going to try and keep you warm. ( MULDER lies in her lap. She accidentally rubs his wounded shoulder. It hurts him.) Sorry.

MULDER: One of us has got to stay awake, Scully.

SCULLY: You sleep, Mulder.

MULDER: If you get tired, you wake me.

SCULLY: Im not going to get tired.

MULDER: Why dont you sing .. something.

SCULLY: No ... Mulder.

MULDER: Well, if you sing something, Ill know youre awake.

SCULLY: Mulder, you dont want me to sing. I cant carry a tune.

MULDER: It doesnt matter. Just sing anything.

(Loooong pause. SCULLY looks around.)

SCULLY: (slightly off key, no enthusiasm) Jeremiah was a bull frog ---

(MULDERS eyes pop open.)

SCULLY: ... was a good friend of mine. Never understood a single word he said...

(MULDER or *Duchovny?* pulls up knees to hide his face.)

SCULLY: ... but I helped him drink his wine.

(Pause.)

MULDER: Chorus.

SCULLY: Joy .... to the world. All the boys and girls. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me.

(Camera pans over to a tree where we see glowing red eyes.)



SCENE 10

(Forest. Morning. MULDER wakes alone.)

MULDER: Scully?!

SCULLY: (about 20 yards away, holds up her gun. She is eating.) Mmmm....over here.

MULDER: What are you doing?

SCULLY: Im looking for food. I found some wild berries.

MULDER: I wouldnt go far.

SCULLY: Mulder, you never left my sight. (SCULLY disappears.)

MULDER: Scully? (gets up and goes to where she was) Scully? Scully! Scully!?

SCULLY: (voice) Im down here.

MULDER: Where?

SCULLY: (voice) I fell down a hole. (howel)

(MULDER looks down at SCULLY who is getting up off the bottom of a 10 foot deep hole)

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: Yeah, I landed on soft dirt .. kind of.

MULDER: Whats down there?

SCULLY: I dont know. Its pretty dark. ( She bumps into one of many hanging bodies.) Oh!

MULDER: Scully, whats going on? Are you okay?

SCULLY: (Sees MICHELLE hanging.) I found Michelle.

MULDER: Is she alive?

SCULLY: (Checking MICHELLE) Not for much longer. Mulder, we have to get her out of here.

MULDER: Is there a way out?

SCULLY: I dont know. I .. Im in some kind of a chamber. Theres .. theres like some kind of network. (She sees CREATURE at one end of chamber.) Mulder...

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Im not alone. (Checks her back.) I dont have my weapon. Mulder!?

MULDER: Hold on, Im going to drop my gun down.

(MULDER drops gun, then hears rustling behind him.)

(SCULLY picks up MULDERS gun, then jumps as he falls into hole behind her.)

SCULLY: Jeez!! Mulder, are you okay?

MULDER: (Holding his shoulder, rolling on ground in pain.) Dont mind me.

(CREATURE begins moving toward them.)

MULDER: (rising) Scully!

(SCULLY fires three or four shots. They look at CREATURES body. Looks very human, but carved out of wood.)

SCULLY: Mulder, look. There has to be a scientific explanation for this.



SCENE 11

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are stacking dead bodies under the hole. A pole reads AD NOCTVM.)

MULDER: Too bad we dont have any office furniture.

SCULLY: If they could see us now.

MULDER: Go, team. 20 more bodies and well win the Honey-Baked Ham.

(SCULLY gives him a look.)

KINSLEY (MALE AGENT from car): (voice) Agent Mulder?1

MULDER: Were down here!

SCULLY: Were down here!

KINSLEY: Whatre you doing down there?

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MULDER: Weve got injured people down here.

SCULLY: We need a ladder.

KINSLEY: Right away.

(KINSLEY runs toward rescue team, STONECYPHER (FEMALE AGENT) stands next to hole.

STONECYPHER: Hey, over here!



SCENE 12

(Road next to forest. Ambulances. MICHELLE on gurney is loaded into ambulance. FATHER also on gurney is loaded into another ambulance. MOTHER kisses his hand.)

MOTHER: (to LOUIS) Hes going to be okay. Hes going to be fine. (Sees KINSLEY) Just a minute.

(MULDER stands by himself, shoulder bandaged. KINSLEY is surrounded by people. MOTHER shakes KINSLEYS hand, then leaves. KINSLEY goes to MULDER next to crosscut of tree.)

KINSLEY: Well, we just got all the thanks when you did all the work.

MULDER: No, on the contrary, Agent Kinsley, we would never have gotten involved in this if not for you.

KINSLEY: Really?

MULDER: (looking at a tab on the crosscut - 1521 Ponce De Leon Lands Looking for Fountain Of Youth ) Yeah, you see this?

KINSLEY: Oh, yeah. I pointed that out to Agent Stonecypher on the drive down.

MULDER: There was something in the cave that Scully fell into ; an inscription - Ad Noctum.

KINSLEY: Thats, uh 

MULDER: It means "into darkness". The Spanish Conquistadors used to carve it on the posts that they would lash the natives to as a warning.

KINSLEY: So whore you saying wrote this?

MULDER: Ponce De Leon came here 450 years ago looking for the Fountain Of Youth.

KINSLEY: You mean you think that these ... that - that - that- that body the one that Agent Scully shot? No -

MULDER: After 400 years in the woods dont you think they might have adapted perfectly to their environment?

KINSLEY: Youre just making this up.

MULDER: Why do you say that?

KINSLEY: (Laughs uncomfortably) Cause, you work on the X-Files, and you just want to write off your motel.

STONECYPHER: (coming up) Search and Rescue are still unable to find Jeff Glaser or the second predator that you reported.

MULDER: I wouldnt be surprised if they couldnt find either one of them.

STONECYPHER: Agent Mulder, Im confused. Why would they come after the boy in the house that night?

MULDER: These predators have been in these woods for a long, long time. They would have perceived any encroachment on their territory as an enemy, even a little kid like that.

STONECYPHER: But that would mean that theyd come after any one of us that had gone into the woods, wouldnt it?

MULDER: (nods, then looks around) Wheres Agent Scully?

STONECYPHER: Oh, she got a lift back to the motel to pack up both your things.

MULDER: She did? Excuse me. (Runs to KINSLEYS car and drives off.)

KINSLEY: My jackets in that car. (STONECYPHER looks at him.)



SCENE 13

(MULDERs motel room. SCULLY enters with her suitcase. She goes into bathroom and closet and begins packing up MULDERS things. These guys are really CLOSE to each other!!! Creepy music.)

(MULDER pulls up, gets out of car and bangs on SCULLYS door.)

MULDER: Scully!? Scully!!!??

(SCULLY leans out of MULDERS room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, whats going on?

MULDER: (Entering his room, getting his suitcase) Lets get out of here.

SCULLY: Kay.

MULDER: You pack everything?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER looks around the room, closes the door. We see red eyes under the bed.)

[THE END]
