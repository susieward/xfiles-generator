                                        POST-MODERN PROMETHEUS



SCENE 1

(A brightly covered comic book cover, The Great Mutato, opens to the black and white interior. The first caption on the neighborhood street scene is "Somewhere in the land, a monster lurked." The picture fades into an actual street. The episode is filmed in black and white.)

(Outside the BERKOWITZ house. 18 year old IZZY BERKOWITZ and a friend are looking under the hood of a very old car. BOOGER is in the drivers seat.)

IZZY: Youre flooding it, Booger.

(BOOGER grunts and does something that causes a cloud of smoke to burst from the engine into IZZYS face. IZZY coughs. SHAINEH BERKOWITZ, early middle aged, comes out onto her porch.)

SHAINEH: For Gods sake, Izzy!

(As SHAINEH comes down to the car, IZZY and his friend get into car.)

BOOGER: Here she comes. Lets go. Come on, man.

SHAINEH: (looking in car) You got to be kidding.

IZZY: What?

SHAINEH: Dont "what" me, Izzy, or you aint going to no comic book convention.

IZZY: Im 18. I go anywhere I want.

SHAINEH: Yeah, but where you going to live when you get back?

IZZY: (impatient) Mom, we got to get going.

SHAINEH: You drive careful, Booger. Hes the only son Ive got.

BOOGER: Okay, Mrs. B.

(Car drives away, belching exhaust. SHAINEH watches them go, shakes her head.)

(Later, inside the house we hear the TV - Jerry Springer Show. Camera begins panning through the house.)

JERRY SPRINGER: (voice on TV) I'm about to introduce you to a woman who three years ago was delivered the surprise of her life.

(We see someone walking quietly through the BEKOWITZ house.)

JERRY SPRINGER: After nine months of what seemed like a normal pregnancy, doctors delivered to Dolores a very special child. Already a mother of two beautiful children, Dolores held in her arms a boy with fur like a dog and a hairline like Eddie Munster. She's here with us today with her real live, but sleeping, wolf baby.

(SHAINEH is in bed raptly watching the TV. Jerry Springer is interviewing a woman holding a sleeping hairy child.)

JERRY SPRINGER: Hey, why not just give him a razor and some shaving cream? I mean, hes going to be shaving in a couple of years anyway.

(Circus tent like fabric begins rolling down outside covering the house.)

WOLF BOY MOTHER: Well, actually, he seems to be quite allergic to shaving cream. They seem to like him. They like to come up and touch his hair and tug on it a little.

JERRY SPRINGER: So they don't tease him?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: No. He's quite popular.

JERRY SPRINGER: Dandruff a problem?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: Mmm. No. I wash his hair twice a day and brush 100 strokes a night.

SHAINEH: I caint believe this.

JERRY SPRINGER: I think the question the audience really wants answered is, uh... what does the father look like?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: The father is completely bald.

JERRY SPRINGER: Completely bald?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: Completely.

JERRY SPRINGER: Were you a hairy kid?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: No. I was not.

JERRY SPRINGER: Seriously?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: Really.

JERRY SPRINGER: Come on. Fess up. We have pictures here. We happen to know that you had hair all over your face.

WOLF BOY MOTHER: I'm afraid that that cannot be true.

JERRY SPRINGER: I know this is a little delicate... but, uh, does he have any problem with fleas?

I mean, he's not a real wolf boy, is he?

WOLF BOY MOTHER: No. I'm very careful about that. I buy the right products for fleas and... He does get the occasional itchies but he's all right.

JERRY SPRINGER: You dont have fleas?

(Gas stove burner is turned on. Something that looks like a hockey puck is placed in a frying pan. It immediately begins to smoke. Music starts. Smoke begins to seep under SHAINEHS bedroom door.)

CHER: (singing) LONLINESS.

SHAINEH: Hello?! (mutes the TV)

IS THE CLOAK YOU WEAR 

SHAINEH: Whos there? (coughing and rubbing her chest.)

DEEP SHADE OF BLUE IS ALWAYS THERE
THE SUN AINT GONNA SHINE ANYMORE
THE MOON AINT GONNA RISE IN THE SKY
THE TEARS ARE ALWAYS CLOUDING YOUR EYES

(Bedroom door opens and SHAINEH gasps as the GREAT MUTATO peeps in the room. He has a lumpy head and two faces.)

WHEN YOURE WITHOUT LOVE .

(Exterior shot of house shows that it completely covered by a circus tent.)

SCENE 2

(Two lane road. MULDER and SCULLY in car, MULDER driving. SCULLY is reading a letter out loud.)

SCULLY: "Dear Special Agent Mulder: Im writing to you for help. Several years ago I had an experience I could not explain. I was lying in my bed when I felt a presence in the room. Though I was awake. I felt that something had taken control over my body. I dont remember much else but I woke up three days later pregnant with my son, Izzy. (MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.) That was 18 years ago, but now it happened again. I was in bed and could swear I heard Cher singing  The one who was married to Sonny. (Another look.) Then the room got all smoky, and I saw some kind of monster. He had a really gross face with lumps all over his head. I was too scared to scream. Then I got all groggy and conked out for three days. Guess what happened when I woke up? I got your name off the TV. Some lady on the Jerry Springer show who had a werewolf baby said you came to her house. (SCULLY looks at MULDER accusingly. He looks guilty.) Well, I got her story beat by a mile so maybe youll want to come see me, too. Sincerely, Shaineh Berkowitz."

MULDER: Scully, do you think its too soon to get my own 1-900 number?

(SCULLY rolls her eyes.)



SCENE 3

(BERKOWITZ kitchen. SHAINEH is pouring classes of Perk cola for MULDER and SCULLY who are sitting at the kitchen table.)

SHAINEH: So, did you actually see that werewolf baby or was that just a story?

MULDER: No. It had something called hypertrechosis lanuginosa. Its a rare hereditary condition most commonly found in some South American families.

SHAINEH: (not convinced) Uh huh. But it was all hairy and stuff?

SCULLY: Uh, Mrs. Berkowitz? You said that you also had a son?

SHAINEH: Mm hmm. Izzy. Thats him there.

(She points to a picture of IZZY posing with a pig. They look very similar.)

SCULLY: And Izzy is the product of your union with some kind of intruder?

SHAINEH: I dont know about no union, but I sure woke up in a condition.

SCULLY: Did you report this to the police?

SHAINEH: Of course I did.

SCULLY: Was there an investigation?

SHAINEH: Not really. Nobody here ever locks their doors, and it took me a month of two to figure it out  I mean, that I was pregnant.

SCULLY: And now youre pregnant again?

SHAINEH: Uh huh, but as I told Agent Mulder on the phone, thats what takes the cake.

MULDER: Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation two years ago.

SHAINEH: You cant plant a seed in a barren field. (She gets up and holds out a very clean frying pan.) They were cooking something on the range. Took me two days of scrubbing to clean the skillet. (SCULLY looks at the skillet, then at MULDER. SCULLY sets the skillet back down.) I dont know how many of them there were. I only saw the one, but they ate almost a whole damn jar of peanut butter. (Holds up a large empty jar of peanut butter.)

SCULLY: You were gone for three days, but nobody missed you?

SHAINEH: I know what youre thinking.

SCULLY: Do you drink, Mrs. Berkowitz?

SHAINEH: No. But Im not so sure my intruders, as you call them, didnt have a few. Somebody set a tumbler here and didnt use no coaster. (points to two ring shaped water marks on an old cabinet)

MULDER: (leaning down to examine the marks) Mmm.

SHAINEH: Thats a family heirloom, too.

SCULLY: Is there no chance that your son could have put it there?

SHAINEH: (snorts derisively) Izzys got more brains than that. Not much more, but he values his life. (indicates room at the end of the hall) That pigsty there is his room.

(SCULLY enters the bedroom and looks around.)

SHAINEH: You know what this thing is, dont you Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Why do you say that?

(SCULLY finds a GREAT MUTATO comic book.)

SHAINEH: 'Cause youre acting all quiet and stuff. And you know something youre not saying -- about alien abductions. They said on the Jerry Springer show youre, like, an expert.

MULDER: Well, I dont think this has anything to do with alien abductions. I dont even know if I believe in that stuff anymore.

SHAINEH: Oh, come on. Really?

SCULLY: Mrs. Berkowitz? You gave a description of the intruder. You said that he had a gross face and lumps on his head?

SHAINEH: And two mouths. I dont know if I mentioned that.

SCULLY: Funny. Sounds just like this. (MULDER comes to her side and looks at the comic book. SCULLY holds it up for SHAINEH.)

SHAINEH: Oh, that? (SCULLY give tight smile.) Thats the Great Mutato. (Proud.) Thats a comic book character my kid Izzy created.

(Door bangs shut as IZZY enters.)

IZZY: Whats going on?

SHAINEH: These are agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.

IZZY: The Federal Bureau of Investigation?

SCULLY: We were wondering how this suspect in your mothers case looks exactly like this?

MULDER: (Holds up comic book.) The Great Mutato

IZZY: Because I  Ive seen him, too.

SCULLY: Youve seen the Great Mutato?

IZZY: Yeah. A lot of people around here have.

SCULLY: Has it crossed neither of your minds that what you say you saw that night fits perfectly with this creature that your son created?

SHAINEH: (defensively) Well, yeah. But  that dont mean it didnt happen.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY and raises his eyebrows.)



SCENE 4

(Night. Outside in a clearing near a forest. IZZY unwraps a sandwich and leaves it on a stump.)

IZZY: Dont ask me why, but it works.

SCULLY: (to MULDER) Peanut butter sandwiches?

(MULDER, SCULLY, IZZY and his friends all begin walking back to the cars about 50 yards away. MULDER and SCULLY speak to each other quietly.)

MULDER: You think baloney would be more effective?

SCULLY: Why are you humoring them, Mulder?

MULDER: Im not humoring them, Scully. This is a very serious crime.

SCULLY: So is perjury. So is calling out FBI agents under false pretenses.

MULDER: For the purpose of what?

(IZZY stays close, hiding a tape recorder.)

SCULLY: Isnt it obvious? (MULDER shakes his head.) I think that what were seeing here is an example of the culture for whom daytime talk shows and tabloid headlines have - have become a reality against which they measure their lives  a culture so obsessed with the media and a chance for self-dramatization that theyll do anything in order to gain a spotlight.

MULDER: I am alarmed that you would reduce these people to a cultural stereotype. Not everybodys dream is to get on Jerry Springer.

SCULLY: Psychologists often speak of the denial of an unthinkable evil or a misplacement of shared fears. (MULDER leans against the hood of their car, SCULLY stands in front of him.) Anxieties taking the form of a hideous monster for whom the most horrific human attributes can be ascribed. What we cant possibly imagine ourselves capable of we can blame on the ogre, on the hunchback, on the lowly half-breed. (TD NOTE: Perfect opportunity for Cher's song, "Half-Breed", don'tcha think?!)

(They glance over at IZZY who is leaning against nearby car and clearing his throat.)

SCULLY: But common sense alone will tell you that these legends, these unverified rumors are ridiculous.

MULDER: But nonetheless, unverifiable, and therefore true in the sense that theyre believed to be true.

SCULLY: Is there anything that you dont believe in, Mulder?

(A distant moan.)

MULDER: Shh.

(Faintly, they hear moaning. SCULLY looks around in surprise.)

SCULLY: Whats that sound?

IZZY: Its the Great Mutato.

(Over at the stump, they see a figure pick up the sandwich. As they begin running toward it, the figure drops the sandwich and runs into the woods. MULDER passes the stump and follows the figure. SCULLY pauses and looks at the sandwich has had two bites taken out of it on different sides. A few minutes later she catches up with MULDER as do the boys.)

SCULLY: Whered it go?

MULDER: I dont know. I lost it.

(Lightening flashes.)

MULDER: There. Up there.

(SCULLY shines her flashlight onto top of nearby hill. They hear pig sounds.)

OLD MAN: Turn that damn thing off. (He has a pig on a leash.) Youre on my property.

MULDER: Were with the FBI.

OLD MAN: Theyre not.

IZZY: We were --

SCULLY: We were just chasing what they told us was a monster.

OLD MAN: Monster? Whatd I tell you boys? There aint no monster. Ill show you the monster youre looking for.



SCENE 5

(Newspaper - University of Indiana News Press - Professor Creates Own Monsters. There is a picture of DR. POLLIDORI. MULDER lowers the newspaper revealing POLLIDORI sitting in his lab. Classic Mad Scientist.)

POLLIDORI: Who sent you here?

MULDER: Your father.

POLLIDORI: My father is a simpleton farmer. He understands nothing of my scientific achievements .

SCULLY: What achievements are those?

POLLIDORI: What makes you think youd understand them any better?

SCULLY: Well, Im a scientist, for one.

POLLIDORI: Well, then you probably know that once in a generation, perhaps once in a lifetime, a truth is uncovered which thrusts mankind into a shocking new consciousness turning accepted notions of our very existence on their head. (MULDER and SCULLY follow him through lab.) Consider relativity, the double helix, and now the Homeotic Hox gene, for which I will undoubtedly have my place among the Columbuses of science as a visionary leader of men.

(GEEK LAB BOY stands waiting, holding a covered petri dish of flies.)

POLLIDORI: Yes?

GEEK LAB BOY: What do you want me to do with these, Dr. Pollidori?

(He opens the dish. The flies all fly away.)

GEEK LAB BOY: Never mind. (Sheepishly walks away.)

MULDER: What is the Homeotic Hox gene?

POLLIDORI: (sighs) Shes the scientist. Ask her.

SCULLY: (on the spot) I, uh  I believe it has something to do with, um  growth and development.

POLLIDORI: If you two will excuse me, I really dont have time for this. I have to travel tonight to the University of Ingolstadt to deliver an international address.

SCULLY: Sir, unless you want your scientific achievements to end up as a footnote on the Jerry Springer Show, I suggest that you make the time.

POLLIDORI: (pause, then with interest) Jerry Springer Show?

(They watch video of developing fruit fly. Periodic dramatic lightening flashes.)

POLLIDORI: Witness the morphogenesis of Drosophila  the fruit fly. What you are watching has been going on for millennia since the Cambrian period some 580 million short years ago when Drosophila was first born. Notice the elegant symmetry with which the pupae grows into a series of beautiful segments.

(MULDER and SCULLY slowly look at each other. POLLIDORI crosses to blackboard with diagram of a fly pupa.)

What we have found  what I have found  is that these segments represent a linear model for the genetic development of our friend, the fly. Each gene is responsible for the development of its corresponding segment: the legs, the mouth, the body, posterior and anterior. But which I, through my genius, can alter into a creation of my own. Behold  Proboscopedia.

MULDER: (looking at very strange image of a deformed fly) This fly has legs 

SCULLY: . Growing out of his mouth.

MULDER: Why would you do that?

POLLIDORI: Because I can.

(Lots of lightening flashes.)

MULDER: Could that be done in humans?

POLLIDORI: That would go against every scientific convention.

MULDER: But could it be done?

POLLIDORI: Theoretically.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY from a third story barred window watch POLLIDORI leave the "castle.")

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Good night, Dr. Frankenstein.

SCULLY: Despite what you might think, Mulder, designer mutations like these are virtually impossible in humans.

MULDER: Thats not what I just heard.

SCULLY: Mulder, even if they could, no scientist would even dare to perform this kind of experiment on a human.

MULDER: Well, then why do them at all?

SCULLY: To unlock the mysteries of genetics, to understand how it is that even though we share the same genes we develop arms instead of wings. We become humans instead of flies or monsters.

MULDER: But, given the power, who could resist the temptation to create life in his own image?

SCULLY: We already have that ability, Mulder. Its called "procreation." And first thing tomorrow morning, Im going to verify the pregnancy of Shaineh Berkowitz.

(MULDER nods.)



SCENE 6

(POLLIDORI house. The decorating is obviously done by someone who has too much time on her hands. Martha Stewart gone bad. ELIZABETH POLLIDORI is packing a suitcase with mens clothes.)

ELIZABETH: When are you coming home again?

POLLIDORI: (fixing his tie) Huh?

ELIZABETH: When are you coming home again?

POLLIDORI: What?

ELIZABETH: We were going to have that talk.

POLLIDORI: Soon, soon. Well have our talk soon.

ELIZABETH: Thats what you always say.

POLLIDORI: Elizabeth, you know how I feel about children. Theyre mewling little monsters.

ELIZABETH: But I want children.

POLLIDORI: What happened to our dream about getting out of this place - getting away from this hick town?

ELIZABETH: I think thats your dream.

POLLIDORI: Listen, what do you want -- a baby or a Nobel Prize? (She doesnt answer. He kisses her on forehead.) See you on Thursday.

(He leaves. ELIZABETH watches him drive away then lies down on bed and cries. Outside the window, circus tent material falls.)



SCENE 7

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up in front of JJs Country Diner. SCULLY goes to get a newspaper while MULDER goes into the diner. As MULDER walks through the full diner, everyone stares and smiles at him. Hysterically funny scene. He finds it a little strange, but seems to enjoy the attention. He sits down at the counter. A woman wiggles her eyebrows at him. He nods politely.)

(Outside, SCULLY reads the newspaper headline - FBI HUNTS HOMETOWN MONSTER -AGENT ADMITS STORIES: "BELIEVED TO BE TRUE." SCULLY is not pleased.)

(Inside, a very CHICKENLIKE WOMAN sits next to MULDER and begins writing notes. The WAITRESS approaches, carrying lots of plates.)

WAITRESS: Hot plates! Hot, hot, hot. (gushing over MULDER and setting plates in front of him) Biscuits, fritters, grits, flapjacks, eggs boiled, scrambled, poached, and fried. We got some monster grapefruits on the way. Bigger than your head, almost.

MULDER: I -Id just like some coffee, thanks.

WAITRESS: On the house. Compliments of J.J.

J.J.: (from the kitchen window) Thats with two Js.

(MULDER tries to see what the woman next to him is writing, but with a jerk of her neck, she shields her notes from him, and leaves.)

WAITRESS: (nose to nose with MULDER) Is it true that Jerry Springers coming to town?

(MULDER does not have time to answer. SCULLY enters with the newspaper and sits beside MULDER. The people in the diner pay her no attention.)

SCULLY: Weve been had. Ill save you the trouble of reading the article. It has everything we talked about last night word for word.



SCENE 8

(BERKOWITZ house. SHAINEH stands in kitchen door.)

SHAINEH: Izzy Berkowitz! Get your butt front and center!

IZZY: What did I do?

SHAINEH: All I can say is I hope the answer to that question is nothing.

(SCULLY pops her head around the doorway.)

SCULLY: We have reason to believe that you or one of your friends recorded our conversation last night and gave it to a newspaper reporter.

IZZY: Me?

SCULLY: In order to promote you comic book monster that you created.

(MULDER pops his head around doorway.)

MULDER: Do you own a tape recorder, Izzy?

IZZY: Um 

SHAINEH: Christmas nineteen ninety THREE!!

(IZZY reluctantly brings out tape recorder and hands to SHAINEH. MULDER takes it and presses "play.")

SCULLY: (recorded voice)  in the form of a hideous monster given the most horrific human attributes 

SHAINEH: (swatting IZZY) Thats for starters!

SCULLY: (recorded voice)  What we cant possibly imagine

(MULDER rewinds the tape then presses "play" again. The Cher song from the beginning plays again.)

SHAINEH: Hey! Hey thats it. Thats the song that was playing when I got knocked up.

(When Cher begins singing, they hear moaning and someone singing badly along with it.)

SCULLY: Who the hell is that?

MULDER: Thats the same voice we heard out in the woods last night.

IZZY: Thats him. The Great Mutato.



SCENE 9

(POLLIDORI house. Cher song playing loudly. House is filled with smoke. The Great Mutato sings along with Cher. He dances through the living room and up the stairs.)

CHER AND GREAT MUTATO:

THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE
THE MOON AIN'T GONNA RISE IN THE SKY
TEARS ARE ALWAYS CLOUDING YOUR EYES
THE SUN AIN'T GONNA SHINE ANYMORE
WHEN YOU'RE WITHOUT...
LOVE...



SCENE 10

(MULDER and SCULLY exiting the BERKOWITZ house. Neighbors are all out raking leaves watching them.)

SCULLY: Where are we going now?

MULDER: (holding tape) To messenger this to the Bureau. I want special audio to filter the tracks and then I want to go back to see the professor.

SCULLY: Mulder, this is just a dopey hoax.

MULDER: Something recorded its voice on this, Scully.

SCULLY: And you think that Dr. Pollidori has something to do with it?

MULDER: When Victor Frankenstein asks himself "Whence did the principle of life proceed?" and then as a gratifying summit to his toils creates a hideous phantasm of a man he prefigures the Postmodern Prometheus. The genetic engineer whose power to reanimate matter  genes into life  us  is only as limited as his imagination is.

SCULLY: Mulder, Im alarmed that you would reduce this man to a literary stereotype, a mad scientist.

MULDER: Who else would go to such trouble to impregnate Shaineh Berkowitz?

(MULDER goes to start car, SCULLY thinks for a moment, watches a neighbor watching her, then goes to the car.



SCENE 11

(MULDER and SCULLY driving. SCULLY is looking at a folder.)

SCULLY: I have to admit, Mulder. Everything looks in order. Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation in 1993 and two months ago she had two pregnancy tests both with positive results.

(MULDER stops the car, and then begins driving in reverse back the way they came.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: Mrs. Berkowitz said in her letter that when she saw her intruder there was a gaseous white cloud and then when she woke up three days later, nobody knew that shed been gone.

SCULLY: Yeah. So?

(MULDER stops the car. As MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car, the intro to another Cher song, "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves" begins. The POLLIDORI house which they have stopped next to is completely covered with a tent. MULDER and SCULLY run to the house.)

CHER:

I WAS BORN IN THE WAGON OF A TRAVELIN' SHOW
MY MAMA USED TO DANCE FOR THE MONEY THEY'D THROW
PAPA WOULD DO WHATEVER HE COULD
PREACH A LITTLE GOSPEL
SELL A COUPLE BOTTLES OF DOCTOR GOOD

(MULDER rips open a section of the tent at the front of the house while SCULLY [in 3 inch heels] runs around back.)

(MULDER enters the house, gun drawn. It is filled with smoke. He goes upstairs.)

GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES
WE'D HEAR IT FROM THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN
THEY CALLED US

GYPSIES, TRAMPS AND THIEVES
BUT EVERY NIGHT, ALL THE MEN WOULD COME AROUND
AND LAY THEIR MONEY DOWN...

(Music changes, more ominous. SCULLY has entered the house from the back, also with gun out. She makes her way upstairs. ELIZABETH POLLIDORI lies unconscious in bed, sheets pulled up to her neck. SCULLY hears coughing from the floor on the far side of the bed.)

SCULLY: (coughing) Come on  Get up! Move!

(Gasping and coughing, MULDER stands up from where he has fallen beside the bed.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(MULDER staggers towards her. Coughing, they take a few steps together, and collapse face to face a few inches apart. The OLD MAN, wearing an old fashioned gas mask enters the room and looks down at their unconscious bodies.)

OLD MAN: I told you there aint no monster.



SCENE 12

(POLLIDORI house. Days later. MULDER and SCULLY wake up coughing. They are greeted by POLLIDORI, police and the CHICKENLIKE WOMAN, who is a newspaper reporter.)

POLLIDORI: What are you doing in my house?

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY sit at the kitchen table, both look completely hung over and exhausted. SCULLY is holding a newspaper with headline "FBI Agents Whereabouts Unknown.")

ELIZABETH: (wrapped in blanket) He had this awful face with these hideous tumors, and  and not one mouth, but two.

POLLIDORI: Oh, my God.

MULDER: Dr. Pollidori. Is there something youd like to tell us?

POLLIDORI: Are you accusing me of knowing something that Im not telling you?

MULDER: Im accusing that your wife may have been impregnated.

(ELIZABETH looks up in delight.)

POLLIDORI: Impregnated? By whom?

MULDER: Oh, I think you know. (Stands up dramatically, but falls back against the stove rattling pans. Very funny.)

SCULLY: Sir, with all due respect I think that this is all part of a hoax.

POLLIDORI: A hoax?

SCULLY: A shameless publicity stunt.

MULDER: (holds a frying pan) Scully?

POLLIDORI: What  what is that?

MULDER: The other victims, they had their frying pans  violated. (Indicates residue on bottom of frying pan. SCULLY examines it.) Do you know what that is? (MULDER stumbles back against the garbage can.)

POLLIDORI: (pause) No, I dont.

(MULDER opens the garbage can and pulls out a large, empty container of peanut butter.)

MULDER: (dramatically) I think we found our smoking gun.

(SCULLY closes her eyes.)



SCENE 13

(Farm of the OLD MAN. The GREAT MUTATO is watching the movie "Mask" on a small television in a storm cellar. It is a reunion scene between the badly deformed young man and his mother, played by Cher.)

MASK BOY: Hey, Mom. You look great.

CHER: You look great.

MASK BOY: Mom, I have some great news.

CHER: Me, too.

MASK BOY: You first.

CHER: I quit. Im clean as a whistle.

MASK BOY: All right, Ma 

(OLD MAN enters the cellar with a peanut butter sandwich.)

OLD MAN: I brought you your favorite. You finish your movie but dont stay up too late, okay, son?

(OLD MAN leaves.)

MASK BOY: Well, thats a start.

CHER: Well, what about your news?

MASK BOY: Oh, its no big deal. I met a girl. Were going out.

CHER: Come on. Tell us.

MASK BOY: Well, her name is Diana .

CHER: Yeah?

MASK BOY: And shes beautiful. Shes got long blond hair. (A friend whistles.) She rides horses and shes beautiful and shes smart and she loves me.

CHER: Whats not to love, baby?



SCENE 14

(OLD MAN enters his kitchen. Sitting at the table, he looks through a photo album filled with pictures of himself and his son, the Great Mutato as a child.. POLLIDORI enters, angry.)

POLLIDORI: Tell me it isnt true. You didnt. You wouldnt. Why?

OLD MAN: Because I can.

(POLLIDORI attacks OLD MAN)

( Grunting as we see the shadows of the two men struggling, POLLIDORI strangling the OLD MAN.)



SCENE 15

(J.J.S diner. MULDER enters. Everyone is hostile. MULDER defensive and over it. Exact opposite of earlier scene. LARGE MAN sticks his leg out as if to trip MULDER.)

LARGE MAN: (sarcastically) Excuse me.

MULDER: (also sarcastic) Not a problem.

( Another hostile diner flips a spoonful of grits? at MULDER which lands on the back of his neck. MULDER reacts with disgust. He sits down and wipes the offending matter away. In the kitchen, J.J. spits loudly onto a plate of barely cooked eggs and hands it to the WAITRESS. The WAITRESS puts it down in front of MULDER.)

MULDER: (looking at disgusting eggs) Whats this?

WAITRESS: (saccharine) Compliments of J.J. Coffee?

MULDER: (looking away) Sure.

(WAITRESS spills hot coffee in MULDERS lap. He jumps up, brushing off his crotch.)

MULDER: Whoa! Thats not a place you want to burn a guy.

(WAITRESS flounces away. MULDER looks as newspaper headline : "FBI Agents Say Monster A Hoax.")

(Commotion outside. Lots of people running past the diner. MULDER follows them to where there is a large gathering outside the post office.)

POSTAL MAN: You want to see your monster?

CROWD: Yeah!

POSTAL MAN: You really want to see your monster?

CROWD: Yeah!

POSTAL MAN: Heres your monster.

(PM drags IZZY outside. IZZY is wearing a very bad rubber imitation head with two faces. Crowd gasps.)

POSTAL MAN: His name is Izzy Berkowitz! (Pulls fake head off.)

CROWD: No! String him up!

SHAINEH: (advancing on POSTAL MAN and her son) Get your filthy hands off him! You let him go!

POSTAL MAN: I intercepted a package.

SHAINEH: How would you like your face to intercept my fist, coconut head?

CROWD MAN: Your kids a monster!

CROWD: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

SHAINEH: That is my son youre talking about!

(SCULLY joins MULDER at the back of the crowd. SHAINEH can be heard in background still defending IZZY.)

SCULLY: Mulder . You may have been right. That these people can be reduced to cultural stereotypes?

MULDER: They unmasked the monster.

SCULLY: I may have found something that says otherwise. The residue in the frying pan was an agricultural product used to anesthetize herds of animals.

MULDER: Used by who?

SCULLY: Farmers  who have to register with the FDA even to have it in their possession.

MULDER: Is there someone registered locally?

SCULLY: Mm - hmm.



SCENE 16

(Sad music. OLD MANS kitchen. GREAT MUTATO enters and finds the OLD MAN lying dead on the floor. He begins to cry. He carries his father to the barn which is filled with animals who watch him avidly as the crying monster buries the OLD MAN in the dirt floor of the barn.)



SCENE 17

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up to the farm. They enter the barn. Again, animals are very visible. MULDER finds a hockey puck shaped object wrapped in white paper.)

SCULLY: (has found the disturbed earth over the grave) Mulder.

(MULDER holds up the hockey puck thing, then comes over to look at the grave.)

MULDER: We may be too late. I think we are. (Hears a noise overhead. He and SCULLY both draw guns.) Whos that? Show yourself!

(A pigeon flies out of the hay loft.)

SCULLY: If youre armed, drop your weapon and walk out slowly!

(Door to loft opens slowly. It is the CHICKEN LIKE REPORTER WOMAN.)

CHICKENLIKE WOMAN: Please dont  dont kill me.

MULDER: Who are you?

CHICKENLIKE WOMAN: Im with the newspaper.

MULDER: Whats your business here?

CHICKENLIKE WOMAN: The old man was murdered.

SCULLY: By whom?

CUT TO:
(Inside the house. Looking at the photo album.)

MULDER: Its alive.

CHICKENLIKE WOMAN: Ive seen it  in the barn, burying the old man

(Outside, mob of townspeople shout angrily. MULDER and SCULLY and CLRW go to doorway where they see a crowd of people led by POLLIDORI carrying torches approaching the farm.)



SCENE 18

(Continued from last scene.)

(MULDER and SCULLY come out to face the crowd.)

MULDER: Whatever you have in mind, Im going to have to ask you to stop right there.

POLLIDORI: We have come for the murderer.

CROWD: Yeah!

SCULLY: What makes you think hes here?

POLLIDORI: Ive seen him with my own eyes. He is not a man. He is a monster!

CROWD: Yeah!

POLLIDORI: The fiend must be found, and then well let justice take its course!

CROWD: Yeah!

POLLIDORI: Well search every crevice, every ravine. You get him alive if you can, but you get him!

CROWD: Yeah! Kill him! (etc)

(The crowd runs toward the barn. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other as if to say, "Now what?" CHICKEN LIKE REPORTER WOMAN follows the crowd into the barn. Animals are upset at the invasion and the fire from the torches.)

(Outside the barn)

SCULLY: Theres only one way Pollidori could have seen that monster  If he was out here himself.

(SCULLY sees the GREAT MUTATO fearfully peeking out from the door of his storm cellar.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(Guns and flashlights out, MULDER and SCULLY enter the cellar.)

SCULLY: Federal agents, and were armed! Come on out!

MULDER: Hey, Scully. Look at this.

(MULDER shines his light on wall covered with Cher memorabilia.)

SCULLY: Oh...

(Hearing a noise, they turn to see the GREAT MUTATO hiding in a corner)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

MULDER: Youre going to have to come out of there.

SCULLY: Were not going to hurt you. (to MULDER) Do you think he understands?

MULDER: I hope not.

SCULLY: He looks frightened.

MULDER: Were going to have to get him out of here, Scully. Theyre going to kill him.

CUT TO:
(Outside, the barn has finally caught fire from one of the torches.)

CROWD MAN: The barns on fire!

CROWD: Fire! Fire!

(There is a panicked exodus from the barn. The animals also escape. Barn burns spectactularly. MULDER and SCULLY emerge from the storm cellar with the GREAT MUTATO.)

CHICKENLIKE REPORTER WOMAN: (seeing GREAT MUTATO) There it is!

(MULDER, SCULLY, and GREAT MUTATO go back into storm cellar as crowd moves toward them. Inside the cellar they back away from the threatening crowd, MULDER and SCULLY standing protectively in front of the GREAT MUTATO. Other crowd members outside break the windows. MULDER and SCULLY are surrounded.)

POLLIDORI: Let him go.

SHAINEH: Where is he?

POLLIDORI: You let him go or well burn him out.

SHAINEH: Where is he? Show the world your horrid, lumpy face!

CROWD: Yeah!

(GREAT MUTATO shows himself, still standing behind MULDER and SCULLY.)

ELIZABETH: Thats him.

SHAINEH: Ugh.

POLLIDORI: That repulsive physiognomy is the vilest perversion of science.

MULDER: Created by whom?

POLLIDORI: A pale student of my most hallowed arts whose life was taken by that which he gave life. By his own horrible creation. By that monstrosity that you see before you.

SHAINEH: Whos he taking about?

POLLIDORI: My father.

GREAT MUTATO: No.

SHAINEH: He can talk.

POLLIDORI: Your ears deceive you. Its a trick.

GREAT MUTATO: Im sorry. My voice is damaged by the gaseous chemicals, but I would like to explain myself. Despite my appearance which you see is quite horrible to the human senses, I  have never acted to harm another soul.

POLLIDORI: These are fiendish lies!

MULDER: Quiet.

GREAT MUTATO: 25 years ago, my father, having only one son, a spiteful, hateful man of science incapable of the deeper sentiments. He came to realize that this son had been conducting secret experiments of which I was the most unfortunate product.

(Crowd gasps. POLLIDORI looks uncomfortable.)

GREAT MUTATO: A simple man, he rescued me and loved me in spite of my deformities. But, as time passed, I grew restless for friends of my own. Because I couldnt go to school or play sports or or even show my face outside this farm, my father set out to learn his sons science so that before he died, he might create for me a mate.

SHAINEH: Uh oh.

GREAT MUTATO: Alas, my father was a simple man. His heart close to the soil he worked, the animals he tended.

(Sound of horse neighing. SCULLY and MULDER look up to where a horse is looking in through a broken window. A young man with a long ponytail also looks up.)

GREAT MUTATO: The experiments he attempted too advanced for his understanding. The results of his experiments  unsatisfactory.

(A chicken in another window clucks. CHICKEN LIKE REPORTER WOMAN looks up.
Goat bleats in another window. Young man with a goatee looks up.)

SHAINEH: I still  you mean, Izzy  but whos the father?

(Pig grunts in another window. SHAINEH and IZZY both look up.)

GREAT MUTATO: Suffice to say his experiments failed and  my father is dead. I am alone  and miserable but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me. If this being you can create, then I will take blame as a murderer.

POLLIDORI: I dont know how to re-create you. You were a mistake.

GREAT MUTATO: What we did was wrong, but in our trespasses we gave you a loving son and in your homes I went places Id never dreamed of. With your books, and your records and home media centers, I learned of the world and of a mothers love that Ill never know. Cher loved that boy so much.

IZZY: Hey  hes no monster.

GREAT MUTATO: Arrest me then, as you will.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other, clearly confused, then at the crowd.)



SCENE 19

(POLLIDORI is taken away in a police car. Light from the barn fire reflects off the windows. The GREAT MUTATO sits in the backseat of MULDER and SCULLYS car. Inside, MULDER is looking through the photo album.)

SCULLY: We should go, Mulder. The prisoners in the car.

MULDER: (shaking his head) This is all wrong, Scully. This is not how the story is supposed to end.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Dr. Frankenstein pays for his evil ambitions, yes. But the monsters supposed to escape to go search for his bride.

SCULLY: Theres not going to be any bride, Mulder. Not in this story.

MULDER: Well, wheres the writer? (IZZY enters) I want to speak to the writer.



SCENE 20

(Music begins. Line of cars driving down rural two lane road.)

CHER:

PUT ON MY BLUE SUEDE SHOES
AND I BOARDED THE PLANE
TOUCHED DOWN IN THE LAND OF THE DELTA BLUES
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POURING RAIN
W.C. HANDY WON'T YOU LOOK DOWN OVER ME?

(Interior of MULDER and SCULLYS car. The GREAT MUTATO is in back seat tapping his foot and hand in time to the music.)

YEAH, I GOT A FIRST-CLASS TICKET
BUT IM AS BLUE AS A GIRL CAN BE
WHEN IM WALKING IN MEMPHIS
IM WALKING WITH MY FEET TEN FEET OFF OF BEALE

(VERY STYLIZED: MULDER looks at SCULLY, then forward. SCULLY looks at MULDER, then back at the GREAT MUTATO, then forward.)

WALKING IN MEMPHIS
BUT DO I REALLY FEEL THE WAY I FEEL?

CUT TO:
(Interior of nightclub. CHER is performing the song. We never see her face.)

SAW THE GHOST OF ELVIS
ON UNION AVENUE
FOLLOWED HIM UP TO THE GATES OF GRACELAND
AND WATCHED HIM WALK RIGHT THROUGH

NOW SECURITY THERE DID NOT SEE HIM
THEY JUST HOVERED AROUND HIS TOMB
THERE'S A PRETTY LITTLE THING WAITING FOR THE KING
DOWN IN THE JUNGLE ROOM

(The GREAT MUTATO is sitting at a table right in front of the stage with MULDER and SCULLY. The GREAT MUTATO dances energetically in his seat.)

WHEN I WAS WALKING IN MEMPHIS
I WAS WALKING WITH MY FEET TEN FEET OFF OF BEALE
WALKING IN MEMPHIS

(MULDER gives high five to the GREAT MUTATO, then MULDER and SCULLY smile at each other.)

BUT DO I REALLY FEEL THE WAY I FEEL?

CUT TO:
(Shot of TV. Future. Jerry Springer is interviewing SHAINEH and ELIZABETH who are each holding a deformed twofaced baby.)

JERRY SPRINGER: Tell me something, is it  is it hard to love these babies?

SHAINEH: Whats not to love?

(Jerry Springer audience gives a standing ovation.)

CUT TO:

CHER:

WHEN I WAS WALKING IN MEMPHIS
(WALKING IN MEMPHIS)

(CHER comes to the GREAT MUTATO and pulls him to his feet and leads him to dance floor. The GREAT MUTATO follows her in awe. MULDER, smiling, rises and helps push him forward. SCULLY beams.)

I WAS WALKING WITH MY FEET TEN FEET OFF OF BEALE
WALKING IN MEMPHIS
(WALKING IN MEMPHIS)

(In a very Elvis like move, MULDER, still standing, turns and holds his hand out to SCULLY. She is surprised, but takes his hand and lets him pull her into his arms. They look straight into each others eyes, smiling.)

BUT DO I REALLY FEEL THE WAY I FEEL?

(During piano interlude, MULDER and SCULLY dance closely, watching each other intently, then turn their heads to watch the GREAT MUTATO and CHER. They smile, still dancing slower now. Live frame slows and becomes a comic book drawing of MULDER and SCULLY, smiling, then hand closes page of comic book, now in color. )

PUT ON MY BLUE SUEDE SHOES...

[THE END]

                               CHRISTMAS CAROL


SCENE 1

US NAVAL STATION
SAN DIEGO, CA
DECEMBER 21

BILL SCULLY'S HOUSE

(A hand reaches to a manger scene and adjusts the baby Jesus. The hand pulls back and caresses her baby in her body. It is Bill's wife, Tara, very pregnant. She takes a Christmas card from a table and puts it on another table. We hear Scully in the distance.)

SCULLY: Hello? Merry Christmas!

TARA: Hello! (She smiles and goes to greet Scully and Mrs. Scully at the door.)

MARGARET: Oh, my God. Look at you. (She hugs Tara)

TARA: Can you believe it?

MARGARET: How am I going to get my arms around you? (Bill is behind Scully with suitcases. Mrs. Scully walks into the living room.)

SCULLY: You're huge. (They hug.)

TARA: Oh, I know. Welcome. Welcome. (Kisses Bill.) Oh, hi, Sweetie.

BILL: Let's get you two settled. Sorry about the digs, Mom. I know you hoped like hell you didn't have to spend another night in base housing. (Scully walks into the living room.)

MARGARET: Are you kidding? This is wonderful.

SCULLY: This is the exact same layout as our old house.

BILL: That's the Navy for ya.

TARA: Yeah. Bill tells me, Mom, that you'll be staying in your old room. And the nursery is going to be in Dana and Melissa's room.

BILL: That's right. (He struggles with the suitcases up the stairs.)

TARA: I got it. Bill! (She takes a suitcase from him)

BILL: Thanks. (He goes upstairs. Tara behind him. Margaret looks at the tree. Scully joins her.

SCULLY: Mom? You okay?

MARGARET: oh, yeah. I was just thinking about your Dad... and Melissa... and how much I miss them. (She walks past Scully to the stairs. Scully is about to follow her when the phone rings. She looks upstairs.)

SCULLY: Bill? (No answer, the phone rings again. She answers it.) Scully residence...

WOMAN: Dana? (Pause, it sounds like Melissa)

SCULLY: Yes, sorry, who is this?

WOMAN: Dana... she needs your help. She needs you, Dana. Go to her.

SCULLY: Who... who is this? (She hangs up. Dana hangs up and calls a number.)

MAN ON PHONE: FBI, San Diego.

SCULLY: This is Special Agent, Dana Scully. My badge number is 2317616. Can you transfer me to your sound agent, please? I would like to trace the last number that was dialed into this phone.



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
SIM'S HOUSE

(They have a pleasant home. There are people mingling and an ambulance parked outside. Bill and Dana drive up. Scully shows her badge to a cop and walks into the house. A photographer is taking pictures of a phone off the hook. Scully walks upstairs. She walks past the photographer to the bathroom where there are policemen)

KRESGE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you?

SCULLY: Scully, FBI. Can you tell me what's going on here?

KRESGE: Well, no offense, Scully, FBI, but what's it to you?

SCULLY: I received a phone call from this address. It was a woman's voice. She said that somebody here needed help.

KRESGE: When was this?

SCULLY: About 20 minutes ago.

KRESGE: I've been here 30 minutes. Guarantee you no one's called out to you or anyone else. Phone's off the hook. (Scully is confused. She looks to the bathroom.)

SCULLY: Please, can you tell me what happened here?

(Kresge brings her into the bathroom. A photographer is taking pictures of the crime scene. Kresge allows Scully to pass to the body. A woman in a bathtub. Wrists slashed, blood pooled on the floor and in the tub)

KRESGE: This is Mrs. Roberta Sim. Age 40. Suicide. She's been dead at least three hours. If you got a call from her, she must have dialed 1-800-the great beyond.



SCENE 3
OUTSIDE

(Scully leaves the house. There is still a lot of activity. Scully walks to Bill on the porch.)

BILL: Dana, what's going on? They're joking that you got a call from a dead woman.

SCULLY: I thought it was a dead woman, just not the one in there.

BILL: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: I know it's not possible, Bill, but it sounded just like her.

BILL: Who?

SCULLY: Our sister... Melissa.



SCENE 4
INSIDE HOUSE

(A latexed gloved hand puts the phone back on its cradle and walks by Scully, who walks further into the house. There is a man holding a little girl in the kitchen. Scully stops and looks at them. Kresge come up to her.)

KRESGE: I don't know what to tell you. Pac Bell confirms that a call came in from this address to your brother's house, but from this end, they show no outgoing call. Plus they confirm that the phone here had been off the hook for the last three hours.

SCULLY: What was their explanation?

KRESGE: Records mix-up, software glitch. It was obviously some kind of mistake. Anyway, I've got to wrap this up. Talk with the husband. Listen, weird phone calls aside, this is looking pretty straightforward. A lot of people check themselves out around Christmas time.

(Kresge goes into the kitchen. Mr. Sim puts the little girl on a stool.)

MR. SIM: Why don't you sit here?

KRESGE (to girl): Hi.

EMILY: Hi.

MR. SIM: Can we get some privacy here? (He looks at Scully. Kresge shuts the kitchen door.)



SCENE 5
BILL SCULLY'S

(The family is sitting having dinner. There is small talk around the table.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. (She gets up and goes to the hallway. She dials the phone.)



SCENE 6
MULDER'S APARTMENT

(Mulder comes into the apartment as the phone is ringing. He is wearing the most ridiculous hat)

MULDER: Hello? (No answer) Hello? (Scully doesn't say anything.) Hello? (Scully hangs up)



SCENE 7
BILL'S HOUSE

(Scully comes back to the table and sits down.)

BILL: Everything okay? (He hands her the rolls.)

TARA: Oh! (They all look at her.)

BILL: Is he kicking?

TARA: Oh, he's kicking, kickboxing! Well, you had both boys and girls, so which ones kicked more?

MARGARET: Oh, I had some pretty tough little girls.

TARA: You know what? I can't believe I'm going to say this. As big and fat as I am right now, I can't wait to have more. This is our baby, our son. It kind of gives everything new meaning. I can't help but think that life before now was somehow... less. Just a prelude. (Scully is devastated during this monologue.)



SCENE 8
KITCHEN

(Scully and her mother are washing dishes.)

MARGARET: What's the matter?

SCULLY: Nothing. Mom, I'm very happy for Bill and Tara.

MARGARET: You don't seem to be.

SCULLY: Oh, Mom. Several months ago, I learned that as a result of my abduction, of what they did to me, that I can not conceive a child. (Margaret is sorry and hugs Dana)

MARGARET: I'm so sorry.

SCULLY: It's okay. I just never realized how much I wanted it until I couldn't have it.



SCENE 9
NURSERY

(In Dana and Melissa's old room (The layout was like their house growing up) Scully is trying to sleep. She turns over in bed and the camera pans to the door. The door opens and young Dana and young Bill run in.)

YOUNG BILL: Dana, where is it? Where is that rabbit?

YOUNG DANA: I'm not telling.

YOUNG BILL: I'm going to find that rabbit and cook it. I'm going to turn it into stew.

YOUNG DANA: No you're not!

YOUNG BILL: Rabbit stew, here I go.

YOUNG DANA: You're not going to find him! (Young Bill leaves)



SCENE 10
BASEMENT

(Young Dana creeps down the stairs, through the mess of the unfinished basement, to the corner where she takes out an old lunch box. She opens it. The dead rabbit is inside. Maggots have taken over. Dana's eyes go wide. She slams the lunch box cover and moves away from it. She sees Emily sitting on the stairs. The phone rings.)



SCENE 11
NURSERY

(Dana wakes up and answers her cell phone.)

WOMAN: She needs your help.

SCULLY: Who is this? Why are you doing this?

WOMAN: Go to her. (Click)



SCENE 12
SIM'S RESIDENCE
2:54 AM

(Scully walks up to the front door and rings the door bell. A light comes on and Mr. Sims opens the door. He's still dressed in a suit and tie.)

SCULLY: Mr. Sim, my name is Dana Scully. I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.

MR. SIM: What do you want?

SCULLY: I received a phone call less than an hour ago. I was addressed by name and told that I needed to help someone... a woman. I traced the call and it came from your house.

MR. SIM: I have no Earthly idea what you're talking about.

SCULLY: This is the second time this has happened, and I'd really like to get to the bottom of it.

SIM: You were here earlier.

SCULLY: Yes.

SIM: Yes, a detective told me, something about a screw up with the phones. I'm in the middle of a meeting. (Scully looks into the house. There are two suited men in the house.) No one's called you from here. Not earlier today and certainly not tonight. You can imagine how bad a day this has been for my daughter and myself.

SCULLY: I understand.

SIM: Well, if you understand, then you'll stop coming around upsetting me with this... nonsense. Please. (He shuts the door and shuts off the light. Scully goes back to the car and drives off.)



SCENE 13
POLICE STATION

(Scully is waiting when Kresge comes)

KRESGE: Scully, FBI. What can I do for you at this ungodly hour?

SCULLY: I'd like everything you have on the Roberta Sim case.

KRESGE: The Roberta Sim case? (She nods.) There is no Roberta Sim case. It was a simple suicide. We sort of went through this before, you and I didn't we?

SCULLY: Whatever you call it, I'd appreciate seeing everything that you have. (Pause) In the spirit of the season?

LATER

(A box of materials is placed on a desk. Scully goes through it. She looks at a picture of Roberta's slashed wrist. A police report.)

KRESGE: So, what are you looking for? Can you even tell me?

SCULLY: It says here that your precinct visited the Sims before. Two weeks ago. A domestic disturbance call?

KRESGE: We sent a unit cause the neighbors were complaining. They were screaming at each other. It wasn't a happy household. Happy people don't kill themselves. (Scully keeps reading the report)

SCULLY: They ran a tox screen?

KRESGE: Yeah, it's just procedure.

SCULLY: It says they turned up high levels of doritriptan.

KRESGE: Some kind of new migraine medicine. Apparently, you take enough of it, you're wearing a cloud for a hat. I figure she anesthetized herself and then... (makes a slashing sound) We found a bunch of empty sample packets in the bathroom trash. A couple more in her purse. (Scully takes her purse out of the evidence box and goes through it. She sees the packets. She takes out a picture of the little girl, Emily, posing with a birthday cake.)

SCULLY: I'd like to borrow this. (Kresge nods okay.)



SCENE 14
BILL SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Scully enters the darkened house. She goes to the bookshelves and pulls out two photo album books. She sits on the couch with them and goes through the first. In the photo album are pictures of the Scully siblings as babies. She gets to a photo of Melissa in Nagoya Farmer's Market, Japan - 1966. Scully pauses on the page. She takes the photograph from the evidence box of Emily Sim. Melissa as a little girl and Emily are identical.)



SCENE 15
NEXT MORNING

(Scully is typing on her laptop. She's on the Internet looking up a Record of Live Births. She types in Sim, Emily and searches. Emily's birth records are sealed.)

SCULLY: She's adopted. (Scully sighs and makes a cell phone call.) Danny, it's me, Dana... Yeah, Merry Christmas to you, too... I, ah, I'm wondering if you can do me a favor... I need the complete case files on my sister, Melissa Scully. Yeah, crime scene and autopsy along with the PCR's that we ran. Right, but I need you to send them to the San Diego field office. As soon as possible. Ok. Thanks, Danny.

(Scully hangs up, takes off her glasses and rubs her eyes. She sets her glasses down. A beam of light reflects on the lenses. The screen turns white and a cross forms. We pan down and we see a little red headed girl holding the hand of a man walking in front of the cross. She walks up the aisle of a church full of people in the pews. There is a casket at the end of the aisle. They walk toward the casket. There is bloody water dripping from the casket onto a ceramic tiled floor like the Sim's floor of their bathroom. They walk closer to the casket. The little girl (Dana) walks up the three steps to the casket and looks inside. It is Roberta Sim. Under water with flower buds floating on the surface. Roberta's eyes open. The little girl jumps back and down the steps. She looks up at the man. It's Mr. Sim.)

MAN'S VOICE: Dana? (Present time, Dana jerks up from her sleep, head on the desk.)

SCULLY: What? (Scully looks behind her and sees Bill)

BILL: This is where you stayed the night?

SCULLY: Some of it. (She closes the cover of the laptop.)

BILL: It's supposed to be a vacation. What are you working on that could be so important?

SCULLY: Just some unfinished business.

BILL: So, are you up to joining us?

SCULLY: I've got a little work to do. Can I join you guys later?

BILL: How are you going to get around?

SCULLY: I'll... I'll rent a car.

BILL: Well, all right. Lunch. We'll hold you to that. (Scully smiles and he leaves. A little later, she does too with her laptop and briefcase.)



SCENE 16
POLICE DEPARTMENT

(Scully walks among the desks in the busy office. She walks into the Detective's office. He is at his desk. He looks up and sees Scully.)

KRESGE: Agent Scully, it's been... what? 4 hours? I was getting worried.

SCULLY: I'd like to order an autopsy on Roberta Sim. There's a possibility she was murdered.

KRESGE: What? You got another phone call?

SCULLY: I think that it may have been the husband.

KRESGE: Where did you get that idea? You want coffee?

SCULLY: No. Thanks.

KRESGE: He's got an ironclad alibi. Mr. Sim was at the doctor's office with his daughter. He was there all morning. I checked.

SCULLY: I took another look at the police photos this morning. There were no hesitation cuts on Roberta Sim's wrists. Suicide victims seldom make the fatal cut the first time.

KRESGE: Seldom but not always. Is that all you got?

SCULLY: No. Why was the phone off the hook when you got to the Sim's house?

KRESGE: The wife took it off. I'm guessing she didn't want to be interrupted.

SCULLY: Your report says the husband called the police after he discovered his wife dead.

KRESGE: Yeah.

SCULLY: But if the phone was off the hook when you arrived, how did he call you? Did he find the phone off the hook, call you, then have the presence of mind to return it to the way that he'd found it? Does that make sense to you?

KRESGE: What are you suggesting?

SCULLY: I am suggesting that there are questions that beg for further investigation. Order an autopsy.



SCENE 17
AUTOPSY ROOM - HOSPITAL

(Scully is over a bowl of internal organs, talking to an off screen medical examiner.)

SCULLY: Stomach contents appear to include coffee, whole wheat toast and cantaloupe. No medicine tablets. Empty sample packets of doritriptan succina were found but I find no evidence that any of the pills were ingested.

MEDICAL EXAMINER: Well, obviously they were, doritriptan showed up on her tox screen.

SCULLY: Then why didn't it show up in her stomach?

MEDICAL EXAMINER: It was absorbed into her bloodstream.

SCULLY: No. I don't believe absorption would be that complete, not that close to her death.

MEDICAL EXAMINER: Then how did the doritriptan get into her blood stream, Ms. Scully?



SCENE 18
POLICE STATION

(Cut right to Kresge's reaction to Scully)

KRESGE: A needle puncture.

SCULLY: On the heel of her right foot. Extremely tiny and easy to miss. It was meant to be overlooked. (The medical examiner is also there.) I believe that this woman was injected, anesthetized so he wouldn't fight back. Then her suicide was staged.

KRESGE (To medical examiner): What do you think?

MEDICAL EXAMINER: It's a possibility. Then again, it's possible this woman simply stepped on a tack and the rest is blue sky conjecture.

SCULLY: I say it justifies opening a murder investigation.



SCENE 19
SIM HOUSE

(Mr. Sim walks into his living room as men in policemen are going through everything. He sees Scully and Kresge.)

SIM: This is your doing, isn't it? You didn't have the decency to leave me and my daughter alone?

KRESGE: Mr. Sim, please. Now, you're going to want to calm down and let us do our business, ok?

SCULLY: Mr. Sim, where is your daughter now?

SIM: Why? (Scully just glares at him) She's at a friend's house. Thank God she's not here to see this. (A female cop comes up)

FEMALE COP: Detective, this was in the trash out back. (She hands a syringe in a bag to Scully. She takes out a latex glove and puts it on.)

KRESGE: You got an explanation for this?

SIM: Yes. My daughter has a severe form of anemia. She requires daily injections.

SCULLY: We'll check that out. (Scully and the female cop walk away.) I want you to analyze this. Get a PCR on the blood. We need to identify whose it is. (The female cop takes it and leaves. Scully turns back to them. She sees out the window two men sitting in a car looking at the house. They drive away.)



SCENE 20
BILL SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Dark. Scully walks in and turns the light on in the dining room. There's a manilla envelope on the table. She opens it and sits down. She takes the PCR screen of Melissa out of the report and matches it to Emily's PCR results from the lab. Scully is on the verge of crying when she sees they match.)

MRS. SCULLY: Dana? Are you alright? It's two o'clock in the morning. Where have you been all day? We were expecting you at lunch.

SCULLY: Mom... sit down. (She does) The woman who committed suicide has an adopted daughter, a three year old named Emily. I got a sample of Emily's blood and I had the lab run a test on her DNA. It's called a PCR test. This... (she hands her one of the screens) is Emily's. (She hands over the other one.) And this, is Melissa's which we ran during her murder investigation. They match.

MRS. SCULLY: What does it mean, they match?

SCULLY: It means, that this little girl Emily... is Melissa's daughter.

LATER

(Mrs. Scully and Dana are in the dining room. Mrs. Scully is sitting, and Dana is hovering over her. We see the pictures of Emily and her birthday cake and Melissa in 1966.)

MRS. SCULLY: It's impossible.

SCULLY: You can't deny that there is a remarkable resemblance.

MRS. SCULLY: Melissa was three years old when this picture was taken. She was practically a baby. All kids can look the same at that age.

SCULLY: Mom, it's uncanny. Emily looked exactly like Melissa. That's why I ordered the PCR test. Because her face may change, but her DNA can't.

MRS. SCULLY: And the test is accurate?

SCULLY: There's a 60% chance that Melissa is Emily's mother. I'll order a more comprehensive test, a RFLP. It'll take a couple of days, then we'll be sure.

MRS. SCULLY: Well, I'm already sure your sister did not have a baby. She would have told me.

SCULLY: Mom, remember about four years ago and Melissa took off? She traveled up and down the west coast, we didn't know where she was half the time.

MRS. SCULLY: You're saying she was pregnant and she didn't want us to know?

SCULLY: That was 1994. Emily was born that November. She could have given it for adoption and none of us would have ever known.

MRS. SCULLY: Dana, listen to me. I know what you're going through.

SCULLY: Mom, this has nothing to do with what I'm going through.

MRS. SCULLY: It has happened to me. When your father died, it was a long time before he left me. I saw him in my dreams. The phone would ring, and just for a moment I was sure it was his voice. You're doing the same thing with Melissa. You're seeing her in this child, but that doesn't make this child my granddaughter. We're still connected to them Dana. Even after they're gone.



SCENE 21
PAST IN SCULLY HOUSE

(Christmas. Young Dana, early teens, walks into the living room.)

YOUNG DANA: Look at all the presents.

YOUNG MELISSA: Dana, quiet, they might hear us. (They both walk to the tree and sit amongst the presents and shake them. Dana holds one up.)

DANA: This one's for me.

MELISSA: You wish. That's for Billy, you dope. (Dana looks and holds up a wrapped LP.)

DANA: This has got to be it. This has got to be Hotel California.

MELISSA: SH! You'll wake everybody. (Dana picks up another present, long and narrow.)

DANA: I wonder what this is.

MELISSA: I don't know, but I got one too.

MRS. SCULLY: You don't have to shake it, Dana. You can open those now. (The girls smile and they do. They got identical gold cross necklaces.)

MELISSA: Thanks, Mom.

MRS. SCULLY: Your grandmother gave me a cross just like that when I was about your age. (She puts it on Dana.)

DANA: It's pretty.

MRS. SCULLY: It means God is with you. He'll watch over you wherever you go. (Young Dana looks up to see current Dana, Scully, looking at her and smiling.)



SCENE 22
SCULLY'S BEDROOM / NURSERY

(There's a knock on the door. It opens. It's Tara.)

TARA: Dana? Hi. Sorry to wake you but there's a detective here to see you.

SCULLY: I'll be right down.



SCENE 23
DINING ROOM

(Tara is at the counter. The detective is sitting at the table. Mrs. Scully serves him a cup of coffee. Dana enters. They notice Dana and the detective rises and walks with Dana away from the others.)

KRESGE: I know it's early.

SCULLY: Not a problem.

KRESGE: We came up with an interesting tidbit on Mr. Sim.

SCULLY: What?

KRESGE: Bank deposits. Large ones. $30,000 a pop. Three in the last 18 months. All the checks had been made out to his wife. The last one was deposited yesterday, apre morte.

SCULLY: From where?

KRESGE: Pharmaceutical firm in Chula Vista.



SCENE 24
TRANSGEN PHARMACEUTICALS

(Day. Outside. There are various people walking around the courtyard.)

SCULLY: Dr. Calderon?

CALDERON: Yes? (A man turns as Scully and Kresge walk up to him)

SCULLY: (extending her hand to him) I'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI, this is Detective Kresge with the San Diego Police Department.

CALDERON: What can I do for you?

KRESGE: We're investigating the death of Roberta Sim.

CALDERON: When did this happen?

SCULLY: You knew Mrs. Sim?

CALDERON: Her daughter, Emily, was a patient here.

SCULLY: What were you treating her for?

CALDERON: She was a subject in one of our clinical trials. We're developing gene therapies here for several blood disorders. Emily suffers from a rare form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. She's a very sick little girl.

SCULLY: What's her prognosis?

CALDERON: I'm afraid I really couldn't say. These are ongoing double-blind trials. It could be years before we have any results.

KRESGE: You've been paying the Sim family compensation for this?

CALDERON: Emily is a very special case, we were lucky to find her.

KRESGE: How did you find her?

CALDERON: Her father brought her to our attention.

SCULLY: Then why were the checks made out to her mother?

CALDERON: How should I put this? These payments are a gesture of good will to Mrs. Sim. She wasn't completely convinced that our experimental treatment was the way to go.

SCULLY: She wanted to pull Emily from the program?

CALDERON: She filed the paper work, but her husband later withdrew it.

SCULLY: Dr. Calderon, did you ever prescribe doritriptan injections to Emily during her treatment?

CALDERON: No. No. I prescribed them for the husband.



SCENE 25
SIM HOUSE

(Night. A knock on the door. Mr. Sim comes around the corner drinking a cup of coffee. He answers the door. At the door are Scully, Kresge, and some uniformed officers.)

KRESGE: Marshal Sim, you're under arrest for the murder of Roberta Sim. (Kresge pulls Sim's hands behind him and handcuffs him.)

SIM: What? (Scully and the others enter.)

SCULLY: Where's Emily?

SIM: Are you out of your mind?

KRESGE: You have the right to remain silent...

SIM: I didn't kill her. (Scully walks through the house.)

KRESGE: Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. (Scully sees Emily standing at the top of the stairs.) You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney...



SCENE 26
OUTSIDE SIM HOUSE

(A woman opens the back door of a minivan. Scully and Emily are walking hand in hand down the walk from the house. Scully helps Emily into the van and the car seat.)

SCULLY: Lets get you right in there. (She locks the car seat.) Lets get you buckled in here nice and safe, ok? (Emily sees her cross necklace. Emily touches it as Scully touched Emily's head.) You like that, huh? (Emily smiles. Scully takes it off and puts it around Emily's neck. The woman puts her hand on Scully's shoulder. It's time to go. Scully looks at Emily again.) I'll see you again soon, ok? (Emily nods. Scully gets out of the van and the woman shouts the door. Scully and Emily connect with each other are the woman gets in the driver's seat, starts the van and pulls away.



SCENE 27
BILL SCULLY'S HOUSE

(It's Christmas Eve day and there's a party going on. Scully sits in a chair by the window, alone. Everyone is mingling. Mrs. Scully is sitting with Tara on the couch.)

MRS. SCULLY: Every year my husband insisted on putting the angel on top of the tree by himself. (Bill walks to the couch.)

BILL: Man's work. (They laugh. Bill looks at Scully in her own world.) Ah, Dana, could you give me a hand in the kitchen? (She follows Bill to the kitchen.)



SCENE 28
KITCHEN

(Bill and Scully enter.)

SCULLY: What's up?

BILL (pouring himself a glass of punch): I need you to tell me what's going on.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

BILL: You're not here, you're a million miles away. I thought you came to see the family.

SCULLY: I did.

BILL: I thought this other thing was resolved. I thought you caught the guy that murdered that woman.

SCULLY: We did.

BILL: Then it's about that little girl, isn't it? Mom told me. You really think Melissa had a baby?

SCULLY: Yes, I do.

BILL: She called you from beyond the grave to tell you that? Sounds like something your partner would say.

SCULLY: It does not matter where that phone call came from. What matters is that there is a little girl who needs my help.

BILL: This isn't about any little girl, Dana. This is about you. It's about some... void, some emptiness inside you that you're trying to fill.

SCULLY: Bill, I don't expect you to understand but I am not going to stand here and justify my motive. (Mrs. Scully interrupts.)

MRS. SCULLY: Dana, there's a telephone call for you.

(Dana leaves and answers the phone in the hallway.)

SCULLY: Hello?

KRESGE (on phone): Merry Christmas, Agent Scully. (He's in his office) I have a little present for you. Marshall Sim just confessed.

SCULLY: He admitted to being in the house that morning?

KRESGE: I've got a signed statement.

SCULLY: What about the witnesses who said they saw him in the doctor's office at the time of the murder?

KRESGE: I guess they were mistaken.

SCULLY: Maybe they weren't. Where is he now?

KRESGE: County lock up.



SCENE 29
SAN DIEGO COUNTY JAIL

(A car pulls up, Scully, and follows another car through the gate. She sees the two men parked in front of Sim's house and gets out of her car as they drive past.)



SCENE 30
INSIDE JAIL

(Scully, Kresge and a deputy are walking down the hall.)

SCULLY: Did they identify themselves?

DEPUTY: They said they were his lawyers.

SCULLY: How long were they here?

DEPUTY: Ten, 15 minutes tops. (They stop at a cell. Marshall Sim is hung from the top cell with sheets.) Damn it! (The deputy fumbles with the keys to open the door as Scully looks in the cell. Sim is still alive, he's choking and gasping. Kresge and the deputy lift and untie him.)



SCENE 31
BILL SCULLY'S HOUSE

(Dana walks in. The party is over. The fireplace is still going. She looks at the manger scene.)

BILL: When did you get back?

SCULLY: Just now.

BILL: Well, you're just in time. I was on my way over to the neighbors. Mom and Tara are already there. What? What happened?

SCULLY: Marshall Sim, Emily's adoptive father is dead. They made it look like a suicide, just like his wife.

BILL: My God. Do you know who did it?

SCULLY: No.

BILL: Do you think it has something to do with that little girl?

SCULLY: I think it might.

BILL: Dana, I have to show you something.



SCENE 32
NURSERY

(Bill opens a drawer and takes out a picture. He hands it to Scully. It's a picture on Melissa, looking like she did in Anasazi)

BILL: Look at the date on the back. (Scully turns it over. Oct. 7 - 94.) Does Melissa look pregnant to you in that picture? It's about four weeks before the girl was born.

SCULLY: Bill, that doesn't prove anything. Melissa didn't have to be pregnant to have a baby. There's... there's in vitro fertilization, there's surrogate motherhood.

BILL: Dana, listen to yourself. You're creating this whole scenario to fulfill a dream.

SCULLY: What dream?

BILL: To have a child. Look... I understand. I know the need. God knows Tara and I tried for years. But making this girl into Melissa's daughter is not the way. You're going to end up hurting yourself. (Doorbell rings.)



SCENE 33
FOYER

(Bill answers the door. It's the woman who took Emily away.)

SUSAN CHAMBLISS: Hi. I'm here to see Dana Scully.

BILL: Ah, may I ask...

CHAMBLISS: I'm Susan Chambliss from the county. It's about the adoption. (She walks in as Scully comes down the stairs.)

SCULLY: Hi. Thanks for coming in on Christmas Eve.

CHAMBLISS: Oh, not at all.



SCENE 34
LIVING ROOM

(Scully is about to cry.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. I mean, I think I have a right to know why you're rejecting my application.

CHAMBLISS: It's not mine to accept or reject, Dana. We only make recommendations to the judge. But at this point I'd advise against you becoming an adoptive parent. You're a single woman who's never been married or had a long-term relationship. You're in a high stress, time intensive, and dangerous occupation. One I sense you are deeply committed to and one which would overnight become a secondary priority to the care and well-being of this child. I'm not sure this is a sacrifice you're prepared to make.

SCULLY: Well, it's one I've given a great deal of thought to. I mean, to be honest, I've started to question my priorities since I was first diagnosed with cancer. (Scully starts crying.) I feel like I was given a second chance. Ever since I was a child, I've never allowed to let myself get too close to people. I've avoided emotional attachment. Perhaps I've been so afraid of death and dying that any connection just seemed like a bad thing... something that wouldn't last. But I don't feel that anymore.

CHAMBLISS: I know you are a trained physician and are aware of Emily's medical condition. I want to stress to you, Dana. Emily is a special-needs child. According to her doctors, her condition is incurable. She requires constant care, both medical and emotional. The good news is, you have first hand experience of grave illness. The bad news is, you'd have to relive it through the eyes of a child.

SCULLY: I realize that. And I feel like I'm ready.

CHAMBLISS: We'll review your final application and make our recommendations. I wish you luck. Merry Christmas.

SCULLY: Merry Christmas. (They shake hands.)

CHAMBLISS: I'll show myself out. (Scully sits on the couch. A hand reaches for her shoulder.)

VOICE: Dana? (Scully turns around and it's Melissa.)

SCULLY: Melissa?

MELISSA: I didn't know anyone else was up.



SCENE 35
IN THE PAST

(Scully is sitting on the couch wearing a robe)

SCULLY: I couldn't sleep. (Melissa walks around and sits on the end of the couch with Dana.)

MELISSA: Why not? You worried about Quantico, or who gets the most presents this year?

SCULLY: I guess I'm afraid of making a big mistake. I could tell Dad sure thinks I am.

MELISSA: Yeah, well. It's not his life, Dana.

SCULLY: (Her hair is longer, like when the show first started) I know that. You know, when I first started med school, it felt so right. It seemed like that was where I was supposed to be. And then by the time I graduated, I just knew it was wrong. But now the FBI feels right. And... what if that's wrong too?

MELISSA: There is no right or wrong. Life is just a path. You follow your heart and it will take you where you're supposed to go.

SCULLY: God! You sound like a greeting card. I don't believe in fate. I think we have to choose our own path.

MELISSA: Well, just don't mistake the path for what is really important in life.

SCULLY: Which is what?

MELISSA: The people you're going to meet along the way. You don't know who you're going to meet when you join the FBI. You don't know how your life is going to change or how you're going to change the life of others.

TARA: Hey!



SCENE 36
PRESENT DAY

(Tara walks to the couch. Scully is laid out on the couch with a blanket over her.)

TARA: Good morning, sleepy head.

BILL: Did Santa come?

TARA: Santa's right here.

BILL: She always was the first downstairs at Christmas. Couldn't wait to get those presents. (Bill hugs Tara from behind. Mrs. Scully goes to Scully on the couch and kisses her on the cheek.)

MRS. SCULLY: Hey, Merry Christmas.

TARA: Ok, ok, enough pleasantries. I'm dying to know what's in this box. (Tara and Bill go to the tree.) I've waited for a month.

BILL: Well, open it. (Scully is leaning against Mrs. Scully on the couch when Bill hands her a gift.) This one's from Charles. (The doorbell rings.) Excuse me. I'll be right back. (He goes to answer the door. Scully gets up and goes to the door.)

COURIER: FBI Courier. Package for Agent Dana Scully.

BILL: I'll sign for it.

COURIER: No, no. I need Agent Scully's signature, Sir.

BILL: Oh, all right. (Scully gets to the door.)

COURIER: I need you to sign for this. (Scully does as Bill goes back to the living room.) Merry Christmas. (He goes out the door. Scully is more interested in what's in the package.)

SCULLY: Merry Christmas. (She opens the package and stumbles to the living room. The others look at her.)

MRS. SCULLY: What is it?

SCULLY: It's the DNA test on Emily Sim's blood.

BILL: What does it say?

SCULLY: It says, definitely, that Melissa is not Emily's mother, but that they found striking genetic similarities between Emily and Melissa, so many that they ran a test against another sample that they already had.

MRS. SCULLY: What sample?

BILL: What are you trying to say?

SCULLY: According to this... I am Emily's mother.

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                   EMILY


SCENE 1
DARK DESERT NIGHT - DREAM

(The wind is blowing sand dunes around.)

SCULLY'S VOICE OVER:

It begins where it ends...
(A woman's feet appear walking slowly)

In nothingness. A nightmare born from deepest fears, coming to me unguarded.
(Long shot of a woman walking across the desert.)

Whispering images unlocked from time and distance.
(It is Scully walking wearing a long dark blue flowing gown)

A soul unbound - touched by others but never held. On a course charted by some unseen hand. The journey ahead promising no more than my past reflecting back upon me. Until at last, I reach the end.
(She picks up her cross necklace from the ground)

Facing a truth I can no longer deny. Alone, as ever.
(Close up on her face that turns into sand and blows away)

SCENE 2
SAN DIEGO COUNTY CHILDREN'S CENTER

(Outside, a woman is leading a group of children single file down a sidewalk. Mulder walks to her.)

MULDER: Excuse me, I'm looking for the special needs ward. (She motions.)

WOMAN: Second door over there.

MULDER: Thanks. (He walks past the children and a playground to the door.)



SCENE 3
PLAYROOM

(Mulder enters and sees Scully and Emily on the floor, Emily is coloring and Scully is watching her. He's not sure he wants in interrupt them. Scully sees him. He smiles and goes to them.)

SCULLY: Emily? I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. His name is Mulder. Remember, I told you about him?

EMILY: Uh hum. (Mulder waves to her and says hi. There is no recognition from her. She just colors.)

SCULLY: She's a little shy.

MULDER: What are you coloring?

EMILY: A potato.

MULDER: Have you ever seen Mr. Potato head? He looks like this. (Give a pretty goofy impersonation of Mr. Potato head that has to be seen to be believed. Got a smile out of her.) Doesn't it? (Emily nods. Mulder notices Emily's wearing Scully's cross necklace.)

SCULLY: I'll be right back. (Scully and Mulder rise and walk away from her as they talk) Thank you for coming. Something's wrong, isn't it?

MULDER: I found Emily's surrogate mother. I had Frohike hack into the California Social Services Adoption database.

SCULLY: You got a name?

MULDER: Yeah, her mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi.

SCULLY: Fugazzi?

MULDER: Yeah, as in slang term for fake.

SCULLY: I don't understand. Why create a false record?

MULDER: Because there are no true records. Emily didn't come into this world through any system that keeps them.

SCULLY: How did she come into this world?

MULDER: Have you asked yourself that?

SCULLY: Well, she was born to someone, she... she has to belong to someone.

MULDER: Someone, who's proven that they'll do anything to protect her or their interest in her.

SCULLY: I can protect her too.

MULDER: Yeah, but who's going to protect you? Emily's adoptive parents are both dead, by no accident.

SCULLY: I know... I've considered that, but I've also considered that there's only one right thing to do. (A woman approaches Emily.)

WOMAN: Emily? (She crouches down to Emily.)

MULDER: Why didn't you call me sooner?

SCULLY: Because I couldn't believe it. But I need you now to be a witness on my behalf in this hearing.

MULDER: And I should have declined... if I never want to see you hurt or harmed in any way.

SCULLY: Then why are you here?

MULDER: Because I know something that I haven't said... Something that they'll use against you to jeopardize your custody of Emily. No matter how much you love this little girl, she's a miracle that was never meant to be, Scully.



SCENE 4
SAN DIEGO HALL OF JUSTICE

(Mulder is sitting in a chair in a hallway eating sunflower seeds. Mrs. Scully, Bill and Tara come out of a door.)

BILL: They're ready for you. (Mulder walks past him and goes into the meeting.)

MAN: Agent Mulder, help me out here. Does FBI stand for Federal Bureau of Imagination? Am I to understand that your partner along with a dozen other woman in Allentown, PA, was abducted by employees of our federal government?

MULDER: She was missing for 4 weeks, that's documented in the file.

MAN: And you found evidence that during this time, she was subjected to experiments where ... you say, they extracted her ova?

MULDER: Yes, all of them. (Scully is stunned.)

MAN: Can this be done?

MULDER: I believe it can, and was. That Emily Sim was conceived as a result of those experiments.

MAN: Can that be done as well?

MULDER: I don't know how else to explain it. A medical exam of Ms. Scully would show that she hasn't given birth.

MAN: You know, under normal circumstances, this petition would be fairly simple. But I'm having difficulty wrapping my brain around this Michael Crichton bit.

MULDER: I included this information in anticipation of your reaction and how it might look if you received this information without any explanation.

MAN: Can you give me an explanation? Why anyone would kidnap Ms. Scully, to conceive this child, then put it up for adoption?

MULDER: No, but the fact remains, Ms. Scully is the mother of this child.

MAN: Not in any legal definition.

MULDER: Well, if you can show me a legal precedent for this case, I'd like to see it. Dana has known for quite some time that she can't bear children. She doesn't know why, but however that happened, that fact that she can adopt this child, her own flesh and blood, is something I don't feel I have the right to question and I don't believe anyone has the right to stand in the way of.



SCENE 5
BILL SCULLY RESIDENCE
10:16 PM

(Mulder sits on the couch in the living room. Scully comes down stairs and sits next to him.)

SCULLY: It takes two of us just to get my sister-in-law into bed these days.

MULDER: When's she due?

SCULLY: Two weeks ago. (Long pause) Why didn't you tell me, Mulder?

MULDER: I never expected this. I thought I was protecting you.

SCULLY: Why would they do this to me?

MULDER: I only know that genetic experiments were being done, that children were being created.

SCULLY: Children being created for who?

MULDER: For who? For what? I don't know. (The phone rings. Scully answers it.)

SCULLY: Hello? Hello? (She looks at Mulder who gets out his cell phone.) Hello, is anybody there?

MULDER: (whispering) I need to trace a call. I have an incoming call to residential line 555-0380.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's ...

MULDER: (to Scully) Don't hang up. (Into phone) Okay, thanks. I got a trace. County Children's Center.



SCENE 6
SAN DIEGO COUNTY CHILDREN'S CENTER

(There is a loud pounding and a woman opens a door and enters a stairwell. She runs down the stairs and opens the door. Mulder and Scully enter.)

WOMAN: What is it? What's the matter?

MULDER: Anyone been here the last half hour?

WOMAN: No. What's going on?

(They go upstairs. Scully leads to the girls' room. She opens the door and Emily is in her bed sleeping with the other girls. Scully sits on the edge of her edge and turns on the light. Scully touched her forehead.)

SCULLY: She's burning up.

WOMAN: I'll call 911. (Scully lifts the covers and Mulder picks her up.)

MULDER: Scully? There's something on her neck. (Scully lower the back of her nightgown and pushes her hair aside.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God. (There's a patch of green)



SCENE 7
HOSPITAL

(In a room with a window to the hall, two doctors hover over Emily who is laying in bed. The doctor is talking softly to Emily about what he's going to do. Scully is watching from the hallway. Mulder gets off the phone.)

MULDER: All right, I'll try back later. (He walks to Scully.) I spoke to the social worker. She hasn't been able to reach Emily's doctor. (One doctor comes out of the room.)

DOCTOR: Hi.

SCULLY: How is she?

DOCTOR: Well, we've put her on a saline drip to rehydrate her. She's running a fever of about 102. It's a good thing you got her here when you did.

SCULLY: Do you know what's causing it?

DOCTOR: Some kind of infection, probably related to the cyst on her neck.

MULDER: Do you know what that is?

DOCTOR: No. I'm having it byopsied. I'll get it off to the lab right away. Now, are you two the parents?

SCULLY: I'm her mother.

DOCTOR: Oh, okay. Can you give me any history that might help? (Mulder looks in the window to Emily and the female doctor preparing for the biopsy.)

SCULLY: I know that she was being treated for anemia.

DOCTOR: You know what type?

SCULLY: I was told that it was some kind of auto immune hemolytic anemia. Her treatment was experimental.

DOCTOR: Who's her doctor?

SCULLY: His name is Calderon.

DOCTOR: I don't know him. (Inside the room, the female doctor bends to Emily)

FEMALE DOCTOR: I'm just going to roll you onto your side, Sweetie. (Mulder watches as she swabs the cyst with alcohol. She's just ready to cut it out when Mulder bangs on the window.)

MULDER: Wait! Stop! (She puts the needle in, Emily flinches) Move away from her! Get away from her!

(The doctor and Mulder tousle as the cyst explodes and green blood flows out. The female doctor's eyes water and she drops to the floor. Emily sits up and looks at her. Scully looks through the window. Emily looks calmly at the female doctor on the floor. A stream of green blood flows down her back.)



SCENE 8
QUARANTINE WARD
7:31 AM

(Emily is asleep and Scully watches her through a window. Mulder enters.)

MULDER: She still sleeping?

SCULLY: They have her under a mild sedative.

MULDER: The ER doctor is in and out of consciousness.

SCULLY: How did you know?

MULDER: If Emily was someone's creation, then it occurred to me that she might share the same body chemistry that we've seen before. So I had them put the ER doctor in a cooling bath like you did when I was exposed to this.

SCULLY: So what now? She's still just a little girl. You say I can't protect her, but I can't let this be her life. Just a few days ago she was fine.

MULDER: She was also being treated. (Doctor enters.)

DOCTOR: Um, I just need some advice. With everything that's happening here, I'm a little at sea. This Dr. Calderon you say is Emily's physician? He's refusing to transfer her medical records.

SCULLY: He can't do that. He's endangering her life.

DOCTOR: He said Emily was in his care, and if you're the one who's stopping that, then you're the one endangering her.

SCULLY: It's an ethical violation .

DOCTOR: He said she was part of a double blind medical trial and that he's spoken to you about it. He also says you have no authority over this child.

SCULLY: Well, authority or not, I'm not leaving her side.

DOCTOR: It's beyond me, I'm afraid.

MULDER: Yeah, but it's not beyond Dr. Calderon.



SCENE 9
TRANSGEN PHARMACEUTICALS

(Dr. Calderon is sitting at his desk talking to Mulder.)

CALDERON: I'd like to say right up front that I know Emily Sim as your partner probably told you. My god, I... never met a sweeter, courageous little girl. I'm so sorry to hear about her down turn. My hope is these custody matters can be resolved so she may resume her treatment here. I'm afraid I can't release any information that relates to our companies experimental drug trials.

MULDER: What can I say to convince you?

CALDERON: (He chuckles) It's really not about convincing me. This is something that I- well, we... simply cannot do. It's purely a business reality. It has to do with Transgen's exposure to litigation and of course, our need to protect our research which frankly, represents a significant dollar investment.

MULDER: So, I'm wasting your time. This isn't worth the life of a three year old girl.

CALDERON: I wouldn't frame it like that. That's not it at all. Look, I'm truly sorry but there's really nothing I can do. (He stands up) However, I do (Mulder stands) wish you the very best. (They shake hands)

MULDER: Okay then. (Mulder holds on to his hand and turns it causing Calderon to flop down on a table. Mulder picks him up and starts slapping him) How do you feel now? (He slams him on the floor. Calderon yells for help. Mulder kicks him on the side and picks him up and thrusts him against the wall.) Why don't you tell me what your company's really in the business of. Huh? Abducting women and stealing their unborn children? Medical rapists! That's all you are! You don't care if that little girl dies! She's just a lab rat to you! (He pulls out his gun and points it in Calderon's face.) Tell me, whose life is worth saving, yours or hers? I want everything to help that little girl! (A door opens, it's security. The whole office is looking through the door, wondering what the hell's going on. Mulder pockets his gun and walks out) I'll be back.



SCENE 10
OUTSIDE

(Calderon rushes out of the door and to his car. Mulder follows in his car.)



SCENE 11
HOSPITAL

(Emily, sweaty, is lying in bed watching TV. Scully in a mask, watches her through the window. A female nurse behind Scully puts something on a tray)

NURSE: We're ready.

SCULLY: Can you give me a minute with her? (The woman nods. Scully adjusts her mask and goes into the room.)

Hey... (Emily is engrossed in the Life with Louie show) Sweetie? In a minute a nurse is going to take you down to have some tests.

EMILY: Mommy said no more tests. (The kid speaks!)

SCULLY: We just want you to get better. That's what these tests are for.



SCENE 12
X RAY ROOM

(Emily is laying on a table that goes inside the round MRI or whatever machine. A part of the machine comes out and covers Emily's head and the table goes into the machine. Scully watches the whole thing. The machine whirls, lights up, and blasts quick loud gun blast type sounds. Scully flinches.)



SCENE 13
STREET

(Calderon parks his Land Rover on the side of the street. Gets out and pushes the button on a remote to arm the security and walks into a house. A man watches through the shutters at him walk to the door. Calderon enters.)

CALDERON: He came to see me. He knows I'm involved. (Another man walks behind Calderon from the kitchen or something. Not sure if Calderon knows he's there. The man at the shutters keeps looking outside. Mulder parks and gets out of his car.)

MAN: Now you brought him to see us. (Calderon notices the man behind him.)

CALDERON: What do you want me to tell him?

MAN: Nothing. (The man behind Calderon takes out a bounty hunter killer switchpick type thing and stabs Calderon on the back of his neck. Green oozes out. The man stands up and looks at Shutter man and together they turn into Calderon clones.)



SCENE 14
MEANWHILE

(Mulder walks up the steps to the house. He sees something through the window on the door and quickly goes to the left. Calderon walks out and walks down the steps to the Land Rover, clicks the security remote and drives off. Mulder jogs down the stairs.)



SCENE 15
MEANWHILE

(We see the X Ray of Emily's head. There's a huge upside down Nike slash in the middle of her head. Scully, a woman and the doctor are conferring)

SCULLY: I hope you know what this is.

DOCTOR: An autoplastic mass, tumorous infection... The cyst on the back of Emily's neck seems to be the point of origin. And from her blood test last night and early this morning, it seems to be growing rapidly.

SCULLY: Is it cancer?

DOCTOR: No. Cancer grows out of control. These are anaerobic channels following the path of the nervous system. They have the effect of killing surrounding tissue, (We see an X Ray of Emily's body from the left side.) depriving it of the oxygen it needs to survive. The origin is in the brain and central nervous system. It couldn't be in a worst place.



SCENE 16
CORRIDOR OF HOSPITAL

(Calderon clone is walking quickly down the corridor. He walks right past the room Scully, the woman and the doctor are in.)

SCULLY: Can you put her on antivirals?

DOCTOR: I have her on a levophod drip to keep her blood pressure up and I've got her on steroids intravenously to bring down the inflammation. We could try radiation therapy.

SCULLY: No, you can't do that. Her immune system's too weak.

WOMAN: What can you do? Has anyone talked to Dr. Calderon about this?



SCENE 17
EMILY'S ROOM

(Emily is sleeping. Calderon gets to her bedside. He has a syringe with green fluid in it. He takes the tip off, taps the side and injects her. Scully walks down the hallway and sees Calderon exit Emily's room and has no expression on his face. He walks right by her.)

SCULLY: Dr. Calderon? (She rushes to Emily's room and sees Emily laying on her side-stomach away from her. She goes to the hallway and tells a nurse) Get Dr. Vinet in there and call the police. (She sees Calderon clone down the hallway. She runs after him.) Dr. Calderon? (He walks through the hall without turning back. There are a lot of people around. Scully takes out her gun and points it at him, people collapse against the wall.) Halt! Dr. Calderon! FBI! (A burly orderly is walking toward Calderon. Scully yells to him) Stop that man! (He tackles him. Scully runs up the him, grabs his shoulder and turns him around. It's another older gentleman.)



SCENE 17
TRANSGEN PHARMACEUTICALS
7:02 PM

(Calderon turns on the security alarm on his car. He goes into the building. Mulder parks and watches him go in. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY (on phone): Mulder where are you?

MULDER: I'm following Dr. Calderon.

SCULLY: What do you mean, you've been following him. I just saw him. There was a scare here. (Scully is at the hospital and looks over at Emily. She's being tended by the doctor) He was here, he came into Emily's room. It appears he injected her with something.

MULDER: Is she all right?

SCULLY: She seems to be, but we're running a tox screen anyway. (She walks down the hall as she talks and she sees men come down a perpendicular hallway. She raises her hand to them.)

MULDER: Whatever he injected her with I don't think he meant to harm her.

SCULLY: What are you talking about? (The men are two cops and Detective Kresge)

MULDER: I think Dr. Calderon went there to treat her.

SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't make any sense. Why would he endanger her before only to protect her now?

MULDER: As a bluff. I don't think they want her dead either, Scully, but for different reasons. Look, I'm going to catch up with you, all right? (He hangs up. Scully does too. She looks at Kresge.)

SCULLY: Detective.

KRESGE: Happy New Year.

SCULLY: Thanks for coming down.

KRESGE: I'm posting two cops outside her room.

SCULLY: That might not be necessary.

KRESGE: What if this guy Calderon is thinking of coming back?

SCULLY: There seems to be some indication that he came here to help her.

KRESGE: I don't understand. You said on the phone that he was somehow connected to the deaths of Emily's parents...

SCULLY: Because Emily's mother wanted to stop the tests, just like I did, and I guess that's why he came here because as much as they want to remove anything that gets in their way, it seems they need Emily to continue the tests.



SCENE 18
HOUSE
NIGHT

(Mulder parks and goes to the house. He walks up the stairs, opens the front door and goes inside. He hears a TV on and goes down the hall it. There in a community sort of room, a bunch of old people are watching TV. Mulder looks across from the room to a door and he sees a note card that says A. Fugazzi. It's ajar. He opens the door He looks inside. There's an old woman in a wheelchair. She looks back at him.)

ANNA: Hello?

MULDER: Anna Fugazzi?

ANNA: Yes? (Mulder walks into the room)

MULDER: Your name is Anna Fugazzi?

ANNA: Yes. Are you the new doctor?

MULDER: No, I'm not. Is that your real name?

ANNA: Yes, for the last 71 years. Were you looking for me?

MULDER: Not until now.



SCENE 19
HOSPITAL

(We see X Rays of Emily. There are like balloons in her sides.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. Just an hour ago you said she was getting better.

DOCTOR: That's right. Her fever's down, her vital signs are nearly back to normal. But these MRIs are telling me that this growth has continued to spread. What we're now seeing seems like a necratizing of the tissue.

SCULLY: It's killing her.

DOCTOR: Whatever it is, it may already be present in some amount. Basically, it shut down her body while it continued to grow. (He leaves and Chambliss comes in with a file)

CHAMBLISS: I presented all this information to the court. I have to tell you that they are greatly concerned that you are making decisions for this child. And they seem to be having no small effect on her health.

SCULLY: Ms. Chambliss, I am a medical doctor. And the decisions that I make are reasonable and right.

CHAMBLISS: But I have it right here in this report that Dr. Calderon's treatment of her actually resulted in a turnaround.

SCULLY: No. That is not true. The injection that Dr. Calderon gave her is actually making her worse.

CHAMBLISS: I want to say something to you and I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but I don't think that you are capable right now of responding with any clinical ability.

SCULLY: Do you think I don't want what's best for this child? Do you think that I'm not trying to save her life?

CHAMBLISS: I'm saying I'm getting wildly differing reports. I have a job to do. I'm not the ultimate authority here, but you don't have the authority, either over this child or her future.

SCULLY: You can get a court order and you can try to enforce it, but I suggest that if you're going to do what's best for this child, then you do everything in your power to tell the authorities that if they take Emily out of this hospital, they are going to hasten her illness. And I'll let it be known that all of you are responsible. (She walks to the door.)

CHAMBLISS: What do you want me to tell them you're doing for her?

SCULLY: I don't know yet, but I will. (Scully leaves)



SCENE 20
LONE GUNMEN'S OFFICE

(Frohike is at the computer)

FROHIKE: Christina Sherman. Delivered a healthy baby girl September 25, 1994. (Cut to Mulder at the old folk's home. He has a list of the elderly residents and is on his cell phone.) Delivered a baby boy (There's an old woman sitting on a rocking chair) March 18, 1986.

MULDER: Evelyn Burmeister. (Cut to Frohike who enters the name into a search engine.)

FROHIKE: Evelyn Burmeister... delivered a baby boy June 1, 1994. (Cut to Mulder)

MULDER: That makes 8 for 8.

FROHIKE: Are you at Adoption Services, Mulder?

MULDER: No I'm at the maternity ward.

FROHIKE: Any fetching young mothers there?

MULDER: I think you might have a shot here Frohike. Do you know anything about pharmaceuticals?

FROHIKE: Medicinal or ... recreational?

MULDER: There's two prescriptions on their med charts that all these women have in common. Abbreviated PMZ 200 and Duratab.

FROHIKE: Estrogen and pretesterone.

MULDER: Hormones.

FROHIKE: But that doesn't make any sense, Mulder. Pregnant women have those hormones in abundance. You wouldn't give those to pregnant women. (Anna wheels herself into the room.)

MULDER: You would these. Anna? There's a doctor that comes to visit you. a Dr. Calderon.

ANNA: Yes. Do you know where he is?

MULDER: No, actually, I'm looking for him.

ANNA: He was supposed to be here. I was going to start my beauty sleep.

MULDER: Your beauty sleep. What is that?

ANNA: He says it's taken years off my appearance.



SCENE 21
HOSPITAL

(Emily is shown from above on a table being slid into a hyperbolic chamber. She is clearly scared. The door is shut and sealed. Scully is standing along side it and takes a mike and talks softly)

SCULLY: You okay in there, Emily. (She nods) Good. I'm going to be right here the whole time, okay? (She nods again.) Now we're just going to put some extra air in there, so you tell me if your ears start to hurt. (Scully nods to a tech. He turns the air up. A dial shows the pressure building. They put it up to 200. Emily starts to get uncomfortable) You okay, Sweetie? (Emily shakes her head no and is starting to cry.) Turn it off! (Scully looks in the chamber. Emily's arm looks like every vein is popped to the surface) Turn it off, NOW!

TECH: I'm doing it ma'am.

SCULLY: Hold on Sweetie. Settle down. We'll get you out of there as fact as we can.



SCENE 22
NURSERY?

(Mulder walks into a darkened room with plastic draped around an area of beds with old ladies laying in them sleeping. Mulder pulls away the plastic and looks in and walks through. There are 6 beds. He looks at an IV hooked up to one of them. Dr. Calderon is the doctor. He looks at the wristband of the woman. It reads, Charmaine Villard. He walks through another plastic drapery and sees a fridge with a big metal box in it. He opens the fridge and takes out the box and sets it on a table. He opens it. He reads a folded piece of paper in the box and on the bottom it has Scully, D. and a number. He takes out a flask with green liquid and a fetus that kicks in it.)

(He opens another box and it's filled with vials. he takes one out and it's green liquid. He hears a car approaching. He puts the vial down and goes to the window. He sees Calderon leave his car and click the alarm on and walk to the building. Mulder hurries and takes some vials and puts everything back. He leaves the room.)



SCENE 23
HALLWAY

(Mulder walks down the hallway and hears a gun click. A gun is pointed at his head. He stops.)

KRESGE: Flinch and you're dead. Hands where I can see them. (Mulder raises his hands. He has the vials in his left hand.) What you got there? Give it to me slowly. (Mulder does. Kresge pushes him against the wall.) Hands against the wall. Spread your legs.

MULDER: Who are you?

KRESGE: Detective Kresge, San Diego PD.

MULDER: Detective Kresge, I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. (A door opens. They both look. Calderon walks into the hallway.) Take the gun off me and put it on that man. (Calderon walks toward them. Kresge points the gun at Calderon who walks toward them)

KRESGE: Stop right there!

MULDER: Run. Get out of here. (Mulder is ready to go, but waits for Kresge, who drops the vials to put both hands on the gun. The vials drop to the floor and scatter.) Don't use your gun. Get out of here!

KRESGE: I said stop right there! (Mulder's not waiting anymore and takes off down the other way in the hallway. Calderon is chest to gun. Mulder picks up a vial. Calderon lifts and throws Kresge down the hallway. Mulder looks at Calderon, who glares at him. Calderon walks to Mulder. Kresge picks up his gun and points it at Calderon.)

MULDER: Kresge...

KRESGE: I said stop right there!

MULDER: Don't fire, Kresge! (He does. The bullets go right through Calderon. Green oozes out of the holes. Mulder runs down the hallway. Calderon never falls. He turns around and faces Kresge. (Kresge's eyes start to water. He tries to hold the gun on him. He drops the gun, gasps and grabs his eyes)



SCENE 24
OUTSIDE

(Mulder is on his cell phone walking away from the house.)

MULDER: I'm an FBI agent. I have an emergency situation. I need an ambulance and I need backup.



SCENE 25
INSIDE

(Close up of Kresge's face. He's in pain. His face is pulled back by the clone and the camera pulls back to see the clone morph from Calderon to the painful expression of Kresge.)



SCENE 26
OUTSIDE

(Mulder is still on the phone.)

ON PHONE: Where are you?

MULDER: I don't know where I am. (Kresge clone leaves the house.)

KRESGE: I have him inside.

MULDER: You have your weapon.

KRESGE: I have him on the floor, hands cuffed.

MULDER: I have back up coming. I need a location though.

KRESGE: I'll take care of it. Just watch the guy. (Mulder goes to the house. Kresge walks to the street. Mulder is walking up the stairs of the house.)

MULDER: Detective Kresge is going to radio in the location. (Mulder hears the car alarm of the Land Rover beep off. He turns to see Kresge drive away in the Land Rover.)



SCENE 27
HOSPITAL

(Emily is in a regular bed, sleeping. Scully looks through the glass. She is worried. Mulder walks in)

SCULLY: She's gone into a coma. (Mulder looks around at where to turn, what to say. He looks at Scully.) I'm okay, Mulder. It's what's meant to be.

MULDER: But if you could treat her...

SCULLY: I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it to her.

MULDER: Are you sure?

SCULLY: Mulder, whoever brought this child into this world... didn't intend to love her.

MULDER: I think she was born to... serve an agenda.

SCULLY: I have a chance to stop that. You were right. This child... was not meant to be.

MULDER: All right. I'll stay with you.

SCULLY: I think I'd like to be alone. (Mulder leaves.)



SCENE 28
HALLWAY

(Mulder walks down the hall to the nurses' station. he stops. He takes the green stuff in the vial out of his pocket and wonders I suppose if he should tell Scully. He puts it away and walks on.)



SCENE 29
EMILY'S ROOM

(Scully walks through the glass door to Emily's bed. She isn't wearing protection such as gown or mask. She touches Emily's forehead. She lies down next to her. She puts her head next to Emily's.)



SCENE 30
DISSOLVE TO CHURCH

(A stained glass window of Mary and child. Scully sits in a pew. People walk past her. She just looks down. A hand reaches out and touches her shoulder. Scully looks up. It's her mother.)

MRS. SCULLY: You ready?

SCULLY: I think I'll ride back with Mulder. (Scully stands and hugs her mother. She hugs Bill. She looks to see Tara standing behind him in the aisle holding her new born baby. Scully smiles to Tara and kisses the baby's forehead.) Bye, bye Matthew. (She caresses his forehead and kisses Tara goodbye.)

TARA: We'll see you at home, okay?

(Scully nods yes. The four of them leave. ms. Chambliss walks up to Scully from behind her. They nod and she leaves. There is a little white coffin behind Scully. She turns and looks at the coffin. She starts to cry. Mulder walks into the chapel. He brings a bouquet of white flowers and lays them on the coffin. He stands beside her.)

SCULLY: Who are the men who would create a life whose only hope was to die?

MULDER: I don't know. But the fact that you found her... and had a chance to love her... Then maybe she was meant for that too.

SCULLY: She found me.

MULDER: So you could save her.

SCULLY: How's Detective Kresge?

MULDER: He's doing better. He's already out of the ICU.

SCULLY: And the men who did this to him?

MULDER: They've already cleaned up the nursing home. All the women have been placed in new homes. There's no evidence that anyone at Transgen Corporation knew of Calderon's work. (Scully looks at Mulder, then back to the coffin.)

SCULLY: There is evidence of what they did.

(She walks to the coffin. Mulder turns his back and stands look out. She opens it. All that's in the coffin is sand and Scully's cross necklace. Scully picks up the necklace and holds it up and shuts her eyes.)

SCENE 1
LORTON PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD
LORTON, VIRGINIA

(A physical therapist is assisting a patient in pushing a large plastic wheel across the floor. Watching are orderlies Piero and Chuck.)

THERAPIST: Keep going. Keep going. That's the way. Don't stop now. Oh, come on, keep pushing. No pain, no gain. I want five more steps and you're done. Uh-huh ... four ... three ... good ... and ... super.

PIERO: Hit it.

(The orderlies push a wheelchair up behind the patient.)

THERAPIST: Nice and easy. You're really coming along, Bobby. I'm very pleased with your improvement.

PIERO: (to Chuck) Back off. Keep your fingers on your pepper spray, just like I told you.

(Piero shackles the patient's arms securely to the wheelchair.)

THERAPIST: Mr. Piero, is all this really necessary?

PIERO: Yes, ma'am. I'd say it is.

(Later, Piero and Chuck are pushing the patient's wheelchair down the hallway.)

CHUCK: So, what's this guy's story?

PIERO: Cop killer. Regular people killer. General all-around waste of skin.

CHUCK: So what are you scared of? Guy's a freaking vegetable, I mean, what's he going to do ... run over you with his big plastic wheel?

PIERO: I'll tell you what. You want to last here more than a week, you don't ever underestimate this man. Never trust him, never let your guard down around him. Never. Capeesh?

CHUCK: Comprendo.

(They open a cell door and we see the patient's face for the first time. It is Robert Modell, the "Pusher" from 3x17.)

(That evening, Chuck is on duty on the ward. He sees a red "call light" blinking outside Modell's cell. He leaves his station and walks to Modell's cell. He looks in and sees Modell shackled to his bed, but the red light continues to blink. He pulls out his pepper spray, unlocks the door, and enters Modell's cell. Modell is tapping one finger against the bed. Chuck checks his shackles, which are secure.

CHUCK: What's up, Modell?

(Modell whispers some unintelligible words to Chuck. Chuck leans closer to listen.)

(The following morning, Piero comes on shift. He notices that Chuck is not at the guard's station.)

PIERO: Hey, Chuck?

(He hears a series of dull thuds from down the hall, in the direction of Modell's cell. He runs down the hall and finds Modell's door open. He enters to find the bed empty and Chuck sitting in the corner, slowly hitting his head against the wall.)

PIERO: What the hell happened, Chuck? Where's Modell?

CHUCK: He had to go.

SCENE 2
A LARGE ROOM IN LORTON PENITENTIARY

(Skinner is conducting a briefing with about a dozen agents, US Marshalls and other officials, as Mulder and Scully enter.)

SKINNER: The orderly's being questioned, but judging by his mental state he's not gonna be much help to us, so there's very little we know for sure at this point. What we do know is that the last confirmed bed check was 2:04AM. As of 6:14 AM, the subject was reported escaped. Since then, there have been no further sightings or contact.

FIRST MARSHALL: How did this man make his way out of the building?

SKINNER: Every indication is he simply walked out the front door. Due to the ... unique ... nature of this investigation, the FBI will head the manhunt. The Marshall Service will lend their much-welcomed expertise and will coordinate all their efforts with myself or my two designated SAC's - agents Mulder and Scully. They apprehended the subject the first time around. Agent Mulder ...

MULDER: The subject's name is Robert Patrick Modell. He's a serial killer responsible for at least 17 murders. Specifically, he targets law enforcement. In 1996, he caused the deaths of an FBI agent and a Loudoun County sheriff's deputy. It was all a game to him. He was looking for, in his words, "a worthy adversary".

SCULLY: To win makes him feel important. He likes to think of himself as a ronan - a warrior without a master, adhering to the budo, the Japanese way of war. In truth, he's a highly intelligent sociopath who has no fear of dying. In keeping with his game archetype, he likes to leave clues. This is why we expect to be contacted by him, hopefully sooner rather than later.

MULDER: We fully expect him to pick up exactly where he left off.

SECOND MARSHALL: What did you mean before when you said he just walked out the building?

MULDER: Modell refers to himself as "pusher". Technically speaking, all of his victims' wounds were self-inflicted. This man has a unique ability to force his will upon others - to push his victims into hurting or killing themselves.

SECOND MARSHALL: Say what?

MULDER: OK, look, this is all you need to know. Do not trust this man, do not talk to him, do not engage him in conversation, even if he is unarmed. Approach him only with extraordinary caution, and then only with adequate backup.

FIRST MARSHALL: So what's adequate backup?

MULDER: Adequate backup? Every cop you can lay your hands on.

SKINNER: Line up for your assignment.

(Skinner hands out assignments to the others while Mulder and Scully step aside.)

MULDER: What's Modell's condition?

SCULLY: Extremely weakened. The doctors here say that he can barely even walk.

MULDER: Oh yeah?

SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder, I'm amazed he's even alive ... the condition that we last saw him in, comatose with a bullet in the head.

MULDER: How did he recover?

SCULLY: Well, apparently one day about six months ago, he simply woke up. It's unusual, but it's not unheard of.

MULDER: What about his brain tumor that was supposed to be killing him?

SCULLY: It still is.

MULDER: Is there anybody on staff here we can talk to?

SCULLY: He has a physical therapist. Mulder ... what if Modell plans to pick up where he left off? Where does that leave you? You were his prime target. Should you even be heading this investigation?

MULDER: As opposed to what? What's your point?

SCULLY: That it's exactly what he wants. That once again you're playing his game.



SCENE 3
OCCOQUAN, VIRGINIA
9:13 AM

(Todd is on duty at the Sport's Hut. He is watching a television showing a news bulletin that includes a photo of Modell.)

NEWSCASTER (on TV): The escaped inmate, Robert Patrick Modell, was convicted in 1996 on charges stemming from an incident in which he brandished a firearm in a downtown hospital. Two people died. Officials are cautioning area residents not to approach this man. He is considered to be extremely dangerous ...

TODD: Can I help you?

(Todd looks up and immediately recognizes Modell at the counter.)

MODELL: Hi.

(Todd reaches down and slowly grasps a baseball bat just behind the counter.)

MODELL: You're not scared of snakes?

TODD: What?

MODELL: (looking down at the bat) Looks like a timber rattler.

(Todd looks down at the bat, but he sees that he is holding a large "snake" just behind the head.)

MODELL: Hold on tight to the neck, now. Don't let it bite you. Don't drop it. You drop it, it'll get you. Todd? Do you think I can get some service now?

TODD: (breathless) Yeah.

MODELL: Go into the back and put the snake down.

(Todd goes to the back, still carrying the "snake". Modell walks behind the counter and grabs a Carbo-Bar. As he eats it, he looks up at the television.)

NEWSCASTER: ... certainly, Paul. This was the scene here at Lorton Penitentiary less than one hour ago. Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation along with the US Marshall Service and representatives of local law enforcement met to assemble a multi-agency task force ...

(The television shows Mulder and Scully getting out of their car and entering the prison.)



SCENE 4
LORTON PENITENTIARY

(Mulder and Scully are interviewing the physical therapist, who is reviewing Modell's medical file.)

THERAPIST: He couldn't have been faking it completely, that's all I can say. The gunshot wound did a hell of a lot of damage. (she turns the page in Modell's file) (to Mulder) You're the officer that shot him.

SCULLY: (reading the visitors log) It says here that Modell had a visitor yesterday afternoon.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: It's marked LSC.

THERAPIST: Little Sisters of Charity. They try to visit all the hospitalized inmates.

MULDER: Did Modell ever get any other visitors besides the Little Sisters of Charity?

THERAPIST: Not that I know of. He didn't have much in the way of family. He was raised in foster homes mostly.

MULDER: Sounds like you got to know him pretty well.

THERAPIST: He never gave me any grief. He worked hard at getting better. I'd talk to him sometimes.

MULDER: About what?

THERAPIST: Small talk, nothing important. He'd ask how I was.

MULDER: He's a very considerate man.

THERAPIST: I don't doubt for a second Robert Modell belongs in prison. But I never had any problem with him personally.

(Another agent bursts into the room.)

AGENT: Agents! It's Modell.

(Mulder and Scully run into the meeting room, joining Skinner.)

SKINNER: (to Mulder) He's asking for you. We're running a trace right now. We just need thirty seconds.

(Mulder reaches for the phone.)

SCULLY: (softly, as he reaches for the phone) Mulder?

(Mulder nods at Scully, acknowledging her warning.)

MULDER: (to phone) Yeah.

MODELL: (on phone) Two words - it's alive. (he laughs)

MULDER: I don't feel like playing your game right now, Modell.

MODELL: Touchy. Look, Mulder, there's something I need you to hear.

MULDER: Tell it to me in person, Modell.

MODELL: No. Seriously, listen to me.

MULDER: No, you listen to me. Either you come back here on your own or I drag your sorry ass back on the bumper of my car.

SCULLY: (to agent monitoring the trace) Time?

TRACE AGENT: 4 seconds.

MODELL: When did you turn into Clint Eastwood?

SCULLY: (to Mulder) Don't let him rope you in.

MODELL: Now stop talking like a tough guy and pay attention. I know you're tracing this call. I don't care. I have something ...

SCULLY: Mulder, hang up the phone.

MODELL: ... that I need you to hear. Mulder, are you going to ...

(Mulder hangs up.)

TRACE AGENT: We got it.

< the Sport's Hut in Occoquan >

(Mulder, Scully, Skinner and other agents storm in. Mulder notices the Carbo-Bar wrapper on the counter. The other agents fan out through the store.)

SCULLY: There's nothing back there.

SKINNER: How far could he get?

(Mulder looks outside and sees a figure walking slowly down the middle of the street.)

MULDER: Outside!

(They run outside. Mulder nearly gets hit by a car, and then runs after the man, who is wearing a light overcoat with "D. C. Dept. of Corrections" on the back. As he reaches him, he draws his gun and spins the man around. It is Todd, the clerk from the Sport's Hut. Skinner and Scully catch up.)

SKINNER: Where is he? Where's Modell?

TODD: He had to go.



SCENE 5
INSIDE A HOUSE

(Modell is staring intently at a framed photograph of a blonde woman. As he puts the photo down, he leaves a bright blue fingerprint on the frame. We hear the door close and see an overturned bucket of paint, several footprints, a paintbrush and a pool of paint, all bright blue, on the carpet. We then see the head of a man, completely covered in the blue paint.)

(We see various symbols, in the same blue paint, on the walls of the room. Mulder, Scully and other officers are investigating.)

MULDER: (motioning at the symbols) I'm going to take a wild stab here and guess this is a clue.

(Scully is examining the body of the man. As she pries open his mouth, a large quantity of blue paint comes flowing out.)

SCULLY: Appears as if he died from ingesting paint. I imagine that he did all of this and then drank what was left.

(Skinner enters with several other agents, including a female agent of oriental descent.)

SKINNER: (to female agent) See what you can make of it. (to Scully) Modell?

SCULLY: (looking toward the paint can on the floor) Cerulean blue.

SKINNER: What the hell's the point in all of this?

SCULLY: Maybe his choice of victim. This is Nathan Bowman with the Loudoun County attorney's office. He's the prosecutor that tried Modell in 1996.

SKINNER: So you think it's simple revenge?

FEMALE AGENT: Sir? It's not a manifesto. It's the same single idiogram over and over.

SKINNER: Which is what?

FEMALE AGENT: Well, the hand it's in is pretty sloppy, but I think it's supposed to be "kitsunegari" - "fox hunt".

SCULLY: Fox Mulder.

MULDER: That's a little on the nose, don't you think?

(Mulder walks over to the photograph of the blonde woman, noticing the blue fingerprint.)

MULDER: Was Nathan Bowman married?

SCULLY: (checking the body's ring finger and finding a wedding band) Yep.

SKINNER: What are you thinking?

(Mulder walks to the phone and notices the names on the "speed dial" list, one of which is "Linda office".)

MULDER: Linda. Bet that's his wife, huh?

(He presses the speed dial button and activates the speaker.)

RECEPTIONIST: (on phone) NovaMax Realty.

MULDER: (to phone) Hi, Linda?

RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry. Mrs. Bowman has left the office to meet a client. May I take a message?

MULDER: Do you know the name of the client that Mrs. Bowman went to see?

RECEPTIONIST: It's, uh, Mr. Fox Mulder.

SCULLY: It's him.

SKINNER: Location. Find out where he's at.

MULDER: Do you know where Mrs. Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder, a location?

RECEPTIONIST: I know it's a commercial property in Falls Church, uh, can you hold on please?

MULDER: Yeah.

(Skinner dials a number on his cell phone.)

SKINNER: (to his phone) Give me the Falls Church PD.



SCENE 6
COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, 214 CHANNEL AVENUE, FALLS CHURCH

(A Falls Church Police Department vehicle arrives. There is a "for sale" sign from NovaMax realty with Linda Bowman's name on the outside. Two officers get out. The first officer checks the door and finds evidence that it has been pried open.)

SECOND OFFICER: (to radio) Unit 6 at 214 Channel Avenue. Signs of forced entry. We're gonna check it out.

DISPATCHER: (on radio) Exercise extreme caution, 6. Backup is in route.

(The officers draw their weapons and enter. It is dark inside, and they move upstairs and split up.)

MODELL: (unseen, from a distance) Hello. Officer? I'm over here. (the first officer follows the voice) That's right. No, not that way. Not that way either, but you're getting warmer. (the voice gets louder) Dead ahead. Straight in front. Buddy, I'm straight in front of you. What do you want me to do, draw you a map? (laughs) Keep coming. Almost there.

(The first officer rounds a corner and sees "Modell" with a gun.)

FIRST OFFICER: Put it down! Put the gun down! Put it down! Now! On the floor! ("Modell" complies) Face down! Do it! (he takes the gun) Marty, I got him! Get up here!

(Outside, a number of cars pull up. Mulder, Scully and Skinner are among the officers arriving. They run into the building.)

SKINNER: Federal Agent! Officer, where are you?

FIRST OFFICER: Upstairs! Sir, I got him!

(They run up the stairs toward the voice.)

FIRST OFFICER: I got him.

(They see that the first officer is actually holding the second officer on the floor.)

SECOND OFFICER: He's gone crazy! Get him the hell away from me!

AGENT: (to second officer) Give me your gun. Just give me your gun.

(The second agent complies.)

SKINNER: He was here. He did come for the woman.

SCULLY: Why Bowman's wife? What would he want with her?

UNIDENTIFIED OFFICER: Hey, we got a visitor.

(Outside, Linda Bowman, the blonde in the photo, arrives at the scene in a NovaMax car. As she gets out of the car, Mulder approaches.)

MULDER: Linda Bowman? Fox Mulder.

LINDA BOWMAN: Hi. Uh, you're my 12:15?

(shortly after, Linda Bowman is being interviewed in a room within the property.)

LINDA BOWMAN: (in a shaky voice) The appointment was made this morning, through my secretary. (sighs) All I know was I was supposed to meet a Mr. Mulder here. He didn't leave a number, and I couldn't call him to tell him that I was running late. Why would someone do this to Nathan?

SCULLY: Mrs. Bowman? Did your husband ever discuss his work as a prosecutor with you?

LINDA BOWMAN: Sometimes.

SCULLY: Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell?

LINDA BOWMAN: Pusher? That was Nathan's biggest case. Why?

SKINNER: Can you think of any reason why this man, Modell, would take an interest in you.

LINDA BOWMAN: What do you mean?

SKINNER: We believe he murdered your husband. It also appears that he's the man that made the appointment to see you today.

LINDA BOWMAN: No. No, no, he's in prison.

MULDER: Not since 6:00 this morning.

LINDA BOWMAN: Oh God.

(Skinner kneels next to Linda Bowman's chair.)

SKINNER: You're safe with us, Mrs. Bowman. If you'll come with me, we'll place you in protective custody.

(Skinner helps her up and takes her to the waiting marshalls.)

SKINNER: (to Mulder and Scully) Find him.

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

(Scully starts to leave but notices Mulder lagging behind.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Why didn't Modell just kill those two cops? What was to stop him?

SCULLY: Well, hopefully, he wasn't capable.

MULDER: As in too tired?

SCULLY: Well, we've seen that before.

MULDER: Maybe. I don't know. Something's just not making sense. (to a marshall) Can I borrow your radio?

MARSHALL: Yes, sir.

(Outside, Skinner and Linda Bowman get into a van. Modell is overlooking the scene from a nearby upstairs window. He is eating another Carbo-Bar and drinking coffee. A spanish-speaking radio station is on in the background, and a janitor is taking a break in the same room. Modell leaves the room.)

MODELL: (to janitor) Gracias, amigo.

(Mulder has walked up to the front door of the same building. He enters and sees another Carbo-Bar wrapper just inside. He draws his gun and starts upstairs. He rounds a corner and sees Modell waiting in the hall.)

MODELL: What took you so long?

MULDER: (to radio) Scully, I got him. Come quick.

SCULLY: (on radio) Where are you, Mulder?

MODELL: Hold on.

MULDER: (to radio) North side of Channel, second floor. Some kind of company, some engineering company.

MODELL: Hold on, hold on, we need to talk.

MULDER: Shut up, Modell.

MODELL: Mulder, listen.

MULDER: I said shut up.

MODELL: There's something I need you to ...

MULDER: Shut up or I will shoot you, you son of a bitch.

MODELL: Mulder.

MULDER: I will shoot you, shut up.

MODELL: You're going to listen to me. You're going to listen to me, Mulder.

MULDER: I will shoot you.

MODELL: Listen. (whispering) Mulder ...

(Shortly after, Scully and several others rush up to the building. Mulder is walking away from the front door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened? Where's Modell?

MULDER: He had to go.



SCENE 7
OUTSIDE THE BUILDINGS ON CHANNEL AVENUE

SCULLY: (on her cell phone) About 10 minutes ago. He can't have gotten far. (to a marshall coming out of the building) Anything?

MARSHALL: No sign.

SCULLY: (to phone) Yes, Agent Mulder's fine. Yes, sir.

(She hangs up and walks over to Mulder, who is leaning against a police car.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

MULDER: Well, aside from the utter grinding humiliation that comes from knowing I let our suspect go, pretty good.

SCULLY: It could have happened to anyone, Mulder.

MULDER: No, actually it couldn't have. I didn't find Modell. He sought me out. He wanted me to hear his message.

SCULLY: Which was what?

MULDER: "Don't play the game."

SCULLY: Whose game? His?

MULDER: I don't think so. I'm not even sure he's playing a game.

SCULLY: What are you talking about? Of course he is. You said yourself that he was gonna pick up where he left off.

MULDER: Then why didn't he kill the cops? Or the prison guards? Or, hell, while we're at it, why didn't he kill me? Why didn't he make me eat a bullet out of my own gun? He could have.

SCULLY: He killed Nathan Bowman.

MULDER: Yeah, he was definitely there, but that doesn't prove that he did it.

SCULLY: Mulder, this man's affected you. He's influenced your thinking.

MULDER: It's not like that.

SCULLY: A man is made to drink a gallon of cerulean blue paint. Kitsunegari - fox hunt. You're saying now that's not Modell?

MULDER: Modell is involved. He's related to it somehow, but not the way you think.

SCULLY: That's your opinion?

MULDER: Yeah, that's my opinion.

SCULLY: How can you be sure it's your own?

MULDER: What do we still agree on here? That Modell was pursuing Linda Bowman? I'd like to know why.



SCENE 8
FBI SAFE HOUSE
ANNANDALE, VIRGINIA

(Mulder and Scully are interviewing Linda Bowman.)

LINDA BOWMAN: I'm sorry, I don't know if I can tell you much more than I already have.

MULDER: We appreciate your help.

LINDA BOWMAN: I know Nathan was very proud of having prosecuted the case. He said this man, Modell, was extremely clever and dangerous, and that he was a menace to society, and Nathan mentioned that an FBI agent had ultimately shot him. Was that you?

MULDER: Yes.

LINDA BOWMAN: He said you crippled him and put him in a wheelchair. Nathan said it was too bad that you just didn't kill him. That would have saved the taxpayers the cost of a trial.

SCULLY: Your husband talked with you a lot about it.

LINDA BOWMAN: Well, as I said, he was proud. I guess he felt that, that it was his brush with greatness.

(Mulder looks up and stares at Linda Bowman.)

SCULLY: Is it possible that he could have mentioned you to Robert Modell?

LINDA BOWMAN: No, no, I sincerely doubt it. You see, Nathan and I, we were only married two months.

MULDER: How long did you know him?

LINDA BOWMAN: Well ... (laughs) ... it was two months and two days. Well, why wait when it's true love? You never know how long you have.

MULDER: No, you don't.

LINDA BOWMAN: It's not like Nathan was implusive or flighty. I don't want to paint him as that.

MULDER: He was true blue. (Linda Bowman nods) Thank you.

(Mulder and Scully leave the room and talk in the hall. Skinner joins them.)

MULDER: She killed Nathan Bowman.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Modell was there but for some other reason. She killed her husband.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, what ...

MULDER: Wait a minute, just hear me out. Her husband's brush with greatness, she doesn't want to paint him as being impulsive. Who the hell talks like that?

SCULLY: You tell me.

MULDER: She was waving it under our nose, she was playing with us. Modell told me, he warned me not to play the game. I think it was her game he was talking about.

SKINNER: Modell told you.

MULDER: Has she asked how her husband was murdered? Has she shown any interest in the details? An escaped serial killer is supposedly stalking her. Does she seem particularly fearful to you?

SKINNER: The woman's in shock, Agent Mulder. She's not herself. And I might add, neither are you.

MULDER: You heard it in there, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, no. I'm sorry. You said it yourself, you said "don't listen to Modell, don't trust him". But you've done both.

MULDER: But what if she can do what Modell does?

SKINNER: I think you should go home.

MULDER: You think I should go home?

SKINNER: You're suspended until such time I'm confident your judgement is sound. Give me your weapon.

MULDER: Who are you afraid I'm gonna point it at?

SCULLY: Mulder, I think you should do what he says.

(Mulder stares at them, then gives his gun to Skinner. Linda Bowman steps out of the room behind them.)

LINDA BOWMAN: Excuse me. Would it be possible for me to get something to drink? Water?

SKINNER: Uh, yes ma'am, I'll have somebody come right in.

MULDER: I'll prove it.

(Mulder walks away from them.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: (annoyed) Go fetch her some water!



SCENE 9
LORTON PENITENTIARY

(Mulder is interviewing the physical therapist.)

THERAPIST: I really don't know the man that well. I'm sorry you got the impression that I do.

MULDER: No, just anything at all that you might recall. Did he ever talk about his past? You know, mention anybody special, a woman, something like that.

THERAPIST: No.

MULDER: Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember.

THERAPIST: I guess one time someone else said something about him that struck me as unusual.

MULDER: Yeah? What was that?

THERAPIST: It was one of the nuns who visits from Little Sisters of Charity. She, uh, she once referred to him as a "conquered warrior". I thought that was kind of weird.

MULDER: Was this the same nun that visited him the day before he escaped?

THERAPIST: Yeah, the same one that always visits.

MULDER: How many times did she visit him?

THERAPIST: Maybe three, four.

MULDER: Would you take a look at something for me? Is that the woman, is that the nun?

(He shows a photo of Linda Bowman, but the phone rings.)

THERAPIST: Hang on, I'm blind as a bat.

(She walks to her desk to answer the phone. Mulder picks up her glasses case from the desk and gives it to her.)

THERAPIST: (to phone) Therapy room.

MULDER: Here ... glasses.

THERAPIST: (to phone) Uh, uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely. (she opens the case) (to Mulder) It's empty.

MULDER: Where did you leave them?

(She searches her desktop while continuing to talk on the phone.)

THERAPIST: (to phone) Uh, uh-huh. Uh-huh, OK.

(Mulder turns away. The therapist walks over to the corner where there is an electrical switchbox.)

THERAPIST: (to phone) Oh yeah, he's here.

(Mulder turns back to see the therapist open the switchbox and reach into it with her hand.)

MULDER: No!

(The therapist touches the leads and sparks fly. Mulder grabs a mop from a nearby pail and uses the wooden handle to pry her hand loose from the switchbox. She falls unconscious to the floor.)

MULDER: I need help in here!

(Mulder starts CPR on the therapist.)

MULDER: Help!



SCENE 10
FBI SAFE HOUSE IN ANNANDALE

(At the front gate, a marshall is on duty. A Falls Church Police car pulls up and the marshall opens the gate. The car pulls in and the marshall recognizes Modell in the back seat.)

MARSHALL: (to driver) You got him?

(Modell rolls down the back window.)

MODELL: (to marshall) Go home.

MARSHALL: What?

MODELL: Go home.

(Inside the safe house, Modell enters the room with Linda Bowman and locks the door.)



SCENE 11
CHAIN BRIDGE MALL

(Scully is getting out of a police van when her cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, it's me.

SCULLY: Where are you?

MULDER: I'm at the prison.

SCULLY: Mulder, you were told to lay off.

MULDER: It's a little late for that now. Modell's therapist just electrocuted herself right in front of me, and she was on the phone when she did it.

SCULLY: It was Modell.

MULDER: It was Linda Bowman.

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: The therapist would have identified her and verified that she visited Modell in the prison.

SCULLY: Would have? You don't know that.

MULDER: Listen, Scully, just trace the call and cut off any access that woman has to a phone. I'm heading back there right now.

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm not at the safe house.

MULDER: You're not?

SCULLY: We're at the Chain Bridge Mall, investigating a suicide.

MULDER: Why isn't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard?

SCULLY: (hangs up) (to marshall) Back in the trucks ...



SCENE 12
FBI SAFE HOUSE

(Skinner notices the phone ringing, unanswered, and no one on duty outside Linda Bowman's room. He draws his weapon and moves to the door to the room. Finding it locked, he kicks in the door and finds Modell and Linda Bowman standing next to each other.)

SKINNER: On the floor, Modell!

MODELL: (calmly, to Skinner) Hey, it's Mel Cooley.

SKINNER: On your face, do it now!

(Modell turns back to Linda Bowman.)

SKINNER: I said now!

MODELL: I have a gun.

(Modell whirls and points a "gun" at Skinner. Skinner fires and Modell falls. Linda Bowman gasps. Skinner approaches Modell and sees that his right hand is pointed like a gun, but there's no gun.)



SCENE 13
OUTSIDE LINDA BOWMAN'S ROOM AT THE SAFE HOUSE

(Marshalls and paramedics are wheeling Modell out on a stretcher. Scully follows the stretcher into the hall. Skinner is standing in the hallway, while Mulder runs up from the end of the hall.)

SCULLY: (to Skinner) Did he try to speak to you?

SKINNER: He said we got our man.

MULDER: What happened?

SKINNER: You were told to go home, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What happened?

SKINNER: He had a gun. I saw it clearly, it was a revolver.

MULDER: He pointed a gun at you?

SCULLY: We haven't found the gun yet.

MULDER: He said to you that he had a gun.

SKINNER: Yes, and he did. Excuse me.

(Skinner walks away.)

MULDER: Modell was unarmed. He purposely drew Skinner's fire.

SCULLY: For what possible reason?

MULDER: To protect someone.

SCULLY: Linda Bowman?

MULDER: To take the fall for her.

SCULLY: That's one hell of a plan, Mulder. A serial killer makes us believe that he's guilty, in turn diverting the suspicion away from the real estate lady. Well, he had me going.

MULDER: Where is she?

SCULLY: They've taken her home. There is no reason to keep her in protective custody, Mulder. It is over.

MULDER: No, it's not.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: If Modell makes it through surgery, I want to be the first person that he talks to.

SCULLY: Mulder, talking to him has already done you enough harm.

MULDER: (annoyed) OK, look, you do me a favor, Scully. You give me a call when you think I've come to my senses, all right?



SCENE 14
ANNANDALE COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER

(Modell has had a tracheotomy and is on a ventilator.
He is unconscious. Mulder is in the room.)

"NURSE": Sir? I'm going to need to change the patient's bandages.

MULDER: Call me if he wakes up, please.

(Mulder walks out of the room. After he has gone, we see that the "nurse" is really Linda Bowman with a piece of paper pinned to her shirt that says "Nurse".)

LINDA BOWMAN: (to Mulder, who has already left) Yes, sir.

(She enters the room and sits on the side of Modell's bed.)

LINDA BOWMAN: Bobby? (Modell's eyes open partially) Why did you do it? I didn't ask you to come after me.

(Modell tries to talk but can only make a wheezing noise because of the tracheotomy. Linda Bowman puts her finger over the exhaling port so that he can speak.)

MODELL: (whispers) Don't ... don't make a mistake.

LINDA BOWMAN: I'm not. After what they've done, do you think I'd let them get away with this? I'm gonna finish what you started.

MODELL: (whispers) No. Stop now. Stop ...

(Linda Bowman removes her finger from the exhaling port. Modell gasps and appears to be in pain.)

LINDA BOWMAN: Bobby ... Bobby, you're not in any pain. You feel wonderful. You've never felt better. (Modell's face relaxes) Your heart is slowing. It's tired. It's too worn out to keep beating. Let it rest.

(The monitor alarm sounds and Linda Bowman silences it. She puts her head on Modell's chest.)

LINDA BOWMAN: It slows ... it slows ... it stops.

(The monitor shows flat lines.)

(Mulder is walking past the nurse's station when a nurse sprints by. He follows her to Modell's room.)

NURSE: I've got the lidocaine, doctor.

DOCTOR: Never mind. Put him down as 7:38.

NURSE: Yes, doctor.

DOCTOR: (to Mulder, as she leaves the room) I'm sorry.

(As another nurse pulls the sheet over Modell's face, Mulder sees the badge with "Nurse" written on it on the table beside Modell's bed. He turns it over and reads the address "214 Channel Avenue".)



SCENE 15
214 CHANNEL AVENUE

(Mulder enters the commercial property. It is very dark. He walks through the building.)

"SCULLY": (from a distance, in a strained voice) Mulder?

(Mulder runs to the voice, rounds a corner and sees "Scully" standing some distance away.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here?

"SCULLY": You were right about her, Mulder.

("Scully" raises her weapon and points it at Mulder.)

MULDER: Scully.

"SCULLY": She's making me do this.

("Scully" cocks the hammer on her weapon.)

MULDER: Where is she?

"SCULLY": She's here. Mulder, make her stop. I can't help myself.

MULDER: (shouts) Linda Bowman!

"SCULLY": Mulder make her stop.

MULDER: (shouts) Show yourself!

"SCULLY": Mulder.

("Scully" points the gun at her temple.)

MULDER: (running toward her) No! No!

(The gun goes off and "Scully" falls to the floor. Mulder reaches her and checks for a pulse. He hears footsteps from behind him and looks up to see "Linda Bowman" approaching, also with a gun. He grabs "Scully's" gun.)

MULDER: (to "Linda Bowman", pointing the weapon at her) I'm gonna kill you!

"LINDA BOWMAN": Don't listen to her, Mulder.

MULDER: What?

"LINDA BOWMAN": It's me. You were right about her. Linda Bowman is pushing you.

MULDER: What the hell are you talking about?

"LINDA BOWMAN": I'm Scully. Linda's right behind you, she's telling you I'm her.

(Mulder looks down and sees "Scully" lying in a pool of blood.)

MULDER: You killed her!

"LINDA BOWMAN": Mulder, I'm Scully. I'm not dead. She wants you to shoot me. She knows you'll never forgive yourself.

MULDER: (shouting) Shut up!

"LINDA BOWMAN": Listen to me!

MULDER: Shut up!

"LINDA BOWMAN": Your mother is Tina, your sister is Samantha!

MULDER: Shut up!

"LINDA BOWMAN": Modell warned you. Don't play her game.

(A figure is seen rising just behind Mulder. "Linda Bowman" fires and the figure falls. Mulder looks down at the body on the floor, then back toward the shooter. He sees that it was Scully who fired the shot.)

SCULLY: Mulder ...

(Scully walks up and holds Mulder's arm. She then kneels over Linda Bowman, who is on the floor.)

LINDA BOWMAN: You think you can hold me?

(Scully dials her cell phone.)

SCULLY: (to phone) Yes, we'd like an ambulance to 214 Channel Avenue.



SCENE 16
SKINNER'S OFFICE

(Skinner is looking at a scan of Linda Bowman's head, showing a bright white spot in her temporal lobe.)

SKINNER: Linda Bowman.

SCULLY: She has an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like Modell's. It seems to run in the family.

SKINNER: She and Modell are related?

SCULLY: Fraternal twins.

SKINNER: He meant to protect his sister.

SCULLY: Apparently, she only found out about his existence six months ago. They were separated when they were two weeks ago, raised apart. Her "fox hunt" ... I'm guessing that she wanted revenge for what she feels we did to her brother.

SKINNER: (to Mulder) Anything you want to add to that?

MULDER: I think that covers it.

(Mulder and Scully rise and start to leave.)

SKINNER: Mulder, a moment, please.

(Scully continues out the door while Mulder turns back to Skinner.)

SKINNER: I just want to say you did a good job.

MULDER: How's that?

SKINNER: Nobody could have figured this out but you. You knew it was Linda Bowman and not Modell. You were way ahead of me.

MULDER: I almost killed my partner.

SKINNER: Mulder, despite that, you prevailed. You won her game.

MULDER: Then how come I feel like I lost?

(Mulder exits the office.)

SCENE 1
COATS GROVE, MICHIGAN
10:05 PM

(BOBBY RICHs room. BOBBY RICH, a stringy-haired 16 year old is playing a video game. Walls are covered with posters indicating this kid is a bit of an outsider. Outside, pickup truck drives up. PHIL RICH, 40s, gets out and sees shovel stuck in the ground. He is pissed. He goes inside. His wife, PATTI, is downstairs.)

PHIL: Bobby!

PATTI: Phil .

PHIL: Ive had it with that kid, Patti.

PATTI: Ive already talked to him.

PHIL: Yeah, like he ever listens.

(PHIL goes upstairs to BOBBYs room.)

PHIL: You hear me calling your name? (pulls headset off of BOBBY) Get up.

BOBBY: What are you doing?

PHIL: You think this is why I wake up and go to work every day -- So you can sit around on your ass?

BOBBY: What did I do?

PHIL: Whatd you do? You never do anything, thats the problem. What kind of a loser are you going to turn out to be? ( hands him boots) Put your boots on.

(Night. Outside the house. PHIL and BOBBY look at shovel stuck in the ground.)

PHIL: You dont leave my tools out in the rain. Tools are for work. They cost money.

BOBBY: Fine, Ill put it away.

PHIL: After youre finished. Pick it up. Im not going to let your mother watch you grow up to be some kind of a jerk. (hands him shovel)

BOBBY: Fine, Ill put it away Phil.

PHIL: No way. Youll finish the job  Now.

BOBBY: (angry) Get away from me! Get away from me now!

(BOBBY drops the shovel and runs into the orchard. PHIL follows him.)

PHIL: Bobby! Bobby! Where are you going?! Bobby! Come back here!

(BOBBY sees the OLD ORCHARD MAN standing nearby holding an axe.)

PHIL: (running through the orchard) Come here! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby? Bobby?

(PHIL suddenly trips on a root and begins sliding into the mud beneath him. BOBBY watches.)

PATTI: (running up to them) Bobby?! Bobby?!

(PATTI watches as BOBBY tries to hold onto PHIL as PHIL slides down in to the mud, drowning.)

SCENE 2
DEPARTMENT OF THE CORONER
11:08 AM

(SCULLY in autopsy scrubs is weighing a lot of mud in hanging scale. MULDER is observing the autopsy.)

SCULLY: 12 pounds, 9 ounces.

MULDER: All that came out of his stomach?

SCULLY: Most of it. The small amount in his lungs is what killed him.

MULDER: Is it possible that he took the term "mud pie" literally?

SCULLY: Well, Im sure if Mr. Rich were alive he would find some humor in that. According to his police report, Mr. Rich was a man who could tell a joke. He grew up here. Worked the same fields for 20 years. Well liked around town. Funny he should turn up murdered.

MULDER: Is that what youve concluded?

SCULLY: I have concluded is that this mans head was held forcibly down in the Michigan mud just a little too long. Most likely by his stepson who was named in the report as Bobby Rich.
Age 16.

MULDER: Well, according to the same report the coroner had to hire a backhoe to remove the body, which was buried completely in a standing vertical position.

SCULLY: There is some indication that his stepson may have dug the hole and that a recent rainstorm may have helped turn it into a muddy trap.

MULDER: That was some rainstorm.

SCULLY: They say it rained 400 inches a day.

MULDER: Now that sounds like an exaggeration, dont you think?

SCULLY: Would you like me to show you how he may have done it?

MULDER: How a 64" 250-pound man was buried alive in less than five minutes by a 16-year-old kid whose classmates lovingly refer to as "Dork-weed?"

SCULLY: (showing bruise on PHILs ankle) He may have had an accomplice.



SCENE 3

(RICH house. BOBBYs room. MULDER is interviewing BOBBY.)

MULDER: (looking at one of BOBBYs posters) "Ich bin ein auslander." "I am an outsider." You know, when Kennedy told the Germans "Ich bin ein Berliner" he was actually saying "I am a cocktail sausage."

BOBBY: (not getting it) Whos Kennedy?

MULDER: (after a second of "Oh, man, Im old" realization) Im not  Im not here to accuse you of anything, Bobby.

BOBBY: What are you here for then?

MULDER: I want to hear your story.

BOBBY: I tried to help. I couldnt.

MULDER: Well, the police arent entirely convinced that thats the truth.

BOBBY: So what the hell am I supposed to do about it? They want me to confess so they have someone to blame.

MULDER: Right. But you see, youre not making it very easy for them to believe otherwise. You understand that?

BOBBY: What can I say? Everybody knows I hated him.

(Downstairs, SCULLY is interviewing PATTI.)

PATTI: They were real close when Bobby was little. Always kidding around and stuff. But Bobby sort of got into that teenage stage  He dont want to listen to nobody.

SCULLY: And it came to a head last night?

PATTI: Phil was late coming home. Hed been stressed out cause of the blight and stuff.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

PATTI: His nut trees all got a disease. And Bobby dont help things out with his attitude and stuff.

SCULLY: Did Phil instigate what happened?

PATTI: Its hard to tell what starts these things. Phil could be stern  just like his own father was to him. But I never saw him raise his hand.

(Upstairs.)

BOBBY: When I saw him lying in the mud, I mean, I half expected him to pull me in. Like he had planned it or something.

MULDER: Did he ever hurt you?

BOBBY: Phil? He used to get off shoving me around, yeah.

MULDER: Did you ever shove him back?

BOBBY: Hes twice as big as me.

MULDER: Thats why some people thought you might have dug the hole. Or attacked him when he fell in the hole because he was down there.

BOBBY: Well, thats their problem, isnt it?

MULDER: You remember what was going through your head at the time?

BOBBY: I guess  I felt he had it coming.

(Downstairs.)

PATTI: He was kneeling over Phil  struggling real hard and stuff.

SCULLY: Could you tell that he was definitely trying to help him?

PATTI: It seemed that way to me.

SCULLY: You know, theres a strong chance the police are going to arrest your son for murder.

PATTI: I dont see how.

SCULLY: But if they do, and if theres evidence of abuse that youre not coming forward with, it could hurt his chances.

PATTI: I know everything happens for a reason, but I still dont see no reason for this.



SCENE 4

(Outside the RICH house. Close up of a thorn on a tree. MULDER touches it and finds very red sap. Looks like blood.)

SCULLY: (coming out of house) Theyre all dying. According to Bobbys mother, thats a big reason why her husband blew up. His hazelnut orchard was hit with a blight.

(MULDER and SCULLY walk through the orchard.)

MULDER: So he pounds the kid. And the kid pounds back. Is that what she told you?

SCULLY: Well not in so many words. Actually, she wont admit to any abuse in the house. I suspect shes just trying to move on and protect what family shes got left.

MULDER: Kid says his stepfather teed off on him regularly.

SCULLY: Thats his excuse?

MULDER: No, thats his explanation. He says hes innocent.

SCULLY: What do you think?

MULDER: I think hes a hard kid to love.

(They get to the place where the father died. The mud has been dug out, leaving a ten foot deep hole.)

MULDER: Im still finding it hard to reconcile the facts with the physical evidence.

SCULLY: Well, even if he didnt dig this hole, the disease could have killed root systems creating weakened soil.

(MULDER climbs down into the hole.)

MULDER: Well, then how did the victim swallow 12 pounds of this stuff?

SCULLY: Well, when you fight for air a vacuum is created. And maybe once he sucked down a mouthful of mud it turned his esophagus into a siphon. With his head pushed down, it filled all of his passages like a gas can.

(MULDER grins at her and nods, laughing at her theory.)

SCULLY: Well  you asked me for answers. Those are the best ones Ive got.

MULDER: Did you ask if anybody else might be involved?

SCULLY: His mother says that Bobby cant make friends. Hes been in therapy for his anger since 1995.

MULDER: That could be me.

(SCULLY sees OLD ORCHARD MAN standing watching them about 30 yards away.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Someones watching us. Sir? Hello.

(As MULDER climbs out of the hole, his foot catches on a root. By the time he gets it free and finishes climbing out of the hole, OLD ORCHARD MAN has disappeared into the trees.)

MULDER: Who was it?

SCULLY: I dont know. Hes gone.



SCENE 5

(High school hallway. Bell rings. LISA BAIOCCHI passes BOBBY on the way to her locker.)

BOBBY: Lisa. Hey.

LISA: What are you doing here?

BOBBY: I - I called you last night. I mean, how come you didnt call me back?

LISA: Theyre saying you killed him, Bobby.

BOBBY: I finally stood up to him.

TEEN 1: Hey, Psycho. (slams LISAs locker closed) Think fast.

BOBBY: Just get away from me, okay?

TEEN 1: (grabbing BOBBY) Or what? What are you going to do, huh?

BOBBY: Maybe Ill kill you, too, huh?

TEEN 1: (laughs nervously) Psycho killer. (walks away)

BOBBY: See All you got to do is stand up. Ill see you later, then.

(LISA walks away, nervously. BOBBY runs down Hall.))



SCENE 6
(KARIN MATTHEWS house. MULDER knocks.)

MULDER: Karin Matthews?

KARIN: Yes.

SCULLY: Were Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.

KARIN: I hope my directions were clear. Im a little tucked away.

(They enter the house.)

KARIN: I first worked with Bobby after an incident at school. Hes had difficulty developing relationships and this difficulty has caused him to act out.

SCULLY: In what way?

KARIN: By putting on certain airs. Affecting an attitude that has drawn the wrong kind of attention to himself. Ive seen him come in here pretty beaten up.

MULDER: Physical violence?

KARIN: More than just kid stuff.

MULDER: Was his stepfather ever involved?

KARIN: Im not free to speak with perfect frankness, of course.

SCULLY: If you know that Bobby committed a crime, youre under legal obligation to tell us.

KARIN: Bobby once spilled a glass of milk at dinner. For the next two weeks, he was forced to eat in the cellar. No table, no chair, no light. Sometimes he was left down there until the following morning. You see, there are all sorts of crimes. (MULDER notices mud on KARINs shoes.) Not just the ones you might find reason to investigate.

MULDER: So youre saying Bobby would have good reason to kill his father.

KARIN: Im saying there are some crimes where there are only victims.

MULDER: Youre free not to answer, Miss Matthews  or youre free to make these vague allusions  but your evasiveness is only going to land this kid in jail for a long, long time.

KARIN: Im not sure I understand.

MULDER: You make it sound like a justification. Like Bobby did it. And I dont think he did.



SCENE 7

(Night. LISA walking alone along a dark road toward her house. BOBBY drives up in his truck. Loud music on the truck radio.)

BOBBY: Hey. What are you doing?

LISA: Going home.

BOBBY: Well, I waited for you. I thought  I thought we were going to talk. So

LISA: You scared me today, Bobby.

BOBBY: Why? Was it because I stood up for myself or, um  because I didnt let them beat me up like usual?

LISA: I got to go.

BOBBY: You got to stand up, Lisa. You got to tell your Dad that youre not going to put up with his crap. There is a way to make it go away  forever.

(She walks on to her house. BOBBY stays parked outside. She enters the house. Her FATHER is waiting for her.)

FATHER: What the hell business you got with him?

LISA: Nothin. Hes just a friend.

(LISA goes up to her room. FATHER follows.)

FATHER: I dont want you seeing that kid. I dont want him coming around here. Do you hear me?

LISA: Stop it, okay?

FATHER: Im doing whats right for you 

LISA: Just shut up!

(LISA goes out of the room and slams the door.)

(FATHER goes to the window and looks out. His face registers shock. Something comes at the window. Loud crash. LISA comes back into the room. The window is shattered. She goes to the broken window and looks down. Her FATHER lies dead on the ground.)



SCENE 8

(Day. Outside LISAs house. MULDER pieces together a smiley faces sticker that was on the broken window.)

SCULLY: The victims name was  Eugene Baiocchi, forties. He was a foreman for one of the local growers. Single parent.

MULDER: Did you get a look at the body?

SCULLY: It had already been removed. I think its pretty clear what killed him, though. From what theyve put together, theyve all but concluded he was pushed out the window.

MULDER: Pushed out?

SCULLY: His daughter Lisa made the 911 call at 8:08 p.m. She says she and her father had a fight.

MULDER: About what?

SCULLY: Bobby.

(Inside the house, KAREN is sitting with LISA.)

KARIN: (quietly) I dont want you to worry about anything, all right? Now, Ill he here for you as much as possible. But theyre going to come and ask you some questions and the most important thing is that you feel comfortable. If you dont fell comfortable answering them, then I dont want you to answer them, okay?

(MULDER and SCULLY enter the house.)

SCULLY: Can I have a moment  with Lisa?

(MULDER and KAREN walk out onto porch leaving SCULLY and LISA inside.)

MULDER: Was Lisa another of you clients?

KARIN: Lisa?

MULDER: Yeah.

KARIN: Yes, for four years.

MULDER: What were you treating her for?

KARIN: An eating disorder.

MULDER: Have you asked her what happened?

KARIN: Isnt that your job?

MULDER: We gather that she had a fight with her father over Bobby Rich.

KARIN: Well, it doesnt surprise me. Lisas father was very disapproving of her generally which stemmed to a lot of her problems.

MULDER: Had you counseled her father?

KARIN: No. My approach is with the victims solely to allow them to empower themselves.

MULDER: In what ways?

KARIN: By breaking the cycle of abuse. By owning it. By confronting it and by standing up against it.

MULDER: Seems to be working.

KARIN: When I told Lisa her aunt was coming to pick her up tomorrow, she started to cry.
It wasnt out of sorrow.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are investigating the house upstairs.)

SCULLY: Three guesses who followed Lisa home last night and was sitting out front in his fathers truck just minutes before this happened.

MULDER: Does she think Bobby did it?

SCULLY: She thinks hes quite capable.

MULDER: I think were all quite capable.

SCULLY: Well, she says that he also threatened to kill a boy in school yesterday.

MULDER: Come here. (SCULLY joins him at the broken window.) Take a look at this. If Lisas father was pushed out, then all the glass would be outside. Look. Theres glass here on the inside. The paint on the mullions is cracked on the outside, not on the inside here.

SCULLY: I dont understand.

MULDER: Well, seems to me like some facts have been assumed. It looks to me like Lisas father was pulled out the window, not pushed.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: That I dont know.

SCULLY: Well, theres nowhere to stand. Even if he did use a ladder thered be no leverage.
I mean, especially for a scrawny 16-year-old kid.

MULDER: Thats my point exactly.



SCENE 9

(High school science class.)

TEACHER: . Na-O-H  and hydrochloric acid. All right, class. There will be a quiz on this tomorrow, so take good notes. Now 

(SCULLY and police enter.)

TEACHER: May I help you?

SCULLY: Sorry to interrupt. (to BOBBY) I need to ask you to come with us, please.

BOBBY: (lots of attitude) What for?

SCULLY: To answer some questions.

BOBBY: About what?

SCULLY: I dont want to have to embarrass you in front of your class.

BOBBY: Well, I aint embarrassed.

(BOBBY gets up leisurely and goes with SCULLY and the police.)



SCENE 10

(Morgue. CORONER opens drawer containing LISAs FATHER. MULDER observes.)

CORONER: Im fairly certain that this man died from a broken neck.

MULDER: Yeah, but there was a substantial amount of blood loss, wasnt there?

CORONER: Yes, but the cuts all missed the artery. I have x-rays, if you dont believe me. Its the fourth and fifth vertebrae.

MULDER: Have you determined if the neck injury was caused by the fall?

CORONER: Well, what else would it have been?

(MULDER finds a sliver of wood imbedded in the FATHERs neck.)

MULDER: Have you seen this? What do you make of this here?

CORONER: (looking at sliver, intrigued and confused) Huh.



SCENE 11

(High School classroom. SCULLY is looking at BOBBYs forearms.)

BOBBY: Are you satisfied?

SCULLY: No, Im not.

(MULDER enters the classroom holding the sliver of wood in an evidence bag.)

MULDER: Scully?

BOBBY: What is that?

MULDER: (pointing to the word on the bag) Evidence.

BOBBY: Of what?

(MULDER doesnt answer. He turns to speak privately with SCULLY.)

SCULLY: (quietly) You just trying to scare him?

MULDER: (quietly) No. I think hes scared enough as it is.

SCULLY: (quietly) Of what?

(MULDER shows SCULLY the bloody splinter.)



SCENE 12

(Night. LISAs house. KARIN and LISA enter.)

KARIN: Ill help getting the rest of your things packed. But I think its best that you go to your aunts as soon as possible.

LISA: Whend she say she was coming?

KARIN: First thing in the morning. Feel it. Its okay. Come on.



SCENE 13

(Later, LISA is lying awake in bed in KARINs house. She hears a strange deep angry voice in the hall.)

DEEP VOICE: You never learn!

KARIN: (voice) Im sorry. Please, just dont yell.

DEEP VOICE: Whatll you ever amount to?

KARIN: (voice) No. Stop it. Stop it.

DEEP VOICE: Where are you going?

KARIN: (voice) Up to my room.

DEEP VOICE: Youre ruining my life. You hear me? I wish youd never been born!

(LISA looks out into the hall and sees KARIN going into a bedroom. No one else is with her.)



SCENE 14

(Night. Outside LISAs house. MULDER and SCULLY where the LISAs father fell.)

SCULLY: What are you looking for?

MULDER: That splinter youre holding came from Mr. Baiocchis neck but it didnt come from the broken window.

SCULLY: Where did it come from?

MULDER: Its greenwood, fresh from a living tree.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Excuse me. Its been a few years.

(MULDER uses a rope to climb a tree near the window.)

SCULLY: What? You think that Bobby climbed this tree to pull Lisas father out of that window?

MULDER: Kind of begs the question, doesnt it? (up in the tree) Hey, Scully, is this demonstration of boyish agility turning you on at all?

(OLD ORCHARD MAN carrying an axe startles SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Who are you?

OLD ORCHARD MAN: I take care of the trees.

MULDER: (from the tree) Scully.

SCULLY: I didnt expect you to be standing right there behind me. You were watching us the other day in the orchard.

OLD ORCHARD MAN: The trees are dying.

MULDER: (from the tree) Scully 

SCULLY: Maybe you should come down here, Mulder. (to OLD MAN, holding out wood splinter) You, uh, know what kind of tree this came from?

OLD ORCHARD MAN: Same as this tree.

(MULDER jumps down and comes to stand beside SCULLY.)

SCULLY: You, uh  you said these trees were dying. This, this splinters live wood.

(OLD ORCHARD MAN suddenly swings axe at tree. Red sap flows out.)

OLD ORCHARD MAN: 20 years ago this happens.

MULDER: What causes this?

OLD ORCHARD MAN: A very bad man.



SCENE 15

(KARINs house. LISA walks through the kitchen to the cellar door. Muddy footprints are on the floor. She slowly opens the door and goes down the stairs. The floor is muddy. She sees a pair of feet. Light pops on at head of stairs.)

DEEP VOICE: (outside the cellar door) Shes just like you  a little snoop! Where is she?

(Door slams shut.)



SCENE 16

(Day. KARINs house. MULDER and SCULLY knock. KARIN opens the door.)

MULDER: Ms. Matthews, wed like to ask you a few questions.

KARIN: About what?

MULDER: Your fathers death. We need to clarify a few details.

KARIN: My father? He died twenty years ago

MULDER: Yeah, under rather curious circumstances. His body was pulled from the mud of an orchard?

KARIN: I-Im sorry, I was just a-a young girl. I dont know why you want to talk to me.

MULDER: Well, we thought it was strange that you didnt bother to mention it.

KARIN: Well, I dont see that it matters.

MULDER: We spoke to someone who thinks it does. Someone who worked for you father? According to the orchard man, Your fathers death brought about the end of a blight affecting the trees.

KARIN: My father was a powerful man. Powerful men are prone to inspire this kind of fantasy. Dont tell me youve been taken in by it, too.

SCULLY: Is Lisa still staying with you?

KARIN: No, shes not. Shes gone to her aunts. Look, Im sorry. I cant help.

(KARIN closes the door. MULDER and SCULLY return to their car. In the cellar, LISA bangs on the window.)

LISA: Help me! Im down here! Help!

KARIN: (behind cellar door, whispering) Lisa . Lisa.

(LISA runs up to the door.)

LISA: Karin  Karin! Karin! Karin.

KARIN: (behind cellar door, whispering) Lisa, youve got to be quiet  quiet as a mouse  or hes going to hear you down there.

LISA: Karin, Im scared. Let me out, please.

KARIN: (behind door, whispering) I will, but not until its safe.

LISA: Karin, Karin, I dont want to stay down here. Please let me out. Karin 



SCENE 17

(Dusk. Graveyard. MULDER is digging up KARINs FATHERs grave. Scully watches.)

SCULLY: Mulder, whatever youre hoping we find here  without a court order, it wont be admissible.

MULDER: Im not expecting it to be.

(MULDER gets the coffin open. There is no body. The coffin is completely filled with tree roots.)

SCULLY: Mulder  Wheres the body?



SCENE 18

(KARINs house. AUNT LINDA drives up in a Volvo. She knocks at the door. KARIN answers.)

KARIN: Yes?

AUNT LINDA: Im Linda Baiocchi. Lisas aunt. Are you Karin?

KARIN: Yes

AUNT LINDA: Is Lisa here?

KARIN: No. She went  Shes gone to the bus station.

AUNT LINDA: She has? But it was all arranged

KARIN: I dont know what to tell you. Im sorry. There must have been a misunderstanding.

(KARIN closes the door. Frustrated, AUNT LINDA returns to her car. She hears LISA break the cellar window.)

LISA: Im down here! Help me! Aunt Linda, Im down here!

(AUNT LINDA goes to the broken cellar window and kneels down to talk to LISA.)

AUNT LINDA: What are you doing down there?

LISA: Just get me out, please?

AUNT LINDA: Okay. Itll be okay. Im going to call the police.

(AUNT LINDA gasps as a tree limb stabs her from behind through the chest, killing her. Very gory. LISA screams.)



SCENE 19

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY walking back to their car from the graveyard, MULDER carrying a shovel.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you still havent answered my question. What happened to Karins father? Why would anybody steal his body?

MULDER: I dont think this was an act of grave robbing, Scully. (puts shovel in trunk of car)

SCULLY: No. Thats what we were doing.

MULDER: More like an act of nature.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

(MULDER and SCULLY stand outside car as it rains and they miraculously dont get wet!)

MULDER: The orchard man said that the blight that plagues this town was caused by a man  implying a connection.

SCULLY: Im a little afraid to ask what kind of connection.

MULDER: Between the people of this valley and their livelihood : the trees. Look at the victims, Scully.

SCULLY: Bobbys father, Lisas father 

MULDER: And Karins father, 20 years ago: all men who worked in these orchards -- their lives and deaths tied to these trees. We removed a sliver of greenwood from Lisas fathers neck. And the bruise that you found on Bobbys fathers ankle could have been caused by a root -- The same root system that pulled Karins father from his grave.

SCULLY: Mulder, there is a connection between these deaths  one that provides a clear motive and intent: These were abused children 

MULDER: Who couldnt defend themselves.

SCULLY: What? So nature did it for them?

MULDER: Something did it for them  or someone controlling nature. Karin said she was counseling Bobby and Lisa to empower them. I think we should talk to them.

SCULLY: I called Lisa at her aunts house 20 minutes ago and there was no answer.

MULDER: Then we should talk to Bobby.

SCULLY: Mulder, weve already questioned him twice.

MULDER: Maybe we havent asked him the right question.

(They get in the car.)



SCENE 20

(BOBBYs room. MULDER and SCULLY interviewing BOBBY. PATTI is in the room also.)

BOBBY: I dont know what youre talking about.

MULDER: Yes, you do. Maybe you hated your stepfather, but you didnt kill him. You dont have it in you.

BOBBY: Thats good. Thats really good. Can I go now?

MULDER: No. You cant go until you tell me the truth. For the first time in your life people are taking you seriously and I think they should take you seriously. I think youre a serious kid. Not an outsider anymore, huh?

BOBBY: Yeah. Im thinking about running for ASB president. So why dont you just give it up?

MULDER: Why dont you give it up? Why dont you tell me what happened that night? You took the shovel to him, but you couldnt do it, so you ran, you ran to the orchard, but not because you dug a hole or laid a trap --

(BOBBY FLASHBACK: PHIL chasing him through the orchard.)

MULDER:  because you were afraid, not of Phil.

(BOBBY FLASHBACK: PHIL drowning in the mud.)

MULDER: You werent afraid of Phil Phil never hit you or hurt you in that way. In fact, I think you wanted to help Phil.

(BOBBY FLASHBACK: PHIL screaming as he sinks into the mud.)

MULDER: You wanted to save him. You didnt want Phil to die, did you?

(BOBBY sobbing.)

MULDER: What were you afraid of, Bobby?

BOBBY: I couldnt do it.

MULDER: Couldnt do what?

BOBBY: I couldnt stand up to him. But she made me.

MULDER: She who?

KARIN: K-Karin. Karin she-she made me, uh 

(Flashback of BOBBY yelling at an emotionless KARIN.)

BOBBY: (flashback) Youre a loser! You understand me?! I wish youd never been born!! Youre ruining my life!!

MULDER: Karin made you what?

BOBBY: She made me say those things. She had me pretend that I was him  that I was - I was Phil.

MULDER: She made you believe you were a victim but you werent, were you?

BOBBY: She  said I have  the power to - to make it all go away. But I  I didnt mean for him to die.

(PATTI walks over and holds BOBBY as he cries.)

PATTI: Its okay.



SCENE 21

(KARINs basement. LISA alone and frightened.)

DEEP VOICE: (outside cellar door) You think you can hide down there? You think youre safe?

(Door opens. KARIN stand there.)

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: Youll wish you were dead.



SCENE 22
KARIN MATTHEWS RESIDENCE
8:43 PM

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY arrive and enter the house. The door is not locked.)

MULDER: Karin?

(MULDER sees muddy footprints on kitchen floor.)

MULDER: Scully. Take a look at this.

(They go downstairs and find KARINs fathers body in the cellar covered in roots as if he has been dragged through the wall.)

SCULLY: Mulder 

MULDER: Talk about putting down roots.

SCULLY: What the hell is going on here?

MULDER: I think were looking at Karin Matthews father.

SCULLY: But how did he get here?

MULDER: The same way Bobbys father got pulled down into that mud.

SCULLY: Mulder, I 

MULDER: This has to do with Karin, with her own fathers abuse. It was never Bobby that was locked in the cellar. Karin was. Karin caused all this.

SCULLY: You think Karin is the killer?

MULDER: I think shes the killer and the victim.

(They hear a slap and a cry upstairs and run up to kitchen where they see LISA sitting on floor crying.)

MULDER: Lisa  Wheres Karin.

(LISA sobs.)

SCULLY: Youre going to be okay.

MULDER: You stay with her, Scully.

(MULDER get in car to follow KARIN. Along a two lane road a tree falls in front of MULDERs car. A tree limb punches through the windshield and the drivers seat. Fortunately, MULDER has fallen into the passenger seat. He works his way under the limb and out the passenger door, climbs over the fallen tree and keeps pursuing KARIN.)



SCENE 23

(BOBBYs house. KARIN knocks on the door. PATTI answers. KARIN is hysterical.)

KARIN: I need to see Bobby.

PATTI: Im sorry. Bobbys not here.

(BOBBY listens from top of stairs.)

KARIN: (voice) Hes in danger.

PATTI: (voice) Get away from here, please.

KARIN: Bobby!

PATTI: Hes not here.

KARIN: Where is he?!

(BOBBY runs out the back and through the orchard. KARIN runs after him.)

KARIN: Bobby! Bobby! Bobby! Bobby!

(KARIN advances on BOBBY.)

BOBBY: Stay away from me! Im warning you.

(Ground underneath BOBBY turns to mud and he begins sinking.)

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: Youre pathetic.

(MULDER comes running toward them.)

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: You little piece of garbage.

MULDER: Karin! Stop!

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: You stay away from him!

MULDER: Stand up to him!

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: Karin deserves what she gets.

MULDER: (trying to keep BOBBY from sinking into the mud, to KARIN) Make him stop, Karin! Tell him what you should have told him 20 years ago. Youre not going to take it anymore.

KARIN/DEEP VOICE: Karins dead.

(MULDER has now sunk into the mud with BOBBY. OLD ORCHARD MAN comes up and swings axe and chops off KARINs head.)

OLD ORCHARD MAN: (dropping axe) Its done now. No more.

(MULDER and BOBBY up to their necks in mud watch KARINs head and body sink into the mud. SCULLY, PATTI and LISA come running up. Under MULDERs voiceover, SCULLY helps MULDER and PATTI and LISA help BOBBY out of the mud.)

(Voiceover A, what was broadcast)

MULDER: Coats Grove authorities conducted a detailed examination of the soil and root composition in the Rich family orchard, but could not explain what pulled Karin Matthews body into the Michigan mud. Nor could the authorities determine how the body of Karins father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier. While the forensic data is inconclusive, I believe the explanation lies in hospital records dating back to Karins childhood, which suggests that she, herself was a victim of abuse.

(Picture of KARIN and her father.)

Rage, unconfronted, takes its own path. I believe it was Karins unconfronted rage that forced her to face her buried father. This same rage made her imagine victims in the children around her, trying to instill in them a strength she never found in herself. What happened to Karin Matthews in the orchard that night was a release. Release for a victim, who, unable to face up to her own past was finally consumed by it.

(Voiceover B , Closed Captioning)

MULDER: (voiceover) Abuse exists, as does the blindness that accompanies it. The pleading cries in the night followed by the disturbing denial of culpability: "If something bad happened, I didnt see it." As witness to a horrific event, I am forced to question the frequently blurred line between right and wrong to weigh the guilt of one mans act against anothers to decide if justice was served or if a grievous injustice has prevailed. And if pressed on the subject of what happened that last night in the orchard, I will speak as truthfully as I can: If something bad happened, I didnt see it.

[THE END]
                                  CHINGA



SCENE 1

(Car with Maine license plate # 384M 95 . MELISSA TURNER walks to the passenger side of the car and opens the door for her young daughter POLLY who is holding a large doll.)

MELISSA: Okay, sweetheart. Were just going in for a few things. We wont be long, okay. Polly? Mommy needs some groceries, okay?

(POLLY does not respond. MELISSA unbuckles the seatbelt and helps her out. As they enter the grocery store, an older woman, JANE FROELICH glares at them. MELISSA ignores her. POLLY looks back at her.)

(Inside the store, MELISSA wheels the cart quickly and nervously down the aisle. POLLY sits in the child seat of the cart with her doll. People watch them suspiciously. They pass by the butchers counter. DAVE, the butcher watches them pass.)

POLLY: I dont like this store, Mommy.

MELISSA: Were only going to be a minute.

POLLY: I want to go home.

(The dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: (high-pitched creepy voice) Lets have fun.

(As they pass the refrigerated section, MELISSA sees an image of DAVE in the glass. He has a knife through his right eye.)

DAVES IMAGE: Help, Melissa.

(MELISSA quickly wheels the cart to the front of the store. The cart has a bad wheel.)

MELISSA: (picking up POLLY) Were going home, Polly. Please, dont do this to Mommy.

(Nearby, there is the sound of breaking glass as a woman drops her basket and begins clawing at her eyes. MELISSA runs out of the store with POLLY as everyone in the store begins clawing at their eyes. DAVE comes out of the back of the store and sees what is happening. He suddenly claws at his eyes, then runs back to his phone and dials 911.)

DAVE: Its Dave, down at the Super Saver. Send whoever you got on duty.

(Dave sees a fuzzy reflection of the doll in the metal door of a meat locker.)

DOLLS IMAGE: I want to play.

(DAVE pulls out a knife as if to attack the doll, but then aims the knife at his own eye. He is struggling against himself, but the knife moves closer to his right eye. The camera cuts away just as we hear him scream. Doll is still reflected on locker, watching.)

SCENE 2

(A convertible drives down a street in the small Maine harbor town. SCULLY pulls the convertible into a gas station, gets out and begins filling the tank . She is wearing a Maine tourist T-shirt  and jeans and very cool shades. She hears her cell phone ringing. She gets the keys out of the ignition, opens the trunk of the car and pulls out her phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(MULDER is in the office rocking on the back of a chair, obviously very bored.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, its me.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, I thought we had an agreement. We were both going to take the weekend off.

MULDER: (on phone) Right, right. I know. But I - I just received some information about - about a case. A classic X-files --- classic. I wanted to share it with you.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Im on vacation. The weather is clear. Im looking forward to hitting the road and breathing in some of this fine New England air.

MULDER: (on phone) You didnt rent a convertible, did you?

SCULLY: (on phone) Why?

MULDER: (on phone) Are you aware of the statistics of decapitation?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Im hanging up. Im turning off my cell phone. Im back in the office on Monday.

MULDER: (on phone) You shouldnt talk and drive at the same time. Are you aware of the statistics .? Hello?

(SCULLY has hung up. She drives the car into the grocery store lot, almost hitting MELISSAS car as MELISSA speeds away. SCULLY looks slightly disgusted. Then she sees an OLD MAN staggering out of the store with bloody eyes.)

SCULLY: Sir  Sir, what happened?

OLD MAN: (disoriented) I .. I think we need a doctor.

(SCULLY walks into store. People are moaning and crying and have horribly scratched eyes)

STORE MANAGER: (in pain) Who are you?

SCULLY: Im .. my name is Scully. Im an FBI agent. What happened to you?

STORE MANAGER: I dont know. But Dave, the butcher .. I think hes dead.

(SCULLY goes to the back and looks at DAVES body, knife sticking out of his eye socket.)



SCENE 3

(X-Files office. Mulder is eating sunflower seeds and watching television. Lots of groaning and moaning from a male and a female voice. Empty video cassette box on MULDERS desk reads "Alien Probe." Phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, its me.

MULDER: (on phone) I thought you said you were on vacation.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) I am. Im up in Maine.

MULDER: (on phone) I thought you said you didnt want to be disturbed. You wanted to get out of your head for a few days.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) I dont  I mean, I do. I . (moaning from TV is loud) What are you watching, Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Its the Worlds Deadliest Swarms. (Fumbles with remote to stop the tape.) Um .. you said you were going to be unreachable. Whats going on?

SCULLY: (on phone) I, uh  Im at a market here. Im just trying to give the local PD a handle here.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) A handle on what?

(SCULLY is in store office watching security tape footage of people clawing at their eyes.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Im not quite sure how to describe it, Mulder. I didnt witness it myself but there seems to be some kind of an outbreak of people acting in a violent, involuntary way.

MULDER: (on phone) Towards who?

(MULDER switches off TV, which now shows man being attacked by bugs. Remember, tape has already been stopped.)

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Toward themselves.

MULDER: (on phone) Themselves?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. Beating at their faces, clawing at their eyes. One man is dead.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Dead? How?

SCULLY: (on phone) Self-inflicted, it appears.

MULDER: (on phone) Huh  it sounds to me like thats witchcraft or maybe some sorcery that youre looking for there.

(Local PD Captain, JACK BONSAINT watches SCULLY strangely throughout conversation with MULDER.)

SCULLY: (on phone) No, I dont think its witchcraft, Mulder, or sorcery. Ive had a look around and I dont see any evidence that warrants that kind of suspicion.

MULDER: (on phone) Maybe you dont know what youre looking for.

SCULLY: (on phone) Like evidence of conjury or the black arts or shamanism, divination, Wicca or any kind of pagan or neo-Pagan practice. Charms, cards .

(MULDER is listening, spellbound.)

SCULLY: (on phone)  familiars, bloodstones, or hex signs or any of the ritual tableaux associated with the occult, Santeria, Voudoun, Macumba, or any high or low magic?

MULDER: (on phone) Scully 

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes?

MULDER: (on phone) Marry me.

SCULLY: (on phone) I was hoping for something a little more helpful.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, you know, short of looking for a lady wearing a pointy hat riding a broomstick, I think you pretty much got it covered there.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thanks anyway. (hangs up, looks at tape again)

SCULLY: (to OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS) Whos that woman right there?

BUDDY: Melissa Turner.

SCULLY: Shes the only one Ive seen who looks unaffected.

BUDDY: Whats your point?

SCULLY: You might want to talk to her.

(SCULLY leaves the store office. Captain JACK BONSAINT follows her.)

BONSAINT: (smiling, very friendly) Ms. Scully  you staying in town?

SCULLY: Yes. Im on vacation. Why?

BONSAINT: Well, what you said back there about Melissa Turner kind of put a spin on this whole business here today.

SCULLY: Hows that?

BONSAINT: Well, Melissas caused some stir. People here say shes a witch.

SCULLY: Well, thats not the first time for that accusation in these parts.

BONSAINT: Ayuh.

SCULLY: Look, to be honest with you, Captain Bonsaint, um, Im not much of a believer in witchcraft.

BONSAINT: Well, you know, Im not either. I used to just think its cause Melissa was pretty and single. Threatening, you know?

SCULLY: But now youre not convinced?

BONSAINT: Well, you know, I appreciate the trouble you went to, and I sure do hope theres a reasonable explanation like you said  just this one thing going to make it hard to persuade folks to your thinking.

SCULLY: What one thing is that?

BONSAINT: Who shes been carrying on with.

SCULLY: Who shes been carrying on with?

BONSAINT: Ayuh. With Dave, the butcher.



SCENE 4

(Back in store office, OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS calls MELISSA.)

MELISSA: (on phone) Hello?

(At MELISSAS house, the HOKEY POKEY song is playing on POLLYS record player. POLLY, holding her doll, watches MELISSA.)

BUDDY: (on phone) Hey. Its Buddy.

MELISSA: Oh, hi.

BUDDY: (on phone) Are you okay, Melissa?

MELISSA: (on phone) Im fine. Why do you ask?

POLLY: Whos that, Mommy?

BUDDY: (on phone) I know you were here, Melissa. Down at the Super Saver.

MELISSA: (on phone) I dont know what youre talking about, Buddy.

POLLY: Hang up. Mommy.

BUDDY: (on phone) Melissa, turn the music down. Theres some talk that youre involved in what happened here today.

MELISSA: (on phone, going downstairs and outside) Im not involved in anything.

BUDDY: (on phone) I know that. Would you listen to me? Im not saying that you are.

MELISSA: (on phone) What are you saying?

POLLY: (from inside) Mommy!

BUDDY: (on phone) I want to help you, but youve got to keep it a secret or were both going to be answering questions. Now, Ive got something to tell you.

MELISSA: (on phone) What?

BUDDY: (on phone) Something bad.

MELISSA: (on phone) What is it, Buddy?

BUDDY: (on phone) Daves dead.

MELISSA: (on phone) Oh, my God!

BUDDY: (on phone) Ive got to see you right away, Melissa.

MELISSA: (on phone) I cant.

BUDDY: (on phone) You need a friend more than ever.

(Upstairs, POLLY sits with the doll, listening to the Hokey Pokey. Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: Lets have fun.

MELISSA: (on phone) You cant come here, Buddy.

BUDDY: (on phone) Why? Tell me why?

MELISSA: (on phone) I cant explain it to you now.

BUDDY: (on phone) Im coming over there, Melissa. You shouldnt be alone.

(Behind MELISSA outside, we see the shadow of the doll on a sheet hanging to dry on a clothesline.)



SCENE 5
MELISSA TURNER RESIDENCE
2:08 PM

(BONSAINT and SCULLY drive up in a patrol car and get out. BONSAINT knocks on front door. No answer. SCULLY looks in a window.)

SCULLY: Back doors wide open.

(They go around to back.)

BONSAINT: Melissa! (to SCULLY) Sheets are still wet.

(SCULLY enters house, goes up to POLLYS room and looks at windows which are nailed shut.)

SCULLY: Chief? Take a look at this.

BONSAINT: What the devils this for?

SCULLY: It looks like she was afraid of something.

BONSAINT: Whatever it is, shes run off in a hurry. Laundrys out. Doors unlocked. Beats me.

SCULLY: You know her?

BONSAINT: Melissy Turner?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

BONSAINT: About as local as you can get. Born and raised here. Married a fisherman. Widowed last year after a boating accident. Dont know if the little girl, Polly ever really understood. Toys in the attic.

SCULLY: The daughters autistic?

BONSAINT: Thats what they say. There was the incident last year over at the daycare center? Proprietor slapped Polly across the face.

SCULLY: Slapped her? What for?

BONSAINT: Well, she said Polly threw a tantrum so fierce there was nothing else she could do. Next thing she knew, shes on the ground. Little girl knocked her silly.

SCULLY: The little girl did?

BONSAINT: Well, thats her story. Polly never touched her, far as I could figure. Oh, it was a real drama, though. The lady who ran the school lost her license. People calling the kid all manner of names saying Melissas a witch. Polly never went back to school a day since.

SCULLY: This ah, this affair that the mother was having with the butcher ?

BONSAINT: Dave. Oh, I might have given you the wrong impression. That wasnt really an affair. Although Dave did make quite a fool of himself and his wife.

SCULLY: So, it was unrequited.

BONSAINT: You could say that.

SCULLY: To the extent that shed have to nail her windows shut?

BONSAINT: Oh, he wasnt that big a fool. You know, maybe she wasnt afraid of something getting in. Maybe shes afraid of something getting out.

SCULLY: Like what?

BONSAINT: Just a thought.



SCENE 6

(Fast food restaurant. OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS sets a chocolate sundae in front of POLLY who is holding her doll.)

BUDDY: What do you think of that, huh?

(POLLY does not answer. She eats the cherry, then begins eating the sundae. OFFICER BRIGGS pats her on the head and goes to sit with MELISSA. They talk quietly.)

BUDDY: Why dont you leave town?

MELISSA: Ive got nowhere to go, Buddy. I live on a shoestring as it is.

BUDDY: Listen to me. Ive got some money put away.

MELISSA: Buddy, I cant!

BUDDY: Ive had my eye on you, Melissa, for more years than I care to remember. You know, I missed my chance the first time around. Ive been waiting in the wings. Now, Im sorry about things, truly I am, but you need somebody who can provide.

MELISSA: Dont, Buddy, please!

BUDDY: "Dont" because you dont want to, or just because youre too proud?

MELISSA: You dont understand!

(They watch POLLY take her sundae up to the counter.)

BUDDY: What dont I understand?

MELISSA: What happened in the Super Saver, what happened to Dave  I couldnt stop it.

BUDDY: What do you mean?

MELISSA: Ive seen things.

(POLLY has gone up to the counter.)

POLLY: I want more cherries.

(WAITRESS with really long ponytail answers her.)

WAITRESS: Whats that, sweetie?

POLLY: (not sweet) I want more cherries!

(MELISSA and OFFICER BRIGGS still talking at table.)

MELISSA: I saw Dave dead. Before he was dead. I saw him in frozen foods all cut and bloody and its not the first time. My husband  I saw him in a window dead before it happened. You know, with a hook?

(At counter)

POLLY: I want more cherries, now!

WAITRESS: Youll have to go ask your Mommy for some more money, hon. I just cant give them away.

WAITER: Window order.

(Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: Lets have fun.

POLLY: Mommy, I want more cherries.

MELISSA: We got to go now, Polly.

OFFICER BRIGGS: (holding up a key) Take this, Melissa. Its a place we use for hunting up near Schoodic Lake 

POLLY: Mommy!

OFFICER BRIGGS: or else theres going to be trouble. More than you need.

POLLY: Mommy! Mommy!

(WAITRESSS long hair gets caught in the milkshake mixing machine. She begins screaming as blood appears at her hairline. OFFICER BRIGGS rushes to help her. MELISSA and POLLY run out the door.)



SCENE 7

(JANE FROELICHS house. JANE looks through door window.)

JANE: Is that you, Jack?

BONSAINT: Uh, yeah, its me, Jane. Come in?

JANE: (opens door, hostile) Whove you got with you?

SCULLY: Miss Froelich, my names Dana Scully. Im with the FBI. I just happen to be here on vacation , and uh 

JANE: So?

SCULLY: So, I just am helping out the chief here.

JANE: You talked to her?

SCULLY: Who?

JANE: Oh, please. Melissa Turner. That whores a witch sure as Im standing here. Shes descended from the Hawthornes in Salem and the Englishes, too. She comes from a cursed lineage and now shes passing it on to the whelp. God save that little girl if somebody dont do something. Lord knows I tried.

BONSAINT: Jane, if we could just come in for a few minutes and talk.

JANE: I found out last year how much good talking to you does, Jack Bonsaint. I explained everything and the city closed me down anyway. Our great-great-grandfathers knew how to treat witches. They would have driven the demon out of that little girl and given that slattern of a mother just what shes got coming! (slams door)

SCULLY: New England hospitality. Heard about it my whole life. Finally got a chance to experience it for myself.

(JANE watches them walk to the car.)

BONSAINT: Well, you see what Im up against here, public sentiment and all.

SCULLY: This family tree of Melissa Turners...

BONSAINT: Ayuh..

SCULLY: Its all talk, isnt it?

BONSAINT: Oh, I never really asked. Why?

SCULLY: Well, I think you need to bring her in to straighten this out.

BONSAINT: Under what pretext?

SCULLY: That she might know something.

BONSAINT: About what?

SCULLY: Well, about what Im sure is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this.

BONSAINT: Ayuh.

SCULLY: Well, I wish I could help you out. You know, Im just  on vacation.

(They get in car. SCULLY watches JANE standing in the window, watching them.)



SCENE 8
SHOODIC LAKE RANGERS STATION
11:06 PM

(MELISSA drives up to the rangers station. POLLY is asleep beside her. RANGER comes out to greet them.)

MELISSA: Hi.

RANGER: Where are you headed this time of night?

MELISSA: We were invited up to a place near the lake.

RANGER: Uh-huh.

MELISSA: A friend gave us the key.

RANGER: You got gear? Food and water?

MELISSA: Well be all right.

RANGER: I just want to make sure of that, maam. Winters in full force up there. Powers iffy. Just you and the little one?

MELISSA: For now.

POLLY: I want to go home, Mommy.

MELISSA: Were going to go camping, Polly.

POLLY: I want my bed! I want my records!

(Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: Lets have fun.

RANGER: Ill just take you license number, then.

(RANGER walks around back. MELISSA looks at rear window and sees reflection of JANE FROELICH, throat slit.)

JANES IMAGE: Help me ..

(MELISSA accelerates quickly, forcing RANGER to jump out of the way, then she speeds back the way she came.)



SCENE 9

(JANE FROELICHS house. Hokey Pokey is playing. JANE is dressed in bathrobe. She turns on light and starts down hall toward sound of the music.)

JANE: Hello?

(She enters living room.)

JANE: Whos there? Is there anyone there?

(Light switch doesnt work. 45s are spread around the floor next to an old record player. JANE raises plastic covering the record player and lifts needle off the record. Music stops. Shadow moves behind JANE.)

DOLLS VOICE: I want to play.

(JANE drops needle and music starts again. JANES hand begins to shake. She bends down and picks up a broken record that she just stepped on. Hokey Pokey begins skipping - "Thats what its all about" over and over. JANE holds broken record in front of her.)

JANE: Im not afraid of you.

(She tries to resist, but brings the broken record to her neck. Camera pans away just before she cuts herself. We hear her gurgle in pain. Hokey Pokey stops skipping and finishes the song.)



SCENE 10

(SCULLYS hotel room. Classical music. SCULLY is in a bubble bath, very relaxed. Hotel phone rings. SCULLY opens one eye, sighs, then reaches a bubbly leg out of the tub to slam the bathroom door. Camera pans across room showing used room service tray and CD boom box playing the classical music. SCULLY comes out of the bathroom wearing a black velour lounging outfit and a towel around her head. She turns down the CD player. Beside the phone is a copy of Affirmations for Women Who Do Too Much. The message light on the phone is blinking. SCULLY sighs, probably thinking "Mulder," and ignores the flashing light. She goes to the window and flings open the curtain obviously expecting sunshine and escapism.. Outside, CAPTAIN JACK BONSAINT gets out of is patrol car and smiles and waves at her. SCULLY smiles tightly, then heads for the door with a resigned expression.)



SCENE 11

(Coroners wheel JANES body out of her house. BONSAINT and SCULLY drive up and enter the house.)

BONSAINT: Looks like she died by her own hand. A big slice under the chin opened up the artery.

SCULLY: With what?

BONSAINT: Buddy, show her the thing.

(A cell phone begins ringing.)

(OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS shows her a bloody broken record in an evidence bag.)

BONSAINT: (on phone) Jack Bonsaint. Ayuh.  Who?  Oh, okay. Put him through.
(to SCULLY) Its for you.

(SCULLY is surprised.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, morning, sunshine.

(There is a repetitive banging sound from MULDERS end. He speaks loudly to compensate.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah. I was a little worried about you. I was wondering if you needed my help up there.

SCULLY: (on phone) Needed your help on what?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) I left you a message at the motel. You didnt get it?

SCULLY: (on phone) I was up and out this morning. Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah?

SCULLY: (on phone) Whats that noise? Where are you?

MULDER: (on phone) Im at home. Theyre doing construction right out the window. Hold on a second. (to imaginary construction workers) Hey fellas! Can you just keep it down for a second, maybe? (He bounces his basketball twice more and tosses it away from him. It crashes into some piece of furniture. MULDER pauses then picks up phone again.) Thank you. (to SCULLY) Yeah, hey. I was - I was thinking about this case. You know, maybe its not witchcraft after all. Maybe theres a scientific explanation.

SCULLY: (on phone) A scientific explanation?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, a medical cause. Something called chorea.

SCULLY: (on phone) Dancing sickness.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, St. Vituss dance.

(MULDER opens his refrigerator. It contains absolutely nothing besides a jug of orange juice.)

MULDER: (on phone) It affect groups of people causing unexplained outbursts of uncontrollable jerks and spasms.

(MULDER takes a swig of the juice straight from the bottle. )

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, and hasnt been diagnosed since the Middle Ages.

(MULDER makes a face at the taste of the juice and looks at the date on the bottle. OCT. 97)

MULDER: (on phone) Oh. (Spits juice back into bottle.) Youre obviously not a fan of American Bandstand, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?

SCULLY: (on phone) Thanks for the help. (Hangs up.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hello?

BONSAINT: That your partner?

SCULLY: Yep.

BONSAINT: Im sorry for eavesdropping but has he maybe got some insight on this?

SCULLY: (definitive) No.

BONSAINT: I see.

(OFFICER RIGGS plays the record that was on the player - Hokey Pokey. Privately, RIGGS seems to remember it was playing in the background when he last spoke on the phone to MELISSA. He turns it off.)

SCULLY: You know, Chief Bonsaint  Jack  can I call you Jack? Ive been thinking that maybe  maybe we need to explore other possibilities.

BONSAINT: Im not sure I understand.

SCULLY: Well, maybe we need to keep our minds open to  extreme possibilities.

BONSAINT: Okay, but arent you on vacation?

(SCULLY sort of nods, then looks away.)



SCENE 12

(Turner house. Hokey Pokey is playing. Polly is napping with the doll. As song ends, MELISSA enters and begins to take doll away from POLLY. Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: Let's have fun.

(MELISSA backs away in horror. Record player starts over on its own. MELISSA goes back down stairs to kitchen and begins crying. She looks up and sees reflection of OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS in her kitchen window holding his nightstick.)

BUDDYS IMAGE: Melissa  help me.

MELISSA: No!



SCENE 13

(Restaurant. SCULLY and BONSAINT at a table. Waitress places a very large lobster in front of them. BONSAINT sighs with pleasure.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god! That looks like something out of Jules Verne. Were supposed to eat that?

BONSAINT: (ripping off a piece) A little late for anything else. You said you had some other directions you were looking at?

SCULLY: Ive been thinking about Melissa Turner. Now, you said that her husband died in a boating accident?

BONSAINT: (eating lobster with much cracking) Ayuh.

SCULLY: Well, was there anything strange about that? About the way that it happened?

BONSAINT: Well it was never quite explained to anyones satisfaction, actually.

SCULLY: Hows that?

BONSAINT: (rips off more lobster) How the man got a grappling hook poked clean through his skull.

SCULLY: Was Melissa ever questioned about that?

BONSAINT: Melissa? No. I dont see how shed be involved. The boat he died on is right over there if youre at all wondering.

(They look out window and see the OLD MAN on a small fishing boat.)

SCULLY: I saw that man at the market.

(Outside, OLD MAN throws a bucket or water over the side of the boat.)



SCENE 14

(Turner house. POLLY, holding her doll, puts a record on her record player.)

POLLY: I want popcorn, Mommy.

(MELISSA looks in the room as POLLY starts her record player. Hokey Pokey.)

MELISSA: Okay.

(MELISSA turns and is started to see OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS.)

BUDDY: What are you doing here?

MELISSA: Buddy!

BUDDY: How come youre back in town?

MELISSA: Youve got to get out of here, Buddy.

BUDDY: You know, I called the rangers. They said you tried to kill a man. You almost ran him over. You came back to kill her, too, didnt you?

MELISSA: I didnt try to kill anybody.

BUDDY: Jane Froelich.

MELISSA: It isnt me, Buddy.

BUDDY: Well, were going to see about that. Youre coming in with me. You and your little brat.

(POLLY turns the doll to face BUDDY. Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: I want to play.



SCENE 15

(Night. On the boat, SCULLY and BONSAINT interviewing the OLD MAN. OLD MAN still has scratches around his eyes.)

OLD MAN: What happened? You ask that question around here, you get as many stories as  as fishermen.

SCULLY: You were on board the night that he died. What do you think?

OLD MAN: I told my story to the Chief.

SCULLY: Peoples stories change.

OLD MAN: Folks blame the widow.

SCULLY: Who do you blame?

OLD MAN: He was wild for her.

CUT TO:
(Night before the father died. As OLD MAN tells the story, FATHER pulls up a trap and finds the doll.)

OLD MAN: (voiceover) He worked very hard to build that little house for her and when that daughter came, youd need a mop to wipe that smile off his face. Wed set out to sea on the girls last birthday. He was counting the hours before hed be home again.

FATHER: Hey, look what Davy Jones sent my little Polly. Catch of the day.

OLD MAN: Ayuh.

CUT TO:
(Present.)

OLD MAN: Three days later, he was dead.

SCULLY: And you know what killed him.

OLD MAN: The eyes play tricks at night, water up against the hull making noises.

CUT TO:
(Night FATHER died. FATHER is alone on deck.)

OLD MAN: (voiceover) Sometimes you hear things.

DOLLS VOICE: Lets have fun.

FATHER: What the hell was that?

(FATHER picks up a long curved grappling hook. He opens cabin door, waking the OLD MAN.)

OLD MAN: What is it?

(FATHER doesnt answer, just goes back outside. OLD MAN hears the voice.)

DOLLS VOICE: I want to play.

(OLD MAN gets up and goes outside. He sees the FATHER with the hook through his head.)

OLD MAN: Oh, my God.

CUT TO:
(Present.)

OLD MAN: Like I said, the eyes play tricks.

SCULLY: But you saw something in that grocery store. That little girl and her dolly.

OLD MAN: Moment I saw them, I knew.



SCENE 16

(SCULLY and BONSAINT are getting back in the car. SCULLYS phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully

MULDER: (on phone) Hey. I thought you werent answering your cell phone.

(MULDER, tie undone, is sitting at a desk  which has an upside down map of Kentucky behind it. He is playing with the phone cord. Still bored.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Then whyd you call?

MULDER: (on phone) I, uh, I had a new thought about this case youre on. Theres a viral infection thats spread by simple touch 

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, are there any references in occult literature to objects that have the power to direct human behavior?

(BONSAINT gives SCULLY an odd look.)

MULDER: (on phone) What types of objects?

SCULLY: (on phone) Um, like a doll, for instance.

MULDER: (on phone) You mean like Chuckie?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, kind of like that. (MULDER gets up and crosses to his desk)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, the talking doll myth is well established in literature, especially in New England. The-the fetish or Juju is believed to pass on magical powers onto its possessor. Some of the early witches were condemned for little more that proclaiming that these objects existed. The supposed witch having premonitory visions and things . Why do you ask?

SCULLY: (on phone) I was just curious.

MULDER: (on phone) You didnt find a talking doll, did you, Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, no. Of course not.

MULDER: (on phone) I would suggest that you check the back of the doll for a - a plastic ring with a string on it.

(SCULLY shakes her head and hangs up.)

MULDER: (on phone) That would be my first . Hello?

SCULLY: Lets go talk to Melissa Turner.



SCENE 17

(Turner house. Sound of metal scraping.)

POLLY: (in her room, yelling) Wheres my popcorn?!

(MELISSA is in the kitchen making popcorn on the stove. She is very upset.)

MELISSA: Its coming, Polly.

(Camera shows that OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS is dead. In his hand is his bloody nightstick.)

POLLY: Wheres my popcorn?!

MELISSA: (crying) Its coming.



SCENE 18

(POLLY is in bed sleeping with the doll. MELISSA looks in the room, then goes to a cabinet and gets a hammer and a handful of nails. Later, MELISSA is frantically hammering nails into all the door frames and windows.)

POLLY: (calling from upstairs) Mommy  I cant sleep.

MELISSA: You go back to bed, Polly. Its way past your bedtime.

POLLY: No more pounding.

MELISSA: Go back to bed, sweetheart.

(Dolls eyes pop open.)

DOLL: Lets have fun.

(MELISSA sees her own image in the window, a hammer stuck in her bloody forehead.)

MELISSAS IMAGE: Help me 

MELISSA: Everythings going to be all right, Sweetie. Just go back to bed.

(Outside, BONSAINT and SCULLY drive up. They see a car parked close by.)

BONSAINT: Thats Buddys car.

(Inside, MELISSA closes the door to POLLYS bedroom. She puts the hammer back in the cabinet and padlocks it. Then she goes to the kitchen and tips a portable heater over, spilling kerosene on the floor next to the dead body of BUDDY RIGGS. She gets a box of matches then hears BONSAINT and SCULLY outside knocking.)

BONSAINT: Melissa!

(SCULLY looks in a window.)

BONSAINT: You see anything?

SCULLY: Unh-uh.

BONSAINT: (knocking) Melissa.

(Inside, Melissa tries to strike a match. She is shaking. Finally, the third match lights)

BONSAINT: (outside) Melissa!

POLLY: (watching MELISSA, frightened) Mommy?!

(Dolls eyes open. Match goes out.)

DOLL: Dont play with matches.

MELISSA: (crying, and trying to strike another match) You go back to bed, Polly!

(MELISSA strikes more matches. They each get blown out.)

BONSAINT: (outside knocking) Melissa?!

MELISSA: Go on now.

(Outside, SCULLY sees the nails holding the door closed. As BONSAINT continues to knock on the door, SCULLY looks in the window again and sees MELISSA striking matches. SCULLY begins knocking on the window.)

SCULLY: Melissa? Melissa? Bonsaint!

(MELISSA gives up on the matches and begins trying to open drawers. They snap back closed.)

DOLL: Dont play with knives.

POLLY: Mommy!

SCULLY: (outside) Shes got the door nailed shut. Shes trying to kill herself.

(BONSAINT begins breaking down the door. SCULLY keeps knocking on the window.)

SCULLY: Melissa! Melissa!

POLLY: Mommy! Mommy, no more pounding!

(Hardware cabinet bursts open on its own.)

DOLL: Lets play with the hammer.

(SCULLY and BONSAINT take turns hitting the door.)

SCULLY: Melissa!

(Door finally crashes open. BONSAINT and SCULLY enter. MELISSA is holding the hammer in front of her face.)

MELISSA: Get away from me!

SCULLY: Put it down, Melissa.

DOLL: I dont like you anymore.

(MELISSA hits herself on the forehead with the hammer.)

SCULLY: (kneels next to POLLY.) Give me the doll, Polly.

DOLL: I want to play.

(POLLY shakes her head and holds onto the doll. MELISSA hits herself again. Her head is now bloody.)

SCULLY: Polly, give me the doll.

DOLL: I want to play.

(MELISSA hits herself again. POLLY watches in horror. SCULLY takes the doll which keeps repeating "I want to play." She takes down to the kitchen and stuffs the doll into the microwave and turns it on. Doll catches fire. Must be one of those oxygenated microwaves. POLLY walks over to MELISSA who is bloody and crying. SCULLY and BONSAINT watch the doll burn.)



SCENE 19

(X-Files office. Mulder finishes sharpening a pencil in an electric sharpener, and delicately blows the dust off the tip. He places it on the desk and carefully lines it up with about 20 more sharpened pencils. Door opens and SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: Oh, hey, Scully. How you doing? (Laces his fingers together smoothly to hide the row of pencils.) How are you feeling? Rested?

SCULLY: I feel fine.

(SCULLY is focused on the I Want to Believe Poster behind MULDER.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: That poster  Whered you get it?

MULDER: Oh, I got it down on "M" Street at some head shop about five years ago.

SCULLY: Hmm.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: No. I just  wanted to send one to somebody.

MULDER: You do?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

MULDER: Who?

(As SCULLY passes him, MULDER opens his desk drawer and coughs to cover the sound of the pencils being pushed into the drawer and the drawer being closed.)

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Oh, just  some guy. (pause) Jack. "M" Street?

MULDER: Yeah. Hey, does this have something to do with that case you were working on?

SCULLY: What case? Uh, yeah. Yes it does.

MULDER: Did you solve it?

SCULLY: Me? No. No. I was, uh, I was on vacation. Just  getting out of my own head for a few days. What about you? Did you, uh, did you get anything done while I was gone?

MULDER: Oh, God. Its amazing what I can accomplish without incessant meddling or questioning into everything I do. Its just 

(MULDER is interrupted by a pencil dropping down on him. He looks up and another falls on him. SCULLY slowly raises her eyes to the ceiling. About thirty pencils are stuck into the ceiling tiles above MULDERS desk.)

MULDER: (embarrassed, but charming) Theres  got to be an explanation.

SCULLY: Oh, I dont know. I think some things are better left unexplained.

(Another pencil falls and hits MULDER on the top of the head. He looks innocently at SCULLY. She looks at him with exasperation.)



SCENE 20

(Night. Fishing boat in Maine. Fisherman pulls a lobster out of a trap.)

FISHERMAN: Ah.

(He pulls the burned doll out of the trap. Dolls eyes open.)

DOLL: I want to play.

[THE END]

                                      KILL SWITCH



SCENE 1

(Metro Diner. Night. 40 something year old man is typing on laptop. He is only person there. Coughing, he seems to be sick. WAITER offers coffee.)

WAITER: Excuse me. Do you want that warmed up?

LAPTOP MAN: No. But Ill buy another one if youll leave me alone.

(WAITER leaves. Computer screen beeps. ACCESS DENIED.)

LAPTOP MAN: Well see about that.



SCENE 2
LOGAN CIRCLE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Drug house. BUYER slides money through window.)

BUYER: Eight ball.

(Money is placed in a bill counter. Phone rings. Dealer, JACKSON, a young black man, answers.)

JACKSON: Yeah? (static on line)

VOICE: Hello, Jackson. (JACKSON looks surprised.)

JACKSON: Howd you get this number?

VOICE: What do you care? Youre partner, Kenny Slater, he took your money, didnt he? I want to help you, Jackson.

JACKSON: Help me what?

VOICE: Slaters in the Metro Diner. 14th and Arlington.

JACKSON: Hes in Florida by now, man ... Jamaica, Cuba ...

VOICE: No. Hes here. In the Metro Diner. 14th and Arlington.

(JACKSON hangs up and goes to get in car with DRIVER. Makes sure his gun is loaded.)

JACKSON: 14th and Arlington. Its Kenny. The fools come back. (They drive off.)



SCENE 3
PETWORTH
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Someone lighting a crack pipe. Phone rings.)

VOICE: The men who took your product Friday night are in the Metro Diner.

(CRACK DEALER hangs up and checks gun.)

CRACK DEALER: (to partner) 14th and Arlington.



SCENE 4
7th AND KENNEDY
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Interior car. Phone rings. Rap music playing.)

(GUY WHO DOESNT LIKE SPANISH JACK answers.)

VOICE: Spanish Jack is in the Metro Diner  14th and Arlington. I understand you wish to speak with him.

GWDLSJ: (to driver) 14th and Arlington.



SCENE 5

(US MARSHALLS car. Phone rings.)

BOYCE: Boyce.

VOICE: Pico Salazar is in the Metro Diner.

BOYCE: Salazar? Who is this?

VOICE: 14th and Arlington.

(BOYCE hangs up and violently starts the car.)



SCENE 6

(Diner. LAPTOP MAN still getting ACCESS DENIED on his laptop.)

LAPTOP MAN: Oh ... sharper than a serpents tooth to have a thankless child.

(Requests master override. Door opens. Two rough looking MOTORCYCLE GUYS enter and sit at a table.)

(CRACK DEALERS enter and sit at the counter.)

(JACKSON and JACKSONS DRIVER enter and sit at a table. Everybody looks suspiciously at each other.)

LAPTOP MAN: (to computer) Now you know whats coming, and theres nothing you can do.

(Screen shows a bunch of computer stuff, then ACCESS GRANTED. Da-ding!)

(GUYS WHO DONT LIKE SPANISH JACK enter and sit at the counter. LAPTOP MAN removes gold CD from his pocket and puts it in laptop. Screen says to press enter.)

LAPTOP MAN: You wont feel a thing. (Has finger over enter key.)

(US MARSHALLS bust in the door, guns drawn.)

BOYCE: US Marshalls! On the floor!

LAPTOP MAN: No!

BOYCE: Get down, now!

(Everybody pulling out guns. LAPTOP MAN is now standing in the middle of the room.)

LAPTOP MAN: No!

(Exterior of diner shows violent gunfire, 20 shots or so, then silence. Glass falls out of window.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 7

(Night. Diner is now roped off as a crime scene. Inside, MULDER pulls back sheet revealing a body.)

MULDER: Charles Figgis, ten year veteran of the US Marshalls Service. Multiple gunshot wounds, high speed Teflon rounds. His partner, Gerald Boyce was DOA at Mercy General. Tried to catch a nine millimeter slug in his teeth.

SCULLY: Looks like they crashed the wrong party.

MULDER: Figgis and Boyce had radioed in that they were coming here to apprehend Pico Salazar.

SCULLY: Pico Salazar?

MULDER: The Colombian Cartels banking liaison. Salazar escaped from federal custody three months ago. Boyce and Figgis were on the offender transport squad that lost him. (MULDER is looking at other bodies.) They took his escape personally. A phone tip told them that Salazar was going to be here tonight.

SCULLY: A foreign national with his kind of connections? What would he be doing here, let alone in the country?

MULDER: I dont think he is ... or was. But there were a lot of very photogenic gentlemen that were.

(SCULLY looks at file with mug shots.)

SCULLY: Mulder, these are street level coke dealers... Minor wholesalers at most.

MULDER: Yeah, not the type youd expect to associate with a cartel boss.

SCULLY: What would they be doing here?

MULDER: Maybe it was for the pie.

SCULLY: (give MULDER *the look*) ItS 2:45 in the morning. You mind telling me what it is were supposed to be looking for?

MULDER: (Pulls back sheet over dead MAN with LAPTOP) Donald Gelman.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Donald Gelman --- Silicon Valley software pioneer. Hes been missing since 1979.

SCULLY: And you recognize him?

MULDER: He invented the internet. (SCULLY looks skeptical.) Well, he didnt quite invent it, but hes a Silicon Valley folk hero. He was writing internet software even before there was an internet.

SCULLY: Why have I never heard of him?

MULDER: On the eve of the deal that was going to set him up as another Bill Gates he went hiking in the Sierras and said hed think about it. Never came back.

SCULLY: I still dont see the connection.

MULDER: (picks up GELMANS laptop which is still on) Maybe thats the point.

(MULDER and SCULLY go to their car.)

SCULLY: So, why was Gelman in there?

MULDER: I think somebody obviously wanted him dead.

SCULLY: You think this was a hit on him?

MULDER: Eight unconnected dealers all at the same place at the same time, all tipped off by phone looking for somebody, last call goes to the Marshalls, they arrive, place explodes, Gelman dies in the crossfire. Its genius.

SCULLY: Mulder, did you take a look at him? Why kill a man who is dying. His body is a bag of bones.

MULDER: Well, when youre talking about Donald Gelman you want to kill the brain, not the body.

(They get in car, SCULLY on driver side. MULDER opens GELMANS laptop which he had hidden under his coat.)

SCULLY: (shocked) Mulder, thats evidence.

MULDER: Gee, I hope so.

(MULDER finds CD in computer. SCULLY looks around, worried. MULDER puts CD into car stereo. Car lights begin flashing. The Platters "Twilight Time" plays.)

PLATTERS:
HEAVENLY SHADES OF NIGHT ARE FALLING
ITS TWILIGHT TIME
OUT OF THE MIST YOUR VOICE IS CALLING
TIS TWILIGHT TIME
WHEN PURPLE COLORED CURTAINS MARK THE END OF DAY...

( During song, MULDER looks at player raises his eyebrows and smiles at SCULLY. SCULLY looks at interior lights pulsing, then at MULDER. MULDER chuckles. Exterior shot of car shows all lights flashing in time to music.)



SCENE 8

(Lone Gunman Office. GUNMEN are looking at GELMANS laptop.)

BYERS: Jobs and Wozniak at Apple, Gates and Allen writing Basic, the homebrew computer clubs first meetings. Gelman was there.

FROHIKE: Now theyre power brokers and billionaires. Back then they were just ... inspired nerds.

MULDER: All except Gelman.

BYERS: Gelman was a part of the group, but not one of them. At 28 he was ..the old man. Some say the brightest of all.

LANGLY: He wrote some of the earliest viruses.

MULDER: And found himself under investigation by the NSA.

SCULLY: Is that why he disappeared?

BYERS: Gelman? Gelman was a visionary, not a capitalist. A subversive.

FROHIKE: (looking at computer) This is a one-off. Ive never seen anything like it. Gelman built this?

MULDER: That may be what got him killed.

(GUNMEN looked shocked.)

LANGLY: Heavy casualty.

FROHIKE: A brother goes down.

MULDER: (holding CD) I found this in his CD ROM drive.

BYERS: What is it?

SCULLY: (dryly) "Twilight Time."

(Later, Twilight Time is playing as MULDER and GUNMEN analyze it. SCULLY sits apart from them reading latest issue of Lone Gunman, headline * Infrared Technology. *)

LANGLY: Were up against 64 bit encryption ... as password thats a random sequence of twelve symbols. Gelmans got this baby sealed tight.

BYERS: This CD has some kind of enhanced background data. Lots of code. Maybe a programming design.

MULDER: What for?

SCULLY: (coming over) Anyone ùh, think to check his e-mail.

(Guys all look at her then each other, shake heads.)

(One piece of mail is found.
To: gelman@com
From: invisigoth@com
DAVID MISSING. FEAR THE WORST. THE HUNTED HAS BECOME THE HUNTER. HSWT 780022 3 UNTIL SATURDAY, INVISIGOTH.)

BYERS: David missing, fear the worst, the hunted has become the hunter.

SCULLY: "Invisigoth?"

BYERS: Could be an address.

FROHIKE: Seven digits. An alpha numeric string of four.

MULDER: Standard ID. Shipping container.

(SCULLY looks impressed.)



SCENE 9

(Night. Shipping container storage yard. SCULLY and MULDER driving through. MULDER has a map.)

SCULLY: There must be a thousand containers here. .... and in no particular order.

MULDER: Frohike says this place is really proud of its accurate tracking.

SCULLY: If not in their computer security.

MULDER: Yeah. Should be straight ahead. Three rows and to the right.

(SCULLY drives into narrow alley between two containers. They get out, and MULDER shines light on container number. Loud music is playing.)

MULDER: Sounds like somebodys home.

(MULDER knocks, then immediately enters, holding his badge.)

MULDER: FBI. Come ....

(Someone zaps him with a handheld electrical device. He falls. The person runs out the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: (in pain) Im all right! Go get her!

(SCULLY chases woman.)

SCULLY: Stop! FBI!

(SCULLY tackles the woman who then zaps her with the device and runs again. SCULLY pulls out gun.)

SCULLY: FBI! Stop, or Ill shoot! (Fires warning shot over womans head.)

(Woman, ESTHER NAIRN stops. She is young, blonde, dressed in leather, nose ring, and heavy dark makeup around her eyes. Scully walks up behind her.)

SCULLY: Thank you. (cuffs the woman)

(MULDER looks around the trailer. Lots of computer equipment and a bed.)

MULDER: Home sweet home.

(SCULLY enters with the ESTHER.)

MULDER: Are you "Invisigoth?"

ESTHER: How did you find me?

MULDER: Donald Gelmans mailbox. You left a return address.

ESTHER: You know where Donald is?

SCULLY: Why dont you let us ask the questions.

ESTHER: Why dont you bite me.

MULDER: Hey!

SCULLY: Like what youre doing here and what all this stuff is.

ESTHER: And why would I tell you even if you could understand?

SCULLY: You just committed felony assault on a federal agent, followed by resisting arrest.

ESTHER: Arrest for what? Unless you got a warrant, you two just busted in here and seriously violated a buttload of my constitutional rights.

MULDER: We had just cause to come in.

ESTHER: (going over to a monitor) Yeah? Now weve got just cause to get out.

MULDER: What is that?

ESTHER: Its a surveillance module. It monitors computing processes.

(Screen displays BRIGHT LIGHTS : WARM UP COMPLETED)

ESTHER: Its locking up.

SCULLY: What is?

ESTHER: A DOD satellite .. Warbird grade orbital weapons platform. (turns to leave) Weve got to get out of here!

SCULLY: (stopping her) A weapons platform?

MULDER: (watching monitor zero in on a geographical location) Scully ....

ESTHER: You dont understand! That thing has optical systems that can read headlines on a newspaper.
.
MULDER: Scully ....

ESTHER: Its targeting us!

SCULLY: You want us to believe that the Department of Defense wants to kill you?

ESTHER: No, its controlling their satellite!

SCULLY: Youre out of your mind.

MULDER: Scully, weve got to get out of here right now. (Runs out, pulling ESTHER behind him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, this is absurd!

MULDER: (at car) Its locked. Give me the keys.

SCULLY: Mulder!

ESTHER: Were all gonna die!

MULDER: Give me the keys!

(SCULLY unlocks car. MULDER and the ESTHER get in. Monitor now shows very detailed area.)

MULDER: Get in the car, Scully!

(SCULLY reverses out, hitting sides of containers, then spins and drives away just as bolt of energy from sky blows up the trailer ---BOOOOOOMMMM! Lots of fire. Lots and lots of fire. MULDER looks at fire, then at ESTHER, then at SCULLY. SCULLY looks at MULDER, then confused.)



SCENE 10

(Car. Day. MULDER looks at ESTHER in backseat.)

SCULLY: (driving) No more screwing around. We need a name. Your real name.

ESTHER: Invisigoth. You want my address? Its T - O - A - S - T.

MULDER: When you said "it" was targeting us back there, you meant an artificial intelligence. Donald Gelman was trying to create a sentient AI. A program with its own consciousness. He succeeded, didnt he?

ESTHER: Donald wrote an interlocked sequence of viruses 15 years ago. It got loose on the net.

MULDER: Wait, what do you mean, "got loose?"

ESTHER: He let it loose ... so it could evolve in its natural environment. Urschleim in silicon.

SCULLY: "Urschleim in silicon?"

ESTHER: The primordial slime? The ooze out of which all life evolved. Except this time its artificial slime - artificial life. One man alone achieving the equivalent of Copernicus, Magellan, and Darwin.

SCULLY: And what was your role in all this? Were you the bass player?

MULDER: (Starts to say something)

ESTHER: Automata Theory, MIT 95. Post doc the Santa Fe Institute. Head hunted to Kobayashi my junior year. Then Donald showed up in Tokyo and made me a better offer.

SCULLY: A better offer to do what?

ESTHER: You wouldnt understand.

(SCULLY angrily pulls off the road into a rest area and gets out of the car.)

SCULLY: Jeez...

(MULDER follows her.)

SCULLY: You believe this load of crap?

MULDER: You saw what happened back there, Scully. You saw that container blow.

SCULLY: She could have rigged an explosive charge. There are no weapons platforms, there is no such Department of Defense satellite.

MULDER: What about Star Wars? Brilliant Pebbles?

SCULLY: They were never built! We dont even have that kind of technology. I mean, even if an artificial intelligence was targeting us, with an armed satellite, why isnt it doing it right now?

ESTHER: (coming toward them, still cuffed) Because it doesnt know where we are. If I so much as made a phone call right now, it would nuke us right where were standing.

SCULLY: How?

ESTHER: Recognizes my voice, monitors all communication. I havent used a phone in over a month.

MULDER: Then how did it know to target the container?

ESTHER: All I can think is that some idiot got on Donalds computer and tried to contact me over the net. Only Donald knew where I was. And David.

MULDER: Whos David?

ESTHER: David Markham. He was hardware. Donald and I were software. Wed been caring for the AI, weaning it. Then Donald warned us that the system started to display more than consciousness. It started to display intention. But before we could stop it, it was gone.

(SCULLY does not believe a word.)

MULDER: Where?

ESTHER: I dont know. One day David was on the system and it wouldnt come, it wouldnt come when we called it. We knew it was out there somewhere on the Global Net, but it wouldnt answer, and Donald was just getting sicker.

MULDER: And you cant find it?

ESTHER: Well, its not a program any more. Its wildlife loose on the net. And either we kill it ....Wheres Donald?

MULDER: Donald Gelman is dead. He was killed in a café. What looks like a hit.

ESTHER: (sighing, shocked) Thats the AI protecting itself. Itll find David and.... me. Its only a matter of time. Donald was writing a concatenation of viruses designed to find and immobilize the rogue system. The file name was "Kill Switch." Without it, nobody can catch it.

MULDER: We have Donalds computer.

ESTHER: No, hed never leave it on the hard drive.

MULDER: Well, we have this. (Show CD) "Twilight Time."

ESTHER: Thats it. Thats the Kill Switch.

SCULLY: (expression says "Yeah, right.")



SCENE 11

(Lone Gunman office. MULDER, SCULLY, and ESTHER enter. LONE GUNMEN stand in awe.)

BYERS: Ai -yi -yi

FROHIKE: It cant be ... it is.

LANGLY: Esther Nairn. You programmed the autonomous bots in Ninjitsu Princess, the most gnarliest piece of entertainment software ever.

ESTHER: Are these the brain donors that nearly got us incinerated?

(LONE GUNMEN just stare at her, lustfully.)

MULDER: Dont let their looks fool you.

SCULLY: Your name is Esther Nairn?

(ESTHER gives SCULLY a dirty look, then crosses to GELMANS computer.)

FROHIKE: She is so hot.

ESTHER: Are you going to take off the cuffs, or do I have to do this with my tongue?

MULDER: (Crossing to remove the cuffs.) You dont want to take a vote.

(SCULLY smiles and subtly bites the tip of her tongue. Thinking about how she would do it? MULDER cuffs ESTHER to the desks cup holder.)

ESTHER: Give me the Kill Switch.

SCULLY: Arent you worried its going to track you, Esther? Hunt you down with another particle beam?

ESTHER: Not unless someone else makes another boneheaded internet connection.

(GUNMEN look guilty.)

MULDER: (referring to computer screen where ESTHER has pulled up a diagram) What is this?

ESTHER: Thats the sharp end of the stick. Donald probably tried to feed this sector in over the net, but it took too long, so the system was able to take counter-measures.

SCULLY: Why didnt it just zap him, too?

ESTHER: Its creator? No, it needed to impress Donald. Particle beam wouldve been overkill.

SCULLY: Unlike a dozen crack dealers.

ESTHER: No, you see thats its sense of humor. (smiling)

MULDER: Oh, all right. But if you load the Kill Switch, whats to stop it from playing another funny joke on us?

ESTHER: Well, obviously we cant inject Kill Switch over the Net. Theres only one way now: We have to find its home node and physically feed it the poisoned apple.

MULDER: Physically?

ESTHER: Right into its eager little CD drive. It knew it couldnt hide over the Net forever, not until it learned to completely disguise itself. It requires a physical nexus of hardware so somewhere its built itself a little safehouse. (FROHIKE is in awe. SCULLY is totally over her.) David went looking for it.

MULDER: Did he find it?

ESTHER: Theres no way to know.

SCULLY: Why dont you just call him. (They all look at SCULLY.) Oh, right  death from above.

LANGLY: It would need bandwidth.

ESTHER: Its a pig for bandwith.

BYERS: It would need a T3, at least.

SCULLY: T3?

FROHIKE: A hard line  45 megs a second.

BYERS: Major research labs and internet service providers use them.

LANGLY: But the government keeps those records secret for fear of sabotage.

ESTHER: Gee, you guys know anyone that works for the government?

(All look at MULDER.)



SCENE 12
FAIRFAX COUNTY, VIRGINIA

(MULDER drives up to rural telephone pole with a junction box. He checks T3 connection map, then climbs the pole and looks to see where line goes- old dilapidated farmhouse.)



SCENE 13

(Lone Gunman Office. SCULLY wakes up from nap on the couch to see empty handcuffs at desk. She crosses to a door, and sees the GUNMEN sleeping. Turning quickly, she sees ESTHER pointing SCULLYS gun at her.)

ESTHER: Shh. Buenos dias, muchacha. (SCULLY sighs.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER pulls up to farmhouse. He calls SCULLY on his cel phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Scully?

(SCULLY is driving.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yep.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, Ive found something down in Fairfax County. A derelict chicken farm with a T3 connection, paid for by Aleph Industries, Palo Alto, of which theres no other record anywhere.

SCULLY: (on phone) Dandy.

MULDER: (on phone) Where are you? Sounds like youre driving.

SCULLY: (on phone) You are correct, sir.

MULDER: (on phone) You have Esther with you?

SCULLY: (on phone) In a manner of speaking.

ESTHER: Left up here. Give me that. (reaches for phone)

MULDER: (on phone) Where are you going?

ESTHER: (on phone, gruff voice) To find David.

MULDER: (on phone) Where?

(ESTHER hangs up, smiles and hold gun on SCULLY who is not pleased with the situation.)

MULDER (into phone) Scully? Scully?

(MULDER hangs up, walks around the house, through some small trees to a small rusty motor home with lots of wires going into it.)



SCENE 15
DAVID MARKHAM RESIDENCE

(SCULLY and ESTHER pull up in LONE GUNMENS car (?) to where a house used to be - now just debris. ESTHER, still holding SCULLYS gun, gets out of the car in shock to survey the damage. All is burned. In the car, SCULLY who is handcuffed to the steering wheel, digs in her coat pocket for the keys, and unlocks the bracelet just as ESTHER gets back in car. ESTHER places gun on dash and bursts into tears. SCULLY, showing no sympathy, slowly begins to reach for it. ESTHER suddenly grabs the gun and points it at SCULLY.)

ESTHER: Go ahead! Put me out of my misery! Take it! (Cries harder.)

(SCULLY sighs, takes the gun, then places her hand on ESTHERS shoulder.)



SCENE 16

(MULDER walks toward trailer. About ten yards away, a loud siren on a telephone pole goes off. MULDER places his hands over his ears until it stops.)

MULDER: (from computer infrared, sound distorted perspective) FBI! Im a federal agent.!

(MULDER walks up to the door, and chuckles as he sees a doorbuzzer. He presses the buzzer. Inside a monitor reads his thumbprint, and accesses MULDERS FBI Personnel File:

SCENE 17

(SCULLY and ESTHER looking at remains of burned house.)

ESTHER: I lied to you. I wasnt working with Donald. I mean, I was, and then he found out about us.

SCULLY: About you and who.

ESTHER: David. (sniffs) About our plans.

SCULLY: What plans did he find out?

ESTHER: Uploading. Transfer of memory, of consciousness to the distributed system maintained by the AI. Imagine being mingled so completely with another, you no longer need your physical self  youre one.

SCULLY: So you were going to 

ESTHER: Enter the AI. Give up our inefficient bodies so that our consciousness could live together forever.

SCULLY: But Donald Gelman forbade it.

ESTHER: He was afraid of his creation. He was afraid of what would happen if other people followed us. (Finds half burned picture of herself and an older man.) I loved him so much.

SCULLY: Well, maybe he wasnt here when this happened. Maybe hes somewhere else.

(ESTHER looks like she might take hope.)



SCENE 18

(MULDER, getting no response, crawls under the mobile home, following the T3 line. He unscrews and enters through a bottom hatch. There is a small mobile robot *like the one in WOTC* zipping around. He ignores it. The trailer is completely filled with computer hardware. Lots of wires and monitors. MULDER is startled when he sees a dead man in some kind of harness wearing a VR goggle thing.)

MULDER: (lifting visor) David Markham.

(DAVIDS eyes and skin look like they have been subjected to a great deal of electricity. Suddenly, MULDER is jerked back into an identical harness. Restraints whip around his arms and legs, and sparks fly as electricity pours into his body. He struggles, crying out in pain.)



SCENE 19

(Hospital corridor, very dark. MULDER wakes up as he is being wheeled on a gurney attended by EMTs.)

MULDER: (groggy) Whats going on?

EMT: Severe tissue injuries to upper extremities. Weve got ourselves a real crispy critter, here.

EMT 2: Alert the burn unit. Tell them to scramble the surgical team.

EMT: (on radio) Unit 23  request Burn Unit.

(MULDER tries to sit up.)

EMT 2: Hes coming up on us.

EMT: Surgical team, stat.

MULDER: Whats that smell? (sees his badly burned arms) Oh, jeez ...

EMT: Easy now.

EMT 2: Just relax.

(They turn down another dark deserted corridor.)

EMT: 120 BP 130 over 80

EMT 2: (into recorder) Frank charring at contact site, along path of current, and at exit point. Looks like the charge grounded through both arms. Weve got a lot of work to do, here, people, if were going to save him.

(MULDER has been looking confused and nervous as he is wheeled through the hall. Walking to his left is a ditsy Barbie look-alike nurse, NURSE NANCY.)

MULDER: Is it bad?

NURSE NANCY: Youre in good hands.

MULDER: My arms hurt.

(NURSE NANCY looks at EMT.)

EMT: Thats a good sign

(They wheel him into an OR room, very dark and sparse. MULDER looks around nervously. NURSE NANCY adjusts an overhead light. Another nurse wheels over an instrument cart with assorted blades and saws.)

MULDER: No, wait .... (almost passing out) Call my doctor. You have to call ... my doctor. Call Dr. Scully. Please call Dr. Scully.

(Very Old SURGEON totters to side of gurney.)

MULDER: Call her. (groans as a nurse pushes his head back down on pillow.) No, no. No ... what are you doing?

VERY OLD SURGEON: (so old he can barely speak) Prep the patient.

(SURGEON picks up a little hand held rotating electric saw that looks like a piece of a quisinart. MULDER is *very* worried now.)

MULDER: No. No.

(MULDER is now surrounded by four Barbie nurses. NURSE NANCY injects him in the side of the neck.)

MULDER: No-no-no-no! Ahhhhh!

(NURSES strap him down, and SURGEON starts the little saw. MULDER looks around even more confused as the drug takes effect.)



SCENE 20

(SCULLY hangs up cell phone (phone ringing blends with sound of saw in previous scene) as she and ESTHER are driving. Night.)

SCULLY: I cant get through to Mulder. (tries number again)

ESTHER: Its the AI. Its had time to analyze my voice. It knows I was using your phone.

SCULLY: It can interfere with my phone?

ESTHER: Give it enough information, itll sue you for palimony.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. Mulder said that he found the system. In an abandoned chicken farm in Fairfax county.

ESTHER: Well, maybe we can cut off the T3 and kill its communication capabilities.

SCULLY: You can do that?

ESTHER: Theres only one way to find out. (grabs laptop from backseat and connects to the Fairfax County mainframe over a *very* high speed modem and browser.)



SCENE 21

(Hospital room. MULDER is sleeping, blanket pulled up to his chin. There is a very strange crucifix hanging over the bed. NURSE NANCY enters. MULDER wakes.)

MULDER: I feel sick.

NURSE NANCY: Thats the anesthetic, Agent Mulder. You were injured and they had to operate.

MULDER: I remember ... wires, and uh ...

NURSE NANCY: Yes, you were doing something dangerous. Something very, very foolish. The good news is they were able to save the right one.

MULDER: What do you mean?

(NURSE NANCY pulls down covers to show that MULDERS left arm has been amputated, no bandage.)

MULDER: Oh, my God. What did you do with my arm? What did they do with my arm?

NURSE NANCY: (pushing him down, gently) Shh.... or theyll come back.

MULDER: (almost panicking) Theyll come back for what?

NURSE NANCY: Theyre evil, Fox. They want something from you.

MULDER: (high pitched) What do they want?!

NURSE NANCY: I dont know. But if you dont tell them, Im afraid theyll take your other arm.

MULDER: This is crazy! You have to help me. You have to get me out of here ... please! (She pulls his head to her breasts.) Help me. Help me. Please, help me.

(She drops him back to bed and holds pillow over his face. MULDER givesmuffled yell.)

NURSE NANCY: Shh ... or theyll hear you. Shhh .... (keeps pillow over his face)



SCENE 22

(SCULLY and ESTHER pull up to drawbridge just as gate comes across. Laptop beeps.)

ESTHER: Somethings wrong. (computer scrolling) I didnt do anything. I didnt even get on the Net! I think it found us. (A truck marked "flammable" pulls up behind them.) Its zeroing in.

(Computer begins displaying map zeroing in on a bridge over a river.)

SCULLY: Esther ... (they get out of the car) Get away from the tanker truck!

(ESTHER runs onto bridge, which is beginning to turn. SCULLY runs to trucks cab.)

SCULLY: (to driver) Sir? You need to get out of the truck. Move it! Its going to explode. (He does. SCULLY runs toward ESTHER who still holds computer and is looking skyward from center of bridge.) Dump it, Esther! Get rid of it!

ESTHER: Its got the Kill Switch.

SCULLY: Esther! Dump it! (jumps onto bridge at the last minute) Esther! Get rid of it! (ESTHER desperately typing.) Get rid of it , Esther!

(Computer screen shows zeroing in complete. ESTHER flings laptop into the river. Bolt of energy from above hits laptop causing large explosion. BOOOOOMMMM!!!! SCULLY and ESTHER duck together.)



SCENE 23

(MULDERS hospital room. NURSE NANCY and two other nurses are massaging MULDER under the sheets. He looks *very* content. Crucifix is lighted above him.)

MULDER: Oh, I had this terrible dream. (NURSE NANCY gives a knowing smile. MULDER smiles back) And then I had a good dream.

NURSE NANCY: Those werent dreams, Fox. (to other nurses) I believe thats enough for now. (They stop the massage.) You poor thing. But I warned you. Nurse Nancy warned you. You have to tell them, Fox. You have to.

MULDER: Tell them what?

NURSE NANCY: About the Kill Switch.

MULDER: Nobody asked me anything.

NURSE NANCY: Youve just forgotten, Fox.

MULDER: No.

NURSE NANCY: (takes MULDERS face in her hands) I was there. The doctor asked and he was very cross when you refused to answer. But hell be here in just a few minutes, and you can tell him then.

MULDER: I ...

NURSE NANCY: (cheerfully) Otherwise, whoops! There go your legs.

(She flings back sheet to show that both his arms are now amputated. MULDER starts yelling. SCULLY kicks in the door holding her gun.)

SCULLY: Mulder, these women are spies!

MULDER: Scully!

(Brunette nurse kicks gun out of SCULLYS hands. Ninja!SCULLY hits her three times then does a beautiful aerial karate kick to her head. Then hits the other blonde nurse in the face and stomach and knocks her out. Then NURSE NANCY, kick, right, left, right, MULDER watching, and knockout. SCULLY looks at her fallen opponents, blows her hair out of her face, comes over to Mulder.)

SCULLY: Mulder, they want the Kill Switch virus. What did you tell her?

MULDER: I didnt tell them anything!

SCULLY: I need to know!

MULDER: (showing her his arms, pitifully) Look ...

SCULLY: Do we have it? (MULDER looks at her, hurt, wanting comfort) Do we have the Kill Switch?

MULDER: (realizing it cant really be her) Of course we do.

(He pulls up his legs and kicks her in the chest, throwing her back against the wall. From MULDERS perspective, images of SCULLY and entire room begin to short out. Then we see he is back in the trailer still strapped in with VR helmet. His voice is weak.)

MULDER: Scully? Scully? Scully, help! Help! (camera outside trailer) Help!! Sculleeee!!!

(Commercial)



SCENE 24

(SCULLY and ESTHER arrive at chicken farm. Night. SCULLY shines flashlight at MULDERS car)

ESTHER: Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

(They walk through snowy forest. When the set off the alarm at the trailer, SCULLY drops her flashlight, they cover their ears, then SCULLY takes out her gun a shoots the alarm and spotlight. Go Scully!)

MULDER: (inside) Scully ...

SCULLY: Mulder?! Mulder, are you all right?

(Inside trailer a mechanical arm moves toward MULDER.)

MULDER: Im in here. Scully ...

(Mechanical arm cuts his sleeve and injects him with something that makes him pass out.
Not that he was very coherent to begin with.)

SCULLY: Mulder? (AI perspective of SCULLY and ESTHER) Mulder. Mulder, can you hear me? (SCULLY sticks her head through floor hatchway.) Mulder?

(Little mobile robot turns on bright light and starts toward SCULLY. SCULLY ducks and shoots it four times. Go Scully! She and ESTHER both enter trailer.)

SCULLY: (looking around at wires and machinery) Mulder? Help me out here, Esther. Whats its next move? What is it thinking?

ESTHER: I dont know.

SCULLY: Who built this?

ESTHER: It did. There. (Points flashlight at one of the harnesses. Sees dead DAVID.) Ah! David! (shocked) Oh, god.

(SCULLY looks at DAVID then turns to see MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder? (ESTHER shines flashlight on MULDER.) Mulder? (lifts visor up exposing MULDERS staring eyes, being held open by clamps.) Mulder, can you hear me? (MULDER tries to move his mouth.) Mulder, talk to me.

(SCULLY turns and points her gun at a whirring sound. A CD ROM drive holder has opened.)

ESTHER: It wants the Kill Switch.

SCULLY: Well, we dont have it. You threw it in the water with the computer.

(ESTHER shakes her head, pulls out the disc, steps close to the drive.)

SCULLY: Thats going to kill it, right?

ESTHER: Not if it can learn the program and vaccinate itself against it.

(MULDER is jolted by a burst of electricity four times. MULDER is in pain.)

SCULLY: Give it what it wants, Esther. (MULDER jolted again.) Put it in, Esther.

(Computer monitor begins zeroing in.)

ESTHER: Its targeting us.

SCULLY: Put it in!

(SCULLY grabs disc, puts it in drive, and closes drive. Twilight Time begins. Computer pauses targeting process.)

PLATTERS:
HEAVENLY SHADES OF NIGHT ARE FALLING
ITS TWILIGHT TIME

(Straps that were holding MULDER snap off. SCULLY goes to him and tenderly removes helmet and clamps from his face.)

SCULLY: Youre going to be okay. Im going to get you out of here.

PLATTERS:
OUT OF THE MIST YOUR VOICE IS CALLING
ITS TWILIGHT TIME.
WHEN PURPLE COLORED CURTAINS MARK THE END OF DAY
ILL HEAR YOU, MY DEAR AT TWILIGHT TIME

SCULLY: Okay. Its okay.

(ESTHER watches them, then begins typing. SCULLY removes MULDERS eye clamps. ESTHERS typing has restarted the targeting process. SCULLY helps MULDER to the floor hatch.)

PLATTERS:
DEEPING SHADOWS GATHER SPLENDOR AS DAY IS DONE

(ESTHER is crying, still typing)

FINGERS OF NIGHT WILL SOON SURRENDER THE SETTING SUN
I COUNT THE MOMENTS DARLING TIL YOURE HERE WITH ME
TOGETHER AT LAST AT TWILIGHT TIME

SCULLY: What are you doing, Esther?

ESTHER: Get out of here.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

ESTHER: Go!

PLATTERS: HERE IN THE AFTERGLOW OF DAY WE KEEP OUR RENDEZVOUS BENEATH THE BLUE HERE IN THE SAME AND SWEET OLD WAY

(SCULLY hesitates, then follows MULDER out the hatch. She gets him leaned up against the side of the trailer, then goes back to the hatch. She doesnt see ESTHER.)

PLATTERS: I FALL IN LOVE AGAIN AS I DID THEN

SCULLY: Esther?!

ESTHER: (voice) You dont listen, do you?

SCULLY: Where are you?

ESTHER: Get out of here, now!

(COMPUTER beeps. SCULLY ducks back out. ESTHER is now strapped into MULDERS harness, looking relaxed.)

PLATTERS:
DEEP IN THE DARK YOUR KISS WILL THRILL ME
LIKE DAYS OF OLD

(SCULLY helps MULDER stand and run from trailer.)

LIGHTING THE SPARK OF LOVE THAT FILLS ME
WITH DREAMS UNTOLD.

ESTHER: Upload. (Computer monitors going crazy.)

PLATTERS:
EACH DAY I PRAY FOR EVENING JUST TO BE WITH YOU
TOGETHER, AT LAST AT TWILIGHT TIME
TOGETHER, AT LAST AT TWILIGHT TIME

(Lots of electricity begins pouring through ESTHER. SCULLY helps MULDER running through forest. ESTHERS head falls to side. Smoke comes out her mouth. Computer finishes targeting. MULDER and SCULLY turn and look as beam from above explodes trailer. BOOOOMMMMMM!!!!)



SCENE 25

(Dawn. MULDER and SCULLY look over smoking remains of trailer.)

SCULLY: Well, if Esther wanted to leave her body, she got her wish. At least that part of it.

MULDER: I wonder.

SCULLY: Mulder, shes dead.

MULDER: What if she managed to establish an uplink, Scully? A satellite transmission?

(We see FROHIKE typing at computer.)

SCULLY: (voice) Mulder, are you telling me that Esther may have ... that she may not be dead?

MULDER: (voice) Artificial life. It could exist. It could be here among us, evolving.

SCULLY: (voice) Electrons chasing each other through a circuit --- that isnt life, Mulder.

(LANGLY and BYERS join FROHIKE.)

MULDER: (voice) Yeah, but what are we but impulses? Electrical and chemical through a bag of meat and bones. Youre the scientist. You tell me.

(FROHIKES monitor reads *BITE ME.* LONEGUNMEN look at each other, confused.)



SCENE 26
NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA

(Two boys playing football in a trailer park. Two onlookers. One decrepit trailer is surrounded by chain link fence. One boy, HARLEY falls face down in the mud, then gets up and throws the ball. It lands inside the chain link fence.)

ONLOOKER: You did it now, Harley!

(HARLEY and the other player run up to fence.)

HARLEY: You get it.

OTHER PLAYER: Uh unh.

FEMALE ONLOOKER: Theyll get you if you go in there!

HARLEY: Mama says no one lives in there.

(HARLEY climbs the fence, retrieves the ball. Camera on top of trailer watches him climb out.)

[THE END]

                                 BAD BLOOD


SCENE 1
CHANEY, TEXAS
FEBRUARY 10

(In the woods on a dark night, a teenager runs through screaming)

RONNIE: Help me! Somebody help me! Help! That guy's gonna to kill me! Help! (A man's legs are running after the teen, his coat flying behind him looking like a cape. Help me! Somebody help me! Go away! (The man is getting closer to the teen, who's screaming frantically) Please help me!

(The teen stumbles and the man falls on top of him. The man turns the teen on his back and struggles to hold him down. He jams a wooden stake into the teen's chest. He grabs a rock and slams the top of the stake with it, pushing the stake further into the now quiet teen's chest)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The man is a sweating Mulder! He turns to Scully's voice. She runs to them. She stops as she realizes the teen is dead. She kneels down. Mulder pulls the teen's lips apart to reveal fangs)

MULDER: Look at that. Huh... Huh?

(Scully taps her fingernail to his teeth. A denture falls down. She pulls out the fake fangs and shows them to Mulder.)

MULDER: Oh, shi...

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS - X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder is sitting at his desk. Scully opens the door and peers inside. There's an awkward silence as she comes in, exchange a look at Mulder and sits.)

SCULLY: Mulder--

MULDER: Don't. (He cuts her off and points his finger at her) Don't even start with me. (He crinkles up a piece of paper and throws it across the room to the trash can. He misses, walks over and kicks the hell out of the can. Scully watches him. He stops jamming a foot down on the can and walks over to the deak.) I know what I saw.

SCULLY: Skinner wants our report in one hour. What are you going to tell him?

MULDER: What do you mean what am I going to tell him? I'm going to tell him exactly what I saw. What are you going to tell him?

SCULLY: I'll tell him exactly what I saw.

MULDER: Now, how is that different? (She gives him a look that's mildly exasperated) Look, Scully, I'm the one who may wind up going to prison here. I got to know if you're going to back me up or what.

SCULLY: First of all, if the family of Ronnie Strickland does indeed decide to sue the FBI for -- I think the figure is $446 million -- then you and I both will most certainly be co-defendants and second of all ... I don't even have a second of all, Mulder. $446 million. I'm in this as deep as you are and I'm not even the one that overreacted. I didn't do the ... (She makes a stabbing motion) with the thing.

MULDER: I did not overreact. Ronnie Strickland was a vampire.

SCULLY: Where is your proof?

MULDER: You're my proof. You were there. (She heavily exhales) OK, now you're scaring me. I wanna know exactly what you're gonna tell Skinner.

SCULLY: Oh, you want our stories straight.

MULDER: No, no, no, I didn't say that. I just want to hear it the way you saw it.

SCULLY: I don't feel comfortable with that.

MULDER: Prison, Scully. Your cell mate's nickname is going to be Large Marge. She's going to read a lot of Gertrude Stein.

(She puts her hand to her face and smiles)

SCULLY: All right.

MULDER: All right, start at the beginning.

SCULLY: The very beginning? (Mulder returns to his desk and takes a micro tape recorder from the drawer and turns it on.) Fine. (she slowly stands up and starts to pace as she talks) Yesterday morning ... when I arrived at work, you were, uh ... characteristically exuberant.



SCENE 3
YESTERDAY
X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder slaps a plane ticket on the desk)

MULDER: Hope you brought your cowboy boots. (She picks it up and looks at it)

SCULLY: You want us to go to Dallas? (Mulder talks through this whole scene rapid fire while Scully is laid back, just give me the facts)

MULDER: Yee-haw! Actually, a town called Chaney, about 50 miles south of there, population 361 ... by all accounts, very rustic and charming, but as of late, ground zero the locus for a series of mysterious nocturnal exsanguinations.

SCULLY: Exsanguinations? Of whom?

(Mulder turns on a slide projector)

MULDER: How does that grab ya?

SCULLY: Is it a...?

(It's a slide of a dead cow on it's right side, left feet in the air. Rigor mortis has definitely set it)

MULDER: Dead cow! Exactly. Specifically, a dead 900-pound Holstein. Its body drained of blood as was this one, (He clicks through a series of slides of dead cows. Scully is wondering why this is important) ... this one, this one, this one, and so on. Six, all in all --approximately one a week over the past six weeks.

SCULLY: Is there any sign of --?

MULDER: Two small puncture wounds on the neck?

SCULLY: I wasn't asking that.

MULDER: Too bad. We got 'em. Check it out. (He clicks to the next slide. It's a close up picture of two puncture marks on the side of a cow's neck)

SCULLY: Well, these may be syringe marks. Their placement meant to emulate fangs. Such ritualistic blood-letting points towards cultists of some sort, in which case ... (She notices a look of bemusement on Mulder's face) What? (He laughs)

MULDER: Yeah, that's probably it, satanic cultists. Come on, Scully.

SCULLY: You're not gonna tell me you think it's that Mexican goat sucker thing.

MULDER: El Chupacabra? No, they got four fangs, not two, and they suck goats, hence the name.

SCULLY: So, instead, this would be...

MULDER: Classic vampirism.

SCULLY: Of a bunch of cows.

MULDER: And one dead human last night - a vacationer from New Jersey. (She looks at him as he leaves) Come on, we got to go.

SCULLY: Why the hell didn't you tell me that from the beginning?

MULDER: Lock the door on your way out.

(she signs with a groan)



SCENE 4
PEACEFUL SLUMBERS FUNERAL PARLOR

(A view of coffins, a lot of them as we hear Scully's voice over)

SCULLY: The town of Chaney is too small to maintain a morgue facility. As such, we made our way to the Peaceful Slumbers funeral home in order to examine the body of one Mr. Dwight Funt, recently deceased.

(Mulder and Scully are standing next to a mortician in the middle of all the coffins. Scully looks around the room as she continues the voice over. We see cowboy boots, jeans, gun belt, shirt and jacket, badge, wonderful smile, and cowboy hatted fella walk in)

It was there that we were met by a representative of local law enforcement, Sheriff...

HARTWELL: Lucius Hartwell. You the FBI agents?

(Scully is now staring at the handsome officer, lost in a cloud)

MULDER: Yes. I'm ... Agents Mulder and ... (He snaps his fingers as if to remember) uh ... Scully. What do you say, we go take a look at your victim.

HARTWELL: Yeah, by all means. After you. (Mulder walks to the door, Scully and Lucien's eyes connect and she smiles)

MULDER: Come on, Scully, get those little legs moving. Come on. (Her pleasant smile turns to annoyance at Mulder and she walks to the door)

HARTWELL: Boy. (He likes her too)



SCENE 5
EXAMINATION ROOM

(They all look at the body)

HARTWELL: Here we go.

MULDER: Nice threads. (The corpse is wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Scully snaps on latex gloves and comes up behind Mulder to look at the victim)

SCULLY: No exam has been done?

HARTWELL: No, ma'am. He's just like we found him in the motel room. Once I heard you folks were interested I figured we'd best leave it up to the experts.

(Scully smiles at him)

MULDER: Your satanic cultists have some sharp little teeth.

HARTWELL: What satanic cultists?

MULDER: Go ahead, tell him your, uh, (he makes his little fingers go into quotation marks with a goofy look on his face) "theory."

SCULLY: Well, my theory has evolved. Basically, I think that we're looking for someone who has seen one too many Bela Lugosi movies. He believes he is a vampire, therefore...

HARTWELL: They act like one. Yeah. Yeah. That makes a whole lot of sense. I think she's right.

(Scully smiles and looks down in almost embarrassment, but none the less, happy as Mulder looks bewildered)

MULDER: What about the fang marks?

SCULLY: Well, someone so obsessed might well file down their incisors. I think that a moulage casting should help us make an identification.

HARTWELL: Moulage casting, that's a good idea. (Scully is very happy. She finally has someone think she's right) Now ... now, isn't there some kind of disease that makes a person think that they're a vampire?

(Lucien walks closer to Scully, leaving no room for Mulder next to her anymore and he moves back and looks at the two of them)

SCULLY: Well, there is a psychological fixation called hematodipsia which causes the sufferer to gain erotic satisfaction from consuming human blood.

HARTWELL: Erotic. Yeah.

(she smiles)

SCULLY: Mmm. There are also genetic afflictions which cause a heightened sensitivity to light, uh, to garlic -- porphyria, xeroderma pigmentosum.

HARTWELL: You really know your stuff, Dana.



SCENE 6
TODAY
X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder cuts off Scully in mid story)

MULDER: Dana?! (he laughs) He never even knew your first name.

SCULLY: You're gonna interrupt me or what?

MULDER: No. Go ahead ..... Dana.

SCULLY: Anyway ... that's when you had your big ... breakthrough ... whatever.



SCENE 7
YESTERDAY
EXAMINATION ROOM

HARTWELL: Agent Scully, you really know your stuff.

MULDER: Sheriff, you say this man is exactly as you found him?

HARTWELL: Yes, sir, to the letter.

MULDER: Have you noticed that this man's shoes are untied? (In a voice like "Eureka! I've found the answer!)

HARTWELL: Yeah, they sure are.

SCULLY: Mulder, what's your point?

MULDER: This means something. Sheriff, do you have an old cemetery in town off the beaten path, the creepier the better?

HARTWELL: Uh, yeah.

MULDER: Take me there now. (he snaps his fingers at the sheriff)

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Scully, we're going to need a complete autopsy on this man, the sooner the better.

SCULLY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I even looking for? (She walks to Mulder, who puts his hands on her shoulders and pulls her close)

MULDER: I don't know.

(He releases her and walks out. She smiles at Lucien)

SCULLY: He does that.

MULDER: Come on, Sheriff Hartwell.

(He walks by Scully and tips his hat to her)

HARTWELL: Ma'am.

LATER (Scully is in scrubs. She rolls a tray of surgical tools to the corpse. She talks into a micro tape recorder)

SCULLY: 4:54 PM, begin autopsy on white male, age 60, who is arguably having a worse time in Texas than I am ... although not by much. (She holds a scalpel in her hand) I'll begin with the "y" incision. (The blade falls to the floor) Yee-haw. (very unenthusiastically)

LATER (Scully plunks his heart into a scale tray and looks up at the readout)

SCULLY: Heart weighs 370 grams, tissue appears healthy. (She plunks a lung into the tray and looks at the readout) Left lung weighs 345 grams, tissue appears healthy. (She plops large intestines in the tray, it slops around over the edges and she pushes it back on the tray, looks at the readout) Large intestine ... 890 grams, yada yada yada.

LATER (The corpse is splayed open and Scully in hunched over him looking in the stomach)

SCULLY: Stomach contents show last meal close to the time of death, consisting of ... pizza. Topped with pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms ... mushrooms ... That sounds really good. (She works the kinks out of her neck and continues)



SCENE 8
SAM HOUSTON MOTOR LODGE - NIGHT

(Scully's voice over continues)

SCULLY: Having completed the autopsy I checked into the Davey Crockett Motor Court.

MULDER: The name of it was actually the Sam Houston Motor Lodge. (The name onscreen changes to Sam Houston Motor Lodge.)



SCENE 9
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Scully puts money in the "Magic Fingers" box, causing the bed to begin vibrating, she lays back, in heaven. She kicks off her shoes. Mulder opens the door and looks at her)

SCULLY: Chloral hydrate.

MULDER: What? (He enters)

SCULLY: What the hell happened to you? (She sits up on the bed. The whole front of his jacket and pants is full of mud)

MULDER: Nothing. Chloral hydrate?

(Scully's voice vibrates as she talks)

SCULLY: Yeah. That thing that you didn't know that you were looking for -- chloral hydrate -- more colorfully known as knockout drops. I found it in abundance when I sent the tox screen in on our murder victim. Now, seriously, Mulder. What happened to you?

MULDER: Nothing. Who slipped him the mickey?

SCULLY: My ... (She makes her fingers into quotation marks) "theory?" Your vampire. He found it necessary to dope poor Mr. Funt to the gills before he was able to extract his blood ... Probably did it to the cows, too.

MULDER: What kind of vampire would do that?

SCULLY: Exactly.

MULDER: We got another dead tourist. You got to do another autopsy.

SCULLY: Tonight? I just put money in the magic fingers!

MULDER: I won't let it go to waste.

(Mulder jumps on the bed, landing next to Scully, she wrinkles her nose at his stench. He laughs in glee as she gets out of bed and puts on her shoes. He's still laughing when she takes her coat and walks to the door)

SCULLY: This one's my room, Mulder. Don't get mud everywhere.

MULDER: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

OUTSIDE (The pizza delivery man walks to her door with the pizza as she exits)

RONNIE: Excuse me, ma'am, did you order a pizza?

SCULLY: Yeah. The guy in there'll pay for it. (She walks to the car as the delivery boy turns and we see it's the teen from the beginning of the show)



SCENE 10
EXAMINATION ROOM

(Scully's doing another autopsy as she talks in voice over. She's not in a good mood. She goes through the motions, very sloppily)

SCULLY: Foregoing both dinner and sleep, I was soon back at the funeral home examining one Mr. Paul Lombardo from Naples ... (She slaps the objects in the tray this time) Florida. Heart ... lung... large intestine. (The large intestines slop out of the tray and to the floor, she just watches, not caring and obviously tired and put out. She has really bad neck problems as she works the kinks out as she talks slowly) As with the previous victim, it appears that the subject was most likely incapacitated with chloral hydrate, and then exsanguinated. (Her cell phone rings) The drug was either injected or ingested. I'm not sure which. (Phone rings again. She answers it) Scully. (She only hears breathing) Hello? Hello? (She hangs up, sighs, then puts on new latex gloves) Where was I? Stomach contents. (She hunches over the corpse) Stomach contents include ... pizza ... (She gasps) Chloral hydrate's in the pizza. The pizza guy. (Gasps again) Mulder!



SCENE 11
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Scully kicks in the door with her gun drawn)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(The half eaten pizza vibrates off the bed. She sees Mulder's feet on the floor on the other side of the bed. Ronnie comes out from the side of the bed and hisses. Scully fires at him. He leaps over the bed and across the room, knocking her down. He runs outside. She rolls across the floor to the door and fires into the night)



SCENE 12
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder has his head on the desk)

MULDER: That's it?

SCULLY: Well, luckily, I'd gotten there in time. I mean, though you were drugged, you were ... more or less unharmed.



SCENE 13
YESTERDAY SCULLY'S ROOM

(Scully walks to the other side of the bed. Mulder's on the floor)

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you okay? (She turns his face to her and softly slaps it to wake him up. He wakes up and sings)

MULDER: Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine with all the chicks? (falsetto) Shaft! Can you dig it? They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother ... (falsetto) Shut your mouth! Talkin' 'bout Shaft.



SCENE 14
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder bolts out of his chair)

MULDER: I did not!

(Scully's expression seems to convey, yes you did, I saw it and you'll never live it down)

SCULLY: Long story short. Though my first four shots obviously missed Ronnie Strickland entirely, with my fifth I was able to shoot out a tire on his car, forcing him to escape on foot. I left you behind and I entered the woods in pursuit. I assumed that you were incapacitated. Then I heard screaming. When I arrived in the clearing, I found that you had caught up with him first and had ... over reacted. And that his vampire teeth were fake.

MULDER: That's what you're going to tell Skinner?

SCULLY: Well, I'm going to argue that we caught a killer -- an utterly non-supernatural killer, but a killer nonetheless. And that your zeal to catch up with him was augmented by the chloral hydrate you were given.

MULDER: You are afraid to tell the truth. (points his finger at her)

SCULLY: Excuse me?

MULDER: That's not the way it happened at all. I mean, what are you afraid of? That if you tell it the way it really happened, that you'll look like an idiot, like me?

SCULLY: Mulder? (She looks at the 'idiot') Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened? Starting at the beginning.

MULDER: You're damn right. Yesterday morning began like any other morning. You arrived at the office characteristically less than exuberant.



SCENE 15
YESTERDAY - MULDER'S VERSION
X FILES OFFICE

(Mulder gently places the ticket on the desk)

MULDER: I hope you brought your cowboy boots.

SCULLY: Why are we going to Dallas?

(In this version, Mulder is calm, collected and gives Scully every opportunity to speak her mind. Scully on the other hand is quick to grunt and be her not believing self, exaggerated)

MULDER: Actually, it's a little town just south of there called Chaney, Texas. They've had some incidents down there recently, which I think you'll agree, are pretty unusual.

SCULLY: Like what?

MULDER: Well, I-I brought some slides with which to better illustrate. Here we go. (He turns to the first slide.)

SCULLY: It's a dead cow.

MULDER: It's actually six dead cows. And here's the really interesting thing ...

SCULLY: Why am I looking at six dead cows?

MULDER: Um, well, because of the manner in which they died. All six were mysteriously exsanguinated.

SCULLY: And?

MULDER: And two little puncture marks right here on the neck. Look, I got a slide of that. (He goes through each slide of the six dead cows, slowly, embarassed that she has to put up with all this. Scully looks at him to maybe speed it up and little. He finally gets to the puncture marks. She nods sharply, Yep, there it is) And, um, one dead human victim. Last night -- a vacationer from New Jersey. His body completely drained of blood and two little puncture wounds on his neck. Okay, look, Scully I-I don't want to jump to any hasty conclusions, but on the strength of the evidence that we have here, I think that what we *may* be looking at is what *appears* to be a series of vampire or *vampire-like* acts.

SCULLY: On what do you base that?!

MULDER: Uh ... well, on the corpses drained of blood and the fang marks on the neck. (She rolls her eyes and he gives a soft chuckle) But, as always, I'm very eager to hear your opinion.

SCULLY: Well, it's obviously not a vampire.

MULDER: Well, why not?

SCULLY: Because they don't exist?

MULDER: Well ... that's ... one opinion, and I respect that. Nonetheless, I'm thinking a murder has been committed here and we can go down there and help bring a killer to justice in whatever form -- mortal or ... immortal he may take.

SCULLY: It's not that Mexican goat sucker, either.



SCENE 16
PEACEFUL SLUMBERS FUNERAL HOME

(Same scene, Mulder's take on it)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Upon arriving at the funeral home I made an interesting observation. One which you apparently didn't hear.

MULDER TALKING TO MORTICIAN: That's a whole lot of caskets.

MORTICIAN: Largest in-stock selection in the state.

MULDER: Why would a town with a population of only 361 need that?

MORTICIAN: Repeat business. (He's the only one who chuckles) Mortician humor. Excuse me. (He leaves)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Apparently your mind was somewhere else. (Sheriff Hartwell walks in. Scully is dazzled)

SCULLY: Hoo, boy.

(Mulder's version is somewhat the same in appearance, except for when he speaks, he's got massive buck teeth)

HARTWELL: Y'all must be the gov'ment people. (Mulder makes a scared face with his lips apart like Mulder's version of poor Lucien) I'm Lucien Hartwell. (They all smile at each other, Lucien in welcome, Mulder in horror, and Scully with pleasure)



SCENE 17
TODAY
X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: He had big buck teeth?

MULDER: He had a slight over bite.

SCULLY: No, he didn't. (Mulder shrugs) And that's significant? How?

MULDER: I'm just trying to be thorough. So, anyway, then we went to take a look at the body.



SCENE 18
EXAMINATION ROOM

(During this same scene, Scully is swooning over the handsome sheriff with the horrific teeth)

HARTWELL: Here we go.

MULDER: (professionally) No exam has been done?

HARTWELL: No, sir. This is just like we found him in the motel room as is.

SCULLY: (Dreamily gazing at the sheriff, repeats) No exam has been done?

HARTWELL: Uh ... No, ma'am. Once I heard y'all was interested I figured we'd best leave it to the experts. (Scully smiles broadly) Now, uh ... that can't be what it looks like, right?

MULDER: That depends on what you think it looks like, Sheriff Hartwell. Vampires have always been with us, in ancient myths and stories passed down from early man. (Scully stands behind Mulder, smiling, eyes wide, rocks from side to side, goofing around) From the Babylonian Ekimu to the Chinese Kuang-Shi to Motetz Dam of the Hebrews, the Mormo of ancient Greece and Rome to the more familiar Nosferatu of Transylvania.

HARTWELL: Mormo. Yeah.

SCULLY: In short, Sheriff, no. This can't be what it looks like. I think what we're dealing with here is simply a case of some lunatic. (She chuckles) Who, uh, has watched too many Bela Lugosi movies. He wishes that he could transfigure himself into a creature of the night.

HARTWELL: Yeah. Okay. Uh ... what she said, that's what I'm thinking, and, uh ... Yeah. (Scully loves being right)

MULDER: Still, that leaves us in something of a quandary because there are as many different kinds of vampires as there are cultures that fear them. (Scully yawns and covers her mouth) Some don't even subsist on blood. The Bulgarian Ubour, for example, eats only manure.

SCULLY: (sarcastically) Thank you.

MULDER: To the Serbs, a prime indicator of vampirism is red hair. (raises his hand to Scully's head) Some vampires are thought to be eternal. Others are thought to have a life span of only 40 days. (Scully's pointing at her watch, rolling her eyes, carrying on.) Sunlight kills certain vampires while others come and go as they please, day or night.

(Scully sighs deeply from boredom).

SCULLY: If there's a point, Mulder, please feel free to come to it.

MULDER: My point is that we don't know exactly what we're looking for. What kind of vampire, or if you prefer, what kind of vampire this killer wishes himself to be.

(Mulder notices the untied shoes on the corpse and stands with his head between his feet)



SCENE 19
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: Now, why is it so important that his shoes were untied?

MULDER: I'm getting to it.

CEMETERY - DAY

MULDER VOICE OVER: So, while you stayed behind to do the autopsy, the Sheriff drove me to the town cemetery.

(Hartwell opens the gate and they walk through. This cemetery is certainly not off the beaten path, the creepier the better)

HARTWELL: Agent Mulder, you mind me asking you why we're out here?

MULDER: Historically, cemeteries were thought to be a haven for vampires as are castles, catacombs and swamps, but unfortunately, you don't have any of those.

HARTWELL: We used to have swamps only the EPA made us take to calling them wetlands.

MULDER: Yeah. So, we're out here looking for any signs of vampiric activity.

HARTWELL: Which would be like, uh...?

MULDER: Broken or shifted tombstones. The absence of birds singing.

HARTWELL: There you go. Cuz I ain't hearing any birds singing. Right? Course, it's winter, and we ain't got no birds. Is there anything else?

MULDER: A faint groaning coming from under the earth. The sound of manducation -- of the creature eating its own death shroud.

HARTWELL: Nope. No manuh... ma-ma...

MULDER: Manducation.

HARTWELL: Manducation. No.

MULDER: Now, Sheriff, I know my methods may seem a little odd to you, but..

HARTWELL: Hey, look, y'all work for the federal guv'mint and that's all I need to know. I mean, CIA, Secret Service -- y'all run the show, so --

MULDER: It's just that my gut instinct tells me that the killer will visit this place. That it may well hold some fascination -- some kind of siren call for him, you know. (A horn honks)

RONNIE: Howdy, Sheriff.

(The teen delivery boy is in a red car on the street, a Gremlin)

HARTWELL: Oh, hey, Ronnie. How's it going?

RONNIE: Can't complain.

HARTWELL: Well, all right, then. (Ronnie drives off)

MULDER: Maybe after nightfall, Sheriff, but he'll come. Oh, he'll come.

(we watch the car drive off down the road)



SCENE 20
CEMETERY - NIGHT

(Mulder looking around with his flashlight)

MULDER VOICE OVER: So, we staked out the cemetery.



SCENE 21
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: Mulder, shoelaces?

MULDER: Hmm?

SCULLY: On the corpse. You were going to tell me what was meaningful about finding untied shoelaces.

MULDER: I'm getting to it.



SCENE 22
CEMETERY - NIGHT

(Mulder is spreading sunflower seeds around the cemetery, he gets into Sheriff's car)

MULDER: Sunflower seed? (He accidently drops some) Sorry.

HARTWELL: No, thanks. Do you mind ... (he picks up a seed that fell from Mulder's bag and tosses it) do you mind me asking you what you were ...

MULDER: Historically, certain types of seeds were thought to fascinate vampires. Chiefly oats and millet, but you make do with what you have. Remember when I said before that we didn't know what type of vampire we were looking for?

HARTWELL: Yeah.

MULDER: Well, oddly enough, there seems to be one obscure fact which in all the stories told by the different cultures is exactly the same, and that's that vampires are really, really obsessive-compulsive. Yeah, you toss a handful of seeds at one, no matter what he's doing he's got to stop and pick it up. If he sees a knotted rope, he's got to untie it. It's in his nature. In fact, that's why I'm guessing that our victim's shoelaces were untied.

HARTWELL: Yeah, obsessive... Like Rain Man. (Mulder nods) It's like when that old boy dropped them matchsticks, he had to pick them all up. Same thing, right?

MULDER: Well, he didn't actually pick them up. He counted them.

HARTWELL: Oh, yeah. 247. Right off the top of your head.

MULDER: Well, if he had picked them up he would have been a vampire.

HARTWELL: Yeah. I'll tell you what. I know I'm in law enforcement, but I'd like to take him to Vegas myself. Am I right?

MULDER: Well, that would be illegal, right?

HARTWELL: He's like a little calculator.

MULDER: Yeah.

CHARLENE (Over dispatch): Sheriff, you got your radio on?

HARTWELL: Excuse me. Hey, Charlene, what's up?

CHARLENE: I just got a call from the RV park. They got something of a situation there. Sounds like you might wanna have a look.

(They take off, lights flashing)



SCENE 23
ROLLING ACRES RV CAMP

(There's a motor home in reverse going in circles. People watch. Sheriff and Mulder arrive. They get out of the car and watch it go by. Ronnie walks up to them)

RONNIE: Hey, again, sheriff.

HARTWELL: Hey, again, Ronnie.

RONNIE: I guess you got yourselves a runaway, uh?

HARTWELL: Well, yeah, Ronnie, I guess we do. [to Mulder] What do ya think? We ought to shoot the tires out?

MULDER VOICE OVER: Anyway, skipping ahead...



SCENE 24
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: Why skip ahead? What happened then? (silence) Mulder? You shot out the tires, and what then?



SCENE 25
ROLLING ACRES RV CAMP

(The motor home is still going full speed in circles, in reverse. Mulder and the Sheriff fire at the tires)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Here's something you may not know: Shooting out the tires on a runaway RV is a lot harder than it looks. (Didn't slow it down at all) I then tried a different approach. Help! (Mulder's hanging on for dear life to the back ladder, body flat to the ground. That's how he got muddy!)

HARTWELL: Come on, bird dog it! Attaway!

MULDER: Help! (He lets go, the momentum rolls him away, landing in a mud puddle. The people walk to him)

HARTWELL: Ow. How you doin' there?

(the sheriff helps him up, they stand and watch as the RV slows to a halt in front of them)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Finally, we prevailed.

(It's run out of gas. They open the door and the upper part of a man's body falls out. It's got puncture marks on the neck)

HARTWELL: That's the same as the others.

MULDER: Right down to the shoes. (They are untied)

MULDER VOICE OVER: We interviewed everyone present. No one had seen anything.



SCENE 26
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Mulder's peaceful, tired, serene face as he talks in voice over.)

MULDER'S VOICE OVER: Tired, frustrated and lacking a solid lead, I just wanted to get cleaned up. I had the sheriff drop me at the motel, which is where I ran into you.

(At the sound of her voice, his head snaps up)

SCULLY: What do you mean you want me to do another autopsy?! (Scully is sitting on the side of the vibrating bed, screaming and talking fast, her voice vibrating ) And why do I have to do it right now?! I just spent hours on my feet doing an autopsy, all for you. I do it all for you, Mulder. You know, I haven't eaten since 6:00 this morning, and all that was, was a half a cream cheese bagel, and it wasn't even real cream cheese, it was light cream cheese. And now you want me to run off and do another autopsy? (She notices the mud) What the hell happened to you? (Scully gets up and walks to the door)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Finally... you left.

SCULLY: Don't you touch that bed.

(She slams the door behind her and the picture on the wall comes loose on the left side and swings. Mulder turns on the TV. He takes his coat off and puts it on the chair, takes off his suit jacket and drops it on the floor. He goes into the bathroom.)

LATER (Mulder's muddy shoes are on the floor)

RONNIE: Hello? Hello? Ah, hey, again. (Mulder comes out of the bathroom with just his underwear and undershirt) The lady outside, she said that, um, you'd pay for this.

MULDER: She ordered a pizza from you? Excellent. How much?

RONNIE: $12.98

MULDER: Let me get my wallet. (He goes into the bathroom and comes out with it) How much?

RONNIE: It's 12.98.

MULDER: Okay, there's $13.

RONNIE: Okay, then. Enjoy. (The teen leaves. He opens the pizza)

MULDER: Ah, Scully.

LATER (The pizza is on the vibrating bed, two pieces missing. Mulder takes another and has trouble getting it in his mouth as his arm is locked under him on the magic fingers bed)

MULDER VOICE OVER: So, I ate your dinner. (The vibrating stops and he reaches behind him to deposit more money) And that's when I saw it. (He sees his shoes) But by then it was too late. (He realizes he's been drugged and reaches for the phone. He falls off the bed. He dials the phone)

SCULLY (on the phone): Scully. Hello? (Mulder just groans) Hello? (he sees Ronnie's shadow at the window, then he walks in the door) ... Creep. (She hangs up. Ronnie comes in. Mulder throws the phone at him and falls on the floor. Ronnie moves closer. His eyes are glow in the dark green. He hisses, and he has fangs. Mulder's hand reaches up to the night stand and grabs some sunflower seeds and throws them at Ronnie)

RONNIE: Oh, man! What'd you have to go and do that for? You are in big trouble.

(Ronnie stoops to pick them up. Mulder tries to stand up but falls on the floor)

MULDER VOICE OVER: Then I was out cold. I don't know for how long, but when I finally came to ... (Ronnie is bent over him, eyes glowing, teeth flaring, ready to bite)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Ronnie looks at the door and stands. Scully's shots hit Ronnie square in the chest. Ronnie leaps across the bed.)



SCENE 27
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: You're saying that I actually hit him two times?

MULDER: Square in the chest. No effect.

SCULLY: And then he sort of flew at me like a flying squirrel?

MULDER: Well, I don't think I'll use the phrase "flying squirrel" when I talk to Skinner, but ... yeah, that's what happened.



SCENE 28
SCULLY'S ROOM

(Mulder is breaking up a wooden chair during voice over)

MULDER VOICE OVER: You checked on me, then left to pursue Ronnie Strickland into the woods. Once I recovered I knew what I had to do. (He picks up a leg shaped like a stake as it broke off, splintered)



SCENE 29
FOREST - OPENING SCENE OF SHOW

(Ronnie running through the woods )

MULDER VOICE OVER: I caught sight of him, chased him over hill and dale, and in the end... (He puts the stake through Ronnie's heart)



SCENE 30
TODAY X FILES OFFICE

SCULLY: Mulder, it's not just me. Nobody in their right mind will ever believe that story.

MULDER: Well, they'll have to, once they examine Ronnie Strickland's body.

(They both look at their watches anxiously. The meeting with Skinner is coming up)



SCENE 31
DALLAS FORT WORTH PATHOLOGY LAB

(The coroner walks in with a clip board and walks to a slab. He turns on the tape recorder)

CORONER: Case 0026198, Ronald Lavelle Strickland. (We see Ronnie's sheet covered body with a high dome on the chest. 'Course, if you didn't know which end was up, it would look like ... oh, let's not go there! The coroner pulls the sheet back. The stake is still in his chest) Probable cause of death ... (He looks at the stake) Gee, that's a tough one.

(He pulls the stake out and walks to a table. In the background, Ronnie sits up. The coroner, hearing a noise, turns and Ronnie, eyes green. Ronnie licks his fangs, and is surprised to find he has no fangs! He attacks him anyway.)



SCENE 32
FBI HEADQUARTERS
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER'S RECEPTION AREA

(Kimberly, the secretary is at her desk. Mulder and Scully are sitting on the couch, waiting for the principle. Scully leans over to straighten Mulder's tie. He pushes her hands away. The phone rings, secretary answers it)

KIMBERLY: Assistant Director Skinner's office. Oh, I'm sorry, he's about to go into a meeting. Yes, it may last several hours. (Scully hears and reacts, Oh boy) You're welcome. (Scully leans over to whisper to Mulder)

SCULLY: Mulder, please just keep reminding him you were drugged.

MULDER: Would you stop that?

SCULLY: It wouldn't hurt.

MULDER: Stop it. (Skinner opens his door and sticks his head out)

SKINNER: Scully, Mulder ... (They stand quickly)

MULDER: I was drugged!

SKINNER: I want you back in Texas. Ronnie Strickland's body has disappeared from the morgue. Apparently in conjunction with this, a coroner's been attacked ... his throat was ... bitten.

MULDER: The coroner's dead?

SKINNER: No, his ... throat was bitten. It was sort of ... gnawed on. Daylight's burning, agents.

(He goes back into his office, leaving Mulder and Scully standing there in shock for a minute)

SCULLY: But ... he was dead.

MULDER: I noticed that.

SCULLY: With a stake through his heart.

MULDER: I noticed that, too.



SCENE 33
CEMETERY - NIGHT

(Mulder and Scully walk through the cemetery with their flashlights as they talk)

SCULLY: So we should find Ronnie out here because ...?

MULDER: Because tradition states that a vampire needs to sleep in his native soil.

SCULLY: Oh.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: But Mulder, he had fake fangs. Why would a real vampire need fake fangs? I mean, for the sake of argument.

MULDER: Fangs are very rarely mentioned in the folklore. Real vampires aren't actually thought to have them. It's more an invention of Bram Stoker's. I think maybe you were right before when you said that this is just a guy who's watched too many Dracula movies. He just happens to be a real vampire. (She looks around)

SCULLY: Well, so where the hell is he?

MULDER: What about his family -- the ones who are going to sue us for 446 million?

SCULLY: Well, an aunt and an uncle. Their mail comes general delivery to a local post office.

MULDER: No home address? (A car pulls up) That's the sheriff.

(they walk out of the gate to meet him, Scully smiling)

SCULLY: Sheriff Hartwell. (Sheriff gets out of the car)

HARTWELL: Evening, agents. I heard y'all were back in town. Thought I might be of some assistance. (As he talks, Scully flashes her teeth to Mulder and points to them. Hartwell, in fact, does not have buck teeth)

MULDER: Yeah, actually you can. You can stay behind here with Agent Scully and keep an eye on things while I check something out. (He puts his hand on her shoulder, says quietly in exaggerated Southern accent) Don't say I never did nothing for ya.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: Where might you be living if your mail came general delivery around here?

HARTWELL: The RV park.

MULDER: You're good.

(Mulder leaves, Scully and the sheriff smile at each other)



SCENE 34
SHERIFF'S CAR

(Hartwell pours coffee for Scully)

SCULLY: Thanks.

HARTWELL: You're very welcome. (She drinks) So what do you think about vampires?

SCULLY: You mean aside from the fact that I don't believe in them?

HARTWELL: Yeah, aside from that.

SCULLY: Well ... they're supposed to be extremely charming. Seductive. (She drinks) No, I mean ... even if they did really exist, who's to say they'd actually be like that? As Agent Mulder says, there are many different kinds of vampires.

HARTWELL: Yup. Sure are. I really need to apologize to you about Ronnie. He makes us all look bad. He's just not who we are anymore. (She realizes she's been drugged and begins to show the effects) I mean, we pay taxes, we're good neighbors. Old Ronnie, he just ... he can't quite seem to grasp the concept of ... low profile. (Scully's head falls to the seat back. Hartwell takes the coffee cup and looks away) But though he may be a moron, he is one of our own. ( He turns back to her and his eyes are glow in the dark green)



SCENE 35
MOTOR HOME

(Mulder walks up by it and steps on a pizza thingy that keeps the cheese from melting to the top of the box. He opens the door and walks in. He finds a coffin.)

MULDER: Hello? (He opens it. Ronnie's inside, headphones on and listening to something rocky) Sleeping late. (Ronnie bolts up. Mulder slams the cover shut and gets on top. The cover rocks up and down as Ronnie tries to get out.) Ronnie Strickland ... you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Come on, cut it out, Ronnie. (He looks out the window and sees the town folk walking to the motor home. Eyes glowing.) Oh damn... (He hooks his handcuffs on the handles to lock Ronnie in. He shines his flashlight around the trailer and spots some garlic bread sticks, grabs two and goes out. He shapes the bread sticks into a cross and thrusts it at the people) Back! (Doesn't work) Ahh! No!! Aaaaahh! (They all crowd around him, he's lost in a sea of vampires)



SCENE 36
NEXT MORNING - FRONT SEAT OF CAR

(Mulder's shoes are sticking out the driver's side. A sheriff's badge on a coat appears in the window)

SCULLY: Mulder? (Scully's wearing the sheriff's coat)

MULDER: Scully, what happened?

SCULLY: I came to in the cemetery. That's all I know.

(Mulder checks his neck in the rear view window. It's clean. He gets out of the car and looks at Scully. Mulder checks Scully's neck. It's clean. He looks down at the coat, decides to not say anything then looks around at the deserted trailer park)

MULDER: They pulled up stakes. (Mulder's all muddy and his shoes are untied. She stoops to tie them)



SCENE 37
SKINNER'S OFFICE

(Skinner's sitting behind his desk. Not amused.)

SKINNER: So, that's it? They simply disappeared without a trace. And that's exactly the way it happened from start to finish? (Mulder and Scully are sitting in chairs across from him)

SCULLY: Well, I can neither confirm nor deny agent Mulder's version of events which occurred outside my presence.

MULDER: And I can neither confirm nor deny agent Scully's version of events, but, um...

SCULLY: Anyway... I was drugged.

MULDER: That is ... essentially, exactly the way it happened.

SCULLY: Essentially.

[Fade to black]

MULDER VOICE OVER: Except for the part about the buck teeth.

[THE END]

                                    PATIENT X


SCENE 1

[Moving through space, we pass across stars, dust, and constellations, manyof which we will recognize in our horoscopes. MULDER speaks to us in voiceover. Suddenly, from somewhere out there, a blinking light makes its way downward ... downward ... downward ...]

MULDER (V.O.): Before the exploration of space, of the moon and the planets, man hailed that the heavens were the home and province of powerful gods who controlled not just the vast firmament, but the earthly fate of man himself and that the pantheon of powerful, warring deities, was the cause and reason for the human condition, for the past and the future, and for which great monuments would be created on earth as in heaven. But in time man replaced these gods with new gods and new religions that provided no more certain or greater answers than those worshipped by his Greek or Roman or Egyptian ancestors. And while we've chosen now our monolithic and benevolent gods and found our certainties in science, believers all, we wait for a sign, a revelation. Our eyes turn skyward ready to accept the truly incredible to find our destiny written in the stars. But how do we best look to see? With new eyes or old?

[We hold on a single constellation and pan down as the blinking light - a UFO - disappears behind some mountains in KAZAKHSTAN, FORMER SOVIET UNION. It does not crash, it merely settles. Two boys - DMITRI and his FRIEND watch from beyond.]

FRIEND: 

DMITRI: 

FRIEND: 

[Moving quickly through the woods, the two boys head up the mountain, but stop suddenly.]

FRIEND: 

DMITRI: 

[Again they are on the move and, once they emerge from the clearing, they are confronted by the sight of a burning car.]

FRIEND: Mama! Papa!

DMITRI: Papa!

[As the two boys move, we see more burning cars, about twenty of them, all set ablaze and no traces of life. Dmitri shields himself from the heat when suddenly a MAN ON FIRE emerges, trying desperately to douse the flames. The two boys run off, scared, into the woods again. Dmitri goes one way while his friend goes another. Unfortunately for the friend, he is caught by a FACELESS MAN, and Dmitri stops in horror as he hears the helpless screams of his friend ...]



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

[The next day, three United Nations trucks make their way over a small hill to the site of the fires. Each one parks a considerable distance from the others. SOLDIERS emerge from each one, and each soldier carries a fire extinguisher. From one of the trucks steps out a woman - blonde, wearing a black cloak, with a stern face. She is MARITA COVARRUBIAS, the Special Representative to the Secretary General of the United Nations. What a title. The soldiers go about their tasks, putting out flames and prying open doors. Inside many of the cars are charred bodies, burned to the bones. Dmitri hides in the bushes, and a person stands behind him. He moves away from this person, only to bump into another - the man we know as ALEX KRYCEK.

KRYCEK: 

DMITRI: 

KRYCEK: 

DMITRI: 

KRYCEK: Too bad for you.

[We cut to broken glasses, and a soldier is standing over a body which has had its flesh burned right off.]

SOLDIER: It's like the flesh is cooked ... all the way through.

KRYCEK (O.S.): 

[Krycek makes his way over to Marita. These two have never met before.]

MARITA: 

KRYCEK: Your authority isn't recognized here. Only your lies.

MARITA: These are UN Peacekeepers. This is a mission of mercy.

KRYCEK: This is a mission of fear. Yours and the men you work for.

MARITA: I don't know what you're talking about.

KRYCEK: You go back and you tell them what you've seen here, what you've found.

MARITA: My name is Marita Covarrubias. I am a Special Representative to the Secretary General of the United Nations.

KRYCEK: I know who you are, and I know who you work for. Now you go back and you tell them ...

MARITA: Tell them what? What happened here?

KRYCEK: Tell them it's all going to Hell.

[In Russian, Krycek orders his men to take Dmitri away.]

MARITA: Does the boy know?

[Krycek begins to leave.]

MARITA: Did he see?!

[Krycek turns back around to face her.]

KRYCEK: You tell them to kiss my American ass.



SCENE 3

[We cut to the image of a woman in a wheelchair, speaking to us. Her image is on a large screen in the MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE VISITING LECTURERS' FORUM. Her name is CASSANDRA SPENDER.]

CASSANDRA: During my last several abductions I have experienced no fear whatsoever. And it was the absence of fear that allowed me to communicate with them and them with me. They've told me that I am an apostle, here to spread the word of the dawning of a new age of supernatural enlightenment.

[The image freezes, and we hear clapping and cheering from the crowd. In front of the crowd sits a panel of UFO specialists including (according to the names in front of them) DR. PER LAGERQVIST, DR. FLOYD FAZIO DGM, and SPECIAL AGENT FOX MULDER. There is also a woman who is unnamed.]

LAGERQVIST: Wonderful, just wonderful!

[The cheering dies down.]

LAGERQVIST: Sensibly, it's not a question of truth versus fiction, but of truths which are incomprehensible, because we have no physics - no real language for explaining Patient "X"'s story, much less the existence of extraterrestrials - nothing to prepare us for the ontological shock that is bound to follow ...

WOMAN: We quibble and we jaw about the need for proof for evidence as if it would serve some purpose, as if it would make a difference, when what we should be seeking is exactly what this woman is describing: Not IF they are here but WHY and what their business is.

FAZIO: In my conversations with her, she believes this business - the abductions and the experiments - are due to their plans for us, and that we are not simply breeding cows for them, as some have suggested - but subjects, much like we think of our relationship with God. And that there are sites - what she calls lighthouses - around which will be great activity.

MULDER: All this conjecture - the "ontological shock" that you speak of, for which we are so ill-equipped - is not only false but dangerous. This woman ... this woman presents no good or credible testimony apart from the feel-good message that she promotes.

FAZIO: You think she's lying?

MULDER: No, I don't think she's lying. I think that if you prepare people well enough to believe a lie, they will believe it as if it were true. And if you tell them a really big lie, like there are aliens from outer space, much more than a small one, they will believe in it. And if you suggest to them these aliens are doing bad things to them, the ... the power of the suggestion will be to make people believe that certain psychopathologies and neuroses that they're suffering from can now be attributed to that.

LAGERQVIST: Mr. Mulder ... Agent Mulder, she has physical ailments.

WOMAN: Are you discounting any belief in the existence of extraterrestrials?

MULDER: No. I just question mindless belief.

FAZIO: But you've cited evidence. You've made claims yourself.

MULDER: What I've seen, I've seen because I wanted to believe. I ... if you look too hard, you can go mad, but if you continue to look, you become liberated. And you become awake, as if from a dream, realizing that ... that the lies are there simply to protect what they're advertising: a government which knows its greatest strength is not in defense, but in attack. It's strongly held by believers in UFO phenomena that there is military complicity or involvement in abductions, but what if there is no complicity? What if there is simply just the military, seeking to develop an arsenal against which there is no defense: biological warfare, which justifies - in their eyes - making an ass out of the nation with stories of little green men - a conspiracy wrapped in a plot inside a government agenda.

[Several people shake their heads in disbelief. Later, when the conference is over, Mulder goes to leave. But a man in the audience catches his eye - his regression hypnotherapist, DR. HEITZ WERBER.]

MULDER: Dr. Werber?

WERBER: It's been some time.

MULDER: Almost five years.

WERBER: I came down expecting to hear how your work had progressed. I'm ... surprised, to say the least.

MULDER: A lot has changed.

WERBER: You seem to have abandoned something you believed so completely. In spite of what I know about you from our work together - the memories I helped you recover about the experience with your sister.

MULDER: Well, I've come to distrust a lot of things. I've - I've come to distrust those memories.

WERBER: I'm sorry.

MULDER: For what?

WERBER: I've taken a lot of criticism for my work with alien abductees, and in the field itself. The regression hypnosis work I did with you ...

MULDER: I'm not questioning your methods, Dr. Werber. I'm questioning myself, and how I was tricked, how I was led to believe through an elaborate staging of events that my sister had been abducted.

WERBER: A man with faith can indulge in the luxury of skepticism.

MULDER: I don't think you understand. There's just too much evidence that it's all been a lie. The conspiracy is not to hide the existence of extraterrestrials. It's to make people believe in it so completely that they question nothing.

WERBER: So, you and I have just been advocates of insanity all along? Is this the extreme possibility you believe in now?

MULDER: Yeah. Is Patient "X" any more credible?

WERBER: I hope so. I'm her doctor. I think you should meet her. I think you might change your mind.



SCENE 4
TUNGUSKA GULAG, RUSSIA

[We then cut to the TUNGUSKA GULAG, RUSSIA. This was first seen in a previous episode, season four's 4X09 Tunguska. A bright light moves around trying to find any prisoners who may have escaped. Inside the gulag, two men, one of them a DOCTOR pushing a tray, make their way down a hall. The other man - a GUARD - takes keys out and opens a cell door with them. The doctor enters, wearing a white lab coat, and the guard follows. Inside the cell they find a panting Krycek, and Dmitri laying on the floor in a corner, beaten senseless.

KRYCEK: 

DOCTOR: 

KRYCEK: 

DOCTOR: 

KRYCEK: 

[Krycek turns to face the guard, leaving the doctor in the room with Dmitri. He places a note of money on the guard's chest, a bribe.]

KRYCEK: 

[The guard walks off down the hall. Krycek notices, on the doctor's tray, an amber fluid in several bottles. Checking to make sure that the doctor is not watching, Krycek pockets one of the bottles. The doctor, meanwhile, is checking on Dmitri who is bleeding from the eyes, nose, and mouth.]

DMITRI: 

DOCTOR: 

DMITRI: 

DOCTOR: 



SCENE 5
CASSANDRA SPENDER'S HOSPITAL ROOM

[Now, we are in Cassandra Spender's hospital room. She turns and faces a man who has walked into her room - Mulder, accompanied by Dr. Werber.]

WERBER: Cassandra?

CASSANDRA: Hi.

[She makes her way over to Mulder.]

CASSANDRA: Fox Mulder.

MULDER: Hi.

CASSANDRA: I ... I am so glad to finally meet you. You are hero of mine.

MULDER: I am?

CASSANDRA: I read about you in the news, about three years ago. How you helped that man who escaped from the hospital - um, Duane Barry. How he had held those people hostage at the travel agency, because he was being called by aliens, and ... and you were the only one who believed him.

MULDER: You may not like me as much as you like that story.

CASSANDRA: Oh, that story saved my life.

MULDER: How's that?

CASSANDRA: I have been a multiple abductee for over thirty years. I had been afraid to seek help. Nobody would ever believe me, really, until I read about you. That's how I came to meet Dr. Werber.

MULDER: Cassandra ...

CASSANDRA: He told me that you had been through hypnotic regression yourself. That's how you discovered that your sister had been abducted.

MULDER: Cassandra?

CASSANDRA: Yes?

MULDER: Are you here voluntarily?

CASSANDRA: Um ... yes, under doctor's supervision.

MULDER: Whatever it is that you're afraid of, I suggest that you check yourself out of here as soon as you can and start living your life. Okay?

CASSANDRA: Uh, now is not a real good time.

WERBER: Cassandra is experiencing the sensation that she's about to be called.

CASSANDRA: Now is a time of war and stress among the alien nations. The ... the different races - they're in upheaval. I will be summoned to a place, just like Duane Barry.

MULDER: The man you're talking about died because of what he believed in. He died in a room after I'd been interrogating him - after he received a visit from some men from our government.

CASSANDRA: I'm sure the government's involved. They just, they don't want us to know about it all.

MULDER: Cassandra ... there was a time when I would've believed what you're saying without a doubt.

CASSANDRA: There is no doubt, Mr. Mulder. I know what I've experienced. I ... I have been through the terror and the tests more times than I can count. I have had an unborn fetus taken from me. But they're not here for the reasons that you might think. They're here to deliver a message. Except ... something has gone wrong. There are ... there are other forces at work. They're going to be calling me. I can feel it. And you, of all people, need to know about this because you're the one that can do something.

MULDER: I'm not.

[And with that, Mulder leaves.



SCENE 6
TUNGUSKA GULAG, RUSSIA

We then cut back to the Tunguska gulag, in a different room. Dmitri is bound to a table, covered in chicken wire. A grate slides open and light filters through. Dmitri looks up and sees a tap ... and suddenly the tap begins to ooze a black liquid which falls onto him and forms a puddle. The black ooze begins to make its way up, over Dmitri's chin and it enters his body through his nose and mouth. He clenches his fists in pain. Next, we see a BALD MAN who we recognize from 4X09 Tunguska and 4X10 Terma, walking down a hall with the same guard as before.]

BALD MAN: 

AIDE: 

BALD MAN: 

AIDE: 

BALD MAN: 

AIDE: 

[The bald man opens the cell door that they have arrived at, and finds within ... the doctor, hung.]

BALD MAN: 



SCENE 7
UROFF-KOLTOFF STAR OF RUSSIA, LEAVING VLADIVOSTOK

[Off of the shocked look of the guard, we cut to the exterior of a ship, the UROFF-KOLTOFF STAR OF RUSSIA, LEAVING VLADIVOSTOK. Inside the ship, Krycek makes his way down a flight of stairs, carrying a bucket. He opens a door, and enters a room where Dmitri lays.]

KRYCEK: 

[Dmitri nods slowly, and Krycek uses a wet cloth to dampen his forehead.]

KRYCEK: I'm going to take good care of you.



SCENE 8
FBI HEADQUARTERS, WASHINGTON, D.C.

SPECIAL AGENT DANA SCULLY walks down a hallway where she is confronted by fellow agent, SPECIAL AGENT JEFFREY SPENDER.]

SPENDER: Agent Scully, my name is Jeffrey Spender. Special Agent Spender.

SCULLY: Is there something I can help you with, Agent Spender?

SPENDER: I feel kind of funny approaching you like this. I just haven't been able to reach Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: About what?

SPENDER: About somebody he's been talking to ... somebody who claims to be an alien abductee, who I'd really prefer he weren't talking to.

SCULLY: You're going to tell me who this is?

SPENDER: This is going to sound weird. Uh, it's my mother.

SCULLY: Your mother?

SPENDER: It's a very long story. Uh ... she's an exceptional person. But for reasons that are probably kind of obvious I'd rather this didn't get out. Appearances being what they are.

SCULLY: Is this part of a case?

SPENDER: No.

SCULLY: Then why is he talking to her?

SPENDER: I don't know. She just called me, and she's ... she's a very disturbed woman. This is something that caused a lot of pain about twenty years ago. I'm just trying to save myself any extra humiliation. I'd like to build a reputation here, not be given one.

SCULLY: I think I understand.



SCENE 9
EAST 46TH STREET, NEW YORK CITY

Inside the building, the men who we have come to know as the WELL MANICURED MAN (WMM), the FIRST ELDER, the SECOND ELDER, and QUIET WILLY all sit among their peers and listen to what Marita Covarrubias has to say.]

MARITA: Whatever happened in Kazakhstan ... there was no one left to give an accurate account.

FIRST ELDER: How many bodies were there?

MARITA: Forty-one ... all burned beyond recognition. The result of some kind of intense biochemical reaction, none of the UN Medics had ever seen. Not in the Gulf or on any battlefield. The corpses were literally carbonized from the heat.

SECOND ELDER: A new weapon being tested?

FIRST ELDER: There's no intelligence on that.

MARITA: There's no clear data on the victims or their relationship, but I found at least two of these among the dead.

[She shows the men a glass vial containing two small computer chips ... implants.]

WMM: I think it's fairly certain that all the victims had them. That what was taking place was a staging for a group abduction.

SECOND ELDER: What the hell is that?

WMM: In the final phases before it begins, there will most likely be assemblies.

SECOND ELDER: We're years away from that.

FIRST ELDER: If we're to believe their timetable.

WMM: Unless it's already begun.

SECOND ELDER: We're fifteen years away!

MARITA: I don't think this was planned. I think something - or someone - set this in motion. An act of war. Against us and our plans. Krycek was at the burn site with a unit of Russian soldiers.

SECOND ELDER: Alex Krycek did this?

MARITA: He was there, probably acting on the same data we got. Whether he had any direct involvement in what happened, he knows what caused it.

WMM: Knows, how?

MARITA: He captured a boy at the site. A survivor. Someone who saw.

FIRST ELDER: What does Krycek want?

MARITA: I don't know.

SECOND ELDER: How do we find out?

[The phone rings, and they all know that very few people know the number. Slowly, the Well Manicured Man moves over and picks it up.]

WMM: Yes?

[Krycek is on the other end.]

KRYCEK: Well, look who's answering the bat-phone.

WMM: Alex Krycek.

KRYCEK: Those guys too cheap to offer you a pension plan?

WMM: Where are you?

KRYCEK: I'm in town, actually. New York City.

WMM: Just tell us what you want.

KRYCEK: You've been working on a vaccine. Against the black oil.

WMM: Unsuccessfully, you know.

KRYCEK: Yeah, well. I figured you and your buddies must have been busy while I've been gone.

WMM: Our research continues.

KRYCEK: I'll take everything you've got.

WMM: In exchange for?

KRYCEK: The boy.

WMM: Why is that in our interest?

KRYCEK: Because without what he knows, you're not going to need any vaccine.

WMM: What does he know?

KRYCEK: That's my opening offer. The longer you wait, the skinnier this kid gets.

[Krycek hangs up, as does the Well Manicured Man who looks menacingly at Marita.



SCENE 10
X-FILES OFFICE Mulder is doodling on some paper. Scully enters and throws a newspaper on his desk.

SCULLY: Shouldn't that be my picture next to the headline?

[The headline of the paper reads "All This Conjecture About Little Green Men - False, Dangerous, Delusional. -- Panelist Fox Mulder" with Mulder's photo underneath.]

SCULLY: Or is that just you having a little fun?

MULDER: Do I look like I'm having fun, Scully?

SCULLY: You look constipated, actually.

MULDER: That makes sense. I've had my head up my rear end for the last five years.

SCULLY: This wouldn't have anything to do with Cassandra Spender?

[Mulder is drawing a moustache on his own photo.]

MULDER: Cassandra Spender is living proof that the truth I've so boldly sought for the last five years is the truth of a madman.

SCULLY: How's that?

MULDER: One more anal-probing, gyro-pyro levitating-ecoplasm alien anti-matter story, and I'm gonna take out my gun and shoot somebody.

SCULLY: Well ... I guess I'm done here. You seem to have invalidated your own work. Have a nice life.

MULDER: How do you know about Cassandra Spender?

SCULLY: Her son accosted me in the hallway. He's an FBI agent.

MULDER: Great.

SCULLY: He's of the same opinion as you, by the way - that she's not well.

MULDER: You know, you try to reveal what's hidden, you try to incite people with the facts, but they'd rather believe some insane nonsense, refusing to believe what our government is capable of.

SCULLY: You've come a long way, Mulder.

MULDER: Yeah, and still nobody believes me.

[Scully looks concerned as she reads the newspaper.]

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Cassandra Spender was abducted at Skyland Mountain. That's where I was taken ... where Duane Barry took me.

MULDER: The woman is a nut, Scully.

SCULLY: It says here that she has an implant ... in the base of her neck.

MULDER: Where the government no doubt removed her brain. Isn't that what her son stopped you to say, Scully?

SCULLY: Oh, no, he, uh, he asked if you'd please not talk about this with anyone.

MULDER: Wish granted.

(Mulder exits, a little agitated)



SCENE 11
20 Miles from Skyland Mountain National Park

(Several cars drive past the sign, and we pan across to reveal a whole line of cars going back as far as we can see. We cut to the interior of a car, standing still. A flashlight illuminates a map. A DRIVER is pulled up at the toll gate and is greeted by a TOLL COLLECTOR. The driver appears dazed.)

DRIVER: Hi. I'm, uh, looking for ... I'm looking for, uh...

TOLL COLLECTOR: You're looking for what?

DRIVER: A mountain, I think.

TOLL COLLECTOR: You and everybody else.

DRIVER: How's that?

TOLL COLLECTOR: Well, you're a little late to the party. Six dollars. I hope you find some parking.



SCENE 12

[We now cut to Cassandra who is gazing out her window at the stars. She uses her fingers to print dots on the glass, forming what appears to be a constellation. The door behind her opens, and Scully is standing there.]

SCULLY: Cassandra? Miss Spender?

[Cassandra turns around to face her.]

CASSANDRA: Oh. Yes? Do I know you? Of course I do.

SCULLY: I don't think so.

CASSANDRA: No. No, I'm - I'm sure of it. Are you a doctor?

SCULLY: Uh, yes, but not a practising one.

CASSANDRA: No?

SCULLY: My name is Dana Scully and, uh, I'd like to ask you some questions.

CASSANDRA: Questions about what?

[Scully indicates to a chair.]

SCULLY: May I? Um ... I think you should know that I, uh ... I learned about you from your son.

CASSANDRA: Jeffrey?

SCULLY: Yes. I'm an FBI agent and he asked that I protect against your story getting out.

CASSANDRA: Oh.

SCULLY: I guess I'm betraying that by coming here. But, um ... but I - I don't ... I'm here for more personal reasons, actually. I took the liberty of reading your medical file.

CASSANDRA: You're feeling it, too, aren't you?

[Cassandra reaches her hand around the back of Scully's neck and presses down at a certain point.]

CASSANDRA: Here. You wake up at night knowing you need to be somewhere, but you don't know where it is. Like you forgot an appointment you didn't know you had.

SCULLY: That's not why I'm here.

CASSANDRA: Oh.

SCULLY: I'm here because I, uh ... because ... I wanted to tell you that you should ... that you should not remove the thing that you have in your neck. Not without possible consequences. Um ... I became very ill.

[Cassandra smiles.]

CASSANDRA: I'd never dream of removing it. I want to go ... wherever it is. Oh, they have ... so much to teach us. You being a doctor would want to know their great healers. Maybe that's why you were chosen.



SCENE 13
SKYLAND MOUNTAIN SUMMIT

[Back inside the driver's car, he peers through the dense fog at the top of Skyland Mountain. Suddenly, a SHOCKED MAN covered in the fog and lands on the bonnet of his car. He is being pursued by the faceless man from the teaser, who now has a long, metallic stick-like object in his hand.]

DRIVER: Oh, my God.

[The shocked man tries to open the locked door of the driver's car, but to no avail. The faceless man closes in.]

BURNING MAN: Help me! Help me! Help me! Please! Help me!

[The faceless man reaches the shocked man and prods him with the object. The shocked man bursts into flames right before the driver's eyes. The next day, a POLICE MAN gets out of his car and runs past Mulder. Mulder begins walking through smog. There are people everywhere ... FIREMEN, POLICE, and what have you, along with black, charred cars. Mulder reaches a covered area under which are large, yellow bags, each with a dead person inside. INVESTIGATORS examine the bags. Scully is also under the shelter, and Mulder moves towards her as she moves towards him.]

MULDER: Are there any survivors?

SCULLY: No. Not as of this moment.

[They start to walk through the rows of bodies.]

MULDER: From the smell ...

SCULLY: They've all been burned and there are plenty more who are still being bagged as we speak.

MULDER: Any preliminary theories?

SCULLY: Well, it appears they all came by car. Most of the dead are congregated in a wooded area a short distance off the road.

MULDER: Self-immolation?

SCULLY: There's no evidence of that right now. There's no accelerants, no incindiary device.

MULDER: And what was their relationship to each other? Were they families?

SCULLY: There's no way to ID their bodies right now. It's going to be a painstaking dental process. Mulder, why are you tiptoeing around the obvious fact here? I mean, this is Skyland Mountain. We're right back here on Skyland Mountain.

MULDER: And you think it's related to your abduction from the same place?

SCULLY: Well, you can't deny the connection.

MULDER: You think this is some kind of abduction scenario?

SCULLY: No ... I'm not saying that.

MULDER: Do you have any evidence of that?

SCULLY: What do you mean by evidence?

MULDER: That's what I'm asking you.

SCULLY: Well, are you going to give me your theory, then?

MULDER: No. I'm going to give you an explanation.

[And he walks off. Inside the Syndicate's headquarters, they observe the scene being played out on the television news. Marita Covarrubias also watches.]



SCENE 14
SYNDICATE HEADQUARTERS

MARITA: This is the same scene we saw in Kazakhstan.

SECOND ELDER: What the hell is going on? This is our own backyard ...

FIRST ELDER: This is no good. I don't like being kept in the dark on this.

WMM: Someone's going to great lengths to sabotage our work.

SECOND ELDER: Who?

WMM: One way or another, we'd better find out before it's determined we're unable to handle this ourselves ... to put a stop to it ... before the Colonists intervene.

Quiet Willy gets up and leaves.



SCENE 15
CASSANDRA SPENDER'S HOSPITAL ROOM

The television NEWSREADER breaks the silence.

NEWSREADER: More on our top story this hour - in the northern part of the state, last night's mass death in the forest just inside the national park at Skyland Mountain. Again, authorities have now released a barely-complete list of the deaths gathered from vehicle registrations, hoping relatives and friends will come forward and help to explain the cause or reasons of this bizarre tragedy.

[Names appear on-screen, and Cassandra looks on bewildered. She recognizes the names, and begins to cry.]

[Mulder and Scully arrive at the door.]

SCULLY: Cassandra? You called us?

CASSANDRA: This is not supposed to be happening. I knew these people.

MULDER: You knew them?

CASSANDRA: They - they were friends of mine.

SCULLY: Friends from where?

CASSANDRA: From a long time ago. It's not supposed to be happening. Not like this. You have to do something about it.

MULDER: What would you like me to do?

CASSANDRA: You have to stop it.

MULDER: Stop who?

[Cassandra's son, Jeffrey Spender, enters the room and sees Mulder and Scully.]

CASSANDRA: I don't know.

SPENDER: Agent Mulder? My name's Jeffrey Spender.

MULDER: Oh, son of ... the prophet.

[Spender turns to Scully.]

SPENDER: I asked you to leave her alone.

SCULLY: Your mother called us about the incident in Virginia. She said that she knew some of the dead.

SPENDER: Of course she did. They were in the same ridiculous cult that she used to be.

MULDER: There you have it.

SCULLY: She was in a cult?

SPENDER: A UFO cult believed they were going to be carried to immortality in some kind of flying motherwheel.

MULDER: I'm sorry. We won't be bothering you or your mother anymore.

[As Spender leaves, Mulder and Scully walk off down the hallway. They pass a man wearing a black coat and black beret. The man - Quiet Willy - enters Cassandra's room.



SCENE 16
UROFF-KOLTOFF STAR OF RUSSIA,
NEW YORK HARBOR

Krycek squeezes water from a cloth onto the face of the sleeping Dmitri to wake him up. He turns to leave the room, and is surprised when he again is confronted by Marita.]

MARITA: You think you can pull this off, don't you?

[Krycek grabs Marita and passionately begins to kiss her. The couple lean against a wall, continuously kissing.]

KRYCEK: They give me what I want ... I'm going to rule the world.

MARITA: We've got them on their knees, Alex.

KRYCEK: Yeah?

MARITA: Let's get out of this hole.

[Hand-in-hand, they walk off, leaving Dmitri's room unguarded. Cut to Scully's bedroom, and the constellation that Cassandra formed before with her fingerprints is the constellation we now see in the sky above. Scully suddenly jumps to life, awake, after being asleep in her bed. She recognizes the constellation outside as the one Cassandra formed, and moves to the window for a better look. She reaches behind and feels her neck - just as Cassandra described. Back onboard the Uroff-Koltoff Star Of Russia, Krycek arrives back at Dmitri's cell, and opens the door. Dmitri is not in there. Krycek enters the room, looking for any sign of Dmitri, when the voice of the Well Manicured Man comes from off-screen.]

WMM: Well?

[Krycek turns to face the Well Manicured Man, who has a gun in his hand.]

WMM: Where's the boy?



SCENE 17
X-FILES OFFICE

[Inside the X-Files Office, Scully enters and shuts the door. Mulder leaps from his seat, handing her a stack of papers.]

MULDER: Are you ready for this? I've been going over the initial forensics and pathology reports from the incident at Skyland Mountain and, while the event itself remains unexplained, I think it's less than a mystery who's involved - at least for me, and certainly for you. Our pathologists here haven't finalized their reports, but I was able to have three victims selected at random for x-rays.

[He moves over to a UV light and places the three x-rays on top of it, for easy viewing.]

MULDER: That's how I found these - small pieces of what looks like metal in the charred cervical tissue here ... here ... and here. Implants.

[He points to little black dots on each of the x-rays.]

MULDER: I followed up with the families of the three victims and I found that none had any cult associations but two out of the three belong to the local mutual UFO networks, and both of them claimed abduction experiences, and both of them were being treated by a medical health practitioner over the past few months.

SCULLY: For what?

MULDER: Take a look.

[He hands Scully medical files, and she reads from them.]

SCULLY: "Major depressive disorder characterized by periods of sustained anxiety and paranoia. Patient believes he will be contacted or called to an undisclosed place where he will be abducted by aliens."

MULDER: The implants triggered those responses. Those people were led to Skyland Mountain.

SCULLY: By whom?

MULDER: By the same government that put the implant in you, to function as a homing mechanism.

SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't make sense.

MULDER: Why not? A tracking system using military app satellite technology to monitor test subjects. Or to stage what people might otherwise believe are alien abductions.

SCULLY: But they weren't abducted. They were led to their deaths. And for what purpose?

MULDER: I don't know that yet.

SCULLY: Now, Mulder ...

[The phone in the office rings.]

SCULLY: Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to rule out what Cassandra Spender has to say.

[Mulder nods slowly, then picks up the phone and answers.]

MULDER: Mulder.

[We cut to a phone booth where Marita Covarrubias speaks into the phone to Mulder.]

MARITA: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yes?

MARITA: This is Marita Covarrubias. Is this a secure line we're on?

MULDER: Yes.

MARITA: You were at Skyland Mountain. Are you aware of a UN report on a similar incident in the former Soviet Union?

MULDER: No.

MARITA: I was in Kazakhstan, Agent Mulder. There is a connection. I have someone who knows it. I have him with me now.

[She gazes out the phone booth into her car. Dmitri sits there and, unbeknownst to Marita, he begins to pull out the stitching in his eyes and mouth.]

MULDER: Where are you?

MARITA: At a pay phone on Skodal Road, just off the I-90. Come here and wait for my call for my call, for directions.

[Marita tries to scream, but can't. Dmitri is outside the payphone, and the black liquid which was once in him now seeps from his eyes and mouth and Marita drops the phone.]

MULDER: Marita? Mar ...

[Mulder turns to face Scully, but she is not there. Cut to an opening elevator, out of which walks Scully. Scully walks down the hallway to a bubbler, and takes a drink of water. Cut back to the phone booth, as Mulder pulls up in his car. He sees no sign of Marita and the phone is off the hook. He gets out and walks up to the booth. Traces of the black oil remain there, and he's seen it before. We now cut to a phone ringing. Spender answers the phone, which is in Cassandra's room.]



SCENE 18
CASSANDRA SPENDER'S ROOM

SPENDER: Hello?

[Mulder is on the other line, at the phone booth.]

MULDER: Who's this?

SPENDER: This is Special Agent Spender. Who's this?

MULDER: This is Fox Mulder.

SPENDER: Why are you calling here?

MULDER: I'm actually looking for Agent Scully. I haven't been able to reach her, and she said that -

SPENDER: She's not here. Nor is my mother.

[Spender turns to face another man in the room - Dr. Werber.]

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SPENDER: She's gone from her room.

MULDER: Gone where?

SPENDER: Look, she's just gone. Don't you get it? She's got nowhere to go.



SCENE 19

[Cut to the night sky, and we pan down to be confronted by an illuminated bridge, with a beautiful blue waterfall in the background. Hundreds of people line the bridge in waiting. We know they are abductees, and we recognize some of the faces. One of them, namely, being Cassandra, with her wheelchair being pushed by none other than Quiet Willy. They pass another person, Dmitri, eyes and mouth unsewn. And who else is amongst the crowd? Scully. People begin pointing to the sky, where a bright blue light has appeared.]

AMAZED WOMAN: Look!

STUNNED MAN: There! There it is!

[The light moves overhead, and appears to "jump" forward in a sort of explosion. Every person on the bridge is looking up at it as it continues to move overhead. Scully makes her way through the crowd and approaches Cassandra. She takes Cassandra's hand, and does not recognize Quiet Willy. Suddenly, a man covered in flames comes running in pain and panic from the end of the bridge. Behind him walk calmly two faceless men, one of them being the faceless man from the teaser. Walking towards the group of abductees, we catch a glimpse of Scully's stunned expression, and we cut to black ...]

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]


                                 THE RED AND THE BLACK



SCENE 1

[We hear it before we see it - the steady click-clack of a typewriter. We carefully follow the movement of the words being produced.]

Dear Son,

I hope this letter finds you well. I get reports of you from time.

[Cut to a young BOY, dressed in a heavy snowsuit, steadily making his way through the snow. Then cut back to the typewriter, as we see the typing resume.]

I know these letters come as a surprise. You must wonder about me.

[Now we're back on the boy, as he is huffing and puffing, walking up a hill and passing snow-covered trees. The scenery is, for lack of a better word, outstanding. There is no word known to mankind that can describe this kind of beauty. Cut back to the typewriter, and the typist is pretty much going to town on this one.]

I remind myself of a Navajo story. Twin war gods come to their father, seeking magic and weapons to eliminate the monsters of the world.

[Back on the boy, and the scenery. He is getting closer. We then cut back to the typewriter.]

My hope is the same for you, and that we might reconcile the differences between us.

Your Loving Father,

[But no name is printed. The paper is pulled out of the typewriter. Cut to the boy. Trudging through the white snow, he reaches a cabin and knocks hard on the door. The door opens, and a MAN, whose face remains unseen, hands the boy a red envelope containing the letter he just typed, and some money. The boy takes both.]

BOY: Thanks, mister. I'll mail it right off.

[The man closes the door, and the boy looks at the envelope and reads the address aloud to himself, querying it.]

BOY: "Federal Bureau of Investigation?"

[And with that he begins walking off. Inside the cabin, we see the hand of the man opening a curtain to watch the boy as he leaves. When the boy is out of sight, the curtain closes.]

TAG LINE: RESIST OR SERVE



SCENE 2
RUSKIN DAM, PENNSYLVANIA
6:27 AM

[Over RUSKIN DAM - the site of the latest mass burnings - a red helicopter soars through the air and gently hovers in line with the bridge.]

CHOPPER PILOT: Heli-Unit Four responding to Ruskin Dam. We have numerous bodies. Repeat, numerous bodies. We're coming in for a closer look. It looks like some kind of incineration has occurred here. We're looking for survivors. Recommend we get emergency response up here on the double. We'll need medivac and triage facilities. Contact state and federal authorities for possible medical quarantine.

[Charred bodies lay on the bridge itself, smoke still rising from them. By the side of one QUIET WILLY's body, we see a gun. The blaring siren of a fire engine arrives on the bridge, followed by police cars and the car of AGENT MULDER. FIREMEN and POLICE run around, trying to help and the helicopter lands on the bridge. Bodies in yellow bags are carried away from the scene as Mulder walks through rows of them, looking for AGENT SCULLY. He sees her, burnt, dead, lying there and quickly makes his way over - only to realise it's not her. The bag over that person is zipped up, and from off-screen, we hear a voice calling Mulder. It is ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SKINNER and Mulder looks up to see him running over.]

SKINNER: Agent Mulder!

[When Skinner arrives, Mulder asks of Scully in earnest.]

MULDER: Was she here? Is she here?!

SKINNER: Yes, and medics are all over her.

MULDER: She's alive?

SKINNER: They're working on her now. Come on.

[Cut to the face of a burnt DMITRI, dead. We are inside a room filled with hurrying people. Skinner and Mulder walk quickly through the chaos.]

SKINNER: An SAR chopper pilot found her huddled in the woods this morning with about fifty other survivors. She has minor burns, but her fluids and electrolytes were abnormally depleted.

[Skinner and Mulder reach Scully, who is lying on a stretcher with a respirator covering her mouth.]

MULDER: Scully?

[She does not respond. An AIDE does.]

AIDE: She's in vasogenic shock. Unless you gents are doctors, you're in the way. This woman needs to get to a hospital. On three - one ... two ... three.

[With that, a number of doctors lift the stretcher and place it in the waiting red helicopter. Mulder watches on and Skinner runs over to him. They shout to be heard above the noise of the chopper blades.]

SKINNER: What happened here, Agent Mulder?!

MULDER: The answer just got loaded onto that chopper!

[The chopper door shuts, and the helicopter takes off. Mulder and Skinner notice AGENT SPENDER talking to some other men. Spender also notices Mulder and Skinner and walks over to them, but speaks only to Mulder.]

SPENDER: Can I talk to you, please? Is she here? Was she found?

MULDER: Who?

SKINNER: Agent Spender?

SPENDER: My mother.

[And he walks off to search for Cassandra. Cut to the inside of a medical room. A female DOCTOR stands over the woman who we will recognise as MARITA COVARRUBIAS, examining her.]



SCENE 3
MEDICAL FACILITY

DOCTOR: I'm fairly certain it's not a question of dosage. We've administered three intramuscular injections over the past twenty hours, since we found her on the roadside.

[The man known only as the WELL MANICURED MAN (WMM) stands by, watching, with a medical mask around his neck. He wears a medical gown.]

WMM: And you've seen no effect?

DOCTOR: No. It doesn't look good. At all.

[Marita, whom we now see, lies comatose on the medical bed, with tubes coming in and going out of her. The Well Manicured Man puts his mask over his mouth and open's Marita's eye - black smoke clouds it ... she is possessed by the black oil. He closes her eye and looks up, at ten other men who we know as members of the Syndicate. He makes eye contact with the man called the FIRST ELDER, in particular.



SCENE 4
WASHINGTON, D.C.,
4:18 PM

We are inside the hospital in which Scully lays on her bed, asleep. Mulder walks into the room and gently brushes back her hair, waking her.]

SCULLY: Mmmmm ... what time is it?

[Mulder can't help but laugh.]

MULDER: What time is it? It's time to thank your lucky stars.

SCULLY: Why are you laughing?

[Scully sits up, and Mulder presses the button to elevate her bed.]

MULDER: I'm not laughing at you. I'm just very happy to be standing here talking to you, that's all.

SCULLY: Mulder, what am I doing here?

MULDER: You were airlifted here in vasogenic shock.

SCULLY: From what?

MULDER: You've got some first-degree burns and scorching on your hands and face.

SCULLY: From what?

MULDER: You don't remember?

SCULLY: Mulder ...

[Her eye is caught by the television behind him. On it is a scene showing the Ruskin Dam. The volume is down, but supertext tells the story.

THIS SECOND CULT SUICIDE IN SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA -- THE SITE OF OVER 50 DEATHS SO FAR -- WITH MANY MORE MEMBERS IN SERIOUS OR CRITICAL CONDITION. AUTHORITIES ARE STILL ATTEMPTING TO LEARN WHAT WAS BEHIND THIS BIZZARE EVENT.

Mulder turns to face her.]

MULDER: Is any of this coming back to you?

SCULLY: I was there?

[Mulder sighs, indicating that she was.]

SCULLY: Doing what?

MULDER: I was hoping you were going to answer that question for me.

[A NURSE walks into the room, and sees Scully's bed elevated.]

NURSE: You shouldn't be elevated, Miss Scully, not until we get your blood pressure back. She really needs her rest.

[She starts to de-elevate the bed, and Mulder gets up to leave.]

MULDER: I'll come back.

SCULLY: Well, Mulder ...

[Standing outside the doorway, Mulder gives her the thumbs-up. Outside the room, Mulder is confronted by Spender.]

SPENDER: They didn't find her. She wasn't among the victims. They only found her wheelchair.

MULDER: I'm sorry.

SPENDER: What were you doing with her?

MULDER: What was I doing with her? What makes you think we have anything to do with this?

SPENDER: My mom's a cripple. She hasn't driven a car for ... I don't know how long. They found her wheelchair a hundred and thirty miles from the hospital, where I'm now told Agent Scully was meeting with her prior -

MULDER: Look -

SPENDER: No, you look! She's my mother. She's not some test subject of yours.

MULDER: Your mother will be found.

SPENDER: All I want is for you to leave it alone. Is that too much to ask?

[Off Mulder's look, Spender leaves, and we cut to the UROFF-KOLTOFF STAR OF RUSSIA, NEW YORK HARBOR, where the Well Manicured Man has ALEX KRYCEK handcuffed in the same room where Krycek handcuffed the now-dead Dmitri.]



SCENE 5
UROFF-KOLTOFF STAR OF RUSSIA
NEW YORK HARBOR

WMM: You're probably thirsty.

KRYCEK: Remind me to complain to the captain about the service.

WMM: You may have that opportunity. This ship is bound back to Vladivostok tomorrow. I gather there'll be quite an enthusiastic homecoming.

[The Well Manicured Man dips a cloth into a bucket of water and rings it out over Krycek's mouth. Krycek gulps the water down, tastes it, and spits it out.]

KRYCEK: Do you have the boy?

WMM: No. Ms. Covarrubias took him. Your alliance with her was as misguided as ours, but it appears she was unaware of the consequences of her deception. You were clever. Infect the boy to ensure infection of anyone who tried to learn what he knows, who would cheat you.

KRYCEK: Then where's the boy?

WMM: Dead. Victim of another mysterious holocaust. Unable now to tell what he knew or saw.

KRYCEK: Then you got no choice but to deal with me.

WMM: I'm afraid there's no deal to be made.

KRYCEK: I'm the only one who knows what those incidents are. What they mean. I know what that boy saw.

WMM: You've as much as told me what I need to know.

KRYCEK: You know nothing.

WMM: If the boy was your trump card why infect him unless you could also cure him with a vaccine developed by the Russians? One that works. It would mean that the resistance to the alien colonists is now possible.

KRYCEK: You're dreaming.

WMM: Do you have the vaccine?

KRYCEK: You need what I know.

WMM: Do you have the vaccine?!

[The Well Manicured Man kicks the bucket into Krycek.]

KRYCEK: Give you the means to save Covarrubias after what she did?

WMM: The means to save yourself.



SCENE 6

Cut to a sign on a wire fence which reads:

WIEKAMP AIRFORCE BASE
NO TRESPASSING
BEYOND THIS POINT
BY AUTHORITY OF
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

Moving over the fence, topped with barbed wire, we hear the steady whooshing of an aircraft, and suddenly, a huge fireball plummets into the ground and erupts in a gigantic explosion which illuminates the entire area. The aircraft is a UFO, now set ablaze, burning. After a while, we see a man dragging another man from the wreckage, and we hear the faint wailing of army trucks in the background. Four or five of them. From the trucks emerge men with guns, and they point them straight at the man dragging the body - a FACELESS MAN, with another faceless man lying dead on the ground. Cut to pictures of the Ruskin Dam. They are being held by Scully, who is still laying in her hospital bed. Mulder is by her bedside.]



SCENE 7
SCULLY'S HOSPITAL ROOM

SCULLY: I don't know what to say. I mean, I - I don't have the first clue. There's nothing here.

MULDER: Well, at least you're not alone. None of the other survivors have been able to give a cogent account, either.

SCULLY: Mulder, I have never been here. I couldn't tell you how to get here, let alone drive it.

MULDER: Do you remember when you last saw Cassandra Spender?

SCULLY: She was there, too?

[Mulder nods.]

MULDER: I ran more x-rays. I haven't told anybody yet what I found, though.

SCULLY: You found more implants?

[Again, Mulder nods.]

MULDER: That would explain how you were directed to the site, and why you can't remember. It would explain the sensation Cassandra Spender was describing, her abduction fantasies. It would explain Skyland Mountain.

SCULLY: Yeah, but it wouldn't explain why they would want to kill me. And it doesn't explain why I survived.

MULDER: It all comes down to a question, Scully. One that hasn't been answered or I don't even think honestly addressed. Who made that chip in your neck? That chip was found in a military research facility. Our government made that chip, implanted it in your neck as part of a secret military project to develop a biochemical weapon, to monitor your immunity, or to destroy you like a lab rat, if the truth were to be exposed. Your cancer ... your cure ... everything that's happening to you now - it all points to that chip. The truth I've been searching for? That truth is in you.

SCULLY: Mulder, when I met you five years ago, you told me that your sister had been abducted ... by aliens. That that event had marked you so deeply, that nothing else mattered. I didn't believe you, but I followed you, on nothing more than your faith that the truth was out there, based not on facts, not on science, but on your memories that your sister had been taken from you. Your memories were all that you had.

MULDER: I don't trust those memories now.

SCULLY: Well, whether you trust them or not, they've led you here. And me. But I have no memories to either trust nor distrust, and if you ask me now to follow you again, to stand behind you in what you now believe, without knowing what happened to me out there, without those memories, I can't. I won't.

[Mulder stands and looks out the window.]

MULDER: If I could give you those memories, if I could prove that I was right and that what I believed for so long was wrong ...

SCULLY: Is that what you really want?

[From his expression, we know that he's not sure. We then cut to a black and white photo of the captured faceless man, along with two military officers (one who looks amazingly like Adolf Hitler!) The photo is being held by the First Elder, who then passes it along to the Second Elder. The members of the Syndicate (ie. the "Elders") are standing around a circular table, through which they can see the comatose Marita Covarrubias.]



SCENE 8
MEDICAL FACILITY

FIRST ELDER: The facial scarrings appear to be self-mutilation done as protection.

THIRD ELDER: Protection against what?

FIRST ELDER: Infection by the black oil. He was the lone survivor of a crashed spacecraft at a military base in West Virginia.

THIRD ELDER: What the hell is he?

WMM: An alien rebel. This is what the boy saw in Russia. The last face the dead saw at Skyland Mountain, and most surely who killed our man at the dam in Pennsylvania. He's a resistance fighter against the alien colonists. This is what Alex Krycek knew - that a war had begun.

FIRST ELDER: What good was that knowledge? Without the vaccine against the black oil, no one can survive.

WMM: We have a vaccine. Developed by the Russians, stolen by Krycek, given to me.

[They watch as, below, Marita's doctor prepares the vaccine for injection.]

WMM: Do you see what this means? Resistance is possible. We have the weapons and the magic in hand.

FIRST ELDER: We don't know the vaccine works.

WMM: It will. And if it doesn't, we have a new alliance to be made.

FIRST ELDER: Side with the resistance?

THIRD ELDER: Suicide.

FIRST ELDER: They'll squash us as they do them. We must turn the rebel over.

WMM: But first, wait till we know the vaccine works.

[The Well Manicured Man taps on the glass, indicating for the doctor to open Marita's eyes to see the black oil. It is still in her, and the doctor carefully injects the vaccine. Cut to the OFFICE OF DR. HEITZ WERBER, SILVER SPRINGS, MARYLAND. Dr. Werber takes a seat, opposite Scully and Mulder. He reaches out and shakes Scully's hand.]



SCENE 9
OFFICE OF DR. HEITZ WERBER
SILVER SPRINGS, MARYLAND

WERBER: Hi, Dana. It's nice to meet you again. Are you okay with this?

SCULLY: I'm okay.

WERBER: There are a few things I want to say I didn't touch on over the phone. I'm sure Agent Mulder told you about how this works. Have you ever been hypnotized?

SCULLY: Uh, once ... but I have to be honest with you, I didn't have much luck.

WERBER: Well, I hope we can do better today. I'm going to be using something a little different. You may have heard of hypnogogic trance, which is just a light trance state where we relax some of the filtering processes. Okay?

[An ASSISTANT pushes Scully back, relaxing her.]

WERBER: I'm going to ask you to go back to the place we talked about on the phone. Just close your eyes and take long, deep breaths, relaxing all parts of your body. Long, deep breaths. Relaxing your hands and your feet. Relaxing your jaw, your pelvis. Long, deep breaths. Back to the "night place."

[Fade to black]

Scully speaks to us in voiceover:

SCULLY (V.O.): I don't think this is working.

[Suddenly, her face is illuminated with bright, white light.]

SCULLY: Oh, my God!

[We cut to the image of the UFO that she saw, and from now on we continue cutting to and from this "night place" to Dr. Werber's office.]

SCULLY: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

WERBER: Where are you, Dana?

SCULLY: Oh ... I'm, uh ... I'm with the others.

WERBER: Are you in the "night place"?

SCULLY: Yes.

[Cut back to the UFO, which shines a concentrated blue light on CASSANDRA, who is next to Scully, but withdraws the light beam and quickly flies off.]

SCULLY: And then ... and then it was gone. Oh, oh!

[Scully reaches out and Mulder takes her hand.]

WERBER: What is it, Dana?

SCULLY: It's, uh ... they're back.

WERBER: Who?

SCULLY: Oh, they're ... they're on fire!

[People are writhing around on fire.]

SCULLY: They're setting them on fire. I can't ...

WERBER: Who? Who's doing this?

SCULLY: Their faces, I ... they have no faces. I ... they have no eyes. Oh, God! They're coming at us!

[The faceless men move toward Scully. Quiet Willy turns to face her, draws a gun, and races toward the faceless men who are still setting people alight.]

SCULLY: They're surrounding us! They won't stop! They won't stop! There's ... there's another one. There's another ship.

[Another UFO flies over the faceless men and flashes lights over them, blue lights, setting the faceless men alight.]

SCULLY: They see it. They were attacking them.

WERBER: Who were they attacking, Dana?

SCULLY: The ... the faceless men. They're ... oh, my God, I can't -

WERBER: Do you want to stop Dana?

[The second UFO moves overhead now, lights flashing. One particular light in the middle shines down on Cassandra.]

SCULLY: No. Now it's coming at us. Oh, my God! No! Cassandra!

WERBER: Where's Cassandra?

SCULLY: They're ... they're taking her. They're ... oh, my God.

[All the abductees reach their hands into the air as Cassandra closes her eyes and is taken into the air from her wheelchair, until she has disappeared from sight.]

SCULLY: I can't ...

WERBER: Dana? Dana, I'm going to stop now. I want you to open your eyes.

SCULLY: No. I ...

WERBER: I want you to open your eyes, Dana, and come on back. Dana, I want you to open your eyes and come on back to us.

SCULLY: Okay.

[She opens and rubs her eyes, and turns to face Mulder, who is sitting beside her.]

SCULLY: You've been here the whole time?

[He nods, and gets up to leave. We cut to Skinner's office, where Skinner has the tape on his desk. Mulder and Scully sit opposite him.]



SCENE 10
SKINNER'S OFFICE

SKINNER: I, uh, reviewed the tape of the session as you requested. I have to say, I wasn't prepared for what I heard on this.

SCULLY: No, sir. Neither was I.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I'm familiar with the regression process and Dr. Werber's work. I've heard hundreds of those types of abduction scenarios.

SKINNER: Well what do you make of this one?

MULDER: The imagery is startling, but not atypical: bright lights, weightlessness, stolen memory, lost time expressed as a close encounter, an abduction, religious rapture as a kind of dark night of the soul.

SKINNER: Expressed?

MULDER: Described and then interpreted into a linear narrative, a, uh, gestalt impression of a subjective, nonlinear experience.

SKINNER: And your interpretation?

MULDER: That Agent Scully witnessed a very powerful event. Not unlike the one I described on my regression tape of the false memory of my sister's abduction.

SKINNER: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I've listened to the tape several times, and I don't have a clear recollection of what I hear myself saying, but I also don't see any reason why I'd be saying it.

SKINNER: I've got a problem. And the problem is, I have to head up the investigation into this incident. I don't have the luxury of interpretation. I have to make a report, and that report must state a reason or cite a fact, or at least make an assumption. As I sit here right now, I'm unable to do that. I need to know what happened.

MULDER: It was staged.

SKINNER: To ... ?

MULDER: To test a classified military project, or to cover it up.

SKINNER: Then wha - I wanna know what happened to Cassandra Spender.

MULDER: Cassandra Spender was taken aboard a military aircraft, as part of the staging.

SKINNER: Over the past five years I've doubted you, only to be persuaded by the power of your belief in extraterrestrial phenomena, and I'm doubting you now, not because of that belief, but because extraterrestrial phenomena is frankly the more plausible explanation.

MULDER: Then I suggest you put that in your report.

[Mulder stands up and leaves. Cut to Marita's eye, as it is opened by her doctor. The black oil is still in her, and the Syndicate looks on.]



SCENE 11
MEDICAL FACILITY

FIRST ELDER: The vaccine has no effect.

WMM: We must give it time.

FIRST ELDER: We must survive first. Survival means collaboration.

WMM: Turn over the alien rebel, and you turn over any chance of resistance.

FIRST ELDER: It's already been done.

[Cut to Scully walking into the X-Files Office. Spender stands behind Mulder's desk and catches Scully by surprise.]



SCENE 12
X-FILES OFFICE

SPENDER: I heard about this office. Really is in the basement. I'm here about my mother.

SCULLY: Well, we - we don't know anything more.

SPENDER: I spoke with Dr. Werber. He said you'd been to his office.

SCULLY: Did he say why?

SPENDER: No. He didn't have to. I'm assuming knowing the facts I do, that you're wondering about the possibility of alien abduction. I'm sure you know enough about it. Agent Mulder surely pushed the idea.

[Spender takes a video cassette from behind the desk and walks past Scully.]

SCULLY: No, actually, Agent Mulder hasn't.

SPENDER: I find that hard to believe.

SCULLY: I thought you were here about your mother.

SPENDER: You went to see her. I'd like to know what you talked about.

SCULLY: We talked about how she was feeling. We talked about a lot of things.

SPENDER: You talked about abduction, about her experiences? Did you talk about me?

SCULLY: In what way?

SPENDER: I have something here that I think might explain a lot for you.

[He inserts the cassette into a VCR and presses play. The screen on the television flickers to life, with the image of a young boy who is obviously hypnotized. The young boy is the YOUNG JEFFREY SPENDER. He sits on a couch, eyes shut, recalling events.]

YOUNG SPENDER: ... and there's a bright light. There's people standing around.

SPENDER: That's me. I'm 11 years old.

YOUNG SPENDER: They're looking up at something in the sky, where the bright light is. I'm starting to cry. I'm really, really scared and I wanna get back in the car, but I can't find my mom. And ... then I see her. There's something in the sky, and it's got flashing lights, and it's so bright it hurts my eyes. And then she going up in the sky. And I'm yelling, "Mommy ... mommy ... mommy..." And then I feel my feet, and they aren't on the ground. I'm floating up.

SPENDER: Seen enough?

[He hits the "stop" button on the VCR, bringing the tape to a halt.]

SCULLY: Is that what you were afraid people would find out?

SPENDER: Yes. But not because it's true. None of this happened.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

SPENDER: I made it up. Or I should say, my mom did.

SCULLY: She told you to say those things?

SPENDER: Essentially. She told me that story so many times that I believed it. Absolutely. It became a kind of truth and it was really just a substitute.

SCULLY: For what?

SPENDER: For the fact that my dad had left his family and it drove my mom insane. Only, I was eleven years old and I didn't know it.

SCULLY: Why are you here, Agent Spender? Why did you show this to me?

SPENDER: Because I think the process is bogus. Dr. Werber and his whole regression of memory is BS. It's like having a dream and then pretending it's real.

SCULLY: I think that Dr. Werber would beg to differ.

SPENDER: He indulged and infantilized my mother for his own purposes. I think he's dangerous and I think his methods are unsound, and if you went through it, I hope you'd question what came out of it.

SCULLY: I appreciate your opinion, agent Spender, but I don't have a mother feeding me abduction stories.

SPENDER: You've got Agent Mulder, don't you? How many times have you heard the stories he's told? How about the one about his own sister?

[He takes the tape out.]

SPENDER: Don't let yourself be used.



SCENE 13
MULDER'S APARTMENT

[Cut to Mulder's apartment, dark, as Mulder himself walks in. His eye catches something on the floor ... a note. It reads:

THINGS ARE LOOKING UP

And from out of nowhere, Mulder is pushed to the ground by an intruder who pulls a gun and points it in his face. Krycek.]

KRYCEK: You must be losing it, Mulder. I could beat you with one hand.

[NOTE: Krycek lost his arm in 4X10 Terma.]

MULDER: Isn't that how you like to beat yourself? If those are my last words I can do better.

KRYCEK: I'm not here to kill you, Mulder. I'm here to help you.

MULDER: Hey, thanks.

KRYCEK: You know, if it wasn't in my best interests, I would just as soon squeeze this trigger.

MULDER: What's stopping you?

KRYCEK: Hear this, Agent Mulder ... listen very carefully because what I'm telling you is deadly serious. There is a war raging, and unless you pull your head out of the sand, you and I and about five billion other people are going to go the way of the dinosaur. I'm talking planned invasion. The colonization of this planet by an extraterrestrial race.

[Mulder laughs.]

MULDER: I thought you were serious.

KRYCEK: Kazakhstan, Skyland Mountain, the site in Pennsylvania. They're all alien lighthouses where the colonization will begin, but where now, a battle's being waged. A struggle for heaven and earth. Where there is one law: Fight or die. And one rule: Resist or serve.

MULDER: Serve who?

KRYCEK: No, not who. What.

MULDER: Krycek, you're a murderer, a liar and a coward. Just because you stick a gun in my chest, I'm supposed to believe you're my friend?

KRYCEK: Get up.

[Krycek backs off, and Mulder sits up.]

KRYCEK: I was sent by a man ... a man who knows, as I do, that resistance is in our grasp, and in yours. The mass incinerations were strikes by an alien rebellion to upset plans for occupation. Now, one of these rebels is being held captive. And if he dies, so does the resistance.

[Krycek leans over and kisses Mulder on the cheek. He uncocks the gun and hands it to Mulder, who takes it.]

KRYCEK: 

[And he leaves, with Mulder sitting there on the floor. Cut to Wiekamp Air Force Base, where the man introduced to us as the Pilot but who we have come to know and love as the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER hops the fence and runs off into the night. Back in Mulder's apartment, there is a knock at the door.]

MULDER: Come in.

[The door is opened by Scully, who is startled to see Mulder just sitting on his couch in the dark.]

SCULLY: Mulder? What are you doing sitting here in the dark?

MULDER: Thinking.

SCULLY: Thinking about what?

MULDER: Oh, the usual. Destiny, fate, how to throw a curve ball. The inextricable relationships in our lives that are neither accidental nor somehow in our control, either.

SCULLY: Well, I've just taken a long walk and I've reconsidered that I may have been wrong about what I believed happened to me.

MULDER: I've been doing some reconsidering of my own.

[He hands her the note which reads THINGS ARE LOOKING UP. she turns it over and on the flip side is written:

WIEKAMP AIR FORCE BASE

A leap.]

SCULLY: What is this?

MULDER: Maybe an answer ... to a question you and I seem to have been destined to ask.

He walks past her, and she turns to follow.



SCENE 14
WIEKAMP AIR FORCE BASE

Mulder and Scully pull up at the gate. The gates are opened and they drive in to a toll booth. A young OFFICER who is acting as guard greets them somewhat coldly.]

OFFICER: Yes, sir?

[Mulder shows him his ID.]

MULDER: We're federal agents requesting permission to enter the base.

OFFICER: You have any paperwork to go with that, Agent Muldar?

MULDER: It's Mulder. I wasn't aware that any special authorization was needed to enter.

OFFICER: Well, due to the nature of our facility and the hazardous chemicals on site, I can only allow precleared civilians and military personnel on base.

[A truck pulls up on the other side of the gate, shining its lights in our eyes. Scully watches it.]

MULDER: Are you aware there's been a leak and contamination in one of the labs and the personnel on site need immediate medical attention?

OFFICER: No, sir, I wasn't.

MULDER: Why don't you go check on that, son? I'd hate for somebody to die because you were uninformed.

[The officer runs off into his booth, and the truck gets closer.

MULDER: Buckle up, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, he's armed and well within his jurisdiction.

[Inside the booth, the officer dials a phone number and begins to speak into the phone. The gate opens for the truck to exit, and Scully looks at the driver of the truck. It is the now-dead Quiet Willy.]

SCULLY: I know this man.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: That driver. I know his face.

[The officer looks out the window at Mulder and Scully. He speaks into the phone and Mulder watches the truck.]

OFFICER: Yes, sir.

[The officer exits the booth and sees Mulder on the back of the truck. He draws a gun.]

OFFICER: Stop that truck!

[He suddenly turns the gun on Scully.]

OFFICER: Get out of the car! You're under arrest. This is west gate. I've got a breach of security and a possible hijacking of a military vehicle. Repeat, this is w -



SCENE 15
TRUCK

[Cut to the truck as Mulder climbs under a canvas and into the back of it. The back is empty, as we can see when Mulder shines his flashlight around. He moves up to a door with a window in it and when he looks through the window he sees ... the captured faceless man. Suddenly, the truck comes to a halt. Inside the driver's compartment, Quiet Willy takes off his gloves and hat and literally changes - morphs - into the alien bounty hunter. Or it should be said that it was the other way around ... the bounty hunter had morphed into Quiet Willy, but now he is back in his natural form. He gets out of the truck and goes around the back, lifts up the canvas, and gets in. There is no-one there, but he moves towards the door behind which is the faceless man. He pulls out a stiletto and flicks the blade open, watching the faceless man look on in unease. The bounty hunter begins to open the door when suddenly there is a BANG - and a blue light engulfs the entire truck. The truck begins to shake, and someone is transported into the truck ... another faceless man, there to kill the bounty hunter. Without warning, Mulder comes out from hiding with his gun drawn.]

MULDER: Nooooooooo!

[He fires, but we do not see who he hits. Cut to Marita's eye, opened. There is no black oil within her. The vaccine worked. The doctor looks up at the Well Manicured Man, who nods in recognition. Cut to Mulder, inside the truck, with no recollection of what happened. MILITARY OFFICERS shine flashlights on him, and he notices that the faceless man - the rebel - is gone. The officers handcuff him and take him away, throwing him into the car with Scully.]

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: I don't know.

He covers his face, almost in tears, but she comforts him.



SCENE 16
FBI HEADQUARTERS, WASHINGTON DC

Spender enters Skinner's office.]

SKINNER: Agent Spender?

SPENDER: Yes, sir?

SKINNER: I'm sorry. There's been no news about your mother.

[He hands Spender a case folder, marked X-152830.]

SKINNER: I appreciate your wanting to keep this discreet. I'll try and do that. But you should know Agent Mulder has opened an X-File on this case. This hasn't reflected on you in any way, Agent Spender.

SPENDER: Thank you, sir.

SKINNER: You'll do fine. It seems you have a patron outside this office who thinks highly of you.

SPENDER: Who's that?

SKINNER: I don't know. Someone working with a high level of influence.

[Spender turns and exits. Outside, a MAIL MAN catches him.]

MAIL MAN: Oh, Agent Spender. Got a letter for you.

He takes out a red envelope marked:

R. R. #1
North Hatley, Quebec
JOB 2C0
Canada

and gives it to Spender.



SCENE 17
CANADA

Cut back to the snow-covered cabin from the teaser. The boy trudges through the snow and knocks on the door. It opens, and the boy hands the man inside the same red envelope - it is marked:

RETURN TO SENDER
NO FORWARDING SERVICE AVAILABLE

and with that the boy leaves.

BOY: Sorry about that, mister.

[We pan up to see the face of the man. He holds a cigarette in one hand, and gently takes a puff. You guessed it - every x-phile's favorite fiend, the Cigarette Smoking Man. He's back.]

SCENE 1
CALEDONIA, WISCONSIN
NOVEMBER 17, 1990

(Day. A Sheriffs car pulls up in front of a dilapidated old rural house. SHERIFF and LANDLORD get out of the car and face the house. POV is from inside the house looking through the window in the door.)

SHERIFF: Looks like nobody's home.

LANDLORD: Oh, he's here. He knows the minute he steps out I'm changing the locks on him.

SHERIFF: He's an old guy, huh? I don't much enjoy evicting old folks.

LANDLORD: This particular one will change your way of thinking.

(The two men walk onto the porch. SHERIFF knocks on the door.)

SHERIFF: Mr. Skur? It's the sheriff. Will you open up, please?

(Inside the house we see a mans eyes watching and waiting. Outside, the SHERIFF pulls out his gun.)

SHERIFF: (to LANDLORD) Go ahead and open it up.

(Nervously, the LANDLORD unlocks the door and reacts to a bad smell emanating from the dark house.)

LANDLORD: Ugh! God almighty! What the hell's he got in here?

SHERIFF: (entering) Smells like a whole lot of something went bad. (calling out) Mr. Skur? I'm armed. You're going to want to come out now.

LANDLORD: (indicating) The bedroom's back that way.

(They begin walking through the house. It is filthy, windows boarded up.)

SHERIFF: Mr. Skur?

(The LANDLORD looks into the bathroom, gasps, then turns away and vomits in the hallway, then runs downstairs.)

SHERIFF: What is it?

(SHERIFF looks in bathroom and sees a hand shape on the edge of the tub.)

SHERIFF: Ain't nothing but a glove. No reason to... oh, my god!

(It is actually a badly decomposed body in the tub. SHERIFF suddenly doesnt feel too good either. Then he is attacked by a man, EDWARD SKUR. The SHERIFF fires at him and SKUR falls down the stairs. SHERIFF follows. SKUR is muttering something over and over. SHERIFF gets close and hears)

SKUR: Mulder...

SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, D.C.
NOVEMBER 21, 1990

(Day. Silver late 80s model car pulls up outside a plain apartment building. MULDER, first season hair, gets out and enters the building. As he walks down the hall, file folder in his hand we hear a baby crying. He knocks on a door. ARTHUR DALES, 60s, opens it partially keeping the chain on.)

MULDER: Arthur Dales?

DALES: (glancing down the hall) Who's asking?

MULDER: (very nervous, very green, very cute) I'm a-a profiler with the behavioral sciences unit. (shows badge, clumsily) You are Arthur Dales, former special agent with the Bureau? I need to ask you some questions about a man named Edward Skur. You opened a-a file on him in 1952.

DALES: I don't recall.

MULDER: I-I brought the case file here with me. (shows an OLD X-File 525652)

DALES: How long have you been in the bureau? (MULDER shrugs, opens mouth) Do you know what an X file is?

(MULDER brushes his hair off of his forehead with his left hand giving us an oh so obvious view of his  WEDDING RING!)

MULDER: It's, uh... it's an unsolved case.

DALES: No. it's a case that's been designated unsolved.

MULDER: Mr. Dales, most of your report has been censored... as you can see. ( shot of the file which is half blacked out with magic marker) Now, if somebody's trying to bury this case. I'd like to know why. According to your report, Edward Skur disappeared 38 years ago, before you had a chance to arrest him for a series of stranger killings in which the victims' internal organs had all been removed.

DALES: And now you've found him?

MULDER: Yes. last week. Shot to death by a sheriff serving an eviction notice. A man was also found in his bathroom with all his soft tissue removed.

DALES: Well, if he's dead there's nothing you need from me. (begins to close door)

MULDER: (stopping him) Sir, sir, m-my name is Mulder. (DALES reacts) You know that name... and so did Edward Skur. How?

DALES: Have you ever heard of HUAC, Agent Mulder--the House Un-American Activities Committee? No, no, no, it was before your time. You wouldn't know. They hunted communists in America in the '40s and '50s. They found... practically nothing. Do you think they would have found nothing unless nothing... was what they wanted to find? Hmm?

MULDER: Uh... I'm sorry, sir. (RING shot #2 as he brushes his hair again) I-I, uh... I don't, I don't see the connection.

DALES: Maybe you're not supposed to.

(DALES closes door. MULDER reluctantly turns away from the door.)



SCENE 3

(Evening. MULDERs apartment. MULDER is watching a video tape of the McCarthy hearings and eating sunflower seeds.)

TV ANNOUNCER: The nation's chief red hunters, senator Joseph McCarthy and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, join forces. Working through congress, the senator from Wisconsin and the legendary lawman, vow to wipe out the red menace within our own federal government. Roy Cohn, chief counsel at the McCarthy hearings, warns communist mind control can strike anywhere, at any time. It is those Americans sympathetic to the communist cause-- the so-called "fellow travelers"--who pose the greatest threat to our national security.

(MUDLER unwraps the X-File we saw earlier. Not blacked out, we see words: "Gissing  Edward Skur or Terrill Oberman" MULDER looks at old card for the Communist Party bearing SKURs name, address, Leesburg VA, 11-5-47, signed by "W. Schneidermann." RING shot #3.)

TV ANNOUNCER: So says the young U.S. attorney--and he should know. It was Mr. Cohn that brought those atomic spies, the Rosenbergs, to justice. It was his staunch defense of the American way of life, that first brought Roy Cohn to the attention of senator McCarthy. With the support of the FBI, Mr. Cohn and Mr. McCarthy vow to work tirelessly to root out the more than 70 suspected communist spies, and the untold numbers of fellow travelers working in our own state department.

(Something catches MULDERs attention on the tape and he rewinds, putting on his glasses.)

TV ANNOUNCER: ...tirelessly to root out the more than 70 suspected communist spies and the untold numbers of fellow travelers working in our own state...

(He rewinds again focusing on one man in the hearing.)

TV ANNOUNCER: ...and the untold numbers of fellow travelers working in our own state...

MULDER: (quietly, stopping the tape, recognizing the man) Dad.



SCENE 4

(Interior DALES building. DALES opens door with chain still on.)

MULDER: (holding a styrofoam cup, RING shot #4) Good morning, Mr. Dales. I brought you some coffee.

DALES: Speak.

MULDER: Edward Skur died saying a name--my name. My father's name.

DALES: Go ask your father.

MULDER: My father and I don't really speak.

DALES: I told you I can't help you. (shuts door)

MULDER: (through the door) Mr. Dales, I want the truth, and I will subpoena you to get it, if I have to.

(DALES opens door again. MULDER smiles tightly.)

DALES: Before his disappearance, Skur worked for the state department, just like your old man did. You had to have suspected the connection before you came here yesterday, but you said nothing.

MULDER: The man that Edward Skur killed 38 years ago--was my father involved?

(DALES sighs and nods.)

MULDER: How?

(Later, they sit talking. There is an old picture of DALES in the file. DALES looks at a picture of a victim.)

DALES: Skur killed this man the way he did all the others. All the soft tissue, internal organs, ligature--all were removed... without tearing the skin.

MULDER: (who is SMOKING!!!!!) The coroner wasn't able to determine how.

DALES: Oh, I can tell you... how. What I can't tell you... is why.

MULDER: You said in your report that uh, Skur was suspected of being a communist?

DALES: Well, that's what they said he was. That's what they said they all were.

(Fade to suburban fifties house.)



SCENE 5
LEESBURG, VA
JUNE 24, 1952

DALES: (VO) To us, Skur was just another name on a list, another commie spy at the state department. We had no idea who--or what-- Edward Skur really was.

(1950s DALES and his partner, AGENT MICHEL approach the house. DALES knocks at the door. MRS SKUR, 30s, answers.)

MRS SKUR: May I help you?

DALES: My name's Arthur Dales, ma'am. I'm with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is my partner, Agent Michel. Is your husband in?

MRS SKUR: What do you want with him?

SKUR: (coming up behind her) Supper's getting cold, sweetheart. I'll take care of this. It's all right.

(MRS SKUR walks toward rear of house.)

DALES: Edward Skur?

SKUR: Yes.

(AGENT MICHEL enters and pushes SKUR against the wall and begins handcuffing him roughly.)

MICHEL: You're under arrest for contempt of Congress--failure to appear before the committee.

SKUR: I'm a family man, for God's sake!

MICHEL: You should have thought of that before you decided to betray your country, Red.

MRS SKUR: Edward?

DALES: Let's go.

MICHEL: Look what I found.

(MICHEL hands DALES the same Communist Party card that MULDER looks at 36 years in the future.)

SKUR: You planted that.

MICHEL: I'll plant one in your keister, Bolshevik, you don't watch your mouth.

(MICHEL lead SKUR out of the house.)

DALES: (looking at MRS SKUR and three children) I'm sorry. I...

MRS SKUR: (vicious) Get out.

(DALES leaves.)



SCENE 6

(A bar, Hoot Owl, evening. DALES enters and sits at the bar.)

BARTENDER: Geez, Louise, what did you do--take a swim in the Potomac?

DALES: I'd probably be drier if I had. Got something to warm me up?

BARTENDER: Where's your partner?

DALES: He's processing a prisoner.

BARTENDER: You guys, uh, still busting reds?

DALES: Till Mr. Hoover tells us different.

BARTENDER: Good for you, Mr. Dales. (hands him a drink)

[phone rings]

BARTENDER: (on phone) Yeah? Mr. Dales? For you.

DALES: (on phone) Yeah?

MICHEL: (on phone) You try to reach me?

DALES: (on phone) No, why?

MICHEL: (on phone) I thought maybe you heard about Skur.

DALES: (on phone) What about him?

MICHEL: (on phone) He's dead. He hung himself in his cell. The guards found him about 20 minutes ago. You figure commie central command tells these mopes to snuff themselves in the event of capture?

DALES: (on phone) I got to go.

(DALES hangs up, obviously upset.)

BARTENDER: Everything okay?

DALES: Oh, nothing a little bourbon won't cure.



SCENE 7
10:54 PM

(Night, outside the DALES residence. DALES sits in his car drinking from a liquor bottle.)

1990 DALES: (VO) I didn't know what I should say to her. "I'm sorry about your loss, Mrs. Skur. If there's anything I can do..." The words sounded hollow. No matter what I said, I was the man who'd busted her husband--turned her life upside down. I sat there for over an hour trying to find my courage in a bottle. And then, and then I saw someone I shouldn'tI-I couldn't--have seen. Now it was my life that would be turned upside down.

(DALES sees a man get out of a car and walk toward the house.)

DALES: Edward Skur!

(MAN begins running. Dales pursues. MAN, SKUR, turns on DALES and pushes him to the ground. Out of SKURs mouth we see tentacles emerging. DALES, understandably, is a little freaked out.)

NEIGHBOR MAN: (calling out his window) Hey! who's down there?!

(SKUR runs off. DALES catches his breath.)



SCENE 8
1950s FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Video footage of Rosenburg trial.)

1950S TV: Dateline, Washington--the Justice Department vows no mercy for A-bomb spies. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg once again manage to delay their date with the electric chair. Prosecutors say they are confident Judge Kaufman's death sentence will be upheld by the highest court in the land.

1990 DALES: (VO) The world still seemed clear to me that morning. Despite what I'd seen the night before, I still thought I knew who the bad guys and the good guys were. But that was all about to change.

(FBI Headquarters, interior. DALES is on phone. MICHEL comes up to him.)

MICHEL: Hang up.

DALES: (on phone) Let me call you back. (hangs up)

MICHEL: What did the watch commander say?

DALES: They're going door-to-door in the neighborhood. There's no sign of him yet.

MICHEL: They're not going to find him, Artie. Open it up.

(DALES opens MICHELs folder to see picture of a dead looking SKUR in his jail cell.)

DALES: Skur...

MICHEL: Maybe you want to change your description of the suspect who assaulted you.

DALES: When were these taken?

MICHEL: Last night. Two hours before you say Skur attacked you. You had a few. You were feeling bad about what happened. It's understandable.

DALES: I... I didn't have that much to drink.

MICHEL: Just leave Skur's name out of your report. Nobody else has to know.

DALES: I already filed my report. An hour ago.

MAN: Dales. Call for you.

DALES: (on phone) Yes. I'll be right there. [to Michel] it's the Justice Department. They want to talk to me.



SCENE 9

(DALES walks down hall and enters door with following words on it.)

ROY M. COHN
SPECIAL ASSISTANT
TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
INTERNAL SECURITY

COHN: Agent Dales, have a seat. (sits on the edge of another chair) You know who I am?

DALES: You prosecuted the Rosenbergs. Now you're working with Mr. Hoover and, uh, Senator McCarthy.

COHN: Then you know how important my work is--how vital it is to the future of this country that these rats, these vermin, who dare call themselves Americans be exposed as the traitors they are.

DALES: I don't interest myself in politics, Mr. Cohn.

COHN: Everything is political, Agent Dales. Like this report you filed this morning. We've spoken to Mrs. Skur and the neighbors. You seem to be the only person who can identify that man as Edward Skur.

DALES: Do you believe me, then?

COHN: We are fighting a powerful enemy in a war of ideology. In any war there are secrets--truths that must be kept from the public in order to serve the greater good.

DALES: You want me to amend my report? Take out any reference to Edward Skur? I don't understand...

COHN: You're not supposed to understand. You're supposed to follow orders.



SCENE 10

(FBI bullpen, DALES is typing report, suspect UNKNOWN. DOROTHY BAHNSEN, clerk, approaches with a cartful of files.)

BAHNSEN: Agent Dales?

DALES: Yeah.

BAHNSEN: I pulled that file.

DALES: Oh, right. Thank you.

(He takes file. It is the same blacked out X-File that MULDER has 36 years from now mentioning GISSING, SKUR and OBERMANN. AGENT MICHEL comes over to DALES desk.)

MICHEL: Dales.

(DALES follows his partner out of the office leaving the file behind.)



SCENE 11
CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND
2:04 PM

1990 DALES: (VO) I'd never so much as faked an expense report or used a Bureau car to drive home, so lying didn't sit well with me, even if I was under orders. I wanted to leave behind the business of Edward Skur and never hear that name again. But it was too late. By then, Skur had already become a murderer.

(MICHEL and DALES drive up to a house and enter the house.)

MICHEL: Homicide call came in from Chevy Chase PD. Advise and assist.

DALES: Well, where are they?

MICHEL: Must have come and gone.

[German pop song playing]

DALES: I know this song. They were playing it the day my unit rolled into Berlin.

MICHEL: The guy must be a Kraut.

DALES: Yeah. (looking at pictures on the wall with famous people) Well-connected Kraut.

MICHEL: There you go. I got six ounces of German shrapnel in my can and this Kraut got to shake hands with the president?

DALES: What's that? You smell that?

MICHEL: Yeah. Kinda. Hospital smell. Formaldehyde, maybe?

(DALES and MICHEL walk through house. Find badly decomposed dead body.)

MICHEL: Well-connected dead Kraut.

DALES: What the hell happened to him?

(OFFICER 1 pulls his gun in the hallway door.)

OFFICER 1: Hands in the air! Over there! Come on! Now!

DALES: Whoa, fellas, FBI.

MICHEL: Credentials in my front coat pocket. Hey, easy on the material. I'm Agent Michel. This is my partner, Agent Dales.

OFFICER 1: Who called you guys out here?

MICHEL: You did, you mope. We got the call from your department.

OFFICER 2: We don't know nothing about that.

(DALES pulls bar coaster off of a side bar.)

MICHEL: Then who brought you guys out here?

(DALES looks at bar coaster. It says "Come alone." )

OFFICER 1: One of his nurses called in. Said the doc didn't show up for surgery this morning.

MICHEL: Something tells me he ain't going to make it.



SCENE 12
BAR

1990 DALES:[narrating]: I was summoned to the bar by a man who'd already been to the doctor's house that morning. It was the man, Agent Mulder, you came here to ask me about.

(DALES enters bar, pulls curtain for private booth and sits.)

DALES: Skur?

BILL MULDER: No. But I came here to warn you about him.

DALES: Like you warned that doctor you murdered in Chevy Chase?

BILL MULDER: I tried to save that man, but I was too late.

DALES: Skur killed him?

BILL MULDER: He'll kill you, too.

(MICHELs apartment. Michel enters, pops a beer, calls out the open window for his cat.)

MICHEL: [looking for his cat]: Myrtle?

(Cat meows and stretches on the couch. MICHEL closes the window.)

DALES: (in bar) What are you talking about? what is this, some kind of communist plot?

BILL MULDER: Skur's not a communist. He's a patriot. All of these men are patriots.

DALES: What are you talking about? What men?

BILL MULDER: There were three men--veterans--working at the State Department. Skur, Gissing and Oberman.

DALES: Gissing and Oberman. I read those names on a censored report.

BILL MULDER: They're dead now.

DALES: Murdered?

BILL MULDER: No. Dead by their own hand. They couldn't live with what they'd become--what they'd been turned into--and Skur's the last.

DALES: Why did they put out that story about him hanging himself?

BILL MULDER: Because they had to do something to cover up what they'd done to him. Label him a communist--say he killed himself and put him up someplace where no one's going to look for him. But his escape threatens everything.

DALES: Threatens what? What did they do to him? Look... you asked me here.

BILL MULDER: And I risked my career and my family by coming here. But the crimes these men have committed against innocent people... I can't have that on my conscience anymore. Someone needs to know the truth.

DALES: Who are you?

BILL MULDER: My name is Mulder. I work at the State Department.

(CUT to MICHELs apartment.)

MICHEL: (watching McCARTHY on TV) Mmm... attaboy, tail gunner. Give 'em hell. (Cat meows and knocks over beer bottle.) Ah, Myrtle. Dumb cat. Damn it! Damn it, Myrtle!

(CUT to BAR.)

DALES: All right, then, Mr. Mulder. Who is this "they" you want me to arrest?

BILL MULDER: You can't arrest these men.

DALES: Why not?

BILL MULDER: It's... political.

DALES: What are you telling me? Are you telling me that Mr. Cohn and Senator McCarthy are involved in this? Is Skur after them, too?

BILL MULDER: Skur wants vengeance for what those men did to him. He's a killer now. He can only guess at the dimensions of this conspiracy. But he thinks you're part of it. You and your partner.

(DALES walks away toward BARTENDER.)

DALES: (to BARTENDER) Your phone.

BARTENDER: (giving him phone) What's the number?

DALES: Klondike 5-0133.

(CUT to MICHELs apartment.)

MICHEL: I knew I should have got a dog. [sets down gun and badge, phone ringing]

DALES: Come on. Come on.

[Inside MICHEls apartment, we see that the phone line has been cut. SKUR attacks Michel. "Thing, a crab?" comes out of SKURs mouth and goes into Michel's mouth. MICHEL screams.]



SCENE 13

(Next day. MICHEL's apartment. Crime lab team is on the scene.)

CORONER: Are you, um... are you sure a man did this? Uh, I suppose, um, he could have force-fed him a... corrosive agent of some kind, an acid maybe...except I-I don't know why it wouldn't have, uh, burned to the skin.

DALES: That account for the smell?

CORONER: Maybe. We won't know for sure until we get a toxology report. Hopefully, we'll have an answer for you in six to eight weeks. Meanwhile, we can, uh, at least start on a physical exam of the body... Such as it is.

COHN: Agent Dales... Hey, hey, where do you think you're taking that? This man's a veteran. The body goes to Bethesda. Howard, take care of this.

DALES: Mr. Cohn, these men are going to the county morgue. An autopsy needs to be performed.

COHN: Come here. Give us a minute. (others leave) You wanna to test me--see how fast I can pull the chain and flush you. You want to see your name on a list? Are you now, or have you ever been...?

DALES: What are you talking about? I'm no communist.

COHN: You are, if I say you are. This is a matter of national security. Take this body out of here. Get it out. [to Dales, smug] See? You're a patriot again.

DALES: (VO) When your partner dies, a piece of you dies with him. I'd been threatened by Mr. Cohn, but I couldn't leave it alone... Not while Michel's killer was still out there... Not if I wanted to live with myself. I knew Skur had killed Michel out of vengeance for what had been done to him--your father had told me as much--but your father also said there were two other men who'd had the same thing done to them... Men who were already dead. Finding out what happened to them, at least might help me understand what Skur had become... understand how my partner was killed.



SCENE 14
FBI HEADQUARTERS

DALES with BAHNSEN looking at blacked out report.)

DALES: What is this?

BAHNSEN: The deposition that names Edward Skur and these other two men as communists.

DALES: It's all censored.

BAHNSEN: By the committee, to protect the identity of the witness.

DALES: There was no witness. This whole thing's been manufactured. Edward Skur is no communist. Neither are these other two men, Gissing and Oberman. I wanna see their files, Gissing and Oberman.

BAHNSEN: I already checked. They're missing but I recognize one of these names. It's in an X-file.

DALES: An "X-file"?

BAHNSEN: Yes, unsolved cases. I file them under "x." (Goes to file cabinet..)

DALES: Why don't you file them under "u" for "unsolved"?

BAHNSEN: That's what I did until I ran out of room. Plenty of room in the "X"s.

DALES: Who decides when a case gets an "X"?

BAHNSEN: The director's office. It's, uh... it's kind of a dead end. No one's supposed to see them, but it makes for interesting reading. Here it is. A German emigre, Dr. Strohman patriated here after the war. He was found dead in his office last week at the VA.

DALES: Let me guess. They weren't able to explain how. His body just kind of collapsed, right?

BAHNSEN: Yes.

DALES: Gissing? His name's in this file, somewhere?

BAHNSEN: Yes. He was a patient. Found dead on the scene. Suicide. I guess he didn't much care for his treatment.

DALES: They think he killed his doctor and then killed himself? How did Gissing kill this man?

BAHNSEN: That's why it's an X-file. They don't know.



SCENE 15
CORONERS OFFICE

GISSINGs body is uncovered.

CORONER: You're lucky Gissing's body's still here. The VA's been trying to have it transferred.

DALES: Why haven't they?

CORONER: Well, this fella's a bigwig in the State Department. His family's been kicking up a stink.

DALES: What is this?

CORONER: Well, looks like he had some surgery. Judging by the color of the scar, I'd say it was fairly recent.

DALES: I want you to cut this man open.

CORONER: (shocked) No, I-I can't do that. His family will have my head.

DALES: Gissing and a man named Skur were patients of the same doctors. I think whatever was done to this man was also done to the man who killed my partner. It may be the only way we have to explain how he died.

[The coroner opens GISSING up. They see something odd.]

DALES: What's that? What is that?

CORONER: I don't know. It, uh... looks like it's lodged into his esophagus. Wait a minute. Those are sutures. Whatever this is, someone put it there. Oh, geez. Whoa.

(Crablike thing crawls around in the corpses innards.)

CORONER: Oh... Oh, my god.



SCENE 16
SKURS HOUSEHOLD

DALES: Mrs. Skur, I hope I'm not disturbing you.

MRS SKUR: You have a lot of nerve coming here.

DALES: Your husband... You know he's not dead.

MRS SKUR: How dare you?

DALES: Your husband was discredited in order to cover up a crime. Mrs. Skur--a crime that was committed upon him, against his will.

MRS SKUR: Whatever was done to my husband, you're part of it.

DALES: According to VA Records, your husband underwent surgery for war injuries. So did two other men that he worked with at the state department, but the surgeries that they received... It wasn't what they thought it was. It had nothing to do with their war injuries.

MRS SKUR: Then what was it?

DALES: It's called xenotransplantation. It's, uh, the grafting of another species into the human body. It's a procedure that nazi doctors experimented with during the war, and I believe that they continued their work here, using your husband and these other two men as unwitting test subjects. I want to expose what was done to your husband, Mrs. Skur. I can't do that unless I have his help.

(DALES leaves the house. Car pulls up. COHN exits and confronts DALES.)

COHN: Get in. Just get in.

(DALES gets in the car and it drives off. MRS DALES goes down into bomb shelter.)

MRS SKUR: Ed? Oh, god. Are you all right?

(SKUR is in corner of shelter gasping, obviously in distress.)

SKUR: I told you not to come down here.

MRS SKUR: That FBI Agent came back.

SKUR: I'm getting worse.

MRS SKUR: He says he wants to help you.

SKUR: It's too late to help me. I can't help myself anymore.

[Sound of MRS SKUR screaming.]



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

COHN: You sit there.

HOOVER: Leave us alone.

COHN: Mr. Director...

HOOVER: Leave us. [guards leave, to Dales] In 1945, at the time of the first conference to map out the peace, after the second world war, there lived within the Soviet orbit 180 million people. Lined up on the anti-totalitarian side at that time were one billion, 625 million people. Today, Mr. Dales, just seven years later, there are 800 million people under the absolute domination of Soviet Russia--an increase of over 400 percent. On our side the figure has shrunk to around 500 million. In other words... in less than seven years the odds have changed from nine to one in our favor, to eight to five against us. The threat of global communist domination is a reality that can be ignored only at the risk of our own annihilation.

DALES: The men we arrested weren't communists.

HOOVER: If we are to defeat the enemy, we must use their tools. We must go further. We must do those things which even our enemies would be ashamed to do. It is only through strength that we can make our enemies fear us, and thereby ensure our own survival. You have one chance, Mr. Dales, to save yourself--to demonstrate that you have the strength to serve your country.



SCENE 18

(Night. Car pulls up in front of bar. BILL MULDER and DALES are inside the car.)

BILL MULDER: Make your meeting with Skur. Let him think you're alone. Put him at ease. We'll be in when the time is right.

DALES: Is this why you came to see me, Mr. Mulder? Make me your stalking horse?

BILL MULDER: I follow my orders.

(BILL MULDER takes DALES gun.)

DALES: I might need that.

BILL MULDER: We want him alive.

(DALES enters the bar.)

DALES: Here you go. (Hands bartender wad of money.)

BARTENDER: I turned the lights off out front. Just pull the door shut when you go.

DALES: Thanks for your help.

BARTENDER: Anything to help out the Bureau. (leaves)

(DALES pours a drink.)

SKUR: Did you come here to kill me or save me?

DALES: I'm here to help you, just like I told your wife.

SKUR: My wife is dead. I'm dead, too, inside, (We see that BILL MULDER is listening to the conversation out in the car.) because of this thing they put in me. For what? To turn me into some kind of killing machine, or just to see what would happen? They're not coming, you know. They wanted me to kill you, or you wouldn't be here. You're part of their test now, too.

DALES: I don't want to kill you.

SKUR: I know.

[Skur attacks Dales. "Thing" comes out of Skur's mouth. Out in the car, BILL MULDER starts to exit the car. He is restrained by a companion - [First Elder? CSM?] Thing almost reaches DALES. DALES handcuffs SKUR to bar rail. BILL MULDER, listening to sounds of attack on tape finally exits car and finds SKUR handcuffed, and DALES missing.)



SCENE 19
1990 DALES apartment
(RING shot #5.)

MULDER: (brushing hair out of face, Ring shot #6) I can't believe my father threw in with these men. He let them dictate his conscience.

DALES: Oh, don't fool yourself. None of us are free to choose. I was ruined for my insubordination. You keep digging through the...The X-files and they'll bury you, too.

MULDER: Skur died saying my father's name. Why?

DALES: I haven't the faintest idea.

MULDER: (putting on jacket) Well, there was, um... there was one thing you didn't explain. It was, uh... how Skur was able to get away... how he was able to live in obscurity for the last 38 years.

DALES: 38 years? My God. Well, I kept hearing things through the years, you know. Uh, people tell me things. I heard that he was dead-- that he'd been kept in some secret lab while they finished up the, uh, experiment. I even thought that maybe... maybe some poor innocent bastard--somebody with a conscience--might have let him go.

(Flashback 1950s, car on deserted rural road. Man gets out of drivers side. It is BILL MULDER. He tosses keys to a surprised SKUR who is handcuffed to the window, and walks away.)

MULDER: (VO) Why would anyone do that? Why let a killer go free?

DALES: (VO) In the hope that by letting him live, the truth of the crimes that were committed against him and the others might someday... be exposed.

(Car drives away as BILL MULDER walks down the road the opposite direction.)

[THE END]

                         MIND'S EYE



SCENE 1
SOUTHBRIDGE DISTRICT
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE
6:35 PM

(Night. Convex wall mirror reflects MARTY, a young woman, entering an old apartment building. She walks upstairs, down the hall into a room and tuns on the TV.)

TV COOKING SHOW: This ... this heare is a special gumbo. This gumbo gonna make your tongue roll outta your head and dial 911. (laughter) (MARTY places paper bag on counter and removes carton of cigarettes.) Take your best large onion and chop it up like this. Gonna make you cry  cry youll be so happy. (MARTY turns on gas stove, and lights a cigarette from the burner.) And a big ole teaspoon of this cayenne. Mix it in good. Now its all gonna come to a boil. Dont watch that gumbo pot, or she aint gonna roll for you. Add in this nice shrimp and keep the flame going for twenty minutes. (MARTY turns off stove and sits in front of TV, smoking the cigarette.) Now some good parsley and them onion tops because Uncle Bayou dont want nothin to go to waste.

(MARTY has a flashing image of an angry man (voice) yelling:)

VOICE: Wheres the money! You trying to rip me off?

MAN: Huh?

VOICE: You trying to rip me off?!

(MARTY stands and turns up TV, but images of the two men fighting keep appearing in her mind. Looks like the owner of the VOICE attacks MAN in bathroom.)



SCENE 2
PARADISE MOTEL
HIGHWAY 13
10:49 PM

POLICE RADIO: Dispatch, this is unit seven investigating a reported disturbance at 214 Prospect avenue, over.

DISPATCH: Copy that ??

(Two policemen, JIMMY and KEITH arrive and enter room #10 with flashlights and guns drawn. Of course, this being the X-Files, they dont turn on a light. They see blood on the bathroom floor.)

JIMMY THE COP: Jeez .....

(They see a figure behind the shower curtain.)

JIMMY THE COP: Police! Dont move! (whips curtain back exposing MARTY) Keep em in the air.

(MARTY drops a blood soaked sponge.)

KEITH THE COP: (turning on light) Cuff her, Jimmy.

JIMMY THE COP: (cuffing MARTY) Damn, shes got blood all over her. (MARTY stares off into space.) Hey Keith. I think you might want to check this out. (They shine light into her eyes. The pupils do not contract.) I think shes blind.

SCENE 3

(X-Files office. SCULLY is giving a slide show to MULDER and DETECTIVE PENNOCK, who bears a striking resemblance to the DOD guy in Ghost in the Machine, season 1.)

SCULLY: The deceased is Paco Ordonez aka Little Monster. Street dealer. Liked to use grade school kids as couriers. Out on bail for possession with intent. Two-time loser looking at life.

MULDER: (looking at slide of dead guy) I have the same pair of pants. Who exterminated him?

PENNOCK: Thats a subject of some debate.

SCULLY: The killer carved a single C-shaped cut up through the right kidney. Fatal blood loss came in under 30 seconds.

MULDER: Im going to assume the killer knew what he was doing and that "C" wasnt one of his initials?

PENNOCK: Your assumptions are correct. Only the killer isnt a he. (Hands MULDER a folder then goes to where slide of MARTYS mugshot is projected, his face covered in the numbers from the height chart in her mugshot.) Marty Glenn -- 28. We found her at the scene doing a formula 409. Under normal circumstances, my department would have her dead to rights. Theres just one little snag.

MULDER: (reading) Shes been blind since birth.

PENNOCK: Now before your heart goes out to her, check out her rap sheet.

MULDER: "Fraud ... petty theft .... aggravated assault."

PENNOCK: Believe me. Shes a real piece of work.

SCULLY: Her juvenile records are sealed, but Detective Pennock has it on authority that two of them were drug busts  possession, and possession with intent.

MULDER: So, what, you think that uh, she caught Little Monster trying to snatch the pebble from her hand?

PENNOCK: Nothing else makes sense.

MULDER: Including how a blind girl could get the drop on an ex-con and bleed him out with surgical precision.

SCULLY: Ms. Glenn took a $60 cab ride alone straight to the motel. The cabbie instructed her to room 10, which she asked for specifically, and then told him to get lost. 30 minutes later, dead heroin dealer.

MULDER: All right, so you really believe that she did this? You just dont know how.

PENNOCK: Well, Ive got a theory, if you want to hear it.

MULDER: (nods)

PENNOCK: I think shes got some kind of .. sixth sense, lets her see in the dark ... like a bat or something. (MULDER and SCULLY share a look.) I got 48 hours to convince the DA or wait till she kills somebody else.

MULDER: Well how soon can I meet her?



SCENE 4

(MARTYS jail cell. She is lying on bed. Door slams open.)

MARTY: Oh ... its you.

PENNOCK: (to MULDER and SCULLY) See what I mean?

MARTY: Its not magic. Its your crappy cologne. (MULDER is amused.) Whos that with you?

MULDER: (surprised) Special Agent Mulder.

MARTY: And the lady?

SCULLY: Uh, Special Agent Scully. Wed like to ask you some questions, Marty.

MARTY: You must be having trouble with your case, Detective.

(PENNOCK walks to MARTY and takes her arm as if to guide her. She jerks her arm away.)

PENNOCK: Fine. Suit yourself.

(MARTY stands, walks slowly to the door. As she passes MULDER, she stops and faces him.)

MARTY: What are you staring at?

MULDER: An innocent woman. I hope. (smiles at PENNOCK as they exit the cell)



SCENE 5

(Interrogation room. MULDER and SCULLY with MARTY. MARTY is smoking.)

MARTY: So, Im all ears.

SCULLY: Im curious why youve refused your right to an attorney.

MARTY: Unless youre going to charge me, I dont plan on needing one.

SCULLY: Well, you could be charged right now .. for the fact that youve given no compelling reason why you were in that motel room. What were you doing there, Marty?

MARTY: Putting mints on the pillows. (smiles)

SCULLY: (after look to MULDER) The cabbie has given a statement that you asked specifically for room 10, which would put you at the murder scene right about the time of death.

MARTY: Is that a crime?

SCULLY: If you were involved in any way.

MARTY: (sarcastically) You mean like, an eyewitness?

SCULLY: Did you intend to buy drugs from Paco Ordonez?

MARTY: (Big drag off cigarette.)

SCULLY: Did you kill him?

MARTY: Eh, maybe it was just his time to go. I mean, other than the stab wound, did you check his cholesterol level or anything?

MULDER: How did you know there was just one stab wound?

MARTY: Did I say that?

MULDER: Mmm hmm.

MARTY: I guessed. You know what the problem is? Youve got no murder weapon. And I bet thats driving Stinky back there crazy. Isnt it, Stinky! (PENNOCK is watching the interview through a one way mirror.) Why is he hiding? Its not like I can see him. You know what I did with it, Detective? I fed it to my seeing eye dog.

MULDER: Im curious, Marty.

MARTY: Yeah, about what?

MULDER: If you didnt kill him, why you were at the crime scene cleaning up and doing such a piss poor job of it.

MARTY: (No answer.)

MULDER: Why dont we just stop playing games here, okay? I mean (laughs) you probably dont know a feather duster from a ducks ass, do you? I mean its ridiculous. Youre a blind woman, for Gods sake. So why dont you just tell us who did kill Paco Ordonez, and Agent Scully and I can go arrest him, and you can go home and work on your angry-young-blind-girl comedy routine.

MARTY: (No answer)

MULDER: Or we can just ... (he grabs a glass and slams it down on the table in front of him) stay here and entertain each other for the next 48 hours.

(MULDER starts to pour himself a glass of water, Marty violently knocks it off table.)

MARTY: Go to hell.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY have joined PENNOCK behind the one way mirror. MARTY sits by herself in the interrogation room.)

PENNOCK: See what I mean? Put a knife in that hand....

MULDER: All I see is a woman whos adapted to her impairment admirably. Shes honed all her other senses around her blindness.

PENNOCK: Shes taunting you.

MULDER: I dunno I - I think she just wants us to think shes strong, independent. (looking at SCULLY) Its important to her. (SCULLY looks up at MULDER)

PENNOCK: She wants us to know she did it.

MULDER: I dont think she did do it.

PENNOCK: Then why wont she help us? Its been my experience that innocent people dont act like that, Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: She wouldnt explain her presence in the crime scene, and she avoided all discussion about the murder weapon.

PENNOCK: She knew there was only one stab wound. You caught that yourself.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Detective, did you snake all of the plumbing in the bathroom?

PENNOCK: I turned that place upside down and inside out.

SCULLY: Well, if we find the weapon with her fingerprints on it, shes as good as convicted. Short of that, she's gonna walk.

PENNOCK: Well, maybe I can get you to come out to the crime scene one last time.

SCULLY: (looking to MULDER) Okay.

MULDER: You go ahead. I want - I want to  I want to investigate something.

(SCULLY glances at MULDER as she and PENNOCK leave.)



SCENE 6

(Lie detector test room. MARTY is hooked up to the machine. MULDER is watching the lie detector's printout, seated behind her.)

EXAMINER: Im going to ask you a series of questions. Respond only with a "yes"" or "no." Do not judge the content of the question, simply answer truthfully. Is your full name Martelle Francis Glenn?

MARTY: Yeah.

EXAMINER: Are you a resident of the State of Delaware?

MARTY: Lets just cut through the bull, or Im going to decide not to cooperate at all.

MULDER: All right, let's, uh, get to it. (Glances up to examiner.)

EXAMINER: (to MULDER) I need to establish a baseline.

MARTY: Im a resident of the State of Delaware, okay? Lets move on.

EXAMINER: (sighs, and marks 2+ on the chart) Is it your intent to lie during the course of this examination?

MARTY: Im sure youll tell me if it is.

EXAMINER: (slightly frustrated) Did you stab Paco Ordonez, also known as Little Monster?

MARTY: (she turns her head slightly and directs her answer to MULDER) Nope.

EXAMINER: (marks) Did you plan or arrange the murder of Paco Ordonez?

MARTY: No.

EXAMINER: Have you ever met Paco Ordonez?

MARTY: No.

EXAMINER: Would you ever have occasion to see Paco Ordonez (needles go crazy, MULDER looks at EXAMINER with concern) or know him in any other way? Strike that. Have you ever had occasion to interact with Paco Ordonez or know him in any other way?

MARTY: No.

EXAMINER: Were you present during the murder of Paco Ordonez?

MARTY: No.

(MULDER writes on legal pad for EXAMINER : "Did you see the murder?" EXAMINER hesitates.)

MARTY: Why dont you just ask me yourself?

MULDER: Did you see the murder?

(MARTY doesnt answer, but the needles start bouncing around again.)

MULDER: Did you see the murder?

MARTY: I dont see anything.

EXAMINER: Yes or no, only please.

MARTY: Then the answer is no.

(Needles bounce again.)



SCENE 7

(Hotel crime scene. PENNOCK and SCULLY walk through room.)

PENNOCK: No blood trails leading out of the bathroom, windows are painted shut, and as you can see, not a lot of places she could have stashed it.

(SCULLYS cell phone rings. She gives PENNOCK an "excuse me" look, and he leaves her in the bathroom.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (On phone) Shes lying.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) About what?

MULDER: (on phone) She knew Paco Ordonez, but I dont think she murdered him.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) How do you know that she knew him?

MULDER: (on phone) Well I made her take a polygraph test. She passed on every question except one  did she *see* the murder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Would you like me to remind you why polygraphs are inadmissible in court?

MULDER: (on phone) No, she cracked, Scully. She was lying. Im sure of it.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, maybe she was, Mulder, but dont make me state the obvious. She didnt see anything.

MULDER: (on phone) Not with her eyes.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, how else did she see? Bat vision?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) I dont know.

SCULLY: (on phone, looking at razor disposal slot in bathroom) Well, Mulder, when you figure it out, give me a call. (hangs up)

(SCULLY sees loose plaster around the razor disposal, and pries the plate off.)

SCULLY: Detective Pennock.

(She reaches in and removes a bloody leather glove. SCULLY and PENNOCK look at it and at each other.)



SCENE 8

(MARTYS jail cell. MARTY has flashes of a WOMAN in a bar.)

WOMAN: No thanks, Im not looking for any company. Hey, listen, buddy! I said get your hands off of -

MARTY: (calling through bars) Somebody, I need a phone! I get to call a lawyer, somebody, I need a phone!

(Later, MARTY is at a desk with a phone. Guard pushes phone toward her.)

MARTY: I got it. (Picks up receiver, realizes guard is still there.) You know, Im sure the ACLU is going to be very interested in how you violated a blind womans rights by eavesdropping on her private phone call.

GUARD: (makes obscene arm/hand gesture, then walks away)

MARTY: Same to you. (dials number)

CUT TO:
(Phone in bar ringing. BARTENDER answers.)

BARTENDER: (on phone) Blarney Stone. (listens) Uh, lets see. Guy hitting on a redhead at the end of the bar? (Looks and sees upset WOMAN rejecting a mans advances.)

WOMAN: I told you, stop it!

BARTENDER: (on phone) Yeah, we got somebody matching that description.

(Carries phone down to OLDER MAN at end of the bar.)

BARTENDER: Its for you.

(OLDER MAN is surprised. WOMAN puts money on the counter and leaves.)

OLDER MAN: (on phone) Yeah?

MARTY: (on phone) Leave her alone.

OLDER MAN: (Looks around in shock, watches WOMAN leave. On phone) Who is this?

MARTY: (on phone) You just leave her alone. Im watching you.

(OLDER MAN looks shocked as MARTY hangs up.)



SCENE 9

(Jail interrogation room. An evidence bag containing the bloody gloves is dropped in front of MARTY. She picks it up and feels it.)

MARTY: Let me guess ... Your killer is OJ Simpson.

SCULLY: They were found at the crime scene with blood all over them. We believe they were worn by Paco Ordonezs killer.

MARTY: Youre good.

PENNOCK: We think they belong to you.

MARTY: Well, they dont.

PENNOCK: Well, how bout you try one on for us. (Removes glove from bag.)

MARTY: And put my prints all over them?

SCULLY: Your prints are already all over them, Marty.

(MULDER is watching from behind the mirror.)

PENNOCK: (MULDERS POV) Hold still. (puts glove on MARTY)

MARTY: (MULDERS POV) Are you happy, Detective?

PENNOCK: Looks to me like it fits.

MARTY: Somewhere, Marcia Clark weeps. But you still havent got a weapon.

PENNOCK: Ah, its just a matter of time.

MARTY: (smug) But you havent got time.

(Later, SCULLY joins MULDER in another room.)

SCULLY: Hope you saw what just happened in there.

MULDER: Even if the gloves do fit, you can still acquit.

SCULLY: I think its arrogance, Mulder. I think its the same reason why she agreed to take the polygraph test. She knows that the prejudices in this case are all in her favor.

MULDER: I dont think its that simple. Look at this. (opens a folder) She lives in poverty, but shes never taken advantage of the disability benefits that are available to her.

(LIST OF BENEFITS: Social Security, General Disability, Blind Disability, Public Assistance, Unemployed Compensation, Supplemental Security Income, Insurance Benefits -- all checked "no." )

Never once. Its poison to her. The - the mere suggestion that shes anything other than a whole or complete person is offensive to her. Its not arrogance, its pride.

SCULLY: So, you think that it was pride that made her ditch the bloody gloves? Her prints were all over them, Mulder. Why would she do that.

MULDER: I have no idea. I dont 

SCULLY: Okay, so - so by your reasoning, the killer took off with the murder weapon, but not the gloves leaving Marty to come in, go straight to the gloves, and hide them in the one place that nobody would easily think to find them.

MULDER: I think thats the most accurate scenario available to us, right now.

SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Maybe its much simpler than that.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: What if shes not really blind? I mean, she hasnt applied for any of her - her disability benefits. Maybe thats because she knows that she couldnt pass the medical screening.

MULDER: (disbelieving) You think shes faking it?

SCULLY: No, no. But - but possibly its a - a conversion disorder, or a - a form of blindsight. A - a split consciousness whereby a person has a certain level of visual ability but theyre not aware that theyre actually seeing. Its worth checking out.



SCENE 10
FRENCH ST. BUS TERMINAL
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE

(OLDER MAN is on pay phone. He is holding a briefcase.)

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Yo, man, moving Little Monsters "H" aint gonna be easy. See, a lot of people respected him, you know.

OLDER MAN: (on phone) You buying or not? If youre not buying, I can go to somebody else.

DEALER: (on phone, voice) (laughs) No you caint. But Im feelin magnanimous. Swing by in a couple of hours. Maybe we can do some business.

OLDER MAN: Good. Yeah, theres something Ive got to look into first. When Im done, Ill be in touch. (hangs up, and places briefcase in a locker.)



SCENE 11

(Prison medical examination room. MARTYS eyes are being tested. MULDER and SCULLY observe.)

DOCTOR: Eyes wide, please, Marty. Good. Try not to move around too much. Are you aware of any sensation at all?

MARTY: (inhales sharply in wonder) Ahh! Its a miracle!

(DOCTOR looks to MULDER and SCULLY, whose expressions say "not.")

DOCTOR: All right , Marty. Now were going to introduce some optical stimuli. Try not to blink. (Her eyes do not respond.) Just relax for a moment. (to MULDER and SCULLY) Im not getting anything. I dont think theres any activity in either the visual cortex or the superior colliculus.

SCULLY: Theres no way that she could fool the machine?

DOCTOR: Were talking about wholly involuntary physical responses. I wasnt getting any reading.

(MULDER sees MARTYS pupils suddenly contract.)

MULDER: Then what is that?

(MARTY begins having flashes of the bar again. Walking in and seeing a friend of the WOMAN from before.)

MANS VOICE: Where is she?

(In examination room, MARTY stares straight ahead. MULDER kneels next to her.)

MULDER: What is it, Marty? What do you see?

(Door opens, PENNOCK sticks his head in.)

PENNOCK: Agents? (MULDER and SCULLY follow him and another man into hall.) This is Daniel Costa from the DAs office.

COSTA: So what did we find? I hear the girl can actually see with some limited ability?

MULDER: No. No, according to her examiner, she is completely without sight or any kind of light sensitivity.

SCULLY: But she is still our best and only suspect.

COSTA: You said we were making progress.

PENNOCK: We are.

COSTA: Well, Im not going to try to indict a blind girl on some lousy prints.

MULDER: She doesnt exactly fit the definition "blind girl."

COSTA: Come on, folks. Either she is or she isnt.

PENNOCK: (to MULDER) What are you talking about?

MULDER: Well, there is evidence of some kind of neurological activity which caused her pupils to dilate.

PENNOCK: From what?

MULDER: To me, it indicates some reaction to stimuli. Some kind physical response to images in her minds eye.

COSTA: Hows that make her the killer?

MULDER: I didnt say it did.

COSTA: (nods, then says to PENNOCK) Kick her loose.

PENNOCK: Danny ...

COSTA: I got no case, Penn.

PENNOCK: I dont believe this.

COSTA: Im not trying her. Not without a murder weapon. Kick her loose. (leaves)

PENNOCK: (sarcastically to MULDER and SCULLY) Wonderful. Thanks.



SCENE 12

(Office in the jail where you get your stuff back. MARTY signs a form. Her signature goes off the line. OFFICER hands her a manila folder. She snatches it, takes her wallet out and fingers some money.)

MARTY: These better still be twenties.

OFFICER: (sarcastically) No, I replaced them with fifties since youre so damn sweet.

(MARTY unfolds her cane, pauses. Looks like she senses MULDER watching her. He is. She begins walking slowly down the hall using her cane. SCULLY comes up to MULDER.)

SCULLY: Want to hear the latest?

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: Detective Pennock ran the gloves for blood typing and found two different samples, one type matching Marty Glenns.

MULDER: Well, she was examined. There were no cuts or wounds on her.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, all the same Im going to hand deliver them to the lab in Washington, expedite a PCR to see if shes a match.

MULDER; Look at her. (They watch MARTY slowly walking) Do you really think shes capable?

SCULLY: Ill let you know as soon as I get the tests back. (leaves)



SCENE 13

(Outside on street. MARTY is walking. Suddenly she has flashes of WOMAN from bar being attacked in an alley.)

CUT TO:
OLDER MAN: (to WOMAN) Who called me last night? Whos watching me? (Takes his hand slightly off WOMANS mouth.)

WOMAN: (frightened) What?! I ... I dont know what youre talking about.

OLDER MAN: You a cop? You wearing a wire? (WOMAN begins screaming.)

WOMAN: No! Im not a cop!

CUT TO:
(MARTY still having flashes.)

WOMAN: Let me go!

MARTY: (to other pedestrians) I need to get to Spring Street. Which way is Spring Street? Somebody, answer me!

NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN: Four blocks to the left.

WOMAN: (MARTY hearing voice) Please! Please!!

(MARTY suddenly walks into street almost getting hit by several cars. They blow their horns. MARTY looks disoriented. She stops cold in the middle of the street.)

WOMAN: No! Dont kill me! No! No! No! No!

(NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN runs to MARTY and guides her out of the street.)

(Later, MARTY and NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN reach the alley.)

MARTY: Where?

NICE PEDESTRIAN MAN: Here. Here - here. Theres an alley here. Right here.

(MARTY finds the wall and begins walking clumsily down the alley running into things.)

MARTY: Thanks. Leave me alone.

(She passes a dumpster, then feels some bars over a window that she saw in her visions earlier. She goes back to the dumpster and opens it. The WOMAN, covered in blood, lies face down. MARTY feels the body, then for a pulse. She apparently finds none.)



SCENE 14

(Police station. Same OFFICER who gave MARTY back her stuff is at his desk. Looks up at sound of MARTYS voice.)

MARTY: (very quietly) Excuse me. Excuse me, somebody.

OFFICER: Yeah?

MARTY: I killed them. I killed them both. (Holds up her bloody hand.)



SCENE 15

(Interrogation room. MARTY sits alone. MULDER enters and sits across from her. He pauses.)

MULDER: I read your *confession*. Detective Pennock is typing it up as we speak for you to sign.

MARTY: (sighs) Ill sign it.

MULDER: Youll make him a very happy man.

MARTY: Cant have everything.

MULDER: Just for me, Im a little puzzled by this sudden change of heart.

MARTY: Please, too much charity of heart and I want to puke.

MULDER: I - I just ... why kill *them*. Paco Ordonez ... Susan Forester? (MARTY looks surprised.) Did you even know that was her name? Susan Forester. She was 30 years old. Native of Wilmington. She waitressed part-time. She lived alone with her two cats...

MARTY: Shut up! Why are you doing this? I - I .... Ive given you people everything you want.

(She pulls out a cigarette and feels for her matches. MULDER strikes a match and holds it for her. She reaches for his hand and lights the cigarette.)

MULDER: I *like* you, Marty. I *admire* you. And I dont want to see you confess to crimes you didnt commit.

MARTY: You just feel sorry for me.

MULDER: No, I dont. Not the way you think I do.

MARTY: Read the confession. I got it all perfect. Every detail. How could I do that if Im innocent?

MULDER: I believe you witnessed both murders. You - you saw them, somehow. But you were way cross town when they happened. You were a $60 cab ride away.

MARTY: Youre crazy.

MULDER: I think you tried to stop them. You tried to, but you didnt get there in time.

MARTY: (shaking her head) I dont have to talk to you anymore.

MULDER: Marty, whoever did this, theyre going to kill again. And you *can* help stop that.

MARTY: (shakes her head again and puts her hand over her eyes) I cant stop anything. I dont have to talk to you anymore, period. (she stands up, so does MULDER, and she yells ...) Officer! Were done!

MULDER: Whos worth pleading guilty for, Marty?

MARTY: Officer, were done! (MULDER grabs her arm)

MULDER: You didnt do it. And Im not going to let this happen. (Officer enters.) Do you hear me? Marty?

(MARTY leaves with officer.)



SCENE 16

(Bus terminal. OLDER MAN on pay phone.)

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Sorry, man. Deals off.

OLDER MAN: (on phone) What do you mean "deals off?" You cant back out.

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Hey, look it here, brother, I do what I got to do to stay on the download (???) and you shinin too much light on me.

OLDER MAN: (on phone) What are you talking about?

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Somebodys gunning for you, man. And I aint gettin in the middle of it.

OLDER MAN: (on phone) Who? Whos gunnin for me?

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Some old girlfriend of yours called last night and told me I should steer clear.

OLDER MAN: (on phone) She called you?

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Yeah, said she was passing the word.

OLDER MAN: (on phone, angry) Listen to me. Listen, man. Shes nobody, huh? She knows nothing.

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Yeah, right.

OLDER: MAN: (on phone) You and me, man, were still cool. Trust me.

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Well, if she dont know anything, howd she get this number?

OLDER MAN: (on phone) Listen to me. I got nowhere else to take this stuff.

DEALER: (on phone, voice) Thats not my problem. Just dont you call here again.

(OLDER MAN slams down phone.)



SCENE 17

(MULDER alone in an office looking at MARTYS file. "January 27, 1970, 8:55 pm, address - 555 Hol ...? Body found at 1044 Pend..? Lying face down on the floor. Single stab wound right kidney." PENNOCK enters.)

PENNOCK: Well, I appreciate your help here, such at it was, but Id say were doing all right. She just signed her confession.

MULDER: Congratulations.

PENNOCK: I dont feel as good as you might think, you know.

MULDER: Well, all youve got is a signature. No lawyers going to let her go down based on that.

PENNOCK: Im aware of that.

MULDER: Doesnt it bother you, Detective, that you still have no clear motive?

PENNOCK: Well she just now gave us that. Drugs. Just like I thought. She even told us where to find them.



SCENE 18

(Bus station. MULDER and PENNOCK get briefcase full of heroin out of locker.)

PENNOCK: Id say this is gonna make it a pretty short trial.

MULDER: Well, if you think about it, Detective, it actually proves nothing.

PENNOCK: There it is, just like she said.

MULDER: Just like she *described.*

PENNOCK: You know, the thing I find most surprising about this case is you. You are one skeptical guy, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Skeptical?!

PENNOCK: Oh, yeah.

MULDER: Ive been called a lot of things. Skeptical, however, is not one.

(With impeccable timing, MULDERS cell phone rings.)

PENNOCK: (gathering up briefcase) Well, whatever.

MULDER: (answers phone, to himself) Skeptical. (on phone)

SCULLY: (walking down hallway in DC, on phone) Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) What?

SCULLY: (on phone) Ive got the PCR results on the two blood types from the gloves. Neither was Martys. You were right, Mulder. She didnt do it.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, I know that, and you know that, and so does whoever Martys protecting, but Pennock is salivating right now. What we have to do is convince Marty. I got an idea. Ill get back to you. (hangs up)

(On a bench, OLDER MAN watches the police leave with the briefcase. He follows.)



SCENE 19

(MARTY sits in her jail cell. We hear footsteps coming down the hall.)

MARTY: What do you want now?

(Door slides open, MULDER enters and sits beside her.)

MULDER: I know who youre protecting, Marty. And I think I know why. Youre protecting the man who murdered your mother.

MARTY: I dont know what youre talking about.

MULDER: I read the original police report from 1970. Your mother died from a single stab wound to the right kidney -- as did Paco Ordonez and Susan Forester. Dead at the hands of an unknown assailant.

MARTY: I never knew my mother.

MULDER: No. I know. But for once you were there when it happened. She was pregnant with you at the time. She died on the operating table as doctors were trying to save her. You were born ... just barely. But the interruption in blood flow you suffered most likely caused your blindness.

MARTY: What does that have to do with anything?

MULDER: I think that during that time ... as you lost one sense ... you gained another. That somehow ... a connection was formed between you and your mothers killer.

MARTY: What connection?

MULDER: You see through his eyes. You always have. You dont want to, you just do. And because of that you feel responsible for his actions, but youre not. And youre sitting here in prison for crimes you didnt commit. It isnt going to accomplish anything, Marty.

(Door opens.)

PENNOCK: Excuse me, Agent Mulder. Shes being transferred now.

MULDER: Theres absolutely no point to you doing this, Marty. Were going to find him with or without your help.

MARTY: (as she leaves with PENNOCK, to MULDER) Im sorry.

(Later. Marty is led to a prisoner transport vehicle. She is wearing chains. Suddenly, she begins having flashes of a woman being led to a prisoner transport vehicle. Shock, as she realizes she is seeing herself. She turns her face toward the fence where the OLDER MAN is watching her.)



SCENE 20
WOMENS DETENTION CENTER
FAIRVIEW, DELAWARE

(MARTY, in prisoner garb, is led to a visitors booth where MULDER is waiting.)

MULDER: Hi, Marty.

MARTY: Whats going on?

MULDER: Detective Pennock is with the warden right now arranging for your release.

MARTY: (frustrated) Ah! What?

MULDER: The charges against you are being dropped. Youre no longer a suspect in this case.

MARTY: How can they do that?! I confessed.

MULDER: Yeah, well, confession is worthless if its a lie, and yours was a lie.

MARTY: What have you been telling them?

MULDER: Just that youre innocent, which is something they would have found out on their own anyway. The locker you sent us to? It had prints on it, but they werent yours.

MARTY: I was careful.

MULDER: Yeah, well, somebody else wasnt so careful. Charles Wesley Gotts, an ex-con. Convicted in 1970 of aggravated assault. He was paroled three weeks ago and hes been missing ever since.

MARTY: Never heard of him.

MULDER: I happen to believe that, Marty. The PCR tests confirmed that it was his blood on the glove. The tests confirmed something else, Marty. Hes your father. (MARTY is shocked.) That was the connection. (MARTY is on verge of tears.)

MARTY: Hmm.

PENNOCK: (entering) Okay, were all set. (looks between MARTY and MULDER) That is, if everythings taken care of on this end.

MARTY: Whats he talking about?

MULDER: (hard for him to say) Detective Pennock has agreed to not pursue aiding and abetting charges if you agree to help us ... if you agree to help us find him. We need your help, Marty. You can end it now.

MARTY: (she nods) I can end this.

MULDER: Im sure thats what youve always wanted.

MARTY: (nods, then shakes her head) I never wanted to spend my life in a place like this. I had no choice. Hmm. If I help you, will you protect me until hes caught?

PENNOCK: I will personally guarantee your safety.

MARTY: (sighs) Hmmm. Take me home.



SCENE 21

(MULDER pulls up in front of the Blarney Stone bar.)

VOICE ON POLICE RADIO: Moving into position at the back exit.

MULDER: All right, stand by.

VOICE ON POLICE RADIO: Copy that.

(MULDER looks into his rearview mirror, sees SCULLY getting out of the car behind him, gets out to meet her)

MULDER: Just in time for the surprise party.

SCULLY: She told you hed be in there?

MULDER: Yeah, she described this place perfectly, right down to the matchbooks.

SCULLY: What made her decide to cooperate?

MULDER; She wants to stop him.

SCULLY: All of a sudden? I mean, if shes so anxious to stop him, why didnt she tell us his name before now?

MULDER: She didnt know his name. Theyve never met. Hes been in prison her entire life.

SCULLY: Well, yet, according to you, shes been seeing through his eyes the whole time.

MULDER: I - I dont think she was sure exactly what she was seeing but it was more like a - a constant image in her mind that she learned to live with over time. Up until three weeks ago.

SCULLY: When the murders started.

MULDER: He was paroled and everything changed.

SCULLY: Well, if all this is true, let's go get him. (Starts for bar. MULDER doesnt follow.) Mulder?

MULDER: Everythings changed for her, Scully. I dont think were going to find him in there.



SCENE 22
SOUTHBRIDGE DISTRICT
WILMINGTON, DELAWARE

(MARTYS apartment. PENNOCK and MARTY are in her apartment. She is packing.)

PENNOCK: Need some help over there?

MARTY: Nope.

PENNOCK: (to himself) Shouldve known. (MARTY keeps packing.) Now you know, you dont have to pack everything you own. I promise you, youre not going to be in protective custody that long.

MARTY: Its too late for that, anyway.

PENNOCK: Why is that?

MARTY: Gotts is already here.

PENNOCK: What are you talking about?

MARTY: (feels an old-style coffee pot on the stove) Hes been keeping tabs on me for about a day. (walks to the opposite side of the kitchen, takes out a couple of packs or cans of something, then walks back to the stove, putting her hands on the pot) Now he knows where I live. Hes reading the names on the mailboxes right now.

PENNOCK: What? How could you know ........

(MARTY hits PENNOCK on the head with the pot knocking him out. She takes his gun, opens the front door and goes back into the apartment. Downstairs, GOTTS, the OLDER MAN looks at mailbox #26, the name GLENN above it, then goes upstairs.)



SCENE 23

(MULDER, holding his cell phone, and SCULLY come out of the bar.)

SCULLY: How did you know he wouldnt be in there?

MULDER: She doesnt want us to get him. She misdirected us on purpose.

SCULLY: Shes still protecting him?

MULDER: No, shes not. She never was. (hangs up) Pennocks not picking up.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Its not him shes been protecting. If he goes back to prison, so does she. Until now, shes never had a choice. (Gets in drivers side of car.)



SCENE 24

(MARTYS apartment. GOTTS enters, sees PENNOCK still out cold. GOTTS opens a switchblade and begins walking through the house. MARTY, hiding in the kitchen, sees his progress in flashes. When GOTTS gets to the kitchen, she reveals herself, points the gun at his head.)

MARTY: (very quietly) I hate the way you see me.

(We see GOTTS' point-of-view as she fires at him.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY enter the apartment and see GOTTS dead with a bullet hole in his forehead.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

PENNOCK: (cuffing MARTY) She did this one. Trust me. (leads her out past MULDER and SCULLY, she looks right at MULDER as she passes him.)



SCENE 25

(MULDER walking down prison corridor to MARTYS cell.)

MARTY: Not much to look at, is it? At least, thats what they tell me. (She walks to the bars and he reaches through to take her hand.) You were at the sentencing, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Is it my cologne?

MARTY: (smiles) No, I just knew youd be there.

MULDER: Marty, let me speak to the judge on your behalf.

MARTY: No.

MULDER: We found where hed been staying. It was a motel not far from where Paco Ordonez had been murdered.

MARTY: And before that, Atlantic City. Hmmm. Id never seen the ocean before. And now when I close my eyes, or even when I open them, thats all I see.

(Guards footsteps approaching.)

MULDER: Well, youre lucky he wasnt a fan of the Ice Capades.

(They laugh.)

(Guard touches MULDERS arm. He squeezes MARTYS hand.)

GUARD OVER INTERCOM: Lights out.

(Lights go out. MULDER leaves. MARTY stands at bars, then turns and disappears into the darkness of her cell. )

[THE END]

                                ALL SOULS



SCENE 1
(Dark and Stormy Night. A priest, FATHER MCCUE, goes up to the KERNOF house.
MRS KERNOFF answers the door.)

MRS KERNOF: Good Evening, Father.

FATHER MCCUE: Is she ready?

MRS KERNOFF: Yes.

(He enters.)

(Later, FATHER MCCUE is pouring a flask of water into a metal basin.)

FATHER MCCUE: Baptism is the rite of initiation. This holy water takes away original sin. The sacrament confers the grace of god  bringing the soul into Gods family.

(MR and MRS KERNOF go to their wheelchair bound daughter, DARA who is physically very handicapped. MR KERNOF holds DARA as she is baptized. DARA reacts as the water touches her face.)

FATHER MCCUE: Dara, I baptize you in the name of the Father  and of the Son  and of the Holy Spirit. Bless you my child.

(MR and MRS KERNOF are very happy.)

(Later. The KERNOFS are in bed. The storm is much worse. DARA gets out of bed. She has six toes on each foot. MR KERNOF hears a noise. He gets out of bed.)

MR KERNOF: Dara?

(He goes into DARAS room. Her bed is empty. He looks out the window and sees her stumbling down the street outside)

MR KERNOF Oh, my God.

(Outside, DARA approaches a figure dressed in black. She falls to her knees and raises her hands as if in prayer.)

MR KERNOF: (running toward them) Dara?! Dara!

(There is a very bright flash of light. The dark figure is gone.)

MR KERNOF: Dara! Dara?

(He reaches DARA. She is dead, frozen in the position of prayer. Her eyes have been burned out. Crying, MR KERNOF holds her.)

MR KERNOF: Oh  Oh, God. Oh, my God. Dara! No! Noooo!

(Camera pulls away until the telephone pole hides the father and daughter behind the shape of a cross.)

SCENE 2

ST JOHNS CHURCH
ALEXANDRIA, VA
(SCULLY enters church. She looks around for a moment and at a picture of EMILY. One other woman is there, praying. SCULLY goes to a confession booth.)

SCULLY: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been several months since my last confession.

PRIEST: You have a sin to confess?

SCULLY: Father, Im an FBI agent. Ive taken it as my code and purpose to uphold the law 
to save lives.

PRIEST: And now your work has come in conflict with your faith.

SCULLY: In a way. I was here for Easter services last week and Father McCue approached me for my help.

PRIEST: Why did he come to you?

SCULLY: Because there was a family that he felt needed my help. But it was more than that. Father, I had a daughter who died  A strange and sudden death several months ago.

PRIEST: Father McCue thought that by helping these people you might in some way help yourself to come to terms with your grief.

SCULLY: Yes.

PRIEST: But you havent.

SCULLY: (crying) Father, I told you that I had a sin to confess  But the sin of which Im guilty  Im not sure if you can offer forgiveness.

PRIEST: What is the sin?

SCULLY: An innocent girl is dead because of me. I couldve saved her life, but I let her die.



SCENE 3
EASTER SUNDAY
ONE WEEK EARLIER
(SCULLY exits church with other parishioners. FATHER MCCUE is shaking hands.)

FATHER MCCUE: Dana  Do you have a moment? Id like to speak with you in private.

(Later, in FATHER MCCUES office.)

FATHER MCCUE: I must say, Dana, its been nice seeing you at mass again. Ive almost started getting used to it.

SCULLY: Ive been trying to make an effort to come more often.

FATHER MCCUE: I dont mean to take advantage of your attendance, but Ive become involved in a difficult situation with a couple that are also members here. Do you know the Kernofs?

SCULLY: No, Im afraid I dont.

FATHER MCCUE: Recently, they lost their daughter, Dara. You may have heard about the situation?

SCULLY: No, I didnt.

FATHER MCCUE: The circumstances of the girls death were sudden and Im afraid the police havent been able to tell them much.

SCULLY: Are you asking for my help?

FATHER MCCUE: The Kernofs are devout but their faith is giving them little comfort. I thought with your background your words might carry a certain weight. Can I tell them youll be visiting?




SCENE 4
(KERNOFF house. SCULLY sits with MRS KERNOFF in the living room. MR KERNOFF stands in another room staring out the window.)

MRS KERNOFF: (showing picture of DARA) Thats Dara on her 16th birthday. We couldnt have children of our own. I persuaded Lance six years ago to adopt. At first he was reluctant to accept a special needs child, but he became so attached to her. Then this happens. You make the choice never imagining something like this or how vulnerable you are. Dara had just been baptized. I know in my heart shes gone to a better place, but Lance is angry. Angry at God. They say time heals.

(SCULLY looks over at MR KERNOF.)

SCULLY: Oh, Father McCue said that, uh, that youve been having trouble getting much information about what might have happened to her.

MRS KERNOFF: They say now she may have been struck by lightening but no one seems to know for sure. How she even got out of the house onto the street is a mystery.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MRS KERNOFF: Dara suffered from congenital spinal deformities. Shes been wheelchair bound her whole life.

SCULLY: Could somebody have taken her out of her room?

MRS KERNOFF: Lance said he saw her walking and that when he found her she was on her knees, praying. I think thats the hardest part for my husband. Hell never understand how God could  forsake the life of an innocent girl. How God, in His mercy could let this happen to our Dara.

CUT TO:
(Confessional. Present)

SCULLY: Mrs. Kernof was talking about her husband, but she might as well have been talking about me.

PRIEST: You, too, were angry at God?

SCULLY: I felt drawn to these people, Father  in a very personal way. I was determined to help them understand why their daughter had been taken.

PRIEST: And did you?

SCULLY: As much as I have my faith, Father, I am a scientist trained to weigh evidence
but science only teaches us how  not why.



SCENE 5
(Morgue.)

CORONER: If you want me to stand by my report, I will, but I have to say its not exactly open and shut on the cause of death.

SCULLY: You think it was lightning?

CORONER: Im guessing it was lightning, The way her eyes were burned suggests the bolt may have gone to ground right through the top of her head. Funny thing is there was no other sign of arcing except for the face.

SCULLY: Her mother said that she was found in a kneeling position.

CORONER: Genuflecting. Are you a religious person?

SCULLY: Why do you ask?

CORONER: I havent been to church since I was a kid, but I went last Sunday. Im going to show you something. (Shows pictures of DARAS body.) Her body was rigored such that I had to do my examination in the position she was found. Ive never seen anything like it.

(One of the close-up pictures show a scar on the outside of DARAS hand.)

SCULLY: Looks like there was surgery done on her hands.

CORONER: She was polydactyl. Same with her feet. I havent asked her parents yet. Havent had the heart to, but I assume they had the extra fingers removed.

SCULLY: Whats the connection?

CORONER: I found no other evidence of any other tissue damage of electrical burns or any other serious trauma. Its as if God Himself struck her down.

SCULLY: Dara Kernof was adopted. I dont suppose that youve requested any information about the birth mother.

CORONER: I can do that if you like.

SCULLY: No, thats okay. I, uh  I have someone I can ask. Somebody Id like to confer with, actually.



SCENE 6
STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
MOUNT LEBANON, VA

(A man gets out of a silver Cutlass Ciera. There is an upside-down cross pendant hanging from the rearview mirror.)

(Inside. FATHER GREGORY and an ORDERLY are walking down a hall.)

ORDERLY: Koklos  Koklos  Paula Koklos, room 213. Well get her things packed up and get you on your way.

(The ORDERLY begins to unlock the door. Inside the room, PAULA KOKLOS, identical to DARA KERNOF, is looking out the window. At the sound of the key in the lock she jumps then begins crawling across the floor. She has six fingers on each hand.)

STARKEY: (running down the hall) Hold it! Just hold it. Are you Father Gregory?

FATHER GREGORY: Yes.

STARKEY: Im Aaron Starkey with the Department of Social Services. I am very sorry but weve had a mix-up.

FATHER GREGORY: What are you talking about?

STARKEY: Your adoption petition for Paula Koklos. Its missing an approval.

ORDERLY: Ive got the court order right here.

STARKEY: Well, thats the mix-up. See, it never should have gone to family court without getting an approval from the social worker assigned to the case, and thats me.

FATHER GREGORY: Give it to me here then and well be on our way.

STARKEY: No. I cant, at least not yet. Ive just been assigned to Paula, so Ill need time to familiarize myself with her case

FATHER GREGORY: Look, Ive already been through all this. Im here to take the girl home.

STARKEY: Im sorry, Father, but youll have to wait  until I can get the paperwork in order.

(FATHER GREGORY walks away, stiffly.)



SCENE 7
(SCULLY in her apartment looking at pictures of DARA. Sound of HEAVY rain outside. She looks at picture of Emily. About to cry. Phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

(MULDER is in a phone booth dressed very casually throughout the ep. Rain is very heavy.)

MULDER: (on phone, impatient) Hey, Scully. Im returning your call. (checks his watch)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hi .. uh, somethings come up. I was, uh, hoping that you could do me a favor.

MULDER: (on phone) Why? Whats going on?

SCULLY: (on phone) This isnt official FBI business so I was hoping that we could keep it outside of work.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, look, Im, uh  Im kind of tailing a possible suspect right now, so Im kind of rushed, so, uh 

(Through the window of MULDERS phone booth you can see neon pink - XXX.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I need some birth and adoptive records on a Dara Kernof.

MULDER: (on phone) Who?

SCULLY: (on phone) Dara Kernof. I cant tell you much more than that, Mulder. Im sorry.

MULDER: (on phone) You want to give me a hint? Anything?

SCULLY: (on phone) Not until you get me those records.

MULDER: (on phone) All right, Ill talk to you later.

(MULDER hangs up and runs back into movie theatre - Marquee says- 6 PM AND 11 PM -
A DECADE OF DIRTY DELINQUENTS)



SCENE 8
STATE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
1:04 AM

(A figure walks down hall to PAULAS room and stands in her doorway. PAULA raises her hands in prayer. There is a very bright flash of light.)

(Commercial)



SCENE 9
(Psychiatric hospital. Next day. SCULLY watches as coroners cover PAULA, now dead on a gurney, and wheel her out of the room Her eyes are burned out. SCULLY sees an upside-down cross pendant hanging on the wall. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Scully? Arent you the secret squirrel.

SCULLY: What so you mean?

MULDER: Just got a look at that body they wheeled out of here. Youve been holding out on me.

SCULLY: Mulder, its not what you think. I - I didnt want to involve you. I got asked to look into this as a favor for a family.

MULDER: Dara Kernofs family?

(MULDER begins pacing.)

SCULLY: You found Daras records?

MULDER: No, those are her birth records. The adoption records have been sealed.

SCULLY: I think one of my questions has already been answered. Dara was a twin.

MULDER: No. Actually she was a quadruplet  one of four girls. Was this, uh  cross found like this?

SCULLY: Uh, yes, as far as I know. Why?

MULDER: Its inverted. Upside down. Thats a protest, a sacrilege against the church.

SCULLY: Put there by whom?

MULDER: Its your case, remember, Scully? Do you have any suspects?

SCULLY: Not as of this time.

MULDER: Could the, uh, the victim have placed it?

SCULLY: Uh, its doubtful. Paula Koklos was severely impaired -- physically and mentally  as was Dara Kernof.

MULDER: And they both died the same way?

SCULLY: It appears that their eyes were burnt out. Their bodies frozen in a position of prayer.

MULDER: Their physical deformities could account for that.

SCULLY: They might.

MULDER: Look, Scully. I know you dont really want my help on this, but can I offer you my professional opinion? (SCULLY nods.) Youve got a bona-fide, super-crazy, religious wacko on your hands.

SCULLY: What makes you so sure?

MULDER: The mote in the eye, the eyes as windows to the soul, an eye for an eye  hes working from ancient scripture  ancient text  Maybe even the Bible. He may even think hes doing Gods work.

STARKEY: (entering) Did you find anything? My name is Aaron Starkey. Im the social worker assigned to Paula Koklos. This is so tragic. I just hope you catch whoever did this.

SCULLY: Mr. Starkey, do you happen to know if that cross over there belonged to Paula?

STARKEY: I dont remember seeing it before. Im sure it didnt.

SCULLY: Did she have any visitors or anybody who might have left it behind?

STARKEY: Well, she had no family. No friends, really. I dont know if you knew this, but Paula was about to be adopted.

SCULLY: By who?



SCENE 10

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up to The Church of St. Peter the Sinner. The name of the church is prefaced by an upside down cross. They enter the church. It looks like an old warehouse, very simple. Folding chairs set up as pews. Someone watches them from under the stairs. MULDER finds a plainly bound book: The Book of St. Peter the Sinner. It has an upside-down cross. He turns the book upside down, looks at the cross, then turns it right-side up.

MULDER: Scully, look at this. (Begins thumbing through it.) The Gnostic Gospels, Book of Enoch  Book of J  Apocrypha  Im surprised theres nothing here from "Jesus Christ Superstar".

SCULLY: What kind of church is this?

MULDER: Theres no telling.

FATHER GREGORY: (entering) Can I help you?

SCULLY: Father Gregory?

FATHER GREGORY: Yes?

SCULLY: Im Dana Scully. Were here about the death of Paula Koklos.

FATHER GREGORY: (reacts to the news with shock) Oh 

SCULLY: Are you all right, Father?

FATHER GREGORY: I was trying to adopt Paula. Im sure you knew that.

MULDER: (suspicious) We hear you were very anxious to do so.

FATHER GREGORY: I  I hope to God youre not suggesting I had something to do with it.

MULDER: Why adopt her?

FATHER GREGORY: You think I was interested in harming her?

MULDER: Why adopt her?

FATHER GREGORY: I - I was trying to protect her. I knew her mother.

SCULLY: Do you know where she is?

FATHER GREGORY: Yes.

SCULLY: We were looking for her name. Its not listed on the girls birth records.

FATHER GREGORY: Why would you want it?

SCULLY: The other two girls may be in danger. Were hoping that she might be able to help is find them.

FATHER GREGORY: Their mother died in childbirth.

(SCULLY looks to MULDER who says nothing.)

SCULLY: Can you give us a name?

FATHER GREGORY: When I was a priest in the Roman Church, before I founded my own, I was her confessor. Divulging her name would violate the code of my faith (he looks at SCULLYS cross necklace)  and yours, I see.

MULDER: You said you wanted to protect Paula. From what?

FATHER GREGORY: Whatever your intentions  your secular prejudices blind you from seeing whats really happening here. Two girls are dead  not by the hand of Man. Unless you accept the truth of Gods teachings that there is a struggle between good and evil for All Souls and that we are losing that struggle, youre but fools rushing in. You put your own lives in danger as well as the lives of the Messengers. I have nothing more to say..

CUT TO:
(Confessional. Present.)

SCULLY: I brought Agent Mulder on the case to help temper my feelings  to keep them from clouding my judgement. I wouldnt admit it to him, but  as we stood there, I felt as if Father Gregory were speaking directly to me  in a language only I could understand.

PRIEST: The Messengers.

SCULLY: Yes.



SCENE 11
(MULDER and SCULLY are coming out of FATHER GREGORYS church.)

MULDER: I know people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones, blah, blah, blah, but that guy is paranoid.

SCULLY: I think youre a little extreme in your judgment, dont you, Mulder?

MULDER: All that crap about the fight for All Souls, the literature we saw in there, the performance we just witnessed  it all fits. He thinks hes doing Gods laundry.

SCULLY: Well, he said this wasnt done by the hand of man. Do you think he believes that, too?

MULDER: If he does, hes even more dangerous than he appears. Even if hes not your killer, he is hiding something.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Well, he says he knew the mother, but wont give up her name. Maybe shes still alive. I think you have enough to bring him in for questioning if not make an arrest.

SCULLY: But, basically, youre ruling out any element of the supernatural?

MULDER: (slowly) What  do  you mean?

SCULLY: Well, Dara Kernof was baptized on the day of her death. She was sanctified by the ritual sacrament  submerged in the spirit..

MULDER: And why would God allow this to happen. Why do bad things happen to good people? Religion has masqueraded as the paranormal since the dawn of time to justify some of the most horrible acts in history.

SCULLY: I was raised to believe that God has His reasons, however mysterious.

MULDER: He may well have His reasons but He seems to use a lot of psychotics to carry out His job orders. You want to find out who did this? I suggest you autopsy the body of Paula Koklos before its interred, before the man who killed her has a chance to find her sisters. (Gets in driver's side of the car.)



SCENE 12
(Autopsy bay.)

SCULLY: The victim is Paula Koklos, age 16, cause of death unknown. Ill begin with the external examination. (Pulls back sheet to show PAULAS burned eyes. PAULA has six fingers on each hand) Victim has signs of congenital physical defects including four supernumerary digits. The only indications of external trauma are the burning  by means unknown, of both globes of the eyes. (feels a lump on the shoulder) Im noting something on the shoulder  a bony process of some kind, possibly a tumerous mass. No- no indication of surgical procedure. (looks at x-ray) The mass appears on both the right and left clavicle.

(When SCULLY looks back at the table, she sees EMILY lying there, looking at her. SCULLY closes her eyes. When she opens them again she sees PAULA staring back at her.)

SCULLY: (quietly) Oh, God. (turns away)

EMILY: Mommy?

(SCULLY turns in shock to see EMILY speaking to her.)

EMILY: Mommy, please.

(SCULLY, beginning to cry, puts her hand over her mouth and turns away. When she turns back, Paula is there again. SCULLY tries to get control of herself.)

CUT TO:
(Confessional. Present.)

SCULLY: I told myself that it was all in my head  a hallucination brought on by my emotional connection to the case.

PRIEST: That would seem to be a reasonable explanation.

SCULLY: But thats not what it was, Father. I was meant to see Emily  for a purpose.

PRIEST: Which was?

SCULLY: To save these girls.



SCENE 13
(SCULLY is in lab looking at autopsy results)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, Scully, its me. I did a little more digging on those adoption records.

SCULLY: (on phone) What do you mean?

MULDER: (on phone, driving slowly - in sunglasses) I think I got a lead on that third sister.

SCULLY: (on phone) Where?

MULDER: (on phone) She was under county care ten years ago. Apparently, she wandered into a teen crisis center here in DC last week, homeless. That guy over at, uh, social services, Starkey  hes helping me canvas the area. (Stops the car and begins walking, followed by STARKEY.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Mulder, if she shares anything with her sisters, she wouldnt be walking anywhere far.

MULDER: (on phone) What did you find?

SCULLY: (on phone) Theres evidence of a progressive degenerative bone disease and, uh, I know youre going to think that Im crazy  but I swear I found evidence of something winglike.

(MULDER looks in a silver Cutlass Ciera that has an upside down cross hanging from the rearview mirror.)

MULDER: (on phone) Well, then, maybe she flew here, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, theres something else 

MULDER: (on phone) Why dont you hold that thought and tell it to me and Father Gregory when you see us?

(STARKEY goes into a fenced off area. MULDER hangs up and goes after him.)

(Another girl, identical to DARA and PAULA, stumbles into a room in an abandoned building. A dark figure follows her into the room. She raises her hands in prayer. There is a very bright flash of light.)

(MULDER enters the building. No sign of STARKEY. MULDER sees a figure at the end of a hall and pulls out his gun. It is FATHER GREGORY.)

MULDER: Stop right there! Move into the light. Move into the light. Hands where I can see them!

FATHER GREGORY: Were too late.

(MULDER pushes FATHER GREGORY against the wall, roughly.)

MULDER: Wheres the girl?

FATHER GREGORY: Shes dead.

MULDER: Where is she?

FATHER GREGORY: In there.

(MULDER slowly pushes open a door and enters. The girl sits in a position of prayer. Her eyes are burned out. MULDER looks up suddenly as a bird flies up and out through a grate in the roof.)



SCENE 14
(Interrogation room. MULDER sits at table with FATHER GREGORY. SCULLY stands behind MULDER. FATHER GREGORY is quietly murmuring.)

MULDER: What are you asking for, Father? Mercy or forgiveness? You know they say when you talk to God its prayer, but when God talks to you, its schizophrenia. What is your God telling you, Father?

FATHER GREGORY: I pray for the girls souls.

MULDER: You pray for their souls now. Thats convenient.

FATHER GREGORY: Im immune to your mockery. Youre not interested in the truth.

MULDER: I am only interested in the truth. I would like to know why you did what you did to three defenseless, helpless young girls. What in your sick mind would possess you to burn their eyes out! Did they see you for who you are, like I do? (Pushes upside down cross pendant toward him.) What does this mean, Father?

FATHER GREGORY: (to SCULLY) Tell him what it is.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY. SCULLY hesitates.)

FATHER GREGORY: St Peter. You know the story. St Peter on the cross.

SCULLY: St. Peter would only be crucified upside-down out of humility towards Christ.

FATHER GREGORY: Ive risked my life to protect their precious souls, which the devil has sought to claim for his own. He took two before I could reach them. I was too late to save the third.

(GUARD enters.)

GUARD: Agents Mulder and Scully?

(MULDER leaves, SCULLY following slowly.)

FATHER GREGORY: (to SCULLY) You know. Youve already guessed  what they are. The last one is still out there. The Devil is here and if he finds her, his victory will be complete.

MULDER: (reentering) Scully, they think theyve found the fourth girl.

FATHER GREGORY: As long as Im in here, theres no one to protect her. Let me go  or she will die.

CUT TO:
(Confessional. Present.)

PRIEST: You believed him.

SCULLY: Yes.

PRIEST: But you didnt tell your colleague.

SCULLY: He believed that he could find the last girl. But I already knew that I was meant to save her.

PRIEST: From what?

SCULLY: I wasnt sure. Father Gregory said that the Devil claimed the lives of the first three girls.

PRIEST: You dont believe that.

SCULLY: I know now that Father Gregory was mistaken. The Devil didnt take their souls, but the threat to those girls was real. And Father Gregory gave his life to protect them.



SCENE 15
(MULDER and SCULLY walking through police station. SCULLY is looking at folder.)

MULDER: The fourth girl is Roberta Dyer. Transferred to Maryland Adoption Services in 1995 when her foster father got a job in Gaithersburg. Adoption services were called out to investigate allegations of child abuse in September of that year. Three more times in 96, then two more times in 97.

(SCULLY does not respond, just stares at the picture of the girl.)

MULDER: Whats wrong?

SCULLY: Father Gregory called them Messengers.

MULDER: Scully? Scully, dont let this guy get in your head. Thats the last thing you want. Sometimes the most twisted ones are the most persuasive.

SCULLY: Mulder, he knows where she is.

MULDER: Well, thats okay. As long as hes locked up here, it doesnt matter.

SCULLY: Youre not going find her. I think youre being misled.

MULDER: By who? Scully, I think youre the one whos being misled. Not just willingly, but willfully. Ive never seen you more vulnerable or susceptible or more easily manipulated and it scares me because I dont know why.

SCULLY: I saw Emily. She came to me in a vision.

(Puts his arm around her shoulders and leans in close to her.)

MULDER: I think you should step away. Personal issues are making you lose your objectivity, clouding your judgement.

SCULLY: You go. Go find the girl. Im going to finish up with Father Gregory.

MULDER: Okay.

(MULDER releases her shoulder, gently takes the folder and leaves.)



SCENE 16
(Interrogation room. FATHER GREGORY is alone.)

STARKEY: Father Gregory. Where is she, Father?

FATHER GREGORY: (seeing STARKEY) How did you get in here?

STARKEY: I will not be denied this time, Father.

FATHER GREGORY: But you took the others.

STARKEY: The others were taken from me. I will not allow that to happen again. Where is the fourth girl?

(FATHER GREGORYS hands begin to smoke and turn red. He cries out in pain.)

STARKEY: (voice deepening) Tell me, Father. Save yourself.



SCENE 17
(Outside interrogation room. SCULLY tries the door. It is locked. A GUARD is sitting at a nearby desk.)

SCULLY: Id like to get back in here.

GUARD: It should be open. (He tries to unlock the door.)

SCULLY: Father Gregory? (bangs on door) Father Gregory?

(Inside the room, we see FATHER GREGORY dead. His skin is completely red and blistered.)



SCENE 18
(DYER house. Police cars pull up. MULDER and police go to door. DYER, a very slimy man, answers. MULDER pushes his way in the house, shoving a warrant into DYERS hands.)

MULDER: We have a warrant to search the premises for your daughter.

DYER: Shes not here. I tell you, shes out  shes at school.

MULDER: We checked at school. She hasnt been there in over a week. We have reason to believe that her life may be in danger. If you know something  (Tries door under stairs.) Whats behind this door?

DYER: Its the basement.

MULDER: Well, can you unlock it?

DYER: I dont have the key.

(MULDER gives him a look, then kicks in the door. He shines his flashlight in. Blankets and clothes and dirty dishes are strewn about. It looks like a homeless persons corner of an alley.)

MULDER: (angry) Is this her room? Where is she, Mr. Dyer? Where is she?!

DYER: Theyre going to cut off the checks, arent they?

MULDER: Where is she?!

DYER: He said hed take her off my hands, but I could keep the disability.

MULDER: Who?

DYER: The priest.

MULDER: Who?!

DYER: Father Gregory.



SCENE 19
DISTRICT POLICE STATION
9:52 PM
(SCULLY is walking to her car. Her key doesnt work in the lock. She looks through her keys. Still has Apollo 11 key ring MULDER gave her last year. Phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah, hi, Scully. Its me.

SCULLY: (on phone) Hes dead, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Who?

(MULDER is standing in the basement of the DYER house.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Father Gregory. They found him alone in the interrogation room. No one can figure it out. There was a guard sitting right outside the room.

(SCULLY drops her keys. She bends down to pick them up and sees a pair of legs.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) We didnt find her. The fourth girl  she was here.

(Speechless, SCULLY looks up slowly and sees a mans smiling face which is backlit by a very bright light. The head begins turning, different animal faces appear.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, Scully. Scully, you there? Answer me. Scully? Scully!

(Very bright light.)

(Commercial.)



SCENE 20
(FATHER MCCUES office. Next day.)

SCULLY: Father?

FATHER MCCUE: Come in, Dana. I understand you found the man responsible for the death of those girls. Im sure the Kernoffs will be relieved.

SCULLY: Im not sure if they should be, Father.

FATHER MCCUE: Why not?

SCULLY: Ive seen things. Things that have made me question if there arent  larger forces at work here.

FATHER MCCUE: What have you seen?

SCULLY: Visions  of my daughter Emily, for one.

FATHER MCCUE: I think thats understandable. Im sure you identified with the loss.

SCULLY: I considered that, um but then I saw something last night, which I  Which I cant explain. I saw a man  in dark clothes  but he had four faces. They werent human.

(FATHER MCCUE goes to a bookshelf and gets an old book. He opens it and hands it to SCULLY. There is a drawing of a figure with four animal faces and four human figures below it.)

FATHER MCCUE: Is this what you saw? Its a Seraphim. An angel  with four faces  Those of a man, a lion, an eagle, and a bull. In the story, the angel descends from heaven and fathers four children with a mortal woman. Their offspring are the Nephilim  The "Fallen Ones." They have the souls of angels but they werent meant to be. Theyre deformed, tormented. So the Lord sends the Seraphim to Earth to bring back the souls of the Nephilim to keep the Devil from claiming them as his own.

SCULLY: How did he bring back their souls?

FATHER MCCUE: They were smote with the brightness of his countenance. To look upon the Seraphim in all his glory is to give up ones soul to heaven.

SCULLY: Do you think thats what I saw?

FATHER MCCUE: No. I think what you saw is a figment of your imagination. A half-remembered story from your childhood that surfaced because of this case.

SCULLY: But I saw it, Father.

FATHER MCCUE: Dana, the Nephilim is a story. The text in which it appears isnt even recognized by the Church.

SCULLY: Father, do you believe that  God has His reasons?

FATHER MCCUE: Yes, Im certain of it. Its how He rewards our faith.



SCENE 21
(Outside SCULLYS church)

STARKEY: Agent Scully? I cant believe I found you.

SCULLY: What is it?

STARKEY: Agent Mulders been trying to reach you. Hes been at the station.

SCULLY: Trying to reach me for what?

STARKEY: The fourth girl  shes at Father Gregorys church. Come on. Ill drive you.



SCENE 22
(They arrive at FATHER GREGORYS church. SCULLY enters. STARKEY stands in the doorway.)

SCULLY: Theres no one here.

STARKEY: They must be on their way.

(SCULLY sees horns in STARKEYS shadow.)

STARKEY: You dont see her in there? Shes here. I know it.

(SCULLY goes to top of stairs. The door is locked. Coming back down, she sees someone under the stairs looking up at her.)

STARKEY: Agent Scully? Did you find her? Agent Scully?

(SCULLY opens door under stairs. ROBERTA, identical to other three girls, cowers in the corner.)

SCULLY: (to ROBERTA, quietly) My name is Dana. Im going to get you out of there, okay? Im not going to hurt you.

(SCULLY holds out her hand. ROBERTA cautiously takes it and allows SCULLY to help her out.)

SCULLY: Im going to take you someplace safe.

(SCULLY begins walking ROBERTA to front of the church, not towards STARKEY.)

STARKEY: Where are you going? Where are you taking her?

SCULLY: Everythings going to be fine.

(Bright flash of light from the front of the church startles SCULLY and ROBERTA.)

STARKEY: Bring her to me! Bring her here! Bring me the girl!

(ROBERTA begins moving toward the light. SCULLY tries to hold her back.)

SCULLY: No, its okay. Its all right. Stay here. Its okay. Stay  Just stay here! Its going to be okay.

STARKEY: Bring her out to me.

(SCULLY looks back towards STARKEY.)

EMILY: Mommy?

(SCULLY looks back to see that it is EMILYS hand she is holding.)

EMILY: Mommy, let me go. Mommy, please let me go.

SCULLY: Emily.

STARKEY: Agent Scully, get her out of there!

EMILY: Mommy, please.

(SCULLY slowly releases EMILYS hand and watches her walk into the light.)

SCULLY: Emily? Emily?! Oh, God.

(The light fades. ROBERTAS dead body sits, hands raised in prayer, eyes burned. STARKEY is gone. SCULLY sits down on one of chairs.)

CUT TO:
(Confessional. Present.)

PRIEST: You believed you were releasing her soul to Heaven.

SCULLY: I felt sure of it.

PRIEST: But you still cant reconcile this belief with the physical fact of her death?

SCULLY: No. I thought I could, Father, but I cant.

PRIEST: Do you believe there is a life after this one?

SCULLY: Yes.

PRIEST: Are you sure?

(SCULLY tries to answer, but cannot.)

PRIEST: Has it occurred to you that maybe this, too, is part of what you were meant to understand?

SCULLY: You mean, accepting my loss?

PRIEST: Can you accept it?

SCULLY: Maybe thats what faith is.

[THE END]

                                  THE PINE BLUFF VARIANT



SCENE 1
FOLGER PARK
WASHINGTON, DC

(MULDER jogging through park.)

(SKINNER and SCULLY watch from FBI surveillance van.)

TECH 1: (voice) North Perimeter clear. No sign of him.

TECH 2: (voice) South access clear.

SKINNER: Camera one, pan right. Mulder, make for the west entrance.

TECH 3: (voice) West gate  No sign of suspect.

SKINNER: Two, angle south entrance.

TECH 4: (voice) Mid-park clear

SCULLY: (looking at a bus on monitor) There. The bus.

SKINNER: Three, zoom in.

SKINNER: Stay close, Mulder. (Compares mugshot of Haley with the image of a man getting off the bus. Its Haley.) We have Alpha off an east bound Metro bus.

(MULDER running.)

TECH 2: I have alpha heading south.

SKINNER: One, follow suspect.

(AGENT READING PAPER on a bench watches HALEY pass and sit on a bench with another man, the FBI beta target.)

UNDERCOVER AGENT READING PAPER: Contact made.

SKINNER: All right, hold your positions.

(Lots of undercover agents around.)

SCULLY: Whats he looking at?

SKINNER: Two. Pick it up.

(Camera pans over to MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, hes watching you.

(MULDER pauses.)

TECH 2: Hes reaching for something.

SKINNER: Zoom in. One, zoom.

(HALEY hands an envelope to the other man.)

SKINNER: Okay, slowly. Slowly. Wait for it. Wait., wait. Wait for it.

(MULDER stretches, looking casual. The man meeting with HALEY on a bench takes the envelope from HALEY and looks in it.)

SKINNER: Okay 

(Man meeting with HALEY puts envelope in his pocket, then suddenly doubles over in pain.)

HALEY: What - what- what -? Hey.

SCULLY: What just happened? Whats happening?

SKINNER: I dont know what the hell happened.

HALEY: Anybody! A doctor! I need a doctor over here.. My friends sick here. I dont know whats wrong. Oh, God. He just  he just fell  Ah, man. (runs off)

SKINNER: What the hells going on?

SCULLY: I cant see anything! Theres 

TECH 2: Beta target down!

TECH 3: Weve lost Alpha!

SKINNER: Go! Go! Go!

(Car pulls up and FBI agents get out to pursue HALEY.)

SCULLY: There he is! Hes heading west. Hes on the move! Hes on the move!

MULDER: (running after HALEY) Im on him!

SKINNER: Maintain your position on the downed Beta. Find the Alpha on three.

AGENT READING PAPER: (approaching the fallen man on the bench) Federal agents! Step aside! Oh, my God.

SKINNER: What is it?

AGENT READING PAPER: What that hell did he do to him?

SCULLY: What? What! What? What are you seeing?

SKINNER: Come on, talk to me! Talk to me!

(Man looks like acid has been poured on his face and hands.)

AGENT READING PAPER: Its eating away his flesh.

SCULLY: What?

SKINNER: Haley must be carrying something lethal.

SCULLY: Wheres Mulder?

SKINNER: Mulder was on him. Theres no way he couldnt catch him.

SCULLY: Mulder, respond!

SKINNER: Can you find him? Zoom in. Zoom in!

SCULLY: I cant see a thing. Mulder, suspect is armed and dangerous. Pursue Alpha with extreme caution.

(MULDER chasing HALEY.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Damn it!

(SCULLY gets up and jumps out of van. Skinner yells after her.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully!

(SCULLY runs through park. She sees MULDER stop near a car, and look around. Car pulls away quickly. MULDER walks away. SCULLY watches. MULDER runs up to SCULLY)

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: I lost him.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: (not looking at her) He got away.

(SCULLY watches MULDER leave. She appears confused.)

SCENE 2

(X-Files office. SCULLY is watching surveillance video. It looks like Mulder is handing off something to HALEY. MULDER enters, avoids looking at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: I came in early. I wanted to take a look at the surveillance tape to make sure I wasnt crazy. What happened out there, Mulder?

MULDER: "What happened?"

SCULLY: There were 12 agents yesterday in the park. We had ownership of the suspect. We were in position to make the capture and you let him get away. And from what I see now, you may have aided in his escape.

MULDER: (not looking at her) I dont know what youre talking about.

SCULLY: Its on the video, Mulder. I cant prove it was you, but I know what I saw. This man is a murderer. He is a terrorist. I have a report to give this morning. I expect you to give me an answer. I expect you to tell me the truth.

MULDER: Were late for the hearing.



SCENE 3
JOINT FBI/CIA
COUNTER TERRORISM COUNCIL

(FBI briefing room. 15+ agents and MULDER, SCULLY and SKINNER.)

SKINNER: 15 hours ago, a joint FBI/CIA task force assembled to capture Jacob Steven Haley, second in command of the militia group known as New Spartans. Intelligence revealed Haley was to make an exchange of money for a quantity of automatic weapons to conduct domestic terrorist activities and to further their express goal of overthrowing the federal government. Due to reasons that are still under review, our operation failed. (SCULLY looks at MULDER. He looks away from her.) Jacob Steven Haley remains at large. Whereabouts unknown.

CIA AGENT: What about the weapons?

SKINNER: An arms dealer name Cadre who died at the scene received from Haley a $50,000 bearer bond. Presumably, this was payment for weapons delivered.

CIA AGENT: In other words, Haley not only got away, he got away with $50,000 worth of guns? Have we determined a cause of death? How Haley killed this man?

SCULLY: He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological agent.

CIA AGENT: What kind of toxin are we talking about?

SCULLY: We dont know. Its affect on the dermis and the soft tissues, the rapidity of its action  it is not a disease known in nature. It would seem to be genetically engineered. A bioweapon.

CIA AGENT: How the hell did he get it?

CIA AGENT: The former Soviet Union. Security on the Siberian Vector Lab is, uh, lax. Its conceivable it was stolen, though we have no confirmation from Moscow.

CIA AGENT: So this is out in the ozone now? Is this stuff floating through Folger Park?

SCULLY: Level Four decontamination procedures were undertaken immediately. Our best indications are that exposure was limited and that the toxin was transmitted directly and not contagious.

CIA AGENT: How do you know that?

MULDER: Were not all dead?

(No one is amused.)

SCULLY: At this point, we can only guess that the toxin was transmitted by liquid or gas, touch or injection.

CIA AGENT: Anybody care to tell me how this guy, Haley eluded us?

(SCULLY looks at MULDER. He looks away.)

SKINNER: Video recon indicates Haley had an accomplice at the park. We have yet to identify who this was, or how Haley knew he was under surveillance.

FBI AGENT: He must have made us.

CIA AGENT: Could he have?

SKINNER: No. Every member was chosen for their lack of exposure in terrorist circles.

MULDER: Haleys extremely suspicious to the point of paranoia. Hes got military training and a guerrilla mentality.

SKINNER: Second only to this man. (Shows slide of BREMER.) August Bremer. Hes the group's mastermind. However, there are reports that he and Haley are vying for control. This destabilization makes August Bremer our primary threat.

CIA AGENT: Well, this is it. This is the scenario weve all been worried about, people. Now, I need maximum control of information. Nothing leaves this room. The media gets a sniff, were going to disavow. We are going to stop these men. Were going to make it all go away.

(Everyone gets up to leave.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(MULDER walks out of the room, ignoring SCULLY. SKINNER watches them.)



SCENE 4
GABLES CORNER, OHIO

(Movie theatre. A man, BREMER comes up to the USHERETTE.)

USHERETTE: The shows almost over.

BREMER: One, please.

(USHERETTE sells it to him.)

BREMER: Thanks.

(BREMER goes inside and up to concession counter.)

BREMER: Id like some popcorn, please.

USHERETTE: (walking from ticket booth to concession counter) Do you want large, extra large or Jumbo large?

BREMER: Could I get some fresh popcorn, please. The sign says "Fresh Popcorn."

USHERETTE: This is fresh popcorn.

BREMER: No, fresh-fresh --- hot  out of the machine back there. Please. A large.

USHERETTE: (over him) Ill have to make it. Probably take a minute.

(BREMER puts on gloves and takes out an unmarked aerosol can and uncaps it.)



SCENE 5
AARON BURR MOTOR COURT
ANGOLA, DELAWARE

(MULDER drives up to a hotel lobby to check in. SCULLY pulls in behind him and watches MULDER enter the office.)

(Later, in hotel room, MULDERS phone rings. He answers.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?

HALEY: (on phone) You set me up.

MULDER: I saved your ass.

HALEY: (on phone) Then why wasnt I told?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) I didnt know about the operation.

HALEY: (on phone) It was your operation.

MULDER: (on phone) No. The Justice Department got an anonymous tip. I found out a half hour before it went down. I did what I could.

HALEY: (on phone) Youll have to do better than that, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) What else can I say? I-I got as much to lose here as you do. They catch you, youll flip me. Look, I believe in your ideals and your goals but the only reason I tolerate your methods is because the governments are worse.

HALEY: (on phone) Wow. What a ringing endorsement.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, you came to me, remember? I mean, what more do you want from me? Ive risked everything. Ive given you information. My partner is seriously suspicious. If thats not enough for you, thats all Ive got. (hangs up)

(HALEY sighs and hangs up.)



SCENE 6

(Outside movie theatre in Ohio, two teens sit on curb.)

TEEN 1: Aint nobody home.

TEEN 2: Eh, shes in there. Shes just hiding or something.

TEEN 1: Im thinking we could break for it right through the front doors.

TEEN 2: (holding up a coathanger) Why? I got us front row seats.

(They use the hanger to open the exit door behind the theatre and enter the theatre. They sit on front row. Die Hard With a Vengeance is the feature.)

TEEN 1: She see us? Is she coming?

TEEN 2: (turning around) Hey, man.

(Other patrons in the theatre are dead, their faces eaten away.)



SCENE 7

(Hotel lobby.)

SCULLY: (with attitude rings lobby bell) Maybe you can tell me whats going on.

MANAGER: What?

SCULLY: There seems to be a problem. A man just told me you gave him keys to my room, room 130.

MANAGER: Who are you?

SCULLY: Who am I? Who is he?

MANAGER: Mr. uh, Kaplan.

SCULLY: Mr. Kaplan.

MANAGER: Yes.

SCULLY: Thank you. (starts to exit)

MANAGER: Are you the wife?

SCULLY: Not even close.

(SCULLY leaves the office, angry.)



SCENE 8

(MULDERs hotel room. Phone rings. MULDER answers.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?

BREMER: (on phone) Well proceed as planned.

(MULDER hangs up and goes out of his motel room. SCULLY hides behind a car. Another car drives up beside MULDER.)

DRIVER: Agent Mulder? You coming with us?

(SCULLY watches MULDER get into a car. She gets in her own car and follows without her lights on. She is run off the road by another car.)

SCULLY: Shi.!

(MAN gets out of his car and knocks on SCULLYs window.)

MAN: Step out of the car.



SCENE 9

(SCULLY is being escorted down a hallway by four men.)

SCULLY: Exactly what agency are you from? Obviously not the Office of Information.

(MAN knocks at a door. SKINNER and CIA operative are seated at a desk.)

CIA AGENT: Agent Scully, take a seat.

SCULLY: What the hell is going on?

CIA AGENT: I apologize for our methods.

SKINNER: They may well have saved Agent Mulders life.

SCULLY: What about my life? I dont appreciate being run off the road.

CIA AGENT: We had our reasons.

SKINNER: Youre suspicious Agent Mulders betrayed his country.

SCULLY: I dont know what youre talking about.

CIA AGENT: Your discretion is understandable. In point of fact, Agent Mulders actions are entirely honorable. What youve stumbled into is a classified action, a deep-cover assignment.

SKINNER: Until now, Agent Mulders true mission was known only to the US Attorney and myself.

SCULLY: His true mission?

SKINNER: The council we sat in was front to make the New Spartans believe we were unaware of Agent Mulders complicity.

SCULLY: Why him? Why choose Agent Mulder?

SKINNER: We didnt choose him. They did.

CIA AGENT: He spoke at a UFO conference in Boston where he broadcast his feelings about the government and their conspiracies against the American people. Somebody from the organization was listening so the man who escaped, Haley, sent out feelers in hopes that Agent Mulder was a man whose politics were in line with his own. Someone on the inside that he could use.

SCULLY: To what aim?

SKINNER: That we dont know.

SCULLY: Youve put Agent Mulders life in danger by not telling me.

SKINNER: I advised him not to tell you. Hes at a very delicate point. Everything he does now must work to build trust.

SCULLY: Including letting this man Haley get away with murder? Sir, we know nothing about this bioweapon. We dont know what they want to use it for. We dont even know if they have the capacity to store it safely. Putting Agent Mulder in this situation is extremely risky.

SKINNER: They want something from him. We have no other way of learning what.

(Knock at door. AGENT enters.)

AGENT: Movie theatre in Ohio. Whatever theyre using, theyve used it again.



SCENE 10

(Car pulls up to warehouse. Three men exit the car and pull MULDER, who is wearing a hood, out and seat him at a table inside the warehouse. They strap his hands to top of the table, then step away.)

MULDER: (still wearing the hood) Ooh. Is this the Pepsi challenge? How bout some, uh, fresh air, boys?

(They pull the hood off. MULDER blinks his eyes against the light. HALEY is sitting across from MULDER.)

HALEY: Welcome, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Okay, deal me in.

(One of the men who brought MULDER in grabs MULDERs left pinky finger and holds it in his fist.)

HALEY: This is just a little method that we use to learn the truth.

MULDER: Well, you might want to put that hood back on me unless you want to see a grown man cry.

HALEY: What happened in the park?

MULDER: I told you on the phone.

FINGER BREAKING MAN twists and breaks MULDERs finger. MULDER screams in pain.)

MULDER: I was set up. Im telling the truth. Wait, wait! Wait! I let you go!

HALEY: Youre spying on us, arent you?

MULDER: No. No. No.

(FBM twists the finger again. MULDER screams.)

MULDER: You want me to lie and say yes?

(FBM twists again. MULDER screams.)

MULDER: (to FBM) Im going to kill you, you son of a bitch! Im going to kill you! (to HALEY) If I set you up you think Id even get into the car with this Nazi piece of shi!

(FBM twists again. MULDER yells and head butts FBM, knocking FBM to the floor.)

MULDER: (in lots of pain) I risked everything! If I was lying, thered be federal agents descending on this place like the wrath of God right now. (to FBM) If you touch me again, youd better kill me!

(FBM twists again. MULDER screams, weaker now.)

HALEY: A war is going on, Agent Mulder. Either youre on the right side or the wrong. (Pulls out aerosol can and holds it pointed at MULDERs face.) Youve seen the effects of this?

MULDER: (weakly) Yeah.

HALEY: Would you like to see them again?

MULDER: No, I didnt set you up. If you got set up, it was one of yours.

(FBM bends the finger all the way back. MULDER cries out, then puts his face down on his unbroken hand and sobs.)

HALEY: (thoughtfully) You know what? I believe you.



SCENE 11

(Outside movie theatre. SKINNER and SCULLY approach a TECHNICIAN.)

SCULLY: What are you reading in there?

TECH: Weve been through and through. No hot zones. No atmospheric. Youre clear, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (taking kit from the TECH) Thank you.

(SKINNER and SCULLY enter the theatre lobby.)

SKINNER: 14 victims total, including patrons, a projectionist and an employee.

(They look behind the counter. SCULLY is disturbed by the sight of the body. We dont see it.)

SKINNER: Thats the usherette. There were two survivors. Two teenage boys.

(They enter the theatre and shine flashlights over about 10 plastic covered dead bodies still in their seats.)

SKINNER: How did it happen that those two kids survived?

SCULLY: I dont know. But its going to help us establish a method of delivery. (looks closely at one of the dead patrons whose skin has been dissolved) Its doubtful the pathogen was airborne. They found no atmospheric traces. So its got to be something that everybody touched.

(SCULLY bends down, and with gloved hand picks up a ticket stub)



SCENE 12

(MULDER enters his dark apartment. He closes the door and looks at his broken finger.)

SCULLY: Dont be alarmed.

MULDER: (startled, then rubs his face tiredly with his good hand) Scully, get out of here.

SCULLY: Mulder 

MULDER: Get out of here!

SCULLY: I know what youre doing. Skinner told me everything.

MULDER: I dont know what youre talking about

SCULLY: What happened to your hand?

MULDER: Nothing.

(SCULLY takes MULDERs hand and inspects the damage. MULDER winces.)

SCULLY: Oh, Mulder, what did they do to you? God, this needs to be set. Youre in pain.

(SCULLY goes to kitchen.)

MULDER: Yeah, if you keep pulling it around like that.

(MULDER sits on his couch.)

SCULLY: Lets get the swelling down.

(SCULLY brings ice wrapped in a towel and sits on the coffee table in front of him and holds the ice on MULDERs hand.)

SCULLY: Theyve killed again, Mulder. 14 people in a movie theatre in Ohio. The same toxin they released in the park.

MULDER: 14 people? That doesnt make any sense.

SCULLY: Unless it was a test for something bigger.

(Camera brings old adhesive X shaped tape marks on window into focus. The rest of the scene is heard through a handheld listening device pointed at MULDERs apartment.)

SCULLY: (voice) Why do this to you, Mulder?

MULDER: (voice) Theyre testing me, too. Haleys paranoid  and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.

SCULLY: (voice) What stopped him?

MULDER: (voice) They still need something from me  and Im sensing theres someone Haley trusts even less  The man giving him his orders. Someone I havent met yet. A guy named August Bremer.

(We see that the listening device is being held by August Bremer sitting in a van outside.)



SCENE 13
FBI HEADQUARTERS
3:14 AM

(MULDER, finger in a splint,  walks down hall and enters SKINNERs office. SKINNER and the CIA AGENT are waiting for him.)

SKINNER: What happened to your hand?

MULDER: Terrorist lie detector.

CIA AGENT: Well, did you pass?

MULDER: Well, I must have. Im still here. They told me what they want. Documentation from the federal reserve bank. Fund transfer schedules for the eastern seaboard. Cash money.

CIA AGENT: Theyre going to hit a bank or an armored car.

SKINNER: Thats it? Thats all?

MULDER: I think I convinced Haley that the near miss in Folger Park was due to a mole inside his own group. He wants surveillance files on them.

SKINNER: How soon?

MULDER: Theyre waiting for my call.

SKINNER: All right, well need some time to redact. Dummy something up.

CIA AGENT: No, I anticipated this. Ive got files ready to use. (goes to his briefcase)

SKINNER: You know, Im getting a bad feeling about this. I want a tail on him.

CIA AGENT: No tail.

SKINNER: Once they get what they want from Mulder, whats to keep them from killing him?

CIA AGENT: They spot a tail on him, theyre gonna shoot him on the spot. We have got no other way of learning what they want past this  What the big picture is.

SKINNER: You may not have another chance to contact us.

MULDER: (leaving the room) If you dont hear from me by midnight  feed my fish.



SCENE 14

(FBI biology lab. Microscope image of bacteria.)

TECH: Thats it. Thats your bug.

SCULLY: Its a bacterium.

TECH: An especially virulent one. We isolated it from the bearer bond.

SCULLY: Was the bacterium also found on the ticket stub?

TECH: Actually, no. Barring the usual particles and dust mites the ticket stub was clean.

SCULLY: Well, then how was the biotoxin spread throughout the theatre?

TECH: I dont know.

SCULLY: It looks like streptococcus.

TECH: A strain of streptococcus, but one that has been genetically altered to make it extraordinarily lethal.

SCULLY: But strep wouldnt be able to survive any kind of exposure to the environment.

TECH: Normally. But whoever produced this has cleverly coded the bacterium with a synthetic protective covering. The covering gives them an adhesive quality. Its like a scratch and sniff. Dermal contact activates the contagion. Its ingenious in its own evil way.

SCULLY: Developed by the Russians?

TECH: Ive seen everything in the Russian arsenal. Theyve got nothing this sophisticated.

SCULLY: Well, then by whom?

(TECH shrugs.)



SCENE 15

(MULDER drives up to motel. Enters room. Overhead light doesnt work. FINGER BREAKING MAN turns on table lamp. MULDER is startled. HALEY enters.)

HALEY: Do you have what we need?

MULDER: Tell the gimp to back off.

(HALEY nods. FBM leaves the room.)

HALEY: Give me the files.

(MULDER tosses down a roll of film.)

MULDER: I need that back by tomorrow.

(HALEY takes it to the lamp and looks at the images.)

HALEY: Lies within lies. (Pulls hood out of a briefcase.) Put the hood on. Youre going with us.

(MULDER picks up hood and looks at it.)

MULDER: No.

HALEY: You put it on or the gimp puts it on for you.



SCENE 16

(SKINNERS office. Phone rings. SKINNER answers using speaker phone.)

SKINNER: Skinner.

SCULLY: (on phone) The biotoxin was applied to the bearer bond with an aerosol spray, but there is no evidence whatsoever of it on the theatre stubs. Now, I still have no idea how these kids were unaffected.

SKINNER: (on phone) Have you IDd the toxin? (no answer) Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) Sir, are you alone?

SKINNER: (on phone, looks at CIA AGENT) No. Why?

SCULLY: (on phone) Id like to speak with you in private.

SKINNER: (turning off speaker phone) Youre off the speaker.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you. Now, CIA Intelligence suggested that this biotoxin was stolen from the Russians, but my research indicates that it was almost certainly developed domestically.

SKINNER: (on phone) The United States has no bioweapons, Agent Scully. President Nixon dismantled our program in 1969.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir, thats what weve been told, but the CDC database contains evidence of a streptococcus bacterium being developed by the Armys Pine Bluff Facility in the 1960s. It appears to be a very primitive strain of what were seeing here.

SKINNER: (on phone) What are you saying?

SCULLY: (on phone) What Im saying is that the bioweapons program may have continued in secret and that someone may be sending Agent Mulder on a suicide mission.

SKINNER: (on phone) Right. Thank you. (hangs up)

CIA AGENT: What is it?

SKINNER: Shes just .. concerned for her partner.



SCENE 17

(Black car drives up to a barn. Inside the barn are lots of men with guns. HALEY enters with MULDER, hooded. BREMER is there. Once inside, MULDER is unhooded.)

BREMER: You put us all at risk bringing him here.

HALEY: We took the usual precautions. Anyway he came through for us. Federal Reserve schedules for tomorrow. (gives Bremer film from MULDER)

BREMER: (to MULDER) Youre a believer?

MULDER: I have my beliefs.

BREMER: You willing to die for them?

MULDER: Id prefer it didnt come to that.

BREMER: We have a job to do.

(BREMER tosses MULDER a rubber Dracula mask.)

BREMER: Youre Dracula.



SCENE 18
6:04 am

(SCULLY sitting in her car on stake out outside motel?.)

SCULLY: (to herself) Oh, damn. (realization) The money. Oh, my God, the money.

(Starts her car.)



SCENE 19

(Terrorists and MULDER in a moving armored car truck. They are putting on Halloween masks and checking guns.)

HALEY: (wearing werewolf mask, handing MULDER an evil looking gun) Mulder, take it.

BREMER: (wearing purple demon mask) Make sure you point that the right way.

(FINGER BREAKING MAN puts on skeleton mask.)



SCENE 20
FIRST SOVEREIGN BANK OF PENNSYLVANIA
HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA
(MANAGER is walking through large bank.)

MANAGER: Euna, can I have the keys, please?

(Secretary gives him the keys. He walks back to the armored car loading dock. Guard opens gate. Manager unlocks door. Backup alarm beeps. As he reaches armored car, terrorists get out of car.)

BREMER: You do what I say, or Ill shoot you!

HALEY: Three minutes!

(BREMER takes MANAGER by the collar and leads him back into the bank.)

BREMER: Open the gate. Open it!

TERRORIST 1: Get down! Now! Everybody down! Now!

TERRORIST 2: Dont be foolish. Give us the money and well be gone. Move back! Move it! Come on! Move it! Down! Move it! Down, here, now! Dont touch that phone!

(Employees obey, with minimal screaming.)

BREMER: Dracula, take the teller.

MULDER: Right.

(MULDER holds young male teller at gunpoint.)

HALEY: Step away from the counter! Open the doors! Put your hands up on the windows now! Now! Do it! Get down!

TERRORIST 2: You! Here! Get down! Now! Get down!

HALEY: Two minutes!

BREMER: (leading MANAGER to vault) Lets open it! Open it!

(MANAGER begins opening vault.)

FBM: Dont move!

MULDER: I got it!

(Teller that MULDER was watching is shot by FBM, but not fatally. A woman screams.)

HALEY: Is he dead?

MULDER: No. Hes still alive.

HALEY: Finish him!

(MULDER points his gun at the wounded teller.)



SCENE 21

(Bank scene continued. MULDER holds his gun aimed at the man lying on the floor.)

HALEY: One minute thirty!

(MANAGER finishes opening vault.)

HALEY: You! Face down on the floor! Right here!

(HALEY pushes MANAGER to the floor. Terrorists go in vault and begin stuffing money in bags.)

HALEY: (to MULDER) What are you waiting for? Do it!

(MULDER aims gun again.)

TERRORIST 2: Get down!

(In vault, BREMER sprays money that they are not stealing with an aerosol can.)

HALEY: (to MULDER) I told you to finish him. Finish him!

(MULDER stands ready to fire. TELLER is frightened.)

BREMER: (pushing MULDER aside) That weapons traceable. Go.

(Behind MULDER, BREMER shoots  the TELLER. Other employees cry and moan.)

BREMER: Get the hell out of here. Go! Go!

(Terrorists leave.)



SCENE 22

(MULDER throws his Dracula head onto a bonfire, disgusted with himself. BREMER puts money on the bonfire, also.)

MULDER: What are you doing? What are you doing?

BREMER: The bills could be traced.

MULDER: The bank heist was a decoy. To contaminate the money you didnt take.

BREMER: No more tests, Mr. Mulder. This is the real deal. Youve been a big help. (Points a gun at MULDER.)

HALEY: (stopping BREMER) Put that down.

BREMER: Hes a liability now.

HALEY: To who? You? If you think youre going to kill Mulder to protect your secret, its too late. I already know your secret. Agent Mulder provided us with FBI surveillance reports  files which contain the name of a source whos been leaking information on us for a period of two years  Charles Bogard. (to other terrorists) See, Bogard is an alias an old one  for August Bremer.

BREMER: Agent Mulder knows my alias just as he knew a false report would feed your ambition and pit you against me.

HALEY: Mulder risked his life for us.

BREMER: Are you sure about that?

(BREMER plays tape of MULDER and SCULLY in MULDERs apartment.)

MULDER: (taped) They're testing me, too. Haley's paranoid... and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.

SCULLY: (taped) What stopped him?

MULDER: (taped) They still need something from me. And I'm sensing there's someone Haley trusts even less.

HALEY: (to Mulder) What the hell is this?

(MULDER does not answer.)



SCENE 23

(FBI headquarters. SCULLY, upset, enters command center for the operation and goes to SKINNER and the CIA AGENT.)

SCULLY: Director Skinner, youve got to get to Mulder. Youve got to find the bank that they hit..

SKINNER: Thats what were trying to do.

SCULLY: Agent Mulders life is in danger -- and anybody else who touches the currency at that location. Theyre putting the biotoxin on the money.

SKINNER: Weve got no way of contacting him  not without blowing his cover.

SCULLY: Youve got no choice.

CIA AGENT: We had surveillance tapes satellited to us -- There have been 27 robberies in seven eastern states, all this morning.

SKINNER: Theres been no sign of Mulder.

SCULLY: Well, hes got to be on there somewhere.

(SCULLY looks at several monitor freeze frames. One of them has MULDER in the Dracula mask.)



SCENE 24

(MULDER and HALEY are kneeling on the ground.)

BREMER: (to MULDER) Weve made some decisions.

(BREMER places leather pouch of keys on top of HALEYs head.)

BREMER: (to HALEY) Take it and get out of here. I dont want to see your face again. Go.

(HALEY gets up, gets in car and leaves.)

BREMER: (to MULDER) On your feet.

MULDER: I dont need a car. You can just call me a cab, thatd be fine.

BREMER: Lets go.

MULDER: Go where?

(FINGER BREAKING MAN roughly pulls MULDER to his feet.)

BREMER: Witnessing the murder of a federal agent will make these men an accessory to the crime.

MULDER: (to the FINGER BREAKING MAN) You hear that?

FINGER BREAKING MAN: I wouldnt miss it for the world.

(They walk a ways into what looks like used to be a greenhouse area.)

BREMER: (not looking at MULDER at first) Stop there. Down on your knees. Hands behind your back.

(After a look, MULDER complies. The FBM points his gun at MULDERs head. Gunshot. MULDER jerks forward. Slow motion camera. We see that BREMER has shot and killed the FBM.)

BREMER: Theres a car for you just over the rise. Head south till you get to the highway.

MULDER: Who are you?

BREMER: Go on. If they come out here and find us, theyll kill us both. Go.

(MULDER runs toward the car.)



SCENE 25

(MULDER pulls up in front of bank that was robbed.)

POLICE: Hey! Hold it ! Who are you?

MULDER: FBI. Whos in charge? Whos in charge? I need everybody out of the bank!

(SCULLY comes running toward him.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: The money! They sprayed the money.

SCULLY: We got here an hour ago before any of the funds were touched or transferred. The cash supply is being isolated. Its being locked down in the vault.

MULDER: How did you know it was this bank?

SCULLY: I recognized you from the surveillance tape.

MULDER: With the ?

SCULLY: Your finger.

(MULDER laughs shortly. SKINNER comes over .)

MULDER: August Bremer, or whatever his real name is  hes working with us.

SCULLY: Mulder, before you go any further you should know that the biotoxin they used may have come from government labs. Our government.

MULDER: Youre saying I was set up?

SKINNER: We have no definitive information to justify that position.

MULDER: I was being used? This whole operation? The people who died in that theatre?

CIA AGENT: (walking over) Agent Mulder. Our government is not in the business of killing innocent civilians.

MULDER: The hell they arent. Those were tests on us to be used on someone else.

CIA AGENT: Those bills have been analyzed. The money in the vault gave no readings. Theres absolutely no evidence of any biotoxins. So, before you climb on any bandwagon 

SCULLY: You knew about this all along. You knew about this the whole time!

MULDER: I want that money rechecked.

CIA AGENT: That money has been cleared. Its being used as evidence in a federal crime.

MULDER: That moneys as dirty as you are, isnt it. Isnt it?

CIA AGENT: Say that were true. Then what do you hope to accomplish , Agent Mulder, as a whistle-blower? To mobilize a civil rights action? To bring down the federal government? To do the very work that group you were a part of is so bent on doing? What do you want? Laws against those men, or laws protecting them?

MULDER: I want people to know the truth.

CIA AGENT: Well sometimes our job is to protect those people from knowing it. Excuse me.

(CIA AGENT walks away from SKINNER, MULDER, and SCULLY.)



SCENE 26

(Two lane road. Car that HALEY took begins weaving, then drifts off the road, horn blowing steadily. Interior shot of car shows HALEY dead against the wheel, his skin quickly being eaten away. Lose up of leather key pouch that BREMER gave him.)

SCENE 1
OAK BROOK, ILLINOIS

(Muzak playing in the VinylRight telemarketing office with about 100 telemarketers in Dilbertesque cubicles. GARY LAMBERT sits next to a young blond woman, NANCY AARONSON. GARY speaks into his headset.)

MAN: (voice) Hello.

GARY: (on headset phone) Hello. May I speak to Mr. Zachary Llosa?

LLOSA: (voice on phone) Yo-sa, not Losa. Speaking.

GARY: (on headset phone) Hello, Mr. Llosa. Im calling on behalf of the VinylRight corporation which would like to put a crisp $100 bill into you hand by 5:00 tomorrow evening.

LLOSA: (voice on phone) Im not really interested at this time.

GARY: (on headset phone, reading off of a monitor) Yes, sir. $100 all for allowing us the privilege of introducing you to VinylRight siding, The thousand-year siding that never needs painting or maintenance.

LLOSA: (voice on phone) Listen, Im not really interested.

GARY: (on headset phone) Manufactured in America from Space-Age polymers it beautifies while it protects, while it adds to the resale value of your home.

LLOSA: (voice on phone) Look, Im not interested. I have to go now. Sorry. I have to go. (hangs up)

(GARY dials another number, then hears insect sound. He looks suspiciously around, but doesnt see anything. SUPERVISOR stops near GARYs cubicle.)

SUPERVISOR: Yo, Gary. Dial and smile, Gary. See, if youre not smiling, they can hear it.

(SUPERVISOR walks away.)

NANCY: (quietly making fun of SUPERVISOR for GARY) If youre not smiling, they can hear it. Jerk. (into her headset.) Yes, Mr. Valenzuela. Im calling on behalf of the VinylRight Coporation. We would like to put a crisp $100 bill into your hands by 5:00 tomorrow evening .

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) Hello?

GARY: (on headset phone) Mrs. Edith Loach?

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) Yes, thats me.

GARY: (on headset phone) Hello, Mrs. Loach. Im calling on behalf of the VinylRight Corporation which would like to put a crisp $100 bill into your hand by 5:00 tomorrow evening.

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) You want to give me $100? Why?

(GARY stares in shock at shadow of a man sized insect creature in an office across the room.)

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) Hello? Did I win something?

GARY: (on headset phone, nervously) Yes, Maam. $100 All for allowing us the privilege of introducing you to VinylRight siding, the thousand-year siding that never needs painting or maintenance. Manufactured in America from

(Hissing insectizoid sound. Begins to see large insect creature moving between the cubicles.
No one else sees it.)

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) Hello?

GARY: (on headset phone, getting very agitated) Manufactured in America from Space-Age polymers. It beautifies while it protects. While it  While it.

(Hissing sound.)

ELDERLY WOMAN: (voice on GARYs phone) Hello? Hello?

GARY: (on headset phone, whispering) Mrs. Loach .. listen very carefully. Its here.

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
9:12 AM
(SKINNERs OFFICE)

SECRETARY: (voice on speaker) Sir, Agents Mulder and Scully are here.

SKINNER: Send them in.

(Door opens and MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: Agents have a seat.

(They sit.)

SKINNER: I need you to go to Chicago as soon as possible to perform a threat assessment.

SCULLY: A threat assessment for whom?

SKINNER: VinylRight. They make siding. Their telemarketing hub in Oakbrook was the focus of an anonymous audio-taped manifesto, one which threatened violence. Apparently, several years back they had an incident in another office  A disgruntled employee with a gun. They feel they cant be too careful.

MULDER: Why cant the Chicago field office take care of it?

SKINNER: Because I prefer you did.

MULDER: (challenging) Because the manifesto contains bizarre overtones  claims of a paranormal nature?

SKINNER: It speaks of a monster stalking employees. Your insight into such claims should aid in assessing the threat, if any, posed by this person.

MULDER: (sarcastically) Monsters. Im your boy.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are walking down hall from SKINNERs office.)

MULDER: I mustve done something to piss him off.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: Get stuck with this jerk-off assignment or have I finally reached that magic point in my career where every time somebody sees Bigfoot or the Virgin Mary on a tortilla I get called to offer my special insight on the matter? (rubs his forehead showing his still taped fingers)

SCULLY: Youre saying "I" a lot. I heard "we." Nor do I assume that this case is just a waste of our time.

MULDER: Not yours, anyway. Theres no reason both of us should go to Chicago. Ill take care of it.

SCULLY: Mulder 

MULDER: Im monster boy, right?



SCENE 3

(Chicago. MULDER is in PINCUS office listening to a tape.)

PINCUS: This was forwarded to us by a local radio station. Whoever sent it to them wanted them to play it over and over again 24 hours a day. They elected not to. (plays the tape)

GARYS VOICE ON TAPE: Attention, people of Illinois. This is a warning of the utmost urgency. At VinylRight 12340 Wabash Terrace in Oak Brook there is a monster, an evil one that preys on the people there, but they cant see it because it hides in the light. I see it. I know where to look. I cant be the only one. We all must hunt it down and kill it because if we dont  it will take us all.

(PINCUS stops the tape.)

MULDER: You recognize the voice?

PINCUS: We have 96 employees. Anyway, Im hoping its not one of our people though I dont know who else it would be.

MULDER: Your company had a violent incident in its recent history?

PINCUS: We have a plant in Kansas City. Back in 94 one of the warehouse guys came in with a gun, threatened everybody. I think it was over a woman.

MULDER: May I borrow the tape?

PINCUS: Keep it. So I know our home office has to call you guys for insurance reasons, but this is probably just a crank, right? Some guy making a joke.

MULDER: Well, its best to err on the side of caution. Can you hire security for the building?

PINCUS: If you think we need to. Im also conducting my own internal investigation  interviewing employees, seeing if theyre happy 

MULDER: Use you best judgement. Ill be in touch.

(MULDER leaves the office and dials his cell phone from the telemarketers room.)

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hi. Its me. I need you to check on something.

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) What?

MULDER: (on phone) Its a phrase, "Hiding in the light." Its on this tape that Im looking into.

SCULLY: (on phone) On the case thats a total waste of time?

MULDER: (on phone) Yes, and I didnt say that it wasnt. Uh, "To hide in the light" or "Hiding in the light"  some form of that. I think its in an old case file somewhere that I got hidden away.

SCULLY: (on phone) Which one? Theres hundreds.

MULDER: (on phone) Im not sure, but I appreciate it. (hangs up)

SCULLY: (to herself, not overjoyed) "Hiding in the light." (gets up to go look for the file)

(MULDER leaves the room. GARY and NANCY are at their cubicles. GARY stares at PINCUS office door.)

PINCUS: (voice over intercom) Nancy Aaronson, come to my office, please.

NANCY: (to GARY, rolling her eyes) Uh-oh. Now I did it. (starts to go)

GARY: Nancy 

NANCY: Yeah?

PINCUS: (voice over intercom) Nancy Aaronson, come to my office, please.

NANCY: What, Gary?

GARY: Dont.

NANCY: Dont what? Gary, I love you, buddy, but youre really, really weird.

(NANCY goes into PINCUS office. As she enters, Gary sees the shadow of and insect type of creature inside the office. Door closes. GARY hears NANCY scream. No one else does. He starts to go to PINCUS office, but the SUPERVISOR steps in front of him.)

SUPERVISOR: Dial and smile, Gary.

(GARY returns nervously to his cubicle.)

PINCUS: (voice over intercom) Mark Backus, come to my office, please. Mark Backus, come to my office, please.

(When NANCY comes out of PINCUS office and returns to her seat, from GARYs POV her eyes are whited over and she moves like a zombie. Any other POV she looks normal.)

NANCY: See, nothing to it. He just wants to say "hi" to everybody. Hes going alphabetically.

(GARY, panicked, runs out of the office.)

SUPERVISOR: Hey, Gary. Gary Lambert!



SCENE 4
FBI FIELD OFFICE
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

(MULDER is listening to the tape. While the tape is playing, the scene alternates between GARY preparing an assault rifle and MULDER taking notes.)

GARYS VOICE ON TAPE: .Wabash Terrace in Oakbrook, there is a monster .. an evil one that preys on the people there but they cant see it because it hides in the light. I see it. I know where to look. I cant be the only one. (MULDER rewinds)  urgency. At VinylRight, 12340 Wabash Terrace in Oakbrook, there is a monster .. an evil one that preys on the people there but they cant see it because it hides in the light. I see it. I know where to look. I cant be the only one. We all must hunt it down and kill it because if we dont  it will take us all.

(MULDERS NOTES: " to be taken seriously. Exactness of performance indicates deliberate mindset. Tape likely recorded many times till perfect. Paranoia. Exclusion.")

(MULDERs cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) "Hiding in the light." That was a phrase spoken by one Jerrold Resnick to a Lakeland, Florida police investigator on August 9, 1992.

MULDER: (on phone) What was he describing?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Mr. Resnick was a deacon of his local church and apparently he was concerned that there was an evil presence amongst his fellow parishioners and that he alone was aware of that fact.

MULDER: (on phone) He was trying to warn them?

SCULLY: (on phone) Not as such. He showed up for mass one Sunday with four handguns and he began wounding people saying, "The afflicted ones wouldnt bleed." He committed suicide a week later in his cell.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, at the risk of you telling me "I told you so" I think its time for you to get down here and help me.

SCULLY: (on phone) I told you so.

(MULDER hangs up.)



SCENE 5
12:14 PM

(MULDER walking through VinylRight office. It appears deserted.)

MULDER: Hello .. hello?

(He sees NANCY hiding behind a doorway.)

NANCY: (whispering inaudibly) Shh! Get down! Get down!

(MULDER hears GARY cock a rifle behind him.)

GARY: Who are you?

(MULDER slowly raises his hands.)



SCENE 6

(SCULLY drives up outside VinylRight building. Lots of police, crime scene.)

SCULLY: Whos the agent in charge?

AGENT: Agent Rice --- tall guy in the suit.

(SCULLY, showing her badge, goes up to AGENT RICE and the SWAT TEAM AGENT.)

SCULLY: Im Scully. Agent Mulders partner. What can you tell me?

AGENT RICE: Not much. TV news got the call. A mans voice told them we needed to broadcast a "stunning revelation." Since then we keep ringing the phones, but nobody answers.

SCULLY: Whos inside?

AGENT RICE: We cant be sure of a total. It happened over lunch hour, so it could have been worse. The lots only got 18 cars. Ones a rental registered to Agent Mulder.

SWAT AGENT: Were about to try him on his cell phone.

SCULLY: No. Not until we get a clear idea of the situation.

SWAT AGENT: Theres a small cafeteria in the building. We think our guys got everyone barricaded there, he couldnt have picked a better spot  one door, no windows. Were not going to get a clear idea of the situation unless someone in there talks to us.

SCULLY: If you make a phone call right now, it could compromise Agent Mulder. Sir, we need to find another way.

(Inside the building. VinylRight cafeteria. GARY holds a gun on the employees and MULDER. They are on their knees, hands behind their head. GARY straps two people to the exit doors. PINCUS, NANCY, and MARK BACKUS and another men are kneeling apart from the others. Some employees are crying.)

GARY: Move! Okay  come on. Now, get down. Down. Everybody stop crying! Just shut up! Everybody needs to be afraid of him. (indicates PINCUS) Hes the one thats out to get you. Im protecting you.

NANCY: Gary, what are you talking about?

GARY: Shut up! Im not addressing you! Im addressing the actual people over here, okay? Im not talking to you, or you or you! (refers to PINCUS, NANCY, and another man.)

MULDER: Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus, Gary? Id really like to hear what you have to say.

GARY: Who are you, anyway?

MULDER: My name is Mulder.

GARY: You said that already. What are you doing here?

MULDER: Applying for a job.

GARY: (snickering) Oh, man  did you come to the wrong place.

MULDER: I get that. Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus, Gary?

GARY: Because hes a monster  Only you cant see that because hes clouded all your minds but he means to take us all one by one  harvest our souls 

(MULDER unbuttons his jacket while GARYs back is turned.)

GARY: make us into zombies robots made out of meat. (cocks rifle)

PINCUS: Oh, God almighty 

MULDER: Gary, I want to believe that youre protecting us, but, uh, Im kind of afraid of that rifle. It makes it hard for us actual people to concentrate on what youre saying.

GARY: (to MULDER) Why are you talking to me like Im a three-year-old? Dont act like you understand what Im talking about, because you dont  but you will.

(GARY turns away. MULDER unsnaps his holster. GARY almost catches him. GARY hears something on the roof and aims the rifle at the ceiling.)

GARY: Shhh! Everybody hold their breath. (Sees plaster falling out of ceiling vent.) Oh, you sons of bitches.

(GARY grabs NANCY and begins firing at the ceiling.)

NANCY: Gary, what are you doing?

MULDER: Gary!

(Outside, SCULLY and AGENT RICE duck behind a car at sound of gunshots.)

SWAT AGENT: Everybody hold your fire! Whats going on?

AGENT ON RADIO: (voice) Hes shooting the ceiling. Sounds like an AK.

AGENT RICE: We got to find out what the hells going on in that building. Im calling your partner.

SCULLY: No. If it was safe to do so he would have called us already.

AGENT RICE: Agent Scully, we dont have a lot of options here.

(SCULLY very worried.)

(Inside, GARY stops firing. His back is to MULDER, but just as MULDER reaches for his own gun, his cell phone rings. GARY turns the gun on MULDER.)

MULDER: Its just my cell phone. Let me get it.

GARY: Put your hands behind your head.

(GARY sees MULDERs gun. He takes out MULDERs gun and hits MULDER across the face, splitting his lower lip. BACKUS attacks GARY from behind. GARY turns, shoots and kills BACKUS. Lots of crying from other employees. Cell phone keeps ringing. GARY pulls out MULDERs badge. MULDERs expression clearly says "Im screwed." GARY looks at the badge and throws it to the floor.)

GARY: FBI? You happy now? You want to mess with me some more?

(GARY answers MULDERs phone.)

AGENT RICE: (on phone, voice) Hello. Is anybody on the line? We heard gunfire. Is everyone all right?

GARY: (on phone) I just shot a zombie. Everybody thinks I killed him, but I didnt.

AGENT RICE: (on phone, outside) Who am I speaking to?

GARY: (on phone) The guy thats going to start killing actual people if you dont put me on the damn TV! (hangs up)

OUTSIDE:
AGENT RICE: (to SCULLY) I think he just shot a hostage.

SCULLY: (calm, but worried) Who?

AGENT RICE: Hes still asking for his 15 minutes of fame.

SCULLY: Give it to him.

INSIDE:
(Two hostages drag BACKUS body away.)

GARY: Get it out of sight. You want to know why it jumped me like that?

MULDER: Its not an it, Gary. Its a he. Its a man you just killed. What was his name?

MAN: Mark Backus.

GARY: Wrong! It stopped being Mark Backus when he turned it into a zombie (looks at PINCUS)  and then he instructed it by means of mental telepathy to attack me  and so I shot it. I had no choice .. but it doesnt matter because it was already dead. He wants us all like that  insects, not people .. mindless drones. He wants to take away who we are  to control us  so well be his eyes and ears and spy on each other and help him do his dirty work.

PINCUS: Gary, if Im the monster, what do you need all these people for? Why dont you just let them all go?

GARY: You just wait till I put you on TV. Then theyll see what you are.

(Cell phone rings again.)

MULDER: Answer the phone, Gary.

GARY: (answering phone) Dial and smile.

AGENT RICE: (on phone, voice) Okay. Were sending you that cameraman -- Now just stay cool.

GARY: (on phone) Finally. Lets do it.

(Outside, FBI has set up fake newsbroadcast for GARY)

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) Warren, that is exactly what were hearing.

GARY: (to hostages) All you people put your butts against the door. Hurry it up! Go!

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) . Going on here at Oak Brook Corporate 

GARY: (to hostages) You, get over by the counter. Move it!

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset)  to an actual live feed from the .

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) .. that this person or people may have something important to say.

(Cameraman is now in the kitchen. Outside on a monitor, SCULLY sees MULDER, hands still behind his head, looking into the camera. GARY holds the rifle on MULDER.)

GARY: (to camera, referring to MULDER) You see whos going to get hurt if you bust down this door?

(SCULLY very concerned.)

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) . communication between the police and the people inside the building.

SCULLY: Is he getting this?

AGENT RICE: Closed circuits bouncing it back into the building. He thinks hes going to be a star. (to cameraman, GARY cant hear) All right. Show us the room.

(Inside, Camera begins to pan around the room.)

GARY: (voice) What are you doing?

CAMERAMAN: (voice) Hold on, my battery cable is twisted.

GARY: (voice) Well untwist it!

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) As to whether anybody was injured

AGENT RICE: (outside, looking at monitor) There. The exterior wall is clear. Entry team into position.

(Armored assault vehicle drives up into position.)

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) It sounded rapid  very rapid bursts. What we do know, however is that the police and the swat team on hand

(SCULLY watches GARY and MULDER on the monitor.)

GARY: (to MULDER) Lie down on the floor. Do it.

(MULDER complies.)

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset) did not return fire. Warren, Im getting a signal that the cameraman is in place 

GARY: All right. Put me on.

FAKE ANCHORWOMAN: (outside, on headset)  and were about to switch to our live feed inside  Yes here it is. Here we go.

GARY: (clears his throat nervously, holds his rifle like a soldier) People of America  A monster walks among you. (to cameraman) Go. Pan over. Get up.

(Camera pans over to show PINCUS getting up off the floor.)

GARY: (raising gun) Now, Ill show it to you .

(MULDER steps between PINCUS and GARY.)

MULDER: No, Gary.

GARY: Get out of the way.

MULDER: Dont do this.

GARY: Get out of the way!

MULDER: Dont do this, Gary.

(Lights go out.)

GARY: Get out of the way!

MULDER: Put down the rifle.

GARY: Get out of the way, now!

(Insect sounds. MULDER hears them, too.)

GARY: There. Look at it. Look at it!

(MULDER turns and instead of PINCUS, he sees the insect creature. MULDER stares in shock, then turns back to GARY.)

GARY: See?

(Rumbling sound. FBI assault vehicle bursts through the wall. People scream. SWAT team runs in, and shoots Gary. Lots of screaming and crying. MULDER stares at PINCUS for a moment, then kneels down beside the dying GARY.)

GARY: (softly) Now, you know.



SCENE 7

(Later, a body bag is zipped. SCULLY comes up to MULDER and takes his arm.)

SCULLY: (gently) You look exhausted.

MULDER: No, Im fine.

SCULLY: Agent Rice has the situation in hand. Lets get you out of here. Mulder?

(MULDER goes over to PINCUS who is getting his head bandaged.)

PINCUS: I cant begin to thank you. I owe you my life. We all do.

MULDER: Do you have any idea why he fixated on you the way he did?

PINCUS: No, not at all. I feel like I barely even know the man. I mean, I try to be a good guy to work for.

MULDER: You mentioned another incident with another employee at a plant in Kansas City in 1994.

PINCUS: Yes.

MULDER: Were you at that plant at that time?

PINCUS: Well, I wasnt there when it happened, but yeah. Did I mention that?

(MULDER shakes his head "No." )

MULDER: What about Lakeland, Florida. Have you ever lived there?

PINCUS: Ive been there. I have relatives there. Was there anything else?

SCULLY: Uh, no, Mr. Pincus. Thank you very much for your patience.

(PINCUS leaves.)

SCULLY: (to Mulder) Whats going on?

MULDER: (walking away from her) I dont know.

(SCULLY worried, watches him.)



SCENE 8

(X-files office. MULDER drawing red lines on a map connecting cities. Writes date 5/10/98. SCULLY enters. She is surprised to see MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, why didnt you take the day off?

MULDER: Close the door. There was a reason the phrase "hiding in the light" seemed so familiar to me. I found it or variations of it in five other X-Files. "Hiding in plain view" "Hiding in the open" "Lurking in the open." All to describe some sort of manifestation of evil which goes unnoticed be everyone except the claimant in each case.

SCULLY: Have you slept?

MULDER: Seven cities in all dating back ten years. VinylRight has offices within 50 miles of 4 of those cities. Greg Pincus has worked for VinylRight for ten years.

SCULLY: What exactly is it you think you have here?

MULDER: What if Gary Lambert was right?

SCULLY: Mulder, youre not serious.

MULDER: Just bear with me for a moment. What if such a creature existed that could camouflage itself by clouding the minds of its victims? There are antecedents for it in nature. In the insect world, mantids are said to hypnotize their prey.

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: What if it could induce a visual hallucination  a sort of temporary conversion disorder?

SCULLY: Well, what youre describing would be more like some kind of a visual agnosia, an inability to recognize whats before ones eyes.

MULDER: Only Gary Lambert could see through it somehow, as could the others  maybe because of some heightened adrenaline level of maybe just because he knew where to look somehow.

SCULLY: Mulder, he was disturbed.

MULDER: Yeah, but did he see it because he was disturbed, or was he disturbed because he saw it?

SCULLY: He was mentally ill. This monster was a sick fantasy  a product of his dementia.

MULDER: I saw it, too. (worried, really asking her) Does that make me disturbed? Demented? Does that make me sick, too?

SCULLY: (pauses before answering) No. No, I mean, this  this kind of thing is not uncommon. You  you went through a terrible ordeal and sometimes people in close associations under tense conditions, the delusions of one can be passed on to the other.

MULDER: Folie A Deux? Its not that, Scully. Its not Helsinki Syndrome either. What I saw was real, and there may be a way to prove it.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: Lambert pointed out certain individuals he said had been victimized by Pincus, turned into zombies. The man he shot, Backus was one of them. If you would autopsy the body 

SCULLY: No. No, absolutely not.

MULDER: Scully, if this is all in my mind I would be very grateful if you would prove that.

SCULLY: Mulder, I am not going to serve the delusions of Gary Lambert, a madman, by giving credence to them.

MULDER: Then Ill prove it without you. (gets up to leave the office)

SCULLY: Mulder 

(MULDER goes out the door.)



SCENE 9
GARY LAMBERT RESIDENCE
OAK BROOK, ILLINOIS

(MULDER and AGENT RICE go up to the house.)

AGENT RICE: So, what are we looking for?

MULDER: Ill know it when I see it.

(They find a map on the wall, same as MULDERs, lines drawn on it, cities marked.)

AGENT RICE: Whats this about?

MULDER: Lambert was tracking his bosss movements over the years.

AGENT RICE: Stalking him.

MULDER: Gathering evidence.

(AGENT RICE is disturbed by MULDERs odd behavior. MULDER looks out the window and sees NANCY as a zombie standing in the yard. MULDER runs outside. AGENT RICE follows..)

AGENT RICE: What is it?

(Yard is empty.)

MULDER: Did you see her? You see where she went?

AGENT RICE: Who? You mind telling me whats going on here?

(A car pulls away quickly. MULDER starts to run after it, then stops. PINCUS is driving. NANCY is passenger. They look normal but stare straight ahead.)



SCENE 10

(SKINNERs office. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Sir? You wanted to see me?

SKINNER: Yes. I was hoping you could give me some insight into Agent Mulders recent behavior.

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: Why is he back in Illinois? I thought that case was closed.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder believes that there may be a connection between the Oak Brook incident and several other cases.

SKINNER: But you elected not to join him. The Chicago field office has been in contact with him. They describe his behavior as being erratic.

SCULLY: To the best of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is currently working on a legitimate investigation. I will join him in Illinois immediately.

SKINNER: Dont you have an autopsy to do first? (SCULLY stares at him) This body Mulder sent to Quantico  Mark Backus, the shooting victim. Youre scheduled to do an examination.
Or didnt you know that?

SCULLY: Ill get right on it, sir. (starts to leave)

SKINNER: I there something you want to tell me, Scully?

SCULLY: (looks back at him) No, sir.

(SCULLY exits. SKINNER looks concerned.)



SCENE 11
FBI FORENSIC PATHOLOGY LAB
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(SCULLY and LAB GUY with BACKUS body.)

SCULLY: Lets start with the photos. In fact, lets just do photos. External exam only.

LAB GUY: This guy came a long way just to have his picture taken.

SCULLY: Knock yourself out.

(LAB GUY begins taking pictures as SCULLY turns away and dials her cell phone.)

LAB GUY: Case number 98-6522, Mark Backus 45-year-old Caucasian male. There are three one centimeter gunshot entry wounds on the left anterior chest wall with some burn stippling present.

SCULLY: (phone still ringing) Come on, Mulder.

LAB GUY: Judging from the corpses resolved rigor and fixed lividity as well as the decompositional bloating Id place the time of death between 48 and 72 hours.

SCULLY: (turning, surprised) No. This man died late yesterday afternoon.

LAB GUY: Are you sure?

SCULLY: Absolutely.

LAB GUY: Sure looks to me like hes been dead longer than that.

(Body of MARK BACKUS does look quite decayed.)



SCENE 12

(Night. Outside the house of another employee, GRETCHEN STARNS. PINCUS gets out of his car and goes around to the back of the house. MULDER drives up and follows him. No sign of PINCUS. MULDER stands on patio table and looks in a window. He sees GRETCHEN sitting on her couch watching an old Shirley Temple movie. Insect noises. MULDER sees the insect creature moving behind her. MULDER breaks the window. She screams. MULDER runs around to the front and kicks in the door. He sees GRETCHEN sitting still. Shes a zombie. Insect creature skitters on ceiling behind MULDER, he turns, but he doesnt see it. Looking out a window, he sees it climb the wall to the roof and out of sight.)



SCENE 13

(Next day. PINCUS office. GRETCHEN is being interviewed by SKINNER, MULDER and PINCUS.)

GRETCHEN: Suddenly, I became aware of this  this presence  and I could feel it creeping toward me. It was terrifying. And the next thing I knew (looks at MULDER accusingly)  this madmans inside my house. He breaks my window, kicks in the door and the whole time, hes screaming about monsters -- I mean even worse than Gary.

SKINNER: Miss Starns, I apologize for this incident. I assure you it will receive my utmost attention.

PINCUS: Why dont you take the rest of the week, Gretchen?

GRETCHEN: Thank you, Mr. Pincus. (looks again at MULDER) That man has no business carrying a gun, you ask me. (she leaves)

MULDER: (to PINCUS) You got to her, too, didnt you?

SKINNER: Agent Mulder 

MULDER: I was too late. You changed her somehow. You infected her.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, think very carefully about the next words that come out of your mouth. (to PINCUS) Once again, I apologize.

PINCUS: Theres no need. Im well aware of the stress Agent Mulder has been under and Im, uh, well, I still consider him a hero which is why I want to handle this privately.

SKINNER: We appreciate that.

PINCUS: For my part Im happy to let this entire matter drop. Im sure I can persuade Miss Starns to do the same, provided Agent Mulder is amenable.

MULDER: You dont see whats going on here.

SKINNER: (looking at MULDER directly) Im afraid I do.

MULDER: (to PINCUS) Lambert knew your secret. He knew you were sucking the humanity out of these people, feeding on them!

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, thats enough! I dont want to hear another word out of you. If you care about your career, youll knock this crap off and apologize to this man because I will not 

(SKINNER continues to yell, but the sound of his voice fades. MULDER stares at PINCUS. He sees the insect creature.)

MULDER: (drawing his gun and pushing SKINNER out of the way) Get out of the way!

(SKINNER grabs MULDER and holds him down on the desk. MULDER struggles.)

MULDER: Look at it!

SKINNER: (holding MULDER down) Stop!

MULDER: (drops gun) Look at it! Look at it!

SKINNER: Relax! Stop struggling! Stop it!

(MULDER weakly gives up and stops struggling.)



SCENE 14
CALUMET MERCY HOSPITAL
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

(MULDER is strapped down to a hospital bed. SCULLY pushes back the curtain and holds his hand which is strapped to the bed rail. SCULLY looks at him sadly.)

MULDER: Five years together, Scully. You must have seen this coming. (laughs softly) Did you examine Backus body? What did you find?

SCULLY: More or less what we thought wed find.

MULDER: "More or less?" What is that supposed to mean?

SCULLY: The body showed signs of decomposition beyond what we expected to find which, in and of itself means nothing, really. Time of death is notoriously hard to quantify.

MULDER: Or, that Lambert was telling the truth and that man was dead before he was gunned down.

SCULLY: No, Mulder

MULDER: Scully .. When that monster, Pincus  whatever the hell you want to call it  when he attacked that woman last night he did something to the back of her neck. H-he bit her there, or he injected something in there. Theres got to be evidence of that. You got to check for that.

SCULLY: Mulder, the case is over. Theres no more evidence to be gathered. Theres only my hope that youll be able to see past this delusion.

MULDER: (desperate) *You* have to be willing to see.

SCULLY: I wish it were that simple.

MULDER: Scully, you *have* to believe me. Nobody else on this whole damn planet does or ever will. Youre my one in  five billion.

(They look at each other, SCULLY still holding his hand.)



SCENE 15

(Autopsy lab at Quantico.)

LAB GUY: Well, you just made it. I was about to ship him. Full autopsy this time?

SCULLY: No. Lets flip him.

LAB GUY: Flip him over?

SCULLY: Yep. Give me a hand.

(SCULLY and the LAB GUY turn the body of MARK BACKUS over. SCULLY looks at the back of his neck, then shaves it with clippers. She sees three small puncture marks.)



SCENE 16

(Night. MULDERs hospital room. MULDER still strapped to the bed. NURSE prepares a LARGE! injection.)

MULDER: (innocently) We can do without these, huh? What do you say?

NURSE: (smiles) Sorry.

(MULDER winces as she gives him the injection.)

NURSE: There we go. (closes the bed curtain) Sleep tight. Dont let the bed bugs bite.

(NURSE turns off light and leaves the room. MULDER starts to relax, then hears insect sounds. Through the curtain he sees the shadow of the insect creature in the window)

MULDER: Nurse. Nurse! Nurse! Its here! Nurse! Its here! (NURSE opens the curtain.)
Its here! Its at the window!

NURSE: Whats here?

MULDER: (trying to sound calm and rational) There is something  there is something at the window and its trying to get in here. Please unstrap me so that I can stop it.

NURSE: Were three floors up. Theres nothing at the window.

MULDER: Undo my straps so I can check.

NURSE: (turning on light) I can show you 

MULDER: No, dont! No! Just please ! Please.

NURSE: See? (taps closed window) Nothings going to get you.

MULDER: Okay. Just, uh  just untie me anyway please.

(NURSE looking spooky unlocks and opens window.)

MULDER: What are you doing?

NURSE: (sounding spooky) You just need some fresh air.

(As MULDER stares at her, NURSE tightens the straps holding MULDER and closes the curtain again.)

NURSE: I cant be running in here all night, okay?

(Door closes as the NURSE leaves. Insect sounds begin again. MULDER begins to panic as insect creature crawls in his window and across the ceiling.)

MULDER: (yelling) Help! Somebody help!

(At NURSEs station down the hall SCULLY is talking to the NURSE.)

NURSE: Im very sorry, but it is after hours and Mr. Mulder is resting. Ill have to ask you to come back in the morning.

SCULLY: (showing her badge) Ive come a long way, and I know he wants to see me, so what do you say?

NURSE: Im sorry. Really. Its hospital policy.

(SCULLY stares at the NURSE, suddenly seeing her as a zombie. SCULLY runs down the hall, gun out, and kicks open MULDERs door. She sees insect creature attacking MULDER in the dark room.)

MULDER: Help! Help! Help!

(SCULLY shoots at the insect creature next to MULDER. It jumps away and crashes through the window as she shoots it again. She looks out the window, but sees no sign of it. She looks back at MULDER.)



SCENE 17

(SKINNERs office. SCULLY alone with SKINNER.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, I have to say Im at a bit of a loss here. Do I infer correctly from this that you believe theres some  merit to Agent Mulders claims?

SCULLY: I believe that Agent Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty. Aside from that belief, I can only present to you the few hard facts that Ive been able to gather. That, as per Agent Mulders assertions a toxin has been found to have been injected into the spine of the shooting victim, Mark Backus. As of yet, weve been unable to identify it. Furthermore, Gregory Pincus has apparently disappeared without a trace along with half a dozen other key witnesses integral to this investigation  among them, Agent Mulders nurse at the hospital and several VinylRight employees.

SKINNER: Men and women described by Mulder as zombies.

SCULLY: (sighs) I can personally vouch for the fact that there was an intruder in Agent Mulders hospital room.

SKINNER: Describe this intruder.

SCULLY: (pause) It was dark.

SKINNER: You must have gotten a glimpse. What did you see?

(Later, SCULLY joins MULDER at the elevator.)

MULDER: What did you tell him?

SCULLY: The truth  as well as I under stand it.

MULDER: Which is?

(They enter elevator.)

SCULLY: Folie A Deux. A madness shared by two.

(Elevator doors close.)



SCENE 18
CAMDENTON, MISSOURI

(Another telemarketing office. Camera pans across room to young male employees on headset.)

YOUNG EMPLOYEE: (on headset phone, nervous) Mr. Jaycox, may I take a few moments to tell you about the advantages of WeatherRight replacement windows? They keep down high heating and cooling costs. (he hears insect sounds) They beautify  They beautify and add value to your home as well as . (he is very agitated, whispering now) Mr. Jaycox  Its here!

[THE END]

                                THE END


SCENE 1
VANCOUVER
BRITISH COLUMBIA

(Chess tournament underway. Huge arena is filled with thousands of quiet observers as a RUSSIAN MAN and a 12-year-old American boy, GIBSON PRAISE, play. They hit the timer after each move.)

CUT TO:
(GUNMAN walks across catwalk above the players and begins to assemble gun.)

CUT TO:
(The boy, GIBSON, looks startled, like he hears something. Garbled voices sound as he scans the crowd, nervously. GIBSON looks up and behind him.)

CUT TO:
(Gun still being assembled.)

CUT TO:
(GIBSON turns back to the game.)

CUT TO:
(Rifle sights are aimed first at the RUSSIAN MAN, then at the boy, GIBSON.)

CUT TO:
(RUSSIAN MAN moves a piece.)

CUT TO:
(GUNMANs finger on the trigger.)

CUT TO:
(GIBSON stands up to reach and move his queen.)

GIBSON: Checkmate.

(GIBSON sits back down, leaning back as he does. GUNSHOT. Bullet hits RUSSIAN MAN in the chest, and he falls out of his chair knocking the chessboard off the table. Boy is surrounded by people. Crowd goes wild, screaming and running. GUNMAN disassembles his rifle quickly and leaves. GIBSON looks up to where the GUNMAN was.)

SCENE 2
LAURENTIAN MOUNTAINS
QUEBEC, CANADA
6:39 AM
(Two men silently parachute into a woodsy snow-covered area. Their faces are hidden behind ski masks. They approach a cabin. Inside the cabin a teakettle whistles. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN turns off the gas burner. He closes his robe. There is a scar on his chest. Looks like heart surgery, could be a gunshot wound. He hears an alarm bell go off, probably triggered by the men outside. Men slowly approach the cabin, guns out. They split up. FIRST MAN slowly opens the front door. He is killed by a single gunshot, and falls back into the snow. SECOND MAN runs around and sees his partner dead. He sees bloody footprints in the snow. He follows them at a run.)

CUT TO:
(CSM running through the woods pursued by SECOND MAN. SECOND MAN fires at CSM and misses. CSM stops and looks up at the man chasing him. KRYCEK, the SECOND MAN, pulls off his ski mask. He aims his gun at CSM.)

CSM: Go on! Take your shot, Alex!

KRYCEK: Right there! I was  sent to bring you back.



SCENE 3
X-FILES OFFICE, WASHINGTON, DC

(Pan over wall next to MULDERs desk. Lots of newspaper clippings, including Duane Barry, MULDERs "I Want to Believe" poster with a post-it note on the UFO "You are here" , and  a picture of MULDER and SCULLY standing in a doorway looking at some papers. SKINNER looks at the picture. He is holding a few file folders. MULDER enters. He is surprised to see SKINNER.)

MULDER: Wow, you know youre going places in the Bureau when the Assistant Director tidies up your office for you. Whats up?

SKINNER: I was just, uh  looking.

MULDER: For anything special?

SKINNER: I came down to ask you something. I, uh, I guess I was nosing around  wondering about you -- your, uh, long-term plans.

MULDER: My long term plans? You got them right there in your hands.

(MULDER takes the files from SKINNER and crosses to a file cabinet.)

SKINNER: What do you hope to find? I mean, in the end.

MULDER: Whatever I hope to find is in here. And maybe Ill know it when I find it. Is that what you came to ask me?

SKINNER: No. Theres a case  nothing Id send you normally  a murder  an assassination of a Russian chess player. The shooter is former National Security Agency  one of ours. Its got a lot of people upset. This kid, Jeffery Spender  Special Agent Spender  hes been given the case. Hes running it.

MULDER: You give it to him?

SKINNER: No. It came as an order from somewhere outside the Bureau. His teams assembled upstairs right now. He was very specific that you be excluded.

(MULDER slowly grins mischievously.)



SCENE 4
FBI BRIEFING ROOM

(SPENDER is showing slow motion video of the RUSSIAN MAN getting shot. Several agents, including SCULLY, listen.)

SPENDER: Using a weapon registered to a US intelligence agency, the shooter fired one kill shot at Anatole Klebanow before being captured without incident a short distance from the scene. .

(MULDER and SKINNER enter. SCULLY turns to look up at MULDER.)

SPENDER: No motive has been established nor has the shooter offered up a statement or accomplice.

(SPENDER sees MULDER and stops.)

MULDER: (Mr. Congeniality) Please continue.

SPENDER: (not happy) The trajectory of the kill shot suggests the shooter acted alone, but we cannot yet rule out an accomplice or conspiracy. A single bullet was fired from a catwalk at a steep angle striking the target just right of the solar plexus.

MULDER: Im  sorry, can you rewind the tape? Please. Ill tell you where. Just take it back?

SPENDER: Let me get through this. If you have any questions, we can talk later.

MULDER: I dont have any questions. No. I just think youre wrong.

SCULLY: (quietly) Mulder  what are you doing?

MULDER: I dont think the Russian was the target. I think it was his opponent.

SPENDER: His opponent, Agent Mulder, was a twelve year old boy.

MULDER: And a good chess player. Here, let me show you his best move, if youll just take it back.

(SPENDER reluctantly rewinds.)

MULDER: Okay, stop it there. Look what the kid does right here, right before the kill shot. Play. Do you see what he does? He just pushes back. You see that?

SPENDER: He just completed a checkmate. Hes pushing back because the games over.

MULDER: You described a steep trajectory for the kill shot. If the kid doesnt push back at that precise moment he catches the bullet in the back of the neck, not the Russian.

SPENDER: May we move on here?

(A woman, tall, attractive, dark hair, mid thirties, AGENT DIANA FOWLEY is sitting across the room.)

DIANA: I think Agent Mulder is right. Looks like the boy sensed the shooter precognitively . If you rewind the tape youll see it.

(MULDER looks at DIANA, surprised.)

SPENDER: Theres no way. Its impossible.

SKINNER: Just rewind the tape so we can all see for ourselves.

(SPENDER obeys SKINNER, this time rewinding to the point where the boy looks up and behind him. SPENDER and MULDER look at one another, then MULDER and DIANA share a look.)



SCENE 5
NIGHT

(Outside under a bridge. KRYCEK and CSM approach the ELDERS including WELL MANICURED MAN.)

CSM: You look surprised. Is it that Im here or that Im alive?

FIRST ELDER: When we heard youd been shot, wed assumed the worst.

SECOND ELDER: There were reports you lost too much blood to have survived.

CSM: Obviously, you underestimated me. More obviously you overestimated the man you sent to do the job.

(KRYCEK looks uncomfortable.)

CSM: (lights a cigarette) Well, lets say all is forgiven. Now, you have a job for me.

WMM: Theres been an incident  an unfortunate mistake.

CSM: Yes, Ive seen. Ive heard. Ive read.

THIRD ELDER: The boy is a problem to us.

CSM: What would you like me to do  Shoot him dead  splatter his brains?

WMM: Dear God 

CSM: Whats the matter? Does this sort of business offend you?

FIRST ELDER: Its in your interest  as in ours.

CSM: You think you know my interests?

FIRST ELDER: Can we count on you?

CSM: (pause) Yes.

(CSM walks away)



SCENE 6

(Interior car. MULDER driving, SCULLY passenger, DIANA in back seat.)

SCULLY: How long have you been with the Bureau, Agent Fowley?

DIANA: Since 91. I took an assignment in Europe after the wall came down when the director stepped up foreign terrorism concerns.

SCULLY: And they brought you on this because of a terrorism angle?

DIANA: No. I, uh, I requested a reassignment. There were things at home I decided I wanted to get back to.

(MULDER and DIANA make eye contact in the rearview mirror. SCULLY doesnt notice.)

SCULLY: 1991. (to MULDER) Thats about when you started work on the X-Files.

MULDER: More or less, yeah.

(MULDER and DIANA look at each other again.)



SCENE 7
INGET MURRAY
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
GAITHERSBURG, MARYLAND

(GIBSON is watching THE SIMPSONS on TV.)

HOMER SIMPSON: (placing gun on table) Uh... I'd better just put it down.
(gunshot flings a knife into a picture of Marge)
LISA SIMPSON: No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool.
MARGE SIMPSON: Homer, I think you'd agree...

(MULDER, SCULLY, and DIANA enter. MULDER kneels down beside GIBSON.)

MULDER: Hi. My name is Fox. This is Dana and Diana. How are you doing?

GIBSON: I dont mind it here. They get all the good TV shows. Where I live, in the Philippines all we get is Baywatch.

(MULDER looks back at the two women, then back to GIBSON.)

MULDER: Whats wrong with Baywatch?

(GIBSON looks closely at MULDER.)

GIBSON: Youve got a dirty mind.

(MULDER doesnt quite know what to say. Looks at Scully.)

SCULLY: (suppressing a smile) Your parents are going to pick you up on Friday, Gibson, to take you back home.

GIBSON: (to MULDER) I dont want to play any chess.

MULDER: How do you know I want to?

GIBSON: Cause you got that cheapo chess computer in your hand.

(MULDER has indeed been hiding an electronic chess game under his arm.)

MULDER: Its not so cheap. Dont you want to see how fast you can
beat it?

GIBSON: No.

MULDER: Maybe because you cant.

(MULDER turns off TV. GIBSON doesnt answer.)

MULDER: Im right, arent I? You know what Im talking about. You knew the moment I came in. Thats how you win, isnt it  how you know what your opponents going to do? You get inside his head. You read his thoughts. Thats how you knew that man was going to shoot you  isnt it?

GIBSON: I know whats on your mind. I know youre thinking about one of the girls you brought.

MULDER: Oh?

(SCULLY raises an eyebrow, DIANA gives a half smile.)

GIBSON: One of thems thinking about you.

(SCULLY looks uncomfortable, DIANA interested.)

DIANA: Which one?

(GIBSON looks closely at MULDER.)

GIBSON: He doesnt want me to say.

(MULDER chuckles VERY uncomfortably. He stands and faces the two women.)

MULDER: This kids going to need round-the-clock protection.

(MULDER quickly goes out into the hall. SCULLY follows.)

SCULLY: Mulder  (he turns to her) What was that all about?

MULDER: The kids no chess master. Under controlled conditions, I could probably beat him.

SCULLY: Mulder, hes recognized internationally as a prodigy. Hes beaten Grand Masters.

MULDER: With the most unfair advantage. What hes doing amounts to a kind of parlor magic trick.

SCULLY: Mulder, he was goofing on you. He was playing along. Youre positing that this kid can read minds.

MULDER: Weve seen a number of these cases before, Scully.

SCULLY: We have seen cases, Mulder, of fakers and lucky guessers but no one that has ever been able to stand up to any kind of rigorous testing. (DIANA comes out of the room and watches MULDER and SCULLY.) No one who has gone so far as to claim that they can zero in on the mind of one person in a crowd of thousands.

MULDER: Maybe thats why they want him dead.

SCULLY: Who? Who are you talking about?

MULDER: Im not the mind reader.

SCULLY: Say that what youre suggesting were even possible, whod want to kill a kid whose abilities would offer you the ultimate advantage  I mean in business, in war, in anything?

DIANA: Maybe somebody whose business is in keeping secrets.

MULDER: Well, lets test him. I think the kid will stand up. Lets run a brain scan and a psych evaluation on him. (looking away) You know what to do, Diana.

(MULDER walks away down the hall. SCULLY and DIANA watch him go.)

SCULLY: So, you two know each other?

DIANA: It was a long time ago.

(SCULLY watches DIANA walk away.)



SCENE 8
FEDERAL DETENTION CENTER
FT. MARLENE, MARYLAND

(SPENDER comes out of a cell and closes the door. MULDER approaches him.)

SPENDER: What are you doing here?

MULDER: I want to talk to the shooter.

SPENDER: Ive just spent the last six hours talking with him. Hes not been what I would call forthcoming.

MULDER: (reaching for the door) Okay. Let me see what I can do.

SPENDER: (stopping him) I prefer you stay out of there. In fact, I prefer you stay out of this thing altogether.

MULDER: When I first met you I figured you were just ambitious. This morning, my opinion changed. I thought you were arrogant. Now Im beginning to wonder what youre protecting.

SPENDER: Im just trying to run this right, not like some ridiculous paranormal free-for-all.

MULDER: Youre insulting me when you should be taking notes. Somehow, you got the big assignment but just because youre wearing the suit doesnt mean it fits. Youre lucky youre not defusing some international incident kissing serious Russian ass and sending a lot of agents barking down a lot of bad leads. Now, the kid is the key to this and the shooter knows why. Excuse me.

(MULDER enters the cell followed by SPENDER. The GUNMAN sits casually on the bed, hand resting on his face.)

MULDER: What does it take to kill a kid? Money? Or just evil stupidity?

GUNMAN: I didnt kill a kid.

MULDER: No  Thanks to the kid.

GUNMAN: Want to talk about heartlessness? Your squeaky friend there (indicates SPENDER )  hasnt given me any food or water for what  16 hours?

MULDER: I wont tolerate that. Spender, you got to get this guy some food. Come on.

(SPENDER stares at MULDER a moment with hatred, then goes out of the cell.)

GUNMAN: Ive got nothing to say.

MULDER: Yeah  I read your bio. Youve been trained. Special Forces. You were in Grenada, Zaire. You were inside Saddams palace with a hit squad when they started raining bombs down over it yet you failed to kill him as well.

GUNMAN: Like I said 

MULDER: (interrupting) Yeah, I know  you got nothing to say. (sits beside him on the bed) Thats okay. Im a pretty good guesser. The kid reads minds. Hows that? Why dont I tell him you told me that, and then lets see how safe and snug you feel in here.

GUNMAN: What can you do for me?

MULDER: I dont know. I might be able to get you immunity or, uh  get you into the witness protection program.

GUNMAN: Never happen.

MULDER: Think about it.

(MULDER gets up and leaves the cell closing the door behind him. As he walks down the hall, he passes SPENDER and a guard carrying a tray of food.)

SPENDER: What did you get? Did you get anything?

(MULDER, never pausing, grabs a bag of chips and a drink off of the tray and continues down the hall.)

MULDER: Just his attention.

(SPENDER and the GUARD stop and watch MULDER leave.)



SCENE 9
INGET MURRAY PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(SCULLY and GIBSON holding hands walk through a door and down a hall.)

SCULLY: How you doing?

GIBSON: I didnt like those tests. I didnt like being in the machine.

SCULLY: Hmm  Theyre a little scary, arent they?

GIBSON: Youre wondering, arent you?

SCULLY: About what? About you?

GIBSON: About that other girl.

(DIANA, holding a file, steps out of a room to meet them.)

GIBSON: Shes wondering about you, too.

(Later, GIBSON sits in a room facing six adults. Funny scene.)

DOCTOR 1: Were going to show you a group of cards and as we look at them we want you to tell us what were thinking. Now, take as much time as you need.

(As each of the DOCTORS looks at a card with a picture of an object on it, GIBSON looks at the person and says the name of the object.)

GIBSON: Chair. Piano. Piece of pie. Light bulb. Smiley face. Statue. Cat.

(DIANA and SCULLY are watching through an observation window in another room.)

SCULLY: Its amazing. Its hard to believe.

DIANA: Ive witnessed clairvoyants who were over 90% accurate and seen telepathy being demonstrated but I dont know Ive ever witnessed anything quite like this.

SCULLY: Whered you see that?

DIANA: Agent Mulder and I spent some time in psychiatric hospitals. There were some patients serving criminal sentences who we felt had been misdiagnosed.

(In the other room, GIBSON looks at each of the DOCTORS in turn.)

GIBSON:  omelette. Coffee and a cruller. A nonfat latte. An english muffin. Grand Slam number two with double hash browns and a side of Canadian bacon.

(DOCTORS all laugh and clap.)

DOCTOR 1: (over his shoulder to SCULLY and DIANA) He just told us all what we ate for breakfast.

SCULLY: (not looking at DIANA, very tense) I have to disappear for a bit.

(SCULLY quickly leaves the room. DIANA watches her go.)



SCENE 10

(Prison. GUARD slides a note to the GUNMAN through the door.)

GUARD: I was handed a note. Now Im handing it to you.

(The note is written on the back of a Morley cigarette wrapper. "Youre a dead man.")



SCENE 11

(Lone Gunman office, and home apparently. Sound of knocking. SCULLY is shown on a video monitor outside the door. FROHIKE is in pajamas. He is putting on a Kevlar bullet-proof vest.)

SCULLY: (on monitor) Is somebody going to let me in?

FROHIKE: Yeah. Yeah. Coming. Coming.

(To get the door open, FROHIKE must first unlock and unbolt seven very sturdy locks. Very funny. He opens the door and SCULLY enters.)

FROHIKE: Sorry. You caught me getting ready for bed. Come in. Come in.

SCULLY: Thank you.

FROHIKE: To what do we owe the pleasure at this late night hour?

SCULLY: I need your help.

LANGLY: (entering, also in pajamas with toothbrush in his mouth) With what?

SCULLY: Youve all heard of Gibson Praise the chess wunderkind. These are a series of scans and neural electrical outputs of his brain and brain processes. (She places the images of GIBSONs brain on a lighted viewer.) There seems to be some suspicion that hes a fraud.

BYERS: Dorf on chess?

SCULLY: Well, apparently, he wins by reading his opponents minds.

FROHIKE: I love that.

LANGLY: And you want us to what?

SCULLY: Analyze the data  with an eye to the parapsychological.

FROHIKE: Ooh . A walk on the wild side.

SCULLY: (not looking at them, switching off the viewer) First  I want you guys to tell me who Diana Fowley is.

BYERS: Diana Fowley? Geez, we havent heard that name in a while.

SCULLY: Then you know her.

BYERS: Well  yeeaaah.

FROHIKE: She was Mulders chickadee when he just got out of the Academy. Good-looking.

SCULLY: Well, she claims to have worked closely with him for a while.

LANGLY: She was there when he discovered the X-Files. She has a background of para-science.

BYERS: She got a legat appointment a while back  in Berlin. I always wondered why they split up.

(This has made SCULLY uncomfortable. She smiles tightly. Still not looking at the men, she turs the viewer back on.)

SCULLY: Well  Why dont you boys see what you can find?



SCENE 12

(Hospital. GIBSON is watching The Silver Surfer cartoon.)

SILVER SURFER: I must make my stand.
GALACTUS: Your stand will destroy you.
SILVER SURFER: Better to perish for what I believe in than endure forever as a traitor to life.
GALACTUS: Then, so be it.

(DIANA is watching GIBSON from another room through an observation window. GIBSON turns at looks in her direction at one point, then turns back to the TV. MULDER enters the observation room joins DIANA at the window and watches GIBSON also.)

MULDER: Hows little Karnac doing?

DIANA: Put a TV in front of him and he turns right into a normal kid. Hes the real deal, Fox. We tested him with Zener cards, random numbers, a variety of ESP tasking. Hes got ability to not just focus on a thought, but a multitude of thoughts at once.

MULDER: Theres something else. Theres something were missing here.

DIANA: That was a good catch on the videotape. I was impressed.

MULDER: (embarrassed, looking away) Oh, you would have caught it eventually.

DIANA: No. Ive been too many years trying to get inside the head of too many Arab terrorists. Im out of practice with this stuff. But you seem at the top of your game.

MULDER: Thats all I do. Thats all Ive been doing for the last five years. Been my life, such as it is. (smiles)

DIANA: Sometimes I hear about you ... about the work youre doing. And I think how it might have been if Id stayed.

MULDER: Ah, wed all be blown up by some terrorist bomb, no doubt, huh?

DIANA: I sense you could have used an ally, though  someone who thinks like you, with some background.

MULDER: Oh, you mean Scully?

DIANA: Shes not what I would call an open mind on the subject.

(They laugh.)

MULDER: Shes a, uh ... shes a scientist. She just makes me work for everything.

DIANA: Yes, but Im ... Im sure there were times when two like minds on a case would have been advantageous.

MULDER: Ive done okay without you.

DIANA: Hey ... Im on your side.

(DIANA takes MULDERs hand as they look at one another. Outside in the hall, SCULLY, carrying GIBSONs file, approaches the door. Through the door window she sees MULDER and DIANA holding hands and smiling. Surprised, SCULLY keeps walking a few steps down the hall. She pauses, then turns and walks back the way she came without looking in the room again where MULDER and DIANA are still holding hands. SCULLY goes down to the parking deck and gets in her car. She sits quietly for about 15 seconds just thinking, then breathes deeply and pulls out her cell phone. She dials and exhales slowly.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me.

MULDER: (on phone, voice, pause) Where are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) Im, uh, Im on my way to work. I was hoping I could show you something. Something about the boy.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, Im at the psych facility with him right now. Why dont you come by and show me?

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Uh, no, Id ... Id prefer to show you at work if thats okay.

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, what is it?

SCULLY: (on phone) I think youll be surprised. Very surprised.

MULDER: (on phone) Im on my way.

(SCULLY hangs up and starts her car. As she drives away, she sees SPENDER pull up. He doesnt see her. SPENDER sets his car alarm. As SCULLYs car goes out of sight, we hear tires squealing as if someone is driving a little fast.)

(SPENDER gets out of his car and is addressed by CSM who is standing in the shadows.)

CSM: Agent Spender. I need to speak with you.

SPENDER: Who are you?

CSM: Somebody whos taken an interest in you ... in this case of yours. This case I gave you.

SPENDER: What are you? CIA? NSA?

CSM: Youre a bright boy.

SPENDER: You said you had information.

CSM: Control the board. Know which men to sacrifice and when.

SPENDER: I dont know what youre talking about.

CSM: Dont become part of someone elses cause or crusade. Pursue your own self interest. Always.

(At the other side of the parking deck MULDER enters and sees them talking. He runs toward them, but CSM steps back and is gone.)

MULDER: Agent Spender! Agent Spender? (looks for CSM, but doesnt see him) Who were you talking to?

SPENDER: I dont know.

MULDER: You dont know who you were talking to? Youre lying.

SPENDER: Whats your deal?

MULDER: I was told he was dead.

SPENDER: Well, obviously whoever it is, hes not.



SCENE 13

(SKINNERs office. MULDER and SCULLY sit in front of the desk. SPENDER, DIANA, and a few other agents are gathered on the couches.)

SKINNER: (sitting down) Youre here to tell me a story.

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Tell him exactly as you told me.

SCULLY: (uncomfortable with what shes saying) Ive conducted some tests on Gibson Praise and have come up with some rather unexpected conclusions: ones which I myself have difficulty reconciling with what I know.

SKINNER: These are?

SCULLY: Neurological tests. Mapping of brain functions using a very high resolution EEG.

SKINNER: What did you find out?

SCULLY: The tests revealed something peculiar in an area of the brain that we are only beginning to understand. An area of the temporal lobe that neurophysicists are calling the "God nodule."

SKINNER: I hope Im not going to hear that this kid is the next Christ child.

SCULLY: All of the boys brain processes are showing extraordinary activity in exactly this part of the brain. Which is not just abnormal or anomalous, but from what I know absolutely unheard of.

MULDER: There are corollaries  The individuals who have been responsible for great leaps forward in understanding in science. Newton, Galileo, Einstein, Stephen Hawking. All these men exhibited modes of thinking that are suggestive of access to special brain centers.

SKINNER: All right. So this kid is a human oddity. Tell me why anyone would go to such lengths as to kill him?

MULDER: This kid may be the key not just to all human potential, but to all spiritual unexplained paranormal phenomena. The key to everything in the X-Files.

SPENDER: Let me get this right --- Were supposed to believe that this boy was going to be killed because of the X-Files?

MULDER: No, its bigger than that.

SPENDER: Uh-huh. Explain it to me. To us.

MULDER: I cant. But the shooter can. The assassin that you have locked up ... in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

SPENDER: You want to give a murderer a free ride for the secrets to the pyramids? This is crazy. Its nuts.

SCULLY: You mischaracterize what Ive said. This would be quantifiable scientific proof of everything Agent Mulder and I have investigated over the past five years.

DIANA: How do you quantify the spiritual? It cant be done. You ask for immunity for a killer on that basis, the Attorney Generals gonna go off. Youre allowed to investigate the X-Files as an indulgence. But draw the wrong kind of attention and theyll close you down. Put an end to all your work. Something I happen to have an interest in myself.

(MULDER nods. SCULLY looks at him.)

SKINNER: Lets everyone step out into the hall.

(All stand.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, you stay put.

(MULDER sighs as everyone else leaves. SKINNER sits on the edge of the desk.)

SKINNER: Shes right, you know. The risk youre taking, the long-term plans that you and I talked about

MULDER: If what Agent Scullys found is true and I have every reason to believe that it is, then the answers I might have spent a lifetime searching for may fall together like a million puzzle pieces.

SKINNER: Youd risk the X-Files?

MULDER: How soon can you call the Attorney General?



SCENE 14

(Federal prison. MULDER and SPENDER enter the GUNMANs cell. GUNMAN wakes, startled. Hes nowhere near as cool and collected as he was earlier. In fact, he appears panicked and desperate.)

MULDER: The Attorney Generals heard my request for immunity.

GUNMAN: Heard it? You  Oh  You said that you could get it.

MULDER: She needs something more. Something to convince her that youre not just playing games. Something that I can corroborate. I need answers from you.

GUNMAN: The kid is a missing link.

MULDER: To what?

(MULDER and the GUNMAN look at each other. They ignore SPENDER.)

MULDER: Hes genetic proof, isnt he?

(GUNMAN nods slightly.)

SPENDER: Genetic proof of what? (pause) Genetic proof of what?

MULDER: The kids not superhuman. Hes just more human than human.

(MULDER exits the cell quickly. SPENDER follows.)

SPENDER: Hes what?

MULDER: Most of us have genes we dont use. They lie there dormant, turned off. Science doesnt know what theyre for, why theyre there or where they came from.

SPENDER: Right and you think this has something to do with that?

MULDER: Theres a long-held but unpopular theory tied to prehistoric evidence of alien astronauts.

SPENDER: Youre not going to go out there and say the kids part alien.

(MULDER gives SPENDER a direct look and keeps walking.)

SPENDER: You think thats what you heard? You led him, Agent Mulder. Now youre letting yourself be led.

(MULDER ignores SPENDER.)



SCENE 15

(Street. Day. CSM comes out of a building. A car pulls up beside him. KRYCEK is driving, WELL MANICURED MAN rolls down the passenger window.)

WMM: We entrusted you. You failed.

CSM: Failed. Failed who?

WMM: Mulder has gone to the Justice Department. He has testimony about the boy.

CSM: Thats just part of the game.

WMM: Its not a game, for Gods sake.

CSM: Sure it is. Its all a game. You just take their pieces, one by one until the board is clear.

WMM: (under his breath) God .

(WMM is not pleased. He rolls up the window. CSM lights up.)



SCENE 16
CENTERVILLE, VIRGINIA

(Night. Car pulls up to hotel. Interior hotel room. GIBSON is watching "King of the Hill" on TV. SCULLY sits in a chair watching him.)

COTTON: Hey, Missy! How about some sammiches? Hmm.
(Cotton and Bobby are both laughing at a woman.)
PEG: I hope you're all hungry.
HANK: Good-looking breakfast, Peg.
COTTON: Yeah. I see bacon, I see ham...

SCULLY: Gibson?

GIBSON: This is a great show. I wish we got this where I live.

Peg: Cotton, you are welcome to march yourself down to the Safeway 

(SCULLY comes over and pulls up a chair next to GIBSON.)

SCULLY: Id like to ask you something.

Cotton: See, Bobby? Woman works, man loses his sausage.
Peg: You know, Cotton, I'd love to debate this with you but I am just a little too busy living here in the latter half of the 20th century.

SCULLY: How do you do it?

GIBSON: I just hear you thinking  like on a radio. And sometimes there are lots of radios. And I want to shut them off and watch some TV.

SCULLY: Is that why you like chess? Cause its just one thought that you hear?

GIBSON: Yeah, but thats not why I like it all the time.

SCULLY: Why else do you like it?

GIBSON: Because theres no talking. Just thinking. Its nothing like real life where people think one thing but they say something else.

SCULLY: (laughs softly) Is that what people do?

GIBSON: Theyre so worried about what other people are thinking when the people theyre worrying about are worried about the same thing. It makes me laugh.

SCULLY: Why?

GIBSON: They make up all this stuff to believe but its all made up. Some people try to be good people but some people just dont care. Like you.

SCULLY: You think I dont care?

GIBSON: No, you dont care what people think. Except for her. The other one.

(DIANA knocks and enters the hotel room.)

DIANA: Im here to relieve you.

SCULLY: (to GIBSON) Well, well talk about this later, okay?

(SCULLY crosses to the door.)

GIBSON: They want to kill me, you know.

SCULLY: (at door) Nobodys going to do anything to you, Gibson. I promise.

GIBSON: I know you do.

(SCULLY takes her coat and leaves.)

[Closed captioning only
HANK: Well, that's the dangedest thing. I never heard of a solenoid just disappearing before.
DALE: I don't know. Sometimes things just disappear for no logical reason. One day my cousin woke up, his kidney was gone.]



SCENE 17

(Prison. GUARD slides another note to the GUNMAN.)

GUARD: Ive been handed another note.

(The GUNMAN looks at another Morley wrapper. This time there is nothing written on the back. The GUNMAN looks up just as the GUARD fires a gun through the slot in the door, killing the GUNMAN.)



SCENE 18

(Hotel room. Later. DIANA is asleep. DIANA wakes, startled. GIBSON is not where he was sitting earlier.)

DIANA: Gibson?

(She sees GIBSON looking out the window.)

DIANA: What are you doing?

GIBSON: Theres a man with a gun.

(DIANA gets up and runs to GIBSON pulling him out of the way and pushing him toward the bed. She stays at the window.)

DIANA: Gibson, get down. Get back. Get back.

GIBSON: He didnt come here to kill me. Hes aiming at you.

DIANA: Wha 

(DIANA stands up in front of the window, looks at Gibson, shocked, then faces the window. Window shatters as gunshot hits DIANA. She falls.)



SCENE 19

(Next morning. Exterior of hotel. Crime scene - patrol cars, ambulances. MULDER and SCULLY arrive. They get out of the car and see a womans body covered with a sheet. They cross to the body.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, Scully. They killed a US Marshal and then shot Agent Fowley.

(DIANA, unconscious, is carried out of the motel room and loaded onto an ambulance. MULDER, concerned, holds her hand briefly before being pushed back by the EMTs.)

SKINNER: They worked on her here for an hour. They couldnt get a chopper in so theyre in radio communication with the hospital. Shes got weak vitals and a hole in one of her lungs, so theyre not optimistic.

SCULLY: What about the boy? Is he here?

(SKINNER shakes his head.)

MULDER: Wheres Spender?

SKINNER: Hes gone to Federal Detention. They found the shooter shot dead in his cell early this morning. We also found this.

(SKINNER shows them the blank Morley wrapper.)



SCENE 20

(Day. Under the bridge. CSM and GIBSON wait for WMM and KRYCEK who drive up in the car. WMM gets out.)

WMM: (to GIBSON) Hello, young man.

GIBSON: Hello.

WMM: Theres nothing to be afraid of.

GIBSON: Youre a liar. Just like him.

(WMM is taken aback.)

CSM: (to WMM) Youve never had the stomach for our business.

WMM: Just not for your practices.

CSM: Im a necessity. The complement to your cowardice.

WMM: Your work is done now.

CSM: My work is just beginning.

(CSM begins walking away. WMM helps GIBSON into the back seat of the car, then gets in the passenger side.)

KRYCEK: (looking at the departing CSM) I got a nice, straight shot.

WMM: No. Hes useful. And you may need him in the future.

(As the car passes CSM, KRYCEK narrowly misses him. CSM exhales smoke slowly.)



SCENE 21

(Hallway. SPENDER is briefing some other agents. MULDER angrily walks toward them.)

SPENDER:  secure the airports. Notify the parents and the Philippine government the boys missing, and 

(MULDER grabs SPENDER and holds him against the wall while rubbing the Morley wrapper in his face.)

MULDER: Who do you work for?! You work for him -- You and Old Smokey --- Is that who put this together?! Youre going down for this! Im going to see you prosecuted for murder! You watch me! Watch it happen! Your days are numbered!

(MULDER leaves as angrily as he came. SPENDER watches him go.)

SPENDER: (quietly) Youre wrong, Agent Mulder. Its your days that are numbered.



SCENE 22

(MULDERs apartment. SCULLY sits at MULDERs desk on the phone. She looks exhausted. Beside her, MULDER is stretched out on the couch, his eyes closed, hands clasped on his chest. The room is dim. They are both dressed casually.)

SCULLY: (on phone) We knew there were risks going to the Attorney General.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) You know what's coming down here.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) Theyre serious about this.

SCULLY: (on phone) I understand.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) I assume youll make Agent Mulder aware of this.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, Im - Im here with him now.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) I'm making a case his personal involvement clouded his judgment but I don't know the Attorney General's listening.

SCULLY: (on phone) Ill communicate that to him. Is there anything else  any other news?

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) You should know Agent Spender's going after Mulder full bore. He's been reciting some line about "Alien Astronauts." It makes you both look real bad.

SCULLY: (on phone) Right. Well, Ill be here if you need to reach me.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) I've got to get back in there.

(SCULLY hangs up.)

MULDER: (not opening his eyes) Any news on Diana?

SCULLY: (pauses and sighs) They have her on maximum pressers but shes barely maintaining her pressure.

MULDER: What did Skinner have to say?

SCULLY: There are talks going on right now about reassignment.

MULDER: (looking up at her) For who?

SCULLY: Both of us. These talks included instructions from the Justice Department to close down the X-Files.

MULDER: This was all strategized  every move. I just couldnt see it. It was all of a plan.

SCULLY: (sad and tired) Mulder, whatever you may believe, this time they may have won.



SCENE 23

(X-Files office. CSM alone. He slowly lights a cigarette. Looks around the office. He goes to a file cabinet and removes the folder for Samantha T. Mulder. He puffs on his cigarette.)



SCENE 24

(FBI building later, hallway. CSM walks out of the elevator and down the hall carrying the one X-File. SPENDER approaches from the other direction. SPENDER looks up, surprised.)

SPENDER: Can I help you?

CSM: (not expecting this) Actually, uh .. I can help you.

SPENDER: How did you get in here?

CSM: Access, Agent Spender. Its about access. Its what I can give you. Its what can make you. Its why Im doing this for you.

SPENDER: Who are you?

CSM: Im your father.

SPENDER: What?!

(Alarm bell begins ringing. CSM quickly leaves.)

CUT TO:
(X-Files office burning fiercely.)



SCENE 25

(FBI building, later. Firemen everywhere. SKINNER speaking to some agents in the hall. MULDER enters in T shirt and jeans, SCULLY follows him looking very concerned.)

SKINNER: Mulder 

(MULDER ignores him and goes to elevator. It is full of firemen and equipment. MULDER goes to the stairs. Downstairs he passes another fireman as he enters the X-Files office. And stops in the middle of the room in shock. Everything is destroyed. "I Want to Believe" is just barely visible on the charred poster, the desk is destroyed, the file cabinets black. His nameplate has melted on the door. Water drips from the walls and ceiling. SCULLY enters and looks around at the damage.

She looks back at MULDER. He just stares at the destruction. SCULLY walks toward him and puts her hands on his upper arms.

No response. She lays her head on his chest, holding him.

They stand there as the camera pulls back.

Lights from the emergency vehicles outside flash through the windows above.

[Fade to black]

[THE END]

                                       THE BEGINNING            


Before the teaser, scenes from the season finale and the movie including shot of the Almost!Kiss, SCULLY getting stung in MULDER's hallway, and of the ship rising up out of the snow.)



SCENE 1

(Shot of bright sunlight over the desert. Two men in shirts and ties run back to a white van with DNA double helix ROUSH TECHNOLOGIES logo on the side. They get in the van joining about six other men. CARPOOL MAN, not the driver, but probably the bossy one who everyone hates, waves them on.)

CARPOOL MAN: Hurry up! Uh, next time, maybe take a leak before we leave work. Okay, Dipwads?

MAN WHO PEED 1: (flipping him the bird, but offscreen - thank you censors) Can you read sign language, Guy?

CARPOOL MAN: Is that your IQ or the number of Dipwads your mother had?



SCENE 2
PHOENIX ARIZONA
5:46 PM

(The van continues on. Later another man sitting beside CARPOOL MAN, SANDY, is shivering uncontrollably.)

CARPOOL MAN: Not you, too, Sandy? Sorry, man. You got to hold it till you get home.

(SANDY is nonresponsive, sweating and shaking. Van pulls up in front of a suburban house. SANDY, still shivering gets out of the van.)

CARPOOL MAN: See you tomorrow, Sandy.

(Van drives off. SANDY goes inside his house and goes immediately to the thermostat which reads 60 degrees. He raises the temperature to the highest setting, then goes into the living room and sits on the couch. He appears to be freezing cold. He begins gasping in pain, then raises his hand up to look at it. The skin and tissue is almost completely transparent. He begins convulsing weakly.)



SCENE 3
7:04 AM

(Next morning, paper boy is delivering as the van arrives at SANDY's house. They blow the horn. When there is no response, CARPOOL MAN knocks on SANDY's door. No answer. There are lots of pictures of SANDY, but all as a scientist. No family looking pictures. CARPOOL MAN enters the unlocked house and reacts to the sweltering heat.)

CARPOOL MAN: Hey, Sandy, chop chop. (Sees thermostat. [In CLOSED CAPTIONING he says: It's an oven in here. ]) Hey, Sandman? Hey  Hot Dog, come on. (Sees SANDY sitting on the couch and claps his hands to get his attention) Carpe Diem.

(CARPOOL MAN comes closer to the body and stares down at the gaping bloody hole in the middle of SANDY's chest. He backs up in fear, then hears a sound from the hall. A figure looks out at him. CUT TO: Guys in van waiting. Back inside the house CARPOOL MAN screams as the figure leaps out at him.)

CARPOOL MAN: Help!

(He tries to get to the door, but covered in blood as he now is, he slips and is unable to turn the doorknob. The unseen figure jerks him back out of camera range and he continues to scream.)

SCENE 4

(Mulder, sitting in a small dark office using an electronic magnifier and his computer, is laboriously piecing together fragments of burned paper. Vaguely, we see the words, "FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION."

FADE TO: Mulder addressing the OPR committee in conference room. Several ADs are present.)

MULDER: Using a process that restores moisture to the documents and by a reassembling of fragments I should be able to recover a large percentage of the case material that was destroyed in my office fire several months ago... And while this process will be tedious and ongoing what I've already recovered will allow Agent Scully and I to begin work on the X-Files immediately.

(MULDER turns as SCULLY enters the room. She looks uncomfortable as she sits beside MULDER. AD MASLIN, dark-haired no nonsense woman looks at the file in front of her.)

AD MASLIN: Agent Mulder... Agent Mulder, I'm reading here a very pie-in-the-sky report about global domination plans by vicious, long-clawed spacelings? Is there going to be data to back this vague, omnibus account?

MULDER: Yes.

AD #1: I see your renowned arrogance has been left quite intact. You're asking us to accept this report of a spaceship buried under polar ice and your death-defying escape from it?

MULDER: The ice had become superheated by the ship as it rose beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.

AD #1: This entire story is essentially unintelligible and, therefore, encourages unintelligible analysis.

MULDER: Well, I was hoping that you'd look more closely at the reports of mine and Agent Scully's medical conditions.

AD #2: These spacelings, Agent Mulder... They weren't something I saw in Men in Black?

MULDER: (pause) I didn't see Men in Black.

AD #2: Well, it's a damn good movie.

MULDER: As much as this all may sound like science-fiction we can and will prove the validity of our report.

AD MASLIN: And, so, the plot... I-I'm just trying to get this straight. The plot is for these spacelings to take over the planet aided by a group of men here on earth?

(SKINNER is not comfortable.)

MULDER: A shadow conspiracy within our own government.

AD MASLIN: Who are growing corn in the middle of the desert which features pollen which was genetically altered to hold a virus which will be taken away by bees whose sting transmits the virus, causing the growth of an extraterrestrial biological entity inside the human host?

MULDER: Which we will prove now that the X-Files have been reopened.

AD #1: Your presumption is far greater than the case you make for that eventuality.

MULDER: I'm not sure I understand.

AD #1: You're here to justify your reassignment on the X-Files with little more than a rattletrap account of high adventure in the Antarctic.

AD #2: Not to mention some very questionable travel expenses.

(MULDER gives him a look.)

AD MASLIN: Let us remind you that the FBI is not a school for science or for the grinding of personal axes and, hopefully, you will be able to present us with some material evidence to support a continued investigation.

MULDER: (the big speech) Agent Scully was assigned to the X-Files as a scientist, was stung by one of these bees and was infected with this virus. She is here today with hard and incontrovertible evidence... Scientific proof that the virus she was infected with is, in fact, extraterrestrial.

(Having said this last statement confidently, MULDER turns to SCULLY. SCULLY starts to speak, then stops, obviously unsure of what to say. MULDER, realizing she is not going to back him up, stares at her in surprise.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY exit the conference room. They are not pleased with each other.)

MULDER: Next time, I'll wear a clown suit and do balloon tricks.

SCULLY: Mulder, I was hoping it wouldn't come up.

MULDER: The only reason I was in there was because you assured me there was a scientific basis for what we saw.

SCULLY: Mulder, let me remind you once again... What I saw was very little.

MULDER: Look, Scully, that excuse is not going to work this time. You were there and you were infected with that virus.

SCULLY: Mulder, yes there is a scientific basis for what happened to me. I was exposed to a virus but as it turns out, Mulder, that virus is not what you thought. Look, I can't identify it, Mulder-- I have run three separate tests--but I can tell you without a doubt that that virus' DNA and proteins are very much of this world.

MULDER: I saw what that virus did. I saw it generate a new being... An alien being inside a human body.

SCULLY: It attacks and destroys human cells but that is all it does, Mulder. It creates nothing. Look, I don't like telling you this... And I know that you don't want to hear it... Not that you can't question me and what I saw but what you can't question is the science.

(MULDER has no answer for her and walks off angrily. SCULLY sighs sadly as she watches him go.)



SCENE 5
NEW YORK CITY

(CONSORTIUM conference room. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is addressing the ELDERS and showing slides of the body of the man, SANDY, from the teaser.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: There was some sloppiness in Phoenix where they found the body. The local PD got involved. These were taken at the scene by a crime reporter.

FIRST ELDER: These were run in the press?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I trumped up a story about a crazy Indian on the loose. Never underestimate the public's willingness to blame the Red Man for... anything they can't explain.

SECOND ELDER: How did this happen?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: He was one of ours. He must've accidentally injected himself while he was working on the virus. It took just 12 hours for the creature to gestate.

FIRST ELDER: This thing's alive?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Yes. It's killed a man.

FIRST ELDER: It's out there somewhere?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: As far as I know.

SECOND ELDER: God almighty, we can't have this thing running loose.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm managing the situation.

FIRST ELDER: You can manage all you want. Someone's got to find this thing.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Someone has to kill it. (FIRST ELDER looks at him.) The response must be equal to the threat.

FIRST ELDER: Can you dispose of this problem?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Yes.



SCENE 6

(Mulder is working again on piecing together the burned files in his new office. SKINNER enters.)

SKINNER: You're wasting your time.

MULDER: You need evidence to justify our reassignment. I've just got to bring it back from the ashes.

SKINNER: Nothing you might restore is going to help you, Agent Mulder. It's over and done. Your reassignment on the X-Files has been denied.

MULDER: (angry) How can it be denied? We're the only reason the X-Files were reopened in the first place. There's no other reason to reopen them.

SKINNER: I'm not arguing...

MULDER: Well, then, who is?

SKINNER: When will you accept that no amount of pressure or reason will bring to heel a conspiracy whose members walk these halls with absolute impunity?

MULDER: Was there a vote?

(SKINNER pauses.)

SKINNER: Unanimous against.

(SKINNER looks at MULDER apologetically. Sound of motor winding down as Mulder turns off the computer. He gathers up a box full of files in individual plastic bags and heads for the door. SKINNER still stands in the way. )

MULDER: (coldly) Excuse me.

SKINNER: (reluctantly stepping aside) I'm no help to you outside the majority, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Inside or out, I don't see that there's a damn thing you can do for me.

SKINNER: You can break their backs, Agent Mulder, with the proof about this virus. Proof that what you say it does is true.

MULDER: I don't have that proof just yet.

SKINNER: Maybe I can give it to you. There's a file folder. It's on the desk in your old office.

(Short time later. Mulder enters his old office. It has been cleaned. Large house plant by the door. There is nothing on the walls, just a plain desk with a manilla folder sitting on it. Mulder sets his box of files on the edge of the desk and opens the folder. Inside is the same picture of SANDY from the teaser, chest gaping open. Unseen by Mulder, AGENT SPENDER enters the office.)

SPENDER: Is that something for me? Agent Mulder?

MULDER: (setting the file down) Yeah, if you're doing my filing.

SPENDER: Your filing?

MULDER: What are you doing in my office, Agent Spender?

SPENDER: I think there's been a miscommunication. I think someone failed to inform you.

MULDER: If you're about to tell me that you were sent down here to work on the X-Files I think the failure is simple judgment. I don't care what patronage got you this job. I put my life in here. I'm not going to let some brown-nose just slide in and take it all away from me.

SPENDER: I don't believe in your work, in the paranormal mumbo jumbo. So, don't presume I'm the one taking your place.

MULDER: No? Who is?

(SPENDER doesn't answer. DIANA FOWLEY enters the office behind SPENDER.)

FOWLEY: Fox.

MULDER: (giving a weak thumbs-up) Diana, back on your feet. (picks up his box of files and heads out the door) I guess that's the only way you could stab me in the back.

(FOWLEY and SPENDER look at one another, then head toward the back of the office to work. We see that the new file MULDER was looking at is now missing from the desk.)



SCENE 7

(Unknown research facility. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN walks down a hall and looks into an operating room. In the glow of the red "No Smoking" sign, he lights a cigarette and enters the room. Inside, a group of doctors are working on a patient's head. The doctors look up in surprise at CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, but no one challenges him.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I need the patient bandaged and dressed. We'll be taking a trip.

DOCTOR: You want him what?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm sure I don't need to repeat myself. Please get the boy ready.

DOCTOR: But doing that now could kill him.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Let me put it to you simply: it's him or it's us.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN exits. Pan down to show that the patient is GIBSON PRAISE, very much awake and silently unhappy as the doctors work on him. His head, crisscrossed with open incisions, is in a restraint, his hair is completely shaved off allowing the doctors access to his brain.)



SCENE 8
PHOENIX, ARIZONA
4:58 PM

(MULDER and SCULLY enter SANDY's house. The bodies have been removed, but it is still intact as a crime scene. MULDER walks straight in. SCULLY waits by the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I just want to remind you that by not informing local PD we are in technical violation of state laws prohibiting contamination of a crime scene. (She realizes MULDER is not listening. Under her breath.) Why do I bother?

(She closes door and notes the bloody and now scratched and broken doorknob area.)

MULDER: (from the hall) Scully, come here and take a look at this. Ever seen anything like this?

(On the wall in the hall near the door are deep groove marks running vertically about three feet.)

SCULLY: What are they?

MULDER: According to the investigator's notes in the file they're from an attack by a Native American man on a scientist.

SCULLY: With what kind of weapon?

MULDER: It says in the file he used his bare hands.

(SCULLY looks the floor which has more deep scoring marks.)

SCULLY: His bare hands? Mulder, this is hardwood.

MULDER: Uh-huh.

SCULLY: This kind of gouging didn't happen with anybody's bare hands. Not without the use of some kind of an implement. What is that?

(From one of the grooves in the wall MULDER removes a small dark object and holds it up for inspection.)

MULDER: Aw. Somebody broke a nail.

SCULLY: Is it animal?

MULDER: It ain't RuPaul. (reading) The body of the other victim was found here on the sofa his viscera torn from his torso. But the MEs report says that the times of death were hours apart which means that this victim was dead hours before the second attack.

SCULLY: So the attacker never left.

MULDER: There wasn't an attack. I think it was celebrating its birthday. The first victim must have gotten infected with the virus somehow. Right here on the sofa was where the creature was born.

SCULLY: (warning him) Mulder...

MULDER: That would account for the violence done to the man's torso. The virus producing an extraterrestrial biological entity that ripped away his chest as it birthed itself right here. Look.

(He shows her the picture in the file.)

SCULLY: Mulder, given the scenario that you just described, the rate of gestation would have been less than a day. It would have been about 12 hours, in fact. Okay, forgive the scientific argument just for a moment but you're saying this was done by something newborn?

MULDER: That's exactly what I'm saying.

{In CLOSED CAPTIONING only:

SCULLY: Mulder, there isn't anything in the animal kingdom capable of this ferocity. ]

(Outside the house, a car pulls up. MULDER and SCULLY don't see it. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and GIBSON whose head is now bandaged, blood seeping through, sit in the back seat.)

GIBSON: It was here... But it's gone now.

DRIVER THUG GUY: I should take a look.

GIBSON: (emphatically, nervous, perhaps protecting MULDER and SCULLY inside) It's not here. Why don't you believe me when you're so afraid of me?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm not afraid of you.

GIBSON: You think I can destroy you for what I know, because of what I am. You're thinking you could've destroyed me, too and if I don't find this creature, you will.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (to DRIVER THUG GUY) He'll find it.

(DRIVER THUG GUY drives away. Back inside the house. MULDER and SCULLY are almost out of the door.)

MULDER: I don't see there's any argument here. You admit yourself that the crime report is a lie.

SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't mean that I can just accept your theory.

(They exit the house just as the car leaves.)

MULDER: What does it take? For this thing to come up and bite you on the ass? I saw these creatures. I saw them burst to life. You would've seen them, too but you were infected with that virus. You were passed out over my shoulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, I know what you did. I know what happened to me but without ignoring the science, I can't... Listen, Mulder  (close up of her hand grasping his) You told me that my science kept you honest. That it made you question your assumptions. That by it, I'd made you a whole person. If I change now... It wouldn't be right... or honest.

MULDER: I'm talking about extraterrestrial life alive on this planet in our lifetime. Forces that dwarf and precede all human history. I'm sorry, Scully, but this time your science is wrong. (walks away from her)



SCENE 9
ROLLING HILLS NUCLEAR POWER PLANT
60 MILES EAST OF PHOENIX

(Inside the plant, an engineer, HOMER, is sitting in front of the systems monitors. He is asleep. "Put On A Happy Face" is playing on a cheap radio. Another engineer enters and startles HOMER.)

ENGINEER #1: Wake up, Homer.

HOMER: I was awake. I was just thinking.

ENGINEER #1: Yeah, that would be a first. You're ten minutes late on your systems check.

HOMER: If there was a problem, we would have heard about it. Like Arizona's going to go without air conditioning for ten minutes.

ENGINEER #1: Hey, Homer, got something here in the bleed cooling system. See that? Five degrees off. Might be... Might be in the core reactor.

HOMER: No, no, no. It's got to be a monitoring glitch.

ENGINEER #1: Phone could start ringing any minute. You might want to check it out.

HOMER: All right.

(HOMER turns off radio then singing to himself goes into the plant to investigate. He hears a sound behind some creepy red-lit pipes and sees a clawlike hand moving around one of the pipes. He gingerly reaches out with a wrench to touch it, but suddenly the hand reaches out and grabs HOMER's hand. HOMER begins screaming as the camera pans back down the hall.)



SCENE 10

(Later, exterior of power plant. Lots of police cars and crime scene tape. MULDER and SCULLY pull up in a lovely red sedan, SCULLY driving. They get out of the car and head for the building. They are confronted by SPENDER who is wearing an FBI jacket.)

SPENDER: Authorized officers and personnel only. This is a closed area.

MULDER: What happened here?

SPENDER: You'll have to leave, Agent Mulder..

SCULLY: We received a call that a man was killed here.

SPENDER: A call from whom? Assistant Director Skinner?

MULDER: Let us through.

SPENDER: You're unauthorized to be here. You've ignored your superiors and come here without cause or permission. I'm going to get you censured for this and demand a review of AD Skinner's actions.

(MULDER sees FOWLEY nearby, also in FBI gear.)

MULDER: Diana, let us in here.

FOWLEY: I can't. This facility has been sealed off by the NRC.

MULDER: A man was murdered.

FOWLEY: A workman was killed in an accident in a reactor where there was a systems failure.

MULDER: Then why are you here?

FOWLEY: We were called because of a possible connection to two previous deaths. From a case file that was stolen from our office.

MULDER: There is a connection.

SCULLY: (taking his arm) Let's get out of here, Mulder.

MULDER: I hope you know what you're doing, Diana. I hope you know whose errand you're running.

FOWLEY: I think I do.

(MULDER lets SCULLY lead him back to their car.)

SCULLY: You weren't getting anywhere, Mulder. It was only making it worse.

MULDER: It's here, Scully, and they know it.

SCULLY: How do they know? Mulder, how do you know?

(MULDER glances in the back seat and turns back to SCULLY.)

MULDER: Give me the keys and get in the car.

(SCULLY hands him the keys and as MULDER runs around to the driver's side she slips into the backseat where GIBSON is lying down. She gently takes his bloody bandaged head into her lap.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God. Gibson. Sorry, sweetie. Gibson? Gibson? Gibson, sweetheart? Oh, God.

(GIBSON does not respond.)



SCENE 11
CAMELBACK VIEW MOTEL
7:52 PM

(Later that evening in SCULLY's hotel room. SCULLY sits beside GIBSON who is lying on the bed propped up with pillows. She gently cuts away the bandage. Just as she removes the final wrappings, MULDER enters and joins them on the bed. They look at the stitches covering GIBSON's head. The wounds are red and inflamed.)

GIBSON: (knowing what they are thinking) Frankenstein? Really?

SCULLY: (looking down) No. No, you've been worked on by some good doctors. They did a fine job with your stitches.

GIBSON: You think they were butchers.

MULDER: They were butchers.

SCULLY: They should have changed your bandages, Gibson. You've got some swelling and some infection and you've got a fever. Why did they do this to you?

GIBSON: 'Cause I can read people's minds.

MULDER: How did you get in our car?

GIBSON: When they weren't looking, I snuck away. It's easy when you know what they're thinking.

MULDER: Why are you here?

GIBSON: They were using me 'cause I can communicate with it.

SCULLY: Communicate with what?

GIBSON: You already know. You just don't want to believe it.

(MULDER and SCULLY glance at each other, then go into a corner of the room and speak quietly.)

MULDER: The kid could find this thing.

SCULLY: Mulder, this kid belongs in a hospital.

MULDER: We could get his fever down.

SCULLY: Mulder, you can't just take him on some snipe hunt. He's in no condition. He belongs in a bed under constant medical care. Listen to me. What I'm saying is in your best interest, okay? We have to take every precaution. We have to make every effort to ensure that nothing happens to this boy because whatever he is, whatever gives him the ability to do what he does, he's your scientific evidence. It's just like we said. He could be the key to everything in the X-Files.

MULDER: We don't have the X-Files.

SCULLY: No, but what if he could corroborate everything that you're saying? This boy could be our last, best chance.

(They look over at GIBSON who watches them.)

(Later, MULDER carries GIBSON out of the room to the car. SCULLY is already in the driver's seat. Just as MULDER places the boy in the back seat, a car drives up, tires squealing. The bright headlights hide the driver.)

FOWLEY: (from the car) Agent Mulder. Fox, I'm going to get out of the car. I'm alone, all right?

(MULDER closes the passenger door and goes over to FOWLEY's car. FOWLEY gets out of the car. SCULLY watches, but can't hear.)

MULDER: (not wanting to deal with her) Diana, what are you doing here?

FOWLEY: I couldn't say anything to you earlier. I was given this assignment, Fox, okay? They offered it to me. I took the chance...

MULDER: I'm listening.

FOWLEY: ...to make sure someone served your interests. Someone who believes in the work. Hey, you and I found the X-Files together. Don't forget that.

MULDER: Who sent you?

FOWLEY: I'm here on my own.

MULDER: Why? To convince me of your noble intentions?

FOWLEY: Listen to me. That thing is somewhere inside the Number Four reactor building. Now, we can let them find it and destroy it or go find it ourselves. You need proof, Fox. You're so close. Why can't you see that?

(MULDER goes back to SCULLY and opens passenger door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what's going on?

MULDER: You take Gibson.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To find this thing.

(MULDER closes the door and goes back to FOWLEY's car.)



SCENE 12

(MULDER and FOWLEY in FOWLEY's car.)

FOWLEY: Agent Spender and I got a call. We were on a plane within an hour in constant contact.

MULDER: With who?

FOWLEY: The nuclear regulatory people. NRC was first on the scene. They found the victim but by the time we got there it had been removed. We never saw the body.

MULDER: Who removed it?

FOWLEY: I don't know. Couldn't get a straight answer. Then the NRC sealed off the Number Four reactor due to a problem with the heat transfer systems. I believe that was legitimate.

MULDER: Maybe that's why it's there. It wants heat. It needs heat. This thing gestated abnormally fast. What if heat activates it? It could spur on the virus and the rapid development of the entity. But it's still seeking heat. Why?

FOWLEY: What if it's still developing? You're not under the impression what we're looking for makes sense in any conventional way?

(Not what MULDER is used to hearing.)

MULDER: No.



SCENE 13
PHOENIX SAMARITAN MEDICAL CENTER

(Inside the hospital, GIBSON is being wheeled on a gurney. SCULLY walks right beside him.)

SCULLY: You're going to be fine, Gibson. You're going to be okay.

ORDERLY: Let's get a bed ready.

GIBSON: (to SCULLY) You're going to run more tests.

SCULLY: We're going to get you well.

GIBSON: You say that, but you're going to run more tests just like the other doctors.

SCULLY: (guilty and sorry) We have to run some more tests, Gibson.

GIBSON: You want to make me well but you're just thinking about yourself and what you can learn from me.

(They wheel him away from her to a bed and lift him onto it.)

SCULLY: You're a very special boy, Gibson. You know that yourself.

GIBSON: (resigned, accusingly) I'm a very special lab rat.

(ORDERLY pulls the curtain between GIBSON and SCULLY.)



SCENE 14
11:42 PM

(Inside the nuclear plant, MULDER and FOWLEY are running, searching near where HOMER was attacked.)

FOWLEY: According to what little we could gather the victim's body was found near here.

MULDER: It's hot in here.

FOWLEY: We're right above the core reactor. This is part of the heat transfer cooling system.

(MULDER steps in a gooey puddle. They kneel down and he dips his fingers in it.)

FOWLEY: Looks organic.

MULDER: Maybe somebody's got the flu.

(They follow the trail of slime deeper into the pipes. MULDER sees HOMER's dropped wrench and sees scratch marks on the pipes. He reaches in just like HOMER did, then gasps and jerks his hand back quickly. Wet squishy sound.)

FOWLEY: What? What is it?

MULDER: There's something in there.

(MULDER reaches back in and drags out perhaps a 10 pound blob of tissue. Skin? It drops to the floor and he kneels down to look at it closely. MULDER's cell phone ringing scares them both and he jumps back up.)

(SCULLY, phone in hand, is looking at GIBSON's chart in the hospital.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I found something. I found something you're not going to believe.

MULDER: (on phone) Ditto.

SCULLY: (on phone) We did blood tests on Gibson and, Mulder, there's evidence of the virus in his system.

MULDER: (on phone) The same virus you were exposed to?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm almost positive.

MULDER: (on phone) What does that mean, Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know  I don't know, but I think we're on to something. We're on to something huge-- a link.

MULDER: (on phone) I'll call that bet and raise you.

SCULLY: (on phone) What?

MULDER: (on phone) Never mind. Just take care of Gibson.

(CUT TO: GIBSON's curtained off bed. He looks up as the curtain is pulled back by DRIVER THUG GUY.)



SCENE 15

(Hospital. SCULLY goes back into see GIBSON, but the bed is empty. She turns to the large staff milling about.)

SCULLY: There was a little boy in that room and he's gone. Does anybody know what happened to that little boy? His name is Gibson Praise. He was just in that room. Does anybody know what the hell is going on?!

PHOENIX DOCTOR: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's just calm down.

SCULLY: That little boy that I brought in is missing.

PHOENIX DOCTOR: He can't be missing. He should still be in his bed.

SCULLY: He's not here!

(CUT TO: Ambulance headed toward the power plant. DRIVER THUG GUY driving, GIBSON lying in the back.)



SCENE 16

(Inside the plant. MULDER and FOWLEY are still sneaking around. They see DRIVER THUG GUY and GIBSON walking above them, also searching. MULDER and FOWLEY circle around to follow the other two. GIBSON and DRIVER THUG GUY enter a room above the central core. There are lots of pipes rising out of the superheated water of the tank.)

GIBSON: It's here.

DRIVER THUG: Where?

GIBSON: Somewhere.

(They descend some stairs to a lower level of the room. MULDER sees them through a door window at this level and begins pounding on the locked door and yelling.)

MULDER: Open the door, you son of a bitch! Open the door! Open it! Open it! Open the door, you...

FOWLEY: Fox! I'm going to go see if there's some other way in.

(FOWLEY runs off. MULDER keeps pounding on the door.)

MULDER: Open it! Open the door!

(Inside the room, GIBSON and DRIVER THUG GUY see the creature.)

GIBSON: I told you it was here.

(Creature leaps out and attacks DRIVER THUG GUY and begins slamming his head against the door window spreading blood and .. other things ... all over the glass. MULDER tries to see GIBSON through the now bloody glass. He sees GIBSON and the creature looking at each other.)

MULDER: Gibson! Gibson! Gibson!

(Alarm begins clanging. Led by FOWLEY a group of armed men come running up to MULDER.)

GUARD: There he is!

(FOWLEY pulls out her gun and holds it on MULDER. MULDER looks at her, then turns back to the bloody door.)

MULDER: Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson!

(No sign of GIBSON. Just the body of the dead DRIVER THUG GUY.)



SCENE 17

(OPR conference room. MULDER and SCULLY sit front and center. FOWLEY sits at the back of the room. SKINNER's chair is empty.)

AD MASLIN: As I said and as I am forced to reiterate, Agent Mulder, the FBI is not here for vendettas or for the grinding of personal axes. Now, this holds not just for you but for everyone at the Bureau. You force us to put a point on this. To make some hard changes. You and Agent Scully will cease all material association with the X-Files. Refusal to do so will end in immediate dismissal. A probationary period will be set. You will now report to Assistant Director Kersh.

(Focus on AD KERSH, a very stern-looking older African-American man. SCULLY looks over at MULDER. MULDER says nothing.)



SCENE 18

(X-Files office.)

SPENDER: You're not supposed to come here. It's what was agreed to. It's the deal you made.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I had to congratulate you. Commend how you handled things. How you handled Mulder.

SPENDER: I did what I was asked.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You did well, son. He's on very thin ice now, you know?

SPENDER: Mulder will be back. As long as he lives, he won't give up.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Well, there's solutions, of course. Simple but extreme solutions. I've used these methods. They have their place. But not here.

SPENDER: You've killed men?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You can kill a man but you can't kill what he stands for... Not unless you first break his spirit. That's a beautiful thing to see.



SCENE 19

(MULDER is in his new office again working on the burned files. The door opens. He turns quickly to see who it is, then relaxes and goes back to work.)

MULDER: It would help if you'd shut the door. It would make it harder for them to see that I'm totally disregarding everything I was told.

SCULLY: (closing the door) Everything WE were told, Mulder.

MULDER: They can't take away the X-Files, Scully. They tried.

SCULLY: You know, Agent Fowley's report to OPR painted the facts in an interesting way. I hope you haven't been betrayed.

MULDER: (not looking at her) Agent Fowley's report was a means to an end. Trying to protect the work. Protect the X-Files.

SCULLY: Mulder, Agent Fowley's report states that the man you saw attacked was bludgeoned by an unknown subject. She makes no mention of a little boy who as it happens, is nowhere to be found. It would seem that her report protects everything but you.

MULDER: Agent Fowley took me to that plant at great risk to herself where I saw something that you refuse to believe in. Saw it again, Scully. And though it may not say it in her report, Diana saw it, too. And no matter what you think she's certainly not going to go around saying that just because science can't prove it isn't true.

SCULLY: I don't doubt what you saw, Mulder. I don't doubt you. I'm willing to believe, but not in a lie and not in the opposite of what I can prove. It comes down to a matter of trust. (he looks up at her) I guess it always has.

MULDER: You asking me to make a choice?

SCULLY: I'm asking you to trust my judgment. To trust me.

(She hands a folder out to him.)

MULDER: I can't accept that. Not if it refutes what I know to be true.

SCULLY: Mulder, these are test results. DNA from the claw nail we found matching exactly the DNA from the virus you believe is extraterrestrial.

(MULDER takes the folder and looks at the contents.)

MULDER: That's the connection.

SCULLY: Which matches exactly DNA that was found in Gibson Praise.

MULDER: Wait a minute. I don't understand. You're saying that Gibson Praise is infected with the virus?

SCULLY: No. It's a part of his DNA. In fact, it's a part of all of our DNA. It's called a genetic remnant. It's inactive junk DNA. Except in Gibson it's turned on.

MULDER: So if that were true, that would mean that Gibson is in some part extraterrestrial.

SCULLY: It would mean that all of us are.



SCENE 20

(Back at the power plant camera pans into the room where we last saw GIBSON. He is still there, peeping out from behind some pipes. Then we go down into the superheated water inside the reactor. At the very bottom is the creature. As we watch, the skin on its four fingered arms and on its very animalistic alien head sloughs off. Our last view is of a five fingered much more human looking creature. Very small with a large head and large eyes. It looks very much like the figures that Scully saw at the beginning of season 3 inside the Strughold mine.)

[THE END]

                                  DRIVE



SCENE 1

(VERY realistic looking FOX 11 Newsbreak/Special Report screen.)

ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program for a breaking news bulletin.

(Helicopter camera view of an old 70's blue sports car driving on a desert highway. Several police cars are in pusuit. Caption on screen reads KRXI - POLICE PURSUIT.)

NEWS ANCHOR: 90 miles and counting-- that's how far officers of the Nevada highway patrol have pursued the blue car on your screen in a wild chase right through the heart of Elko at speeds approaching 100 miles an hour.

(CUT TO: TV station. BENJAMIN is the NEWS ANCHOR.)

NEWS ANCHOR: Live on the scene in Carlin is Chuck Pickering in the Fox 11 news chopper. Chuck, what can you tell us?

(CUT TO: View of pursuit and of map showing route travelling west from Wells to Elko.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: (fuzzy radio voice) Benjamin, we're heading west following route 766, where it feeds off the I-80. Now, just under an hour ago, troopers attempted to pull over the blue car which we understand is stolen. That occurred on the 80, east of Wells. Since then, this driver has stopped for nothing and nobody.

NEWS ANCHOR: Any word yet on who the driver is?

CHOPPER REPORTER: None at this time. What we do think, though and what we've passed on to the Highway Patrol is that from our vantage point we've seen another person in that car. See, right there. A hand. (Camera gets close enough to show a hand on the back seat which then pulls out of view.) It just moved. See, in the back seat? Now, we could possibly have a hostage situation here. And, obviously, the sooner they bring this vehicle to a stop .

(Camera begins to lose frame, then ...

CUT TO: interior of blue car. PATRICK CRUMP, blue collar, about 40, is driving. VICKY CRUMP, his wife, is lying in the back seat holding her head which is obviously in great pain. Her nose is bleeding. He keeps looking back at her. High pitched sound is heard from her perspective.)

(CUT TO: PATROLMAN stretching a length of barbed chain across the road.)

PATROLMAN: (into radio) Unit six, ready at milepost 13.

PATROLMAN 2: (voice on radio) Coming your way, six.

(Around bend of road we see the news helicopter then CRUMP's car followed by the patrol cars. CRUMP drives over the chain blowing out all four tires. The PATROLMAN quickly jerks the chain out of the way for the patrol cars which quickly converge on the slowing blue car.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: Well, that did the trick. The automobile seems to be coming to a stop.

NEWS ANCHOR: Chuck, what did they just use there?

(CRUMP has stopped and troopers are surrounding the car, rifles out. They pull CRUMP out of the car onto the pavement.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: It looked to be a special tire-puncturing chain. And now the officers are approaching the car. One of them has opened the door, and he has hold of the suspect. He's pulling him out. He doesn't seem to have a weapon.

NEWS ANCHOR: He may not be armed but from our vantage point, it looks like he doesn't want to get out of that car.

(Troopers get VICKY CRUMP out of the car. She is in great pain. CRUMP struggles and screams from where he is held on the pavement.)

CRUMP: Vicky! Vicky!

VICKY CRUMP: (weakly) Please get it out of my head.

CRUMP: Vicky! Vicky! No! Let me go! Let me go! Vicky! No! Let me go! I got to go! Vicky! No!

(Troopers place VICKY CRUMP in back of patrol car and close the door.)

NEWS ANCHOR: ...Hostage appears to be okay. The Highway Patrol has her now. But Chuck, it looks like that driver is still fighting.

CHOPPER REPORTER: Yes. He's definitely putting up a bit of a fight. He seems to be a man with a few choice words on the subject as you can see. They're trying to restrain him. I tell you what. We're going to move back and try to get a wider angle. See, there's the woman . (VICKY CRUMP is banging her head against the window.) What the heck? She's .

CRUMP: Vicky! Vicky!

(VICKY CRUMP and CRUMP look at each other through the window.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: There, see? She's banging her head against the window.

(Chopper camera shows explosion of blood against the patrol car window.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: What the hell just happened?

STUDIO DIRECTOR: CUT! CUT! CUT!

SCENE 2
BUHL, IDAHO

(SCULLY knocks at a farmhouse door. FARMER, 40's, answers the door.)

FARMER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Uh, Virgil Nokes? I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.

(MULDER, in dark sunglasses, leans against one of the porch supports very bored and petulant, eating sunflower seeds.)

FARMER: Jehovah's Witness?

SCULLY: No, sir. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

MULDER: But we do have a free copy of the Watchtower for you if you'd like.

SCULLY: Uh, sir, this is just a routine check but, uh, we understand that you recently placed an order for 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.

FARMER: Oh, you people. Come on in.

(SCULLY and MULDER follow the FARMER into the house. TV is on news channel.)

REPORTER: (on TV) ...with the President. She's said to have admitted to an 18-month affair...

FARMER: Sugar beets.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

FARMER: I grow sugar beets.

REPORTER: (on TV) ... authorities in Riverside County, California 

FARMER: I figure I got better things to do with my fertilizer than going around blowing government buildings sky high.

SCULLY: Yeah. Well, as we said, sir this is just routine.

MULDER: (quietly to SCULLY) So routine, it numbs the mind.

REPORTER: (on TV) ... Experts credit a healthy economy 

FARMER: (looking through papers on his desk) I got my AG card and my papers 'round here somewhere.

REPORTER: (on TV) ... a strange death on a Nevada highway.

FARMER: Help me look for them, will you?

(MULDER watches the scene on the TV.)

REPORTER: (on TV) ... As we reported earlier a wild police pursuit ended in tragedy this morning with the death of a 36-year-old female hostage. This was the scene west of Elko, Nevada, one hour ago...

MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.

REPORTER: (on TV) ... ...died mysteriously while in custody. We once again want to warn our viewers this footage is extremely graphic.

(SCULLY joins MULDER at the TV.)

CHOPPER REPORTER: (taped) Now the hostage is still inside the car. It appears that she is banging her head against the window 

NEWS ANCHOR: (taped) At this time, highway patrol officials are refusing to identify the woman or to speculate on how she died. . Though they do stress it was not the result of a gunshot. .. Coroner's report is not expected for a day or more. Meanwhile residents of Northern Nevada who first witnessed.

(Later, outside the farmer's house, MULDER is on his cell phone next to the car. Mid-conversation, SCULLY comes out of the house to join him.)

MULDER: (on phone) Thank you, Captain. That's no problem. We'd be happy to help. Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: (knowing exactly what MULDER is doing) We'll be happy to help what?

MULDER: (on phone) See you soon. (hangs up)

(They face off over the top of the car.)

SCULLY: (definite) Mulder, we're not going to Nevada.

MULDER: Come on, Scully. Just one quick side trip.

SCULLY: No. Sorry, Mulder. We have a whole new assignment.

MULDER: Running down people that buy fertilizer? This is scut work, bozo work-- the FBI equivalent of being made to wear an orange jumpsuit and pick up trash by the side of the highway-- they mean to humiliate us.

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, like it or not, humiliated or not, we're on domestic terrorism now and, yes, this is... This is a punishment but if we want to get back to where we want to be we have to follow orders. We can't freelance.

MULDER: You saw that news report. What did you make of that?

SCULLY: I think that the obvious assumption is that the woman was shot, regardless of what the police say. Maybe it was a sniper.

MULDER: In the words of their captain "she just sort of popped." And what about this guy who supposedly tried to take her hostage, her husband? Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died. Now, the sun will rise in America tomorrow regardless of whether or not we're at yet another farm investigating yet another enormous pile of doo-doo. We can be in and out in a day. Nobody has to know.

(SCULLY wavers. MULDER waggles his eyebrows at her.)



SCENE 3
ELKO, NEVADA

(Interior jail cell. CRUMP is lying on cot. He reaches up and realizes his nose is bleeding. High pitched buzzing is heard. He begins to panic.)

CRUMP: S-s-somebody! Please! It's starting! Somebody!

(Later, in another part of the police station, MULDER and SCULLY speak with a CAPTAIN.)

MULDER: Why can't we see him?

CAPTAIN: Well, hopefully later. He pitched quite a fit in his cell-- screaming a bunch of nonsense that we were going to kill him the way we killed his wife. You know, he's not a particularly stable individual.

SCULLY: Captain, he may need medical attention.

CAPTAIN: He's getting it. Our doctor's with him now. I mean, after whatever happened to his wife-- which I'd like to stress was not our fault-- we're not going to take any chances, you know?

SCULLY: (reading) Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.

MULDER: 40-year-old roofer. No history of mental illness. No prior record.

CAPTAIN: He's got one now. That Barracuda he jacked on the Utah state line? He yanked some teenager out of the window threw his wife in back and took off. Excuse me. (steps away)

MULDER: What do you think?

SCULLY: I'm thinking while we're here I might take a look at Mr. Crump's wife.

MULDER: I'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump.

(SCULLY goes off in search of the morgue. MULDER crosses over to a wall map of the area.)

MULDER: Captain, where's Montello?

CAPTAIN: Little town right here.

MULDER: So that's where it started. That's Crump's home. Then he headed east in this direction on the 5 about ten miles to the Utah border where he stole the car.

CAPTAIN: You got it.

MULDER: Yeah, but you caught up with him in Wells. Where's that?

CAPTAIN: That's here.

MULDER: So that means that he started off in this direction. Then all of a sudden, he turned around and he headed west... To Wells. Why?

(CAPTAIN shrugs. Mulder nods.)



SCENE 4

(Later. Autopsy bay. CORONER and SCULLY enter dressed in scrubs, but no eye protection. Body of VICKY CRUMP lies on one of the tables.)

CORONER: The former Vicky Jenkins Crump. I'm hoping you can tell me what I'm looking at 'cause this is a new one on me.

(SCULLY looks at the head which is blown out on one side.)

SCULLY: There's no gunpowder residue... No carbon stippling. There seems to be no evidence of an entry wound whatsoever.

CORONER: There is none. It's all exit, but how that could be...?

SCULLY: I'm finding what look like fragments of petrous bone embedded in the remaining portion of the auditory canal. In fact, I seem to be looking straight through to the osseous labyrinth or what's left of it.

CORONER: It's almost like a little bomb went off in her ear.

SCULLY: May I?

CORONER: Please.

(SCULLY begins probing inside the ear.)

SCULLY: There seems to be some kind of tumefaction within the lateral sinus.

(Suddenly, an explosion of blood bursts out of the ear onto SCULLY's scrubs. The two women look at each other apprehensively.)



SCENE 5

(Outside the prison, CRUMP is being loaded into an ambulance. He is beginning to convulse badly. MULDER follows the stretcher.)

EMT: Patient is a white male, age 40, no known history...

EMT 2: No, he just went rammy on me. Accucheck is normal. We did a narcan push but he keeps getting worse. Okay. IV beta blocker and topical nitro.

CAPTAIN: I don't know if you're going to get to talk to this fella after all.

(MULDER tries to get into the ambulance with them. EMT stops him and shuts the door.)

EMT: Five's a crowd, buddy.

(MULDER gets in his car and follows the ambulance as it pulls away.)

(Inside the ambulance as the speedometer approaches 75, CRUMP relaxes.)

EMT: Whoa. Something must have worked. Heart rate's dropping.

EMT 2: BP's headed south. I don't understand; what'd you just do?

EMT: Hell if I know but I'll take it.

(CRUMP eyes the guard and his gun.)

(MULDER notices the ambulance swerving, then stopping by the side of the road. He pulls up right behind it. CRUMP jumps out of the back of the ambulance and points gun at MULDER. MULDER looks resigned.)



SCENE 6

(Back in autopsy bay, SCULLY dials MULDER on a BRAND NEW cell phone. Cool flip thing.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Oh, God. Come on, Mulder.

(Lab technician enters and SCULLY quickly pushes him back out the door.)

SCULLY: Hey, you, out! This lab is quarantined. Go! (locks doors) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. You know how to pick them, I'll tell you that. Look, I have no idea what killed this woman but I have to assume it's communicable.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Another body has been found just outside of Montello --- same apparent cause of death - some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Uh-huh.

SCULLY: (on phone) And Mulder, I've called the CDC. They're on their way but Patrick Crump may be infected. So you need to quarantine his cell and make sure that anybody who's had any close contact with him whatsoever has been quarantined as well, and that means you, Mulder. You're to have no contact with him whatsoever.

MULDER: (on phone, voice) (sighs)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully.

(In the car's back seat, CRUMP takes the phone from MULDER's ear looks back at the patrol cars following them, and continues pointing the gun at MULDER.)

CRUMP: Drive.



SCENE 7

(SCULLY, still in the lab, crumples up a paper with a phone number - 202-555-1066 - on it that she has been holding up to an observation window. The CAPTAIN on the other side of the window begins talking to her through their respective cell phones. They can see each other, but all audio is through the phones.)

SCULLY: Where are they?

CAPTAIN: Route 789, heading west. We're keeping them in visual plus we're in phone contact not to mention the strings we pulled to keep this off local TV.

SCULLY: Where are they going?

CAPTAIN: Crump won't say. Wherever it is, though, he ain't getting there.

SCULLY: Roadblock?

CAPTAIN: We'll shut him down east of Tuscarora-- nice, clean, remote space we can own.

SCULLY: All right. I want the CDC on-site. I want the officers making the arrest to be wearing level two or better anti-contamination suits. I want the car decontaminated. I want Agent Mulder and Crump decontaminated. I want them quarantined separately.

CAPTAIN: You got it.

(An officer comes up to the CAPTAIN and says something that SCULLY can't hear through the glass. Bad news. The CAPTAIN pauses, then speaks again into the cell phone.)

CAPTAIN: Crump says that if we don't pull back our escort he's going to shoot your partner.



SCENE 8

(Inside MULDER's car. They are being closely pursued by several patrol cars. CRUMP is very agitated, still holding gun on MULDER.)

CRUMP: (into phone, looking back at cars) You just leave me the hell alone! Now!

(Poilce cars drop back.)

MULDER: How about if we just pull over and let me out, too, huh? I must be cramping your style.

CRUMP: Just... Shut up. (looks at MULDER's badge) It's you people. Figures.

MULDER: What figures?

CRUMP: Shut up.

( Phone rings. CRUMP looks at it in frustration then throws it out the window. It bounces down the highway behind them. )

MULDER: Hey! No! (furious) That is... so stupid, Crump.

CRUMP: Shut up.

MULDER: That is so stupid.

CRUMP: You shut up and drive, you understand?

(MULDER slows the car as they approach a stoplight. They idle behind a U-Haul. CRUMP begins screaming in pain.)

CRUMP: What are you doing?

MULDER: What? What am I doing?

CRUMP: What the hell are you doing?

MULDER: (sarcastically) I'm composing a sonnet. I'm slowing down for a light.

CRUMP: Go! Go!

(MULDER looks at CRUMP almost passed out. He makes the decision, then floors the gas pedal, weaving through the busy intersection. When the speed of the car builds back up, CRUMP begins to relax.)

MULDER: Crump? Is this what happened to your wife? This same thing? If you stop moving, you die? I think I saw this movie. Why didn't you tell anybody? Why didn't you tell the police?

CRUMP: (breathless) Oh, geez.

MULDER: I don't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds but your life is in my hands regardless of whether or not you hold that gun.

CRUMP: (brandishing gun) It's right here, boy.

MULDER: Just tell me everything you know. That may be the only way I can help you.

CRUMP: You people put me here!

MULDER: Shut up. I'm guessing we got two or three miles before the roadblock.

CRUMP: What roadblock? I got rid of the cops.

MULDER: Check your window.

(CRUMP looks out window and sees chopper flying overhead.)

CRUMP: Oh, God. Man, if we get stopped...

(3 miles down the road, road block is set up. Full decontamination team is present.)

CHOPPER PILOT: (voice) Subject's turning off 789 about a mile east of your position and is heading north on a fire road. Looks like he's going to miss you.

(DECON MAN and troopers look at each other.)

DECON MAN: Say what?

(CUT TO: The station. SCULLY and the CAPTAIN talking on phones.)

SCULLY: What's the report, Captain?

CAPTAIN: They lost them. They were last seen on a forestry service road. Trees were too thick. Our helicopter lost sight of them.

SCULLY: How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock?

CAPTAIN: That's the question. I was hoping your Agent Mulder would manage to steer him toward it, but...

SCULLY: Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it.

CAPTAIN: Why would he do that?

SCULLY: Maybe he knew something that we don't.

(They hang up. In the lab with SCULLY and the CORONER is the prison DOCTOR in a decontamination outfit looking in a microscope.)

DOCTOR: Agent Scully, I've got the cell cultures from the second victim.

SCULLY: Anything?

DOCTOR: So far, I'm seeing no evidence of infection in either victim.

CORONER: So then, we're in the clear?

SCULLY: No, no. Not necessarily. I mean, something killed these people.

( SCULLY's cell phone rings. )

SCULLY: Sorry. Excuse me. (on phone) Scully.

KERSH'S ASSISTANT: (on phone, voice) Please hold for Assistant Director Kersh.

(SCULLY sighs, not wanting to deal with this.)

AD KERSH: (on phone, voice) Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir.

AD KERSH: (on phone, very condescending) How is Southern Idaho? Agent Scully? Southern Idaho? Think carefully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.

AD KERSH: (on phone) No, you're not.

SCULLY: (on phone) In the course of prosecuting our assignment in Idaho, Agent Mulder and I came across a situation in Nevada which we both strongly felt needed our immediate attention.

AD KERSH: (on phone) I eagerly await your report. In the meantime, agents of our Las Vegas field office will be available to assist you in tracking down Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you, sir.

AD KERSH: (on phone) Oh, Agent Scully... I think, at this point I want to see him alive even more than you do.

(SCULLY hangs up.)

SCULLY: (taking latest victim's chart) Can I see that for a minute? (reading) This man worked at Silver State Power reading meters.

CORONER: Yes.

SCULLY: What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump's place?



SCENE 9

(MULDER's car on small two dirt lane road.)

MULDER: Crump? Crump, what else can you tell me about what's happening to you?

CRUMP: Mr. Crump. You call me by my last name, you say "mister" in front of it.

MULDER: "Mister." I got you.

CRUMP: Not Crump. Mr. Crump.

MULDER: I can think of something else I'd like to call you. I could put "mister" in front of that, too if you'd like.

CRUMP: You know, what kind of name is Mulder, anyway? What is that, like... like, Jewish?

MULDER: (disbelieving) Excuse me?

CRUMP: Jewish... It is, right?

MULDER: (mad) It's Mr. Mulder to you, you peanut-picking bastard. Now, Mr. Crump what can you tell me about what's happening to you?

(CRUMP screams in agony.)

MULDER: What?

CRUMP: You're going... The wrong way.

MULDER: What do you mean?

CRUMP: Go this... Go this way!

MULDER: I can't... I can't go... I can't go left. There's only trees there. Crump.

(CRUMP is in increasing pain, banging his head on the window. MULDER turns off onto a side road, barely missing another car. CRUMP begins to relax again.)

MULDER: Crump... It's west. Huh, west? You got to head west. It's just like you did with your wife. You took her and you headed west. It's not just motion; it has to be in one direction. Is that right? What the hell happened to you?



SCENE 10
CRUMP RESIDENCE MONTELLO, NEVADA

(Night. Creepy. Outside the CRUMP's mobile home. SCULLY and others, all dressed in decontamination outfits and carrying LARGE flashlights get out of a van and approach the house.)

SCULLY: Okay, I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual disease vectors.

DOCTOR: You got it.

(They hear barking and find a dog running in circles, very agitated.)

SCULLY: I think we're witnessing the same pathology here.

DOCTOR: We need to get a blood sample.

SCULLY: Let's go.

(The team restrains the dog.)

DOCTOR: Try to hold him still!

SCULLY: Hang on. Let me sedate him.

(Dog gives final series of yelps, then blood explodes onto one of the men holding the dog down. The team looks at each other in shock. The dog is dead.)



SCENE 11

(Night. Inside MULDER's car.)

MULDER: One more time. You woke up this morning then what?

CRUMP: (exhausted) We have been through this.

MULDER: You woke up this morning but you didn't go to work. Why?

CRUMP: It was raining. You don't shingle in the rain. I was up at 6:00, reading the paper.

MULDER: What was your wife doing?

CRUMP: (long pause) Cooking, man. Breakfast. She was just putting breakfast on the table when the...

MULDER: You looked up.

CRUMP: I looked up, and I saw that she had this nosebleed she didn't even know she had.

MULDER: What caused it?

CRUMP: What do I... I'm... I'm, like, Quincy? How the hell should I know what caused it? It just happened. Ten, 15 minutes later, she just... Starts getting sick. Said she got a headache that just... keeps getting worse and worse. (pause) Then she starts... screaming. I didn't know what the hell to do. I just, uh... I got her in the truck and... Taking her to the hospital but then it seemed like the faster we went the better she'd do but just as soon as I try to slow down or stop...

MULDER: I'm sorry about your wife.

CRUMP: Sure, you are... You and the rest of your Jew FBI.

MULDER: Crump...

CRUMP: Oh, yeah. You think I don't know, huh? You think I'm just some ignorant pudknocker, don't you? But I get it, man! I see what this is! I am not sick and I do not have the flu. Vicky and me were just some kind of... Government guinea pigs.

MULDER: You think the government did this to you?

CRUMP: Hell, yeah. Who else? You see it all the time on the TV: they're dropping Agent Orange, they're putting radiation in little retarded kids' gonads... Oh, yeah. You sons of bitches sneaking around my woods at night-- I seen you. You think I don't know?

(Gas gauge is on E.)

MULDER: Well, on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy I just need to inform you that we're... almost out of gas.



SCENE 12

(At the CRUMP's house, SCULLY and the decon team is still looking around. The dog is loaded into the van.)

DOCTOR: The trailer looks clean-- no readily apparent vectors.

SCULLY: Dogs, housewives... Whatever this thing is, it doesn't discriminate.

DOCTOR: There are zoonotic pathogens which spread among species.

(They see a light close by.)

SCULLY: Look at that.

DOCTOR: The Crumps have a neighbor.

(The team enters the other house. All is dark.)

SCULLY: Hello! Hello?

(SCULLY shines her light into a birdcage with two dead birds, their heads exploded.)

SCULLY: Doctor? (he joins her) Hello? Hello?

(SCULLY sees a person sitting in front of a TV. ELDERLY WOMAN jumps up when SCULLY's flashlight shines toward her and begins screaming. SCULLY tries to calm her down.)

SCULLY: Oh, no. It's okay, ma'am.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Who are you?

(From her voice pattern and the closed captioning on the TV we see that she is deaf.)

SCULLY: It's all right. I'm sorry.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Go away! Go away!

SCULLY: It's okay. It's okay.

(The woman is still terrified, but calms down a little.)



SCENE 13

(Night. Mulder's car. CRUMP is lying in backseat, very tired.)

MULDER: Okay, Crump, we got about one more mile. I'll make it fast. You ready? Here goes nothing.

(MULDER whips into a gas station, leaps out of the car and grabs a pump, realizes it won't reach the tank which is, of course, on the far side of the car, then grabs another pump with a really long hose. He runs around and sticks it in the tank and squeezes. Nothing happens. CRUMP's nose is bleeding. MULDER yells into the station where some good ol' boys are standing around the register.)

MULDER: Hey, turn on the pump! Number four! Three! Number three! Turn it on!

ATTENDANT: (over intercom) You got to pay before you pump, buddy!

(MULDER drops the pump, opens the back door and pulls CRUMP out. He drags him over to an old station wagon also at the pumps and pushes him into the backseat. Leaping into the driver's seat of the wagon, he drives away. Fortunately, the pump that was in the wagon falls out and MULDER doesn't drag the whole pump assembly with him. The OWNER of the station wagon comes running out of the gas station.)

OWNER OF THE CAR: Hey, dammit, that's my car! Where the hell do you think you're going?

(Camera pans into the car Mulder just deserted showing an envelope on the front seat marked as "Agent Dana Scully FBI".)



SCENE 14

(Night. CRUMP house. ELDERLY LADY now in decon suit, is helped into the van.)

SCULLY: (to DOCTOR) One deaf woman survives unscathed while everything else around her dies. Why?

(Pause. SCULLY removes the hood of her decon suit.)

DOCTOR: What... What are you doing?

SCULLY: The pathology of this thing... It affects the inner ear and this area right here is ground zero. What if what we're looking for is some kind of a sound?

DOCTOR: Seriously?

(Inside her suit, SCULLY's phone rings. Takes SCULLY a moment to realize what it is.)

SCULLY: Oh. Excuse me. (on phone) Scully.

CAPTAIN: (on phone, the signal crackling) It's Van Gelder. Agent, I don't know what the hell your partner's thinking but not only is he actively evading my officers, now he's stolen a car.

SCULLY: (on phone) Come again?

CAPTAIN: (on phone) You heard right. He left behind a crazy note addressed to you. (no response) You there?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Read it to me.

CAPTAIN: (on phone) "Crump sick; will die if stopped same as wife. Must head west to keep alive. No roadblocks!" Exclamation point. This make any sense to you?

SCULLY: (on phone) Take him at his word. Let him through.

CAPTAIN: (on phone) Let him through? Look, uh... No offense, Agent Scully but how 'bout you run that by your superiors 'cause frankly, I think they'll say different.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'll take that under advisement.

CAPTAIN: (on phone, signal breaking up) Agent Scully, again, I got to say I feel like we got a situation here that...

(Sound of high voltage humming. SCULLY walks over to see a metal plate reading US GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. No phone signal now at all.)



SCENE 15

(Inside the station wagon. CRUMP is in pain.)

CRUMP: Faster.

MULDER: I'm doing 70.

CRUMP: You got to go faster. It's getting worse.

MULDER: Okay.

(MULDER speeds up to 80.)

CRUMP: Yeah, yeah. That's good. Okay. Hey, uh... The Jew stuff? No offense. I mean, uh... A man can't help who he's born to.

MULDER: (sarcastic) That was an apology, right? Gee, I don't know if I can see to drive my eyes are tearing up so bad.

CRUMP: Whatever, man. Why are you doing this?

MULDER: Why am I doing what?

CRUMP: This.

MULDER: It's not in your best interest to make me question that right now.

CRUMP: How do I know you ain't doing exactly what they want you to? Hmm? Driving me all around creation, experimenting on me... How do I know it ain't that?

MULDER: I guess you don't.

CRUMP: I ain't saying you are. I'm just saying... That's no way to treat a man take away his dignity like that. It ain't right. Better just to kill him. That's all I'm saying.

MULDER: Hey, you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the government. If you die, you let them off the hook. Am I right? Huh?

CRUMP: (trying to be positive) You're right. You're damn straight.

MULDER: We'll figure this out.

CRUMP: You'd better figure quick. We're running out of west.

(They pass a billboard welcoming them to California - Gateway to the Pacific.)



SCENE 16

(Navy base. SCULLY approaches LIEUTENANT BRIEL. There is a poster on the wall with the word "Project Seafarer.")

SCULLY: Lieutenant Breil? My name is Dana Scully. I called in regard to the electrical equipment the Navy is maintaining in the town of Montello.

LIEUTENANT BREIL: Right. I don't know if there's been some miscommunication between you and your Washington office, but, uh...

SCULLY: My Washington office?

LIEUTENANT BREIL: Yeah. I was under the impression that I'd explained this to the FCC's satisfaction.

SCULLY: Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry to make you run through it again, uh... For my official report to the, uh... To the FCC.

LIEUTENANT BREIL: OKAY. AT 6:17 yesterday morning during a test of our ground conduction radio system a situation arose in which our equipment experienced a brief power surge. That's what interrupted television reception in the four-state area. However, steps have already been taken to insure this won't happen again.

SCULLY: The ground conduction radio-- th-that would be Project Seafarer?

LIEUTENANT BREIL: The specifics of what we do here are classified, ma'am.

SCULLY: Sure, sure. Um... Would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on, uh... On an organism... Say, a... Say, a human being? (pause) Theoretically speaking.

LIEUTENANT BREIL: Theoretically speaking? Well, that's classified as well, ma'am.

(They look at each other suspiciously.)



SCENE 17

(Next morning. Inside station wagon. CRUMP is lying down in back seat.)

MULDER: Crump?

CRUMP: Mr. Crump.

MULDER: Mr. Crump...

CRUMP: What is it, Mr. Mulder?

(MULDER points out the back window through which can be seen two California Highway Patrol officers on motorcycles following them. MULDER looks in rearview mirror. One of the Officers is holding something up. It's a cell phone.)

(SCULLY is getting on a small jet.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, are you okay?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal... That, and I got to pee. Where are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm just about to board a justice department jet... Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.

MULDER: (on phone) Headed where?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, Mulder. You tell me.

MULDER: (on phone) I'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends but we can't stop, Scully. I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I think I have a loose theory as to what caused this.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, lay it on me.

SCULLY: (on phone) Okay. Mulder, you know what ELF waves are? Extremely low radio transmissions?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. It uses an antenna, like, 50 miles long. The military uses it to communicate with the trident submarines, Project Seafarer, Project Haarp.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching beneath the edge of Patrick Crump's property. Now, ELF fields have been shown to... To produce biological effects in human tissue inducing electrical currents, altering chemical reactions.

MULDER: (on phone) Not to mention that as a potential weapons application it's been referred to as "electrical nerve gas" or may be behind the so-called "Taos Hum."

SCULLY: (on phone) What if some overload some... Some hum from this system could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull? I mean, what if it could induce a like hum that could... That could somehow exert a rising pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shattering it?

MULDER: (on phone) But with constant movement somehow ameliorating that pressure making it bearable. But why only westward movement?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean... I mean, maybe it has to follow certain lines of force electrical or magnetic. I mean, maybe...

MULDER: (on phone) The big question, Scully, is what do we do about it?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like.

(Long pause as MULDER listens to SCULLY. He cringes.)

MULDER: (on phone) We'll be there.

(MULDER hangs up.)

CRUMP: What?

MULDER: Well, whether they did this to you intentionally or not, you were right. They did it to you.

CRUMP: So, what do we... what do we do?

MULDER: Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end of the highway. There, she will insert a long, large-bore needle into your inner ear hopefully relieving the pressure. Now, when we get there she's going to have to work fast. She's only going to have one chance. She's not going to be able to use any anesthetic and it will probably leave you deaf.

CRUMP: (hopefully) But I'll live, right? Well, that's what it's all about. All right, man. (pats MULDER on the shoulder) Let's do it. Mr. Mulder, could you go a little faster, please? Just a little more is all I need.

MULDER: Sure.

(MULDER goes up to 90.)

CRUMP: (very weak) Go a little faster, please? Just a little bit faster.



SCENE 18
LOLETA, CALIFORNIA

(End of the highway. It dead ends into the rocky Pacific coast. SCULLY stands next to an ambulance holding a VERY evil looking enormous needle in her hand. Escorted by the CHP motorcycles, the station wagon approaches.)

SCULLY: Get ready!

(The wagon passes the ambulance and stops at the very end of the road. SCULLY runs up to it, but slows when she sees the blood splattered on the back window. MULDER gets out of the car and walks to the edge of the beach taking off his tie. SCULLY watches him as he crumples the tie in his hand and stares out over the water. [He might be peeing. Hands are in the right place.])



SCENE 19

(AD KERSH's office. MULDER and SCULLY stand in front of his desk as he reads the expense report out loud to them.)

AD KERSH: "Justice department jet: 2.6 turbine hours round trip at $1,400 an hour. Car rental - over-mileage, out-of-state use penalties: $346. Compensation to one Walter R. Duncan for unauthorized use of his 1968 Caprice station wagon: $500."

MULDER: Why don't you bill me?

AD KERSH: I'll bill your partner instead. You two obviously relish the role of martyr.

MULDER: Okay. So are we done here? Back to the bozo work investigating huge piles of manure?

AD KERSH: (needling MULDER) You can always quit.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY, then walks out of the office, slamming the door behind him.)

SCULLY: Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot.

AD KERSH: And you apologize for him a lot. I've noticed that about you.

SCULLY: I'm not apologizing for this. Because of his work, the DOD is shutting down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada. Our participation in this case has saved lives.

AD KERSH: I don't see you proving that. The Department of Defense admits no culpability whatsoever. Furthermore, they say the closing of the facility was coincidental.

SCULLY: ("yeah, right" tone) Right.

AD KERSH: Don't misunderstand me, Agent. I don't care if you and your partner saved a school bus full of doe-eyed urchins on their way to Sunday bible camp. You no longer investigate X-Files. You are done and the sooner you and Mulder come to recognize that, the better for both of you.

(SCULLY turns to leave the office.)

SCULLY: (under her breath, but loudly enough to be heard) Big piles of manure.

[THE END]

SCENE 2

(Night, or at least dark. Raining. Deck of large luxury liner. Several BRITISH SAILORS are lifting a man out of the water.)

SAILOR 1: Oi! Easy! Easy! Steady up! Hold on, mates. He's almost up. That's it. Give it a big pull! That's it. Don't drop him now. Come on! Pull him over! Put your backs into it! Come on!

( The rescued man, MULDER coughs. )

SAILOR 2: There he goes. Lots of life in him. Give it up, Matey. Good for ya. That's what you get for your trouble.

SAILOR 1: Maybe he's just taking a long swim.

SAILOR 2: Yeah. Or a short flight. You an airman, Mate? Oi?

(Hits MULDER.)

SAILOR 1: No, he's not dressed like an airman.

SAILOR 2: What kind of uniform is that, then? Sprechen sie deutsche, jah?

(MULDER groans as someone else hits him.)

SAILOR 1: I say he's a rat and we throw him overboard like a rat.

SAILOR 2: Right. Let's give him the heave-ho!

(The SAILORS pick him up again and lead him to the edge of the deck.)

MULDER: (weakly) Hey 

SAILOR 1: How's about another dip in the Atlantic, huh, dirty Jerry?

SAILOR 2: Even the sharks won't eat him.

SAILOR 1: Oi! What you got to say for yourself, Jerry, before we throw you back in?

MULDER: My name's not Jerry.

SAILOR 1: What's that? Eh?

MULDER: My name's Mulder. Fox Mulder.

SAILOR 2: That a name? Mulder?

MULDER: I got ID in my pocket.

SAILOR 1: (pulling out and reading MULDER's badge) "Fox Mulder, Federal Bureau of Investigation." Sorry, mate, never heard of it!

(They begin dragging MULDER below decks.)

MULDER: (surprised) Never heard of it?

SAILOR 2: Tell you what we do with foxes. (laugh) Care to know?

MULDER: You never heard of the FBI?

SAILOR 2: Why don't you shut up, Jerry, before we change our minds here.

MULDER: Where are you taking me?

SAILOR 1: Where'd you pick up that accent?

SAILOR 2: Probably in the Fuhrer's Secret Service. Come on.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SAILOR 2: I say we cut him open and see what color he bleeds. Dirty Jerry. Deutschland Uber Alles.

(SAILOR 2 spits at MULDER. They are now inside the nice living quarters of the ship.)

MULDER: (confused) "Deutschland Uber Alles"? Wait a second.

SAILOR 2: Oi, how's about you shove a cork in it, mate. All right?

(SAILOR knocks at a cabin door with an ornate brass plaque. The British captain of the ship, CAPTAIN HARBURG opens the door. )

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Eh? What's this about?

SAILOR 2: ( whispering ) Found him in the water, sir. Don't know nothing about him. I think he's a German.

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Bring the prisoner in my room.

(They pull MULDER into the CAPTAIN's cabin and hold him while the CAPTAIN punches him twice.)

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Friend or foe?

MULDER: What?

CAPTAIN HARBURG: To what flag do you pledge allegiance?

MULDER: I think there's been a mistake. I think the mistake is mine.

(MULDER grunts as the CAPTAIN punches him again.)

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Speak the truth, man.

MULDER: This is the Queen Anne, isn't it?

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Aye.

(CAPTAIN starts to hit him again. MULDER stops his hand nonaggressively.)

MULDER: Hey, just about enough of that. I came looking for this ship.

(SAILOR 1 holds up a knife to MULDER's throat.)

SAILOR 1: Say the word, Captain, I'll make him the first of the rest.

MULDER: Hold on a second. I think I can explain what's going on.

SAILOR 2: It's a ruse, Captain.

MULDER: What's our current position?

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Cut the spy up.

(SAILORS begin to drag MULDER back out of the room.)

MULDER: I'll tell you. I'll tell you. We're two degrees above the 30th parallel. Sargasso Sea. Just above the Tropic of Cancer. 64 degrees West by Southwest. Off the Plantagenet bank 60 miles South-southwest off Bermuda. How would I know that if I'd been in the water?

CAPTAIN HARBURG: Aye, that's a damn good question, lad. I'm waiting for a damn good answer.

MULDER: Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that you haven't been able to get accurate compass readings. That navigation's been a real bitch. It's because you've been caught in something called "The Devil's Triangle." I can show you on the chart here. (crosses to wall chart) It goes from Bermuda down to Puerto Rico and back up to Florida. The Queen Anne is stuck here on the Eastern edge of it. You've been caught in some kind of time warp. In some kind of limbo dimension and now you've popped out the other side into 1998.

SAILOR 1: 1998?!

SAILOR 2: This man is mad.

SAILOR 3: Let him tell it to the fishes.

CAPTAIN HARBURG: I'm done fooling about, man. There's a war on. And in it or no, I don't plan to lose me mind nor me ship to the likes of a jackal like you.

MULDER: (laughing) You can relax. There's no war going on. The world is at peace. There's a little trouble over at our White House but that'll blow over, so to speak.

CAPTAIN MARBURG: Peace? It's September 3rd, 1939, man! Hitler has entered Poland. And we've just been boarded by a bunch of his goose-stepping hooligans so don't speak to me of peace, lad. Tell Mother England.

MULDER: (showing them the date on his watch like they would believe him) No, no. It's not September 3rd. It's November 16th. Look.

(There is a knock at the door. FIRST MATE enters.)

FIRST MATE: Excuse me, captain.

CAPTAIN MARBURG: Aye.

FIRST MATE: Sir, the Germans, sir. They've taken control of the bridge. Steering a course for their homeland.

CAPTAIN MARBURG: Not on the watch of captain Yip Harburg, they're not. Lock the prisoner up in here.

MULDER: It's okay. The war's over. Let them take you to Germany. They make nice cars.

(The SAILORS and CAPTAIN MARBURG ignore him, leave and lock the door behind them.)

MULDER: (to himself, grinning, thrilled) This is unbelievable.

(MULDER crosses to the radio and begins turning dials and speaking into the microphone.)

MULDER: (into radio) Mayday, mayday. This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. I'm on the SS Queen Anne. (tries another channel) Ship in distress. Mayday, mayday.

(Still turning the dial, MULDER picks up a radio broadcast.)

RADIO: The British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them that they are prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war would exist between us. No such undertaking has been received. Consequently, as of today, September 3, 1939 this country is at war with Germany.

(MULDER sits listening, staring straight ahead in shock.)

MULDER: Oh, sh.

(MULDER turns away from the radio at the sound of a key turning in the lock.)

GERMAN SOLDIER: Hello? Sind Sie da drinnen? Hallo? Ist da jemand? [Are you in there? Hello? Is anybody in there?] Hello?

(GERMAN SOLDIER enters the now dark room. We can't see his face. He is looking around the room.)

RADIO: CLOSING OF PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT: All cinemas, theatres and other places of entertainment are to be closed immediately until further notice. The evacuation of British children is going on smoothly and efficiently. The ministry of health says that great progress...

(As the GERMAN SOLDIER passes the radio, MULDER jumps out at him. They hit the radio switching the channel to the Andrews Sisters singing "Bei Mir Bist Du Schon" and proceed to quietly beat each other up. MULDER wins and gets a look at the unconscious GERMAN SOLDIER. It is a 1939 version of AGENT SPENDER.)

MULDER: What the hell is going on? Spender?

(MULDER begins to strip 1939 SPENDER as the camera pans around and out into the hall. Now dressed in the 1939 SPENDER's German uniform, MULDER begins walking down the hall. At the other end of the hall, some NAZI SOLDIERS spot him. They speak to his back.

NAZI 1: He, hast du was gefunden? Bleib doch stehen! Hörst du nicht? Umdrehen! Hast du was gefunden? Warten Sie mal! Halt, stehen bleiben! Warten Sie! Maenner, kommt rueber! Wo kann er denn sein? [Hey, have you found something? Stop! Don't you hear? Turn around! Have you found something? Wait! Stop, stand still! Wait! Guys, come over here.Where can he be?]

MULDER doesn't answer or turn around. The NAZI SOLDIERS are no longer friendly.)

NAZI 1: Halt! Mach Schnell! Da rechts! Da rechts! Da rechts! [Stop! Hurry up! There on the right! There on the right! There on the right!]

(MULDER begins running. The NAZIs begin chasing MULDER through the halls of the ship. Twice, MULDER eludes them by slipping into a side hallway. Finally, MULDER going through a narrow hallway ends up in the ship's ballroom where the well dressed ship's passengers are dancing to the tunes of ELMIRA GULCH and the LOLLIPOP GUILD. MULDER wanders dazedly through the dancers up toward the orchestra which is playing "Jeepers Creepers." )

SINGER: IT'S GOT TO BE SUNNY TO ME WHEN YOUR EYES LOOK INTO MINE JEEPERS CREEPERS, WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS? GOSH, OH, GET UP, HOW'D THEY GET SO LIT UP?

MULDER: (quietly to himself looking up at the pretty blonde singer) Hi.

SINGER: JEEPERS CREEPERS, WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE PEEPERS?

(One of the couples is dancing near MULDER. They accidentally bump into MULDER.)

WOMAN: (accusingly) Excuse me.

(MULDER looks away from the singer and sees that the WOMAN is identical to SCULLY. She is dressed in a long burgundy dress. She is dancing with a BALD-HEADED MAN. MULDER, surprised, grabs her arm.)

MULDER: Scully?

1939 SCULLY: I suggest you get your Nazi paws off me before you get one in the kisser.

MULDER: (lifting the bill of his cap so she can see him) Scully, it's me, Mulder.

1939 SCULLY: Oh, you speak English, do you? Well, how'd you like to see the stars on the American flag? (holds her fist in front of his face)

MULDER: (offended, not understanding why she doesn't recognize him) I'm not a Nazi.

1939 SCULLY: Oh, sure. You just look like one, right?

(Turns back to keep dancing.)

MULDER: I had to steal this uniform. (putting his hands on her back) Scully?

(Suddenly, the SINGER stops the music and points down at MULDER.)

SINGER: Hier ist der mann, den sie vollen! [Here is the man you want!]

( The NAZIS near the door converge on MULDER. )

NAZI 1: (firing a gun into the air) Halt! Hande hoch! Hande hoch! [Stop! Hands up! Hands up!]

(MULDER looks blankly at 1939 SCULLY for help.)

1939 SCULLY: (translating) He said, "Put your hands up."

(MULDER puts his hands up. The NAZIs grab him.)

MULDER: (to 1939 SCULLY) You see, I told you.

(NAZI punches MULDER. The music resumes as the NAZIs drag MULDER back out of the ballroom. 1939 SCULLY goes back to dancing.)

SINGER: JEEPERS CREEPERS 

MULDER: You're all big men now but wait until you get into Russia. Hope you fellas like the cold.

SINGER: ...WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE EYES? HUSH, OH, GET UP, HOW'D THEY GET SO LIT UP?

(The NAZIS drag MULDER through the ship, through the rain, and up to the deck. They begin beating him. Mulder fights back, taking one of them down. They restrain him.)

NAZI 1: (shouting angrily in German) Auf schnell! Du hast Glueck, dass wir dich nicht sofort abknallen! [Get up fast! You're lucky that we don't shoot you right away!]

MULDER: Same to you, Adolf!

NAZI 1: (To MULDER) Schnauze! [Shut your trap!]

(To the other NAZIs.)

NAZI 1: Los! Mach schon. [Go! Get on with it!]

(They drag MULDER off. The NAZI that MULDER attacked gets up and follows. They end up at the helm. CAPTAIN MARBURG stands defiantly in front of the wheel. He is surrounded by NAZIS. We can't see the NAZI OFFICER's face yet.)

NAZI OFFICER: Bringen sie dieses schiff auf fahrtrichtung Deutschland oder wir schaffen sie vom steuer weg. Verstanden? [Turn this ship in the direction of Germany or we will remove you from the wheel, understood?]

CAPTAIN MARBURG: I'll not give up this ship!

NAZI OFFICER: Zeig ihm was ich meine. [Show him what I mean.]

CAPTAIN MARBURG: You can put me down, man, but I'll not let go of this wheel so 'till we meet in hell... (spits)

NAZI OFFICER: Ershiess ihn. [Shoot him.]

FIRST MATE: No!

(Camera pans around until CAPTAIN MARBURG is hidden behind the NAZI OFFICER. NAZI 2 shoots the CAPTAIN in the head. CAPTAIN falls dead. NAZI OFFICER turns. He is a 1939 version of CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. He lights a cigarette and looks at MULDER.)

MULDER: You...

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Wer ist dieser mann? [Who is this man?"]

NAZI 2: Er hat einen meiner leute zusammengeschlagen und seine uniform gestohlen. Er ist spion. [He beat up one of my people and stole his uniform. He is a spy.]

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Wo sind die waffen versteckt? [Where are the weapons?]

MULDER: No sprechen.

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Die waffen haben sie an bord, nicht? [You have the weapons on board, no?]

MULDER: I don't speak Nazi.

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Erschiess ihn auch. [Shoot him also.]

(NAZI 2 levels the gun at MULDER's head.)

MULDER: (slight panic) Wait a minute. Why are you shooting me? Why are you killing me? What have I done? I don't understand what you're asking me.

(Another NAZI, who looks just like SKINNER enters the helm.)

1939 SKINNER NAZI: Halt! Nicht schiessen. Dieser mann ist Amerikaner. Es heisst sie vollen mehr leute an dem krieg beteiligen. (hands MULDER's badge to 1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN.) [Stop! Don't shoot! This man is American. They say more people want to take part in the war...]

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Bring ihn nach unten. Bring alle nach unten. [Bring him under. Bring them all under.]

(MULDER's captors drag him back out of the helm.)

MULDER: (off screen) Skinner? Where are they taking me? Help me, Skinner!

(Commercial 1.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(SCULLY is sitting at her DESK!?!?!?!? in the FBI bullpen. The LONE GUNMEN approach her.)

SCULLY: What are you guys doing here?

FROHIKE: Mulder's in trouble.

LANGLY: Big trouble.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

BYERS: Let's take a walk.

SCULLY: Okay, where are we going?

(They walk a few paces away from her desk.)

FROHIKE: The walls have ears.

SCULLY: (impatient) I have ears. Will you tell me what's going on?

BYERS: Mulder's disappeared.

SCULLY: Disappeared from where?

LANGLY: From the national reconnaissance office's lacrosse mid-latitude imaging radar satellite.

(LANGLY hands her a photo.)

SCULLY: I don't understand. What am I looking at?

FOWLEY: A whole lot of nothing.

BYERS: We pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the NRO satellite, which early this morning sent a picture of a ship which inexplicably appeared in the middle of the Atlantic.

LANGLY: The SS Queen Anne which by all accounts vanished without a trace over sixty years ago.

SCULLY: The Queen Anne? The British luxury liner?

FROHIKE: That's correct.

SCULLY: It was torpedoed by a German U-boat.

LANGLY: That's one story.

SCULLY: There's another?

BYERS: Though her exact position was kept secret for fear spies might give her up to the Axis. It's been reasonably determined that the Queen Anne was just south of the Plantagenet bank when she went missing.

FROHIKE: Less than sixty feet of water yet she's never been found.

SCULLY: So you're saying the Queen Anne just disappeared.

LANGLY: Into the Bermuda triangle.

FROHIKE: And reappeared this morning at 6:49 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.

SCULLY: That's impossible.

BYERS: Satellite doesn't lie.

SCULLY: There's nothing on here.

BYERS: We gave the original images to Mulder so he could use them as navigational aids.

LANGLY: He was in a hurry.

SCULLY: To get where?

FROHIKE: Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else got there first.

SCULLY: He's gone out here?

BYERS: He went to Bermuda and chartered a powerboat out of Hamilton Harbor. We tracked him on the satellite for an hour and a half.

LANGLY: Until a storm blew in and obscured all transmissions.

FROHIKE: That's what you're holding.

SCULLY: What's happened to him?

BYERS: We can't know that. Not without alternative tracking data. Which is why we're here.

LANGLY: Without good data, all we can do is wait and hope for the best.

FROHIKE: Yeah, but expect the worst.

SCULLY: Well, we have to get help.

(SCULLY goes back to her desk and doesn't stop moving for the rest of the scene.)

BYERS: Without a position he's a needle in a haystack.

SCULLY: What do you need?

BYERS: Navy AWACS SLAR or SAR 100 K swath imaging. You're going to have to find somebody at the Pentagon to get it.

SCULLY: (writing down the information) Wait for me downstairs.

(SCULLY takes her note and leaves the GUNMEN. She walks purposefully down the hall and into SKINNER's SECRETARY's office.)

SCULLY: (to SKINNER's SECRETARY) I need to speak with him.

SKINNER'S SECRETARY: Could you please take a seat?

SCULLY: Is he in?

SKINNER'S SECRETARY: Yes, he's on his phone.

SCULLY: Sorry, this can't wait.

(SCULLY walks into SKINNER's office. He is on the phone.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: (on phone) Could you hold on a minute? (to SCULLY) What is it, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I just received some very disturbing information, sir. I need your help.

SKINNER: (on phone) I'll call you back in five. (puts down phone and turns to SCULLY) You can't come rushing in here.

(They speak quietly and urgently.)

SCULLY: Sir, I couldn't waste time explaining myself to your assistant.

SKINNER: Tell me what is so urgent.

SCULLY: It's about Agent Mulder. He's done something incredibly rash.

SKINNER: I can't.

SCULLY: He may be lost at sea.

SKINNER: I can't, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: You can't what?

SKINNER: I can't help you. There's nothing I can do.

SCULLY: This isn't for me; it's for Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: My hands are tied. I'm not your direct superior any longer.

SCULLY: Don't you want to know what this is about?

(They walk back toward door.)

SKINNER: No, I don't. I don't even what to hear it.

SCULLY: (pleading) Sir, this is about a man's life.

SKINNER: (louder) I'm not allowed to have contact with you-- any contact with either you or Mulder.

SKINNER'S SECRETARY: She walked right past me, sir.

(SCULLY closes the door between the offices.)

SKINNER: You're out of line, Scully.

SCULLY: No, sir, you're out of line. I'm sorry, but I'm coming to you for help and I've got nowhere else to go. I would hope that after everything that we have been through that you would at least have the courtesy and the decency and not to mention the respect to listen to what I have to say. Now, all I need is information. (SKINNER takes SCULLY's note and glances over it.) You don't have to do anything else. Look, sir, if you know anybody at the Office of Naval Intelligence it would be of great help.

SKINNER: (after a pause, hands back the note) I could lose my job, my pension, I could even be subject to legal action.

(SCULLY sighs in exasperation and starts to open the door, but SKINNER slams it back shut and keeps his hand on it.)

SKINNER: Use your head, Scully. It'll save your ass.

SCULLY: Save your own ass, sir. You'll save your head along with it.

(SCULLY crosses to the double doors that lead directly out of SKINNER's office, looks back a moment, then goes out into the hall. She goes down the hall to a very cool version of the X-Files theme and gets on a crowded elevator and roughly hits a button. She waits impatiently as the car rises, slapping the paper in her hands sharply, getting a very odd look from another female passenger, then quickly exits, accidentally hitting a fellow passenger with the note as she does.)

WOMAN IN THE ELEVATOR: Ouch!

SCULLY: (turning quickly) Sorry.

(SCULLY enter AD KERSH's SECRETARY's office. It is empty. SCULLY turns and is almost back out of the office when the SECRETARY comes out of KERSH's office. She looks JUST like the singer on the ship in 1939.)

KERSH'S SECRETARY: Yes, sir, I'll get those files and make that call and buzz you when I have him on the line.

SCULLY: I need a word with AD Kersh.

KERSH'S SECRETARY: I'm sorry, he's not available.

(SCULLY sees AD KERSH in his office.)

SCULLY: Assistant Director Kersh, may I please have a moment of your time?

AD KERSH: A moment for what?

SCULLY: Uh, may I, sir? (enters the office) Thank you. Sir, I need you to get me some information. (holds up notepaper) I am not a liberty to say why but I can tell you it is of the utmost importance

(SCULLY turns and sees CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN standing in KERSH's office.)

AD KERSH: Yes?

SCULLY: . I, uh... Sorry. I shouldn't have come unannounced.

AD KERSH: (oh so smoothly) May I see what you were going to show me, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Uh... It's nothing, really.

AD KERSH: (taking the notepaper from her) Good.

(With nothing else to say, SCULLY leaves the office, expressing with just her back complete disgust with herself for being so foolish. She raises her hands briefly and turns around in the hall thinking. She has a sudden idea.)

SCULLY: What am I thinking? What am I thinking?

(She pulls out her cell phone, hits speed dial, and heads back for the elevator running into someone on the way.)

SCULLY: Sorry.

(She catches the elevator just before the doors close. She is alone in the car.)

SCULLY: (whispering, willing someone to answer the phone, hitting button for the basement) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Answer the phone, Mulder. Answer the phone, answer the phone, answer the phone.

RECORDED VOICE: The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding or is 

SCULLY: (hanging up) Damn.

(SCULLY exits the elevator and enters the X-Files office.)

SCULLY: (direct) I want you to do me a favor. It's not negotiable. Either you do it or I kill you. You understand?

(SPENDER is alone in the office. He gets up and crosses to her.)

SPENDER: You okay, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: No, I'm not. I'm a gun ready to go off so don't test me, Spender. Don't even think about trying to weasel me.

SPENDER: What is it that you need?

SCULLY: (writing it down for him) Navy AWACS SLAR 100 K swath. South-southeast of Bermuda. I am looking for a boat, maybe a ship. 1939 luxury liner.

SPENDER: 1939?

SCULLY: Don't ask too many questions. I don't care what you do or who you do or who you have to grease, I need that information and I need it now. Are we clear on that?

SPENDER: Crystal.

SCULLY: And, Agent Spender... If you're not back in a hurry I am going to hunt you down, and so help me God... (she clenches her hand in a fist)

SPENDER: Right.

(He leaves the office.)

SCULLY: (under her breath) Oh, God.

(Phone on SPENDER's desk rings. SCULLY stares at it, then picks it up.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: (voice) Agent Fowley?

SCULLY: (on phone, pause, slightly lowers voice) Yes.

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: (voice) I was looking for Agent Spender.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry, he's not here right now. Is there something I can help you with?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: (voice) Yeah, Agent Scully just handed the Assistant Director a piece of paper with an intelligence system scribbled on it.. (pause).

SCULLY: Yes? Yes, sir?

CIGARETTE-SMOKING MAN: (voice, pause) Who is this?

(SCULLY hangs up slowly. Begins to leave. Phone rings again behind her. SCULLY runs into KERSH'S SECRETARY.)

KERSH'S SECRETARY: Oh, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I was just, uh...

KERSH'S SECRETARY: I was sent to come get you.

SCULLY: Yeah, I was waiting for Agent Spender, he was, uh... I'm supposed to pick up a delivery from him.

KERSH'S SECRETARY: Agent Spender is with Assistant Director Kersh.

SCULLY: (furious) That rat bastard!

(SCULLY runs to elevator.)

SCULLY: (to herself) Stupid!

(Her cell phone rings. )

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully. (she can barely hear the other person) Mulder? (hopefully) Is that you? No, I can't... I'm on an elevator. Hold on, I'll be off in a s... Hold on.

(Doors open. SCULLY steps out, sees KERSH, SPENDER, and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN standing in the hall talking. She ducks back in the elevator.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello? No... I can't understand. I can't...

(Doors open revealing SKINNER also holding a cell phone to his ear.)

SKINNER: Was that you?

SCULLY: Is it you?

SKINNER: (joining her in the elevator) I've been trying to reach you. I got the information you needed.

(SCULLY takes the paper, grabs him and kisses him on the lips firmly.)

SCULLY: How?

SKINNER: Don't even ask.

SCULLY: (grateful) Sir, what you've done...

SKINNER: Is save Mulder's ass. I know.

SCULLY: Yes.

(Doors open. Other agents are in the hall.)

SKINNER: (sternly) And if you ever ask me to break policy or protocol I will have you written up, wrapped up and tossed out of the FBI for good. Am I understood, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes.

(She whips around and runs back into the elevator.)

SCULLY: (excited) Yes.

(She realizes there is another Agent in the car with her. She tries to be calm but reads the info from SKINNER excitedly. The other Agent looks at her strangely. When the doors open, she darts out into the garage. Sound of VW bus approaching. She gets in the back with FROHIKE who slams the door.)

BYERS: Did you get it?

SCULLY: (holding up paper triumphantly) Yeah.

(VW Bus drives away. Man -SPENDER?- runs after them, but they get away.)



SCENE 4

(1939. MULDER and the SAILORS are being led by the NAZIS down into the hold of the ship.)

SAILOR 2: Oi... American, right? Saved your life, mate. Krauts don't want no reason to bring you Yanks into the war.

MULDER: I got two words for you, buddy-- Pearl Harbor.

SAILOR 2: What?

MULDER: After Poland, Hitler's on his way to Denmark, Holland and France with a few stops in between. The French all but roll over on us, the Italians seize their opportunity and the Japanese come through the back door. It's a long, bloody story. It fortunately has a happy ending.

SAILOR 2: We win?

MULDER: Yeah, you come out on the side of history with no small amount of help from us. Not much to apologize over the next 50 years except for maybe the Spice Girls.

NAZI 1: Schnauze halten, verdammt noch mal! Raus mir euch! Vorwaerts, worauf wartet ihr? Mach schon! Los! [Shut your trap, damn it! Get out of here! Go on, what are you waiting for?]

(Opens door into the engine room. They enter and the NAZI locks the door behind them.)

SAILOR 1: Well... According to our host this'll be our new accommodations, lads.

MULDER: You speak German. What was that shouting about up there?

SAILOR 1: They got it in mind that we left America carrying arms to England.

MULDER: Are we?

SAILOR 1: Listen, she's drawing 16 feet at 81,000 tons. We're making 21 knots at full power. If we got munitions aboard this ship, mate, they don't weigh but a few stone.

MULDER: But the Captain knew something. He wouldn't give up the wheel.

SAILOR 1: The Nazis boarded us after they intercepted a radio communication... Some kind of code word they keep asking about-- Thor's Hammer. You know what that is, mate?

(CREWMAN 1, Jamaican, approaches them.)

CREWMAN 1: Who go there? I said, "who goes there?"

CREWMAN 2: Show your faces or we'll bloody beat them to a stub.

SAILOR: Put your irons down, boys. It's your own crew, for God's sake.

CREWMAN 2: What're you doing down here?

SAILOR: We're having a cup of tea. What's it look like, you stupid swabbo?

CREWMAN 2: Then who's steering the boat?

SAILOR 3: Oh, just some blokes who answer to the name of Heil Hitler.

SAILOR 2: You ever been to Germany, swabbo? They'll have a special affection for the likes of you.

SAILOR 4: Yeah, right.

MULDER: Hey, this ship can't go to Germany.

SAILOR 2: Make up your mind, mate.

MULDER: I got news for you-- you're not carrying munitions. It's something far more deadly.

SAILOR 1: Thor's Hammer?

MULDER: Thor's Hammer isn't a weapon. It's a man, a man who will help build a weapon-- a bomb that'll win the war for whoever has it.

SAILOR 1: And you're telling me he's aboard this ship?

MULDER: I saw him in the ballroom.

(SAILOR 1 grins and crosses to the door. He bangs on it and the NAZI opens it.)

SAILOR 1: Sein name ist Thor's Hammer. Er hat einen plan, eine bombe zu bauen. Auf wiedersehen... Mates. [His name is Thor's Hammer. He has a plan to build a bomb. Goodbye, mates.*

(SAILOR 1 goes out and the NAZI slams the door back.)

CREWMAN 2: (in MULDER's face) What's wrong with you?! Don't you know there are spies everywhere?! Trust no one, mon!

SAILOR 2: Look, we've got to stop this ship-- now! All right, lads, let's go!

(The SAILORS and MULDER go deeper into the engine area of the hold. More CREWMEN.)

SAILOR 2: Hey, hey, who's in charge of this engine room? Oh, you. Oi, you! I'm talking to you. Shut her down, man. We got to scuttle her now!

CREWMAN 3: Put some piss into her, boys.

(He's Kersh's double.)

SAILOR 2: Hey, you heard him-- kill the engines! There's no other way, swabbo.

CREWMAN 3: (showing the chains they have put on the engine) You can't get to Germany if you can't steer. Me overriding her. We steering a course for home.

SAILOR 2: Have you looked at your compass? You can't get to England going the wrong bloody direction.

CREWMAN 3: We're not going to England. We're going to Jamaica.

CREWMEN: Yeah!

SAILOR 3: Listen, you steer her home, you bloody ruffo-- to her home where she belongs!

MULDER: Listen to me! Listen to me! You can't take this ship to England. You'll never make it.

CREWMEN AND SAILORS: What are you talking about? I'm in charge of the wheel!

CREWMAN 3: There's only one place she's going, Yank. Jamaica!

CREWMWN: Yeah!

MULDER: You can't take the ship to Jamaica, either. The Germans will hunt you down no matter what course you steer.

CREWMEN: No! No! Hear it out. Hear it out. Hear it out.

CREWMAN 3: And who you be, boy?

MULDER: My name's Mulder.

SAILOR 2: He wants to go back to bloody America.

MULDER: No, I want you to take this ship and turn it back around the way you came.

CREWMEN AND SAILORS: No! No!

SAILOR 2: Bloody hell, we're halfway home!

MULDER: You've got to turn the ship around.

CREWMAN 3: And what's in that direction?

MULDER: The future.

SAILOR 2: What?

MULDER: Actually, the past.

SAILOR 3: Hmm? Oh, well, I'm convinced.

MULDER: Well, I can explain it to you.

NAZI 1: (entering) Du! Der Amerikaner. Du kommst mit uns, rauf hier. Ja, mit kommen. -[You! The American. You come with us, up here. Yes, come with?]-

MULDER: (to the SAILORS and CREWMEN) Turn the ship around or Hitler rises, Germany wins and your children will never know what freedom is!

(NAZIS drag MULDER back out and down the halls.)

NAZI 1: (to the GUESTS) Halt! Halt! Stehen bleiben! Stehen bleiben oder ich schiesse! Stehen bleiben! -[Stop! Stop! Stand still! Stand still or I shoot! Stand still!]-

(They reach the ballroom. Music has stopped. Passengers are all gathered. 1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and 1939 SPENDER stand together. NAZIS bring MULDER to them.)

NAZI: Achtung! [Attention!]

1939 SPENDER: (to MULDER) Aufstehen. Mach schnell! Get up! Er sagte... [Get up! Hurry! Get up! He said?]

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Wir haben einen mann an bord, einen wissenschaftler der weiss wie man eine bombe macht die den krieg gewinnin wird. Frag ihn, wer dieser mann ist.

1939 SPENDER: (translating) There's a scientist on board who can make a bomb. Who is this man?

MULDER: (quietly) I don't know.

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (to NAZI 2) Waffe bereit. -[Weapon ready.]

(NAZI 2 cocks his gun. Passengers gasp.)

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (to 1939 SPENDER) Sag ihm, wir werden einen passagier umbringen fuer jede falsche antwort. [Tell him, we will kill one passenger for every wrong answer.]

1939 SPENDER: (to MULDER) You will answer the question or we will begin killing passengers. Which one is the scientist?

MULDER: (quietly) I don't know.

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Schiess ihn. [Shoot him.]

( NAZI walks down the row of passengers, including 1939 SCULLY. He selects a white haired older man and executes him. Paaengers gasp and some cry.)

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Frag ihn, wie viele personen er sterben lasst. [Ask him how many people he will let die?]

1939 SPENDER: How many lives are you willing to sacrifice?

MULDER: None.

1939 SPENDER: Then you have the answer. Er weigert sich ihn zu nennen. [He hesitates to name him.]

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Schiess nochmal. [Shoot again.]

(There is another gunshot and gasping off screen. )

1939 SCULLY: Stop! This man has no answers. (walks up and gets right in 1939 SPENDER's face) You're killing innocent people to learn that he knows nothing!

1939 SPENDER: Shut up. Shut up and move away.

1939 SCULLY: Listen to me, you little weasel...

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Wir haben unseren naechsten passagier, eine dame. Richte die waffe auf sie. Schiess sie... Wenn er die frage nicht beantwortet. [We have our next passenger, a lady. Aim the weapon at her. Kill her, if he does not answer the question.]

(1939 SPENDER aims gun at 1939 SCULLY's head.)

1939 SPENDER: (to MULDER) Answer the question.

(Pause. MULDER, standing beside 1939 SCULLY reaches out and pushes the gun out of the way and steps between 1939 SPENDER and 1939 SCULLY.)

MULDER: I'll answer the question.

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Beantworte die frage. [Answer the question.]

(MULDER points down to the first man killed.)

MULDER: That man is the scientist.

(1939 SCULLY crosses over to MULDER. 1939 SPENDER points the gun at her again.)



SCENE 5

(1998. Twilight. Small boat near the Queen Anne. Lights are on.)

FROHIKE: Hey, Scully, you're not going to believe this. Get up here.

SCULLY: (coming up from the cabin) What?

FROHIKE: The sky just cleared and there it was.

SCULLY: Is it the Queen Anne?

BYERS: That's her.

SCULLY: I don't believe it.

FROHIKE: Seeing is believing.

SCULLY: They've got power.

BYERS: Maybe Mulder's already on board.

SCULLY: Let's hope he is.

(CUT TO: Ballroom 1939.)

1939 SPENDER: (still holding gun on MULDER and 1939 SCULLY) You're lying.

1939 SCULLY: He's telling the truth.

1939 SPENDER: Shut up! Who is the scientist?

MULDER: (pointing down) I told you, this man is the scientist.

1939 SPENDER: Officer! (or something German - another NAZI gets the dead man's ID and hands it to 1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN.)

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Frag ihn, wie der mann heisst?

1939 SPENDER: (translating) What is the man's name?

MULDER: John Brown. Ask me again, and I'll knock you down.

1939 SPENDER: What's his name?!

MULDER: Puddintame. Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.

(BALD-HEADED MAN approaches.)

SCIENTIST: Wait. Don't shoot. I'm the scientist.

1939 SCULLY: This man's a liar. I'm the scientist.

SCIENTIST: Please-- tell them the truth before someone else has to die.

1939 SCULLY: I don't know this man.

SCIENTIST: Please don't listen to her. She's traveling with me to protect me. She works for the OSS.

(They take the SCIENTIST away.)

MULDER: (whispering sarcastically to 1939 SCULLY) That's great.

1939 SCULLY: I don't see you did any better.

(1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN looks at them for a long moment.)

1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (to NAZI 2) Toete sie zuerst. Toete sie alle. [Kill them first. Kill them all.]

MULDER: What'd he say?

(NAZIS push 1939 SCULLY then MULDER to their knees. MULDER briefly rests his hand on her shoulder. 1939 CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and 1939 SPENDER leave.)

MULDER: Uh...I think I know what he said.

1939 SCULLY: You learn fast.

(MULDER and 1939 SCULLY kneel together, heads slightly bowed. Armed NAZI stands behind them. All is too quiet.)

1939 SCULLY: What's happening?

MULDER: The engines shut down.

(Suddenly, all the CREWMEN and SAILORS come running into the ballroom and engage the NAZI SOLDIERS in a bottle smashing, table throwing free-for-all to swing-time sound score.)

(CUT TO: Still with same swing music underscoring, SCULLY and the LONE GUNMEN search the deserted halls of the ship with flashlights. SCULLY separates from the GUNMEN.)

(CUT TO: 1939 ballroom.)

MULDER: Hey!

1939 SCULLY: Hey, what?

MULDER: Come with me.

1939 SCULLY: Why should I?

MULDER: 'Cause you're the only one who can save this ship. Come on.

(MULDER and 1939 SCULLY begin crawling out of the ballroom avoiding the fight around them.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY walking through hall. LONE GUNMEN join her.)

(CUT TO: MULDER and 1939 SCULLY running out of ballroom and into hall. From behind them they hear:)

MULDER: (taking her hand) Come on.

NAZI: Stehen bleiben! Stehen bleiben... Oder ich erscheisse sie. Hande hoche... Hintr irhen kopfe. Machen sies! [Stand still! Stand still. Or I will shoot you. Hands up...behind your heads. Do it!]

(They stop. 1939 SCULLY sighs and puts her hands behind her head. MULDER follows suit.)

1939 SCULLY: (to MULDER) Now what, Einstein?

NAZI: Machen sies! [Do it!]-

(There is a gunshot. They both jump then turn to see the NAZI dead on the floor behind them. From the side hall, 1939 SKINNER appears. )

1939 SKINNER: God bless America. Now get your asses out of here.

(MULDER and 1939 SCULLY run down a hall. Camera frame splits the screen into two halves of the same hall. MULDER and 1939 SCULLY start back down the hall. From the other side we hear SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Byers? Langly? Frohike?

(The SCULLYs cross frames seamlessly, then pause and look back as if at each other. SCULLY continues on. MULDER grabs 1939 SCULLY's hand and urges her on the other direction.)

MULDER: Come on... Come on!

(They run off.)

SCULLY: (finding the GUNMEN) There you guys are.

(Another spilt screen as SCULLY and the GUNMEN enter the ballroom. Lots of yelling, screaming in 1939, but SCULLY and the GUNMEN walk through a deserted, but messy room, as if post fight.)

(CUT TO: MULDER and 1939 SCULLY come out on the deck of the ship. Still night.)

1939 SCULLY: What are you doing?!

MULDER: I'm going to tell you how to save this ship.

1939 SCULLY: Out here?

MULDER: I can't stay. I got to get back to history.

1939 SCULLY: What?

MULDER: (holding her arms) And you got to rescue it. Wait. Listen to me. This ship's been caught in something called the devil's triangle. It's some kind of time warp-- a rift in space.

1939 SCULLY: Are you crazy?

MULDER: You know Einstein, right? He predicts the theoretical possibility. He also predicts an atomic weapon that will destroy the world.

1939 SCULLY: Yeah? So what?

MULDER: If you don't go back and convince the crew of this ship to turn this ship around and head back into the devil's triangle everything Einstein predicted will become true-- except for the outcome of history.

1939 SCULLY: So, if I don't turn this ship around...?

MULDER: In all likelihood, I won't exist.

1939 SCULLY: (disbelieving) Oh...

MULDER: And neither will you.

1939 SCULLY: Okay...

MULDER: So, in case we never meet again...

(MULDER grabs her and kisses her long and hard. She kisses back. He releases her. She looks at him for a moment, then pulls back her right fist and punches him. MULDER rubs his jaw while 1939 SCULLY reacts silently to the pain in her own hand that slugging him caused her.)

MULDER: I was expecting a left.

(MULDER runs away from her and climbs over the rail of the ship.)

1939 SCULLY: Hey!

(MULDER jumps and falls to the water. Frame spilts. 1939 SCULLY runs to the rail and throws a round white life preserver over the side.)

(CUT TO: Twilight. Body being lifted out of the water into a small boat with four people.)



SCENE 6

(MULDER is lying on his side in a hospital bed, unconscious. SCULLY leans over him.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, it's me. Hmm?

MULDER: (waking) Where am I? (tries to sit up)

SCULLY: You're in a hospital.

MULDER: Ooooo.

SCULLY: Lie still.

MULDER: I feel... Like hell.

SCULLY: I don't blame you. You've been through the wringer, I'd say.

MULDER: What happened to me?

SCULLY: You did something incredibly stupid.

MULDER: What did I do?

SCULLY: You went looking for a ship, Mulder. In the Bermuda Triangle.

MULDER: Say that again?

(GUNMEN enter the room.)

FROHIKE: Gilligan awakes.

MULDER: You were there.

SCULLY: Hmm?

MULDER: You were there, Scully.

(SKINNER enters.)

LANGLY: (to the others) He's delirious.

MULDER: (referring to SKINNER) And he was there, too.

SKINNER: (dropping a bouquet of flowers on the nightstand) Right-- Me and my dog Toto.

MULDER: No, you were there with the Nazis.

SCULLY: Mulder, will you settle down? It's an order.

SKINNER: Not that he takes orders...

(MULDER rests the back of his hand against SCULLY's waist which is against his bed rail. He is happy, yet very drugged.)

MULDER: You saved the world, Scully.

SCULLY: Yeah... You're right. I did.

FROHIKE: What kind of drugs is he on?

LANGLY: I want some.

MULDER: No, no, no.... The Queen Anne-- I found it. You were there with Thor's Hammer. I told you you had to turn the ship around and then I jumped overboard.

SCULLY: Yeah, I bet you did. The boat that you were on was busted into a million pieces. And as for the Queen Anne it was nothing more than a ghost ship.

MULDER: No, no, no. You and I were on that ship, Scully. In 1939.

SKINNER: Get some rest, Mulder, 'cause when you get out of here I'm going to kick your butt but good.

(SKINNER and the GUNMEN leave the room.)

MULDER: I would've never seen you again. But you believed me.

SCULLY: In your dreams. (as if talking to a child) Mulder, I want you to close your eyes and I want you to think to yourself "there's no place like home."

MULDER: Mmm. ( chuckles )

(SCULLY starts to leave. He calls her back.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully. (leans up on his elbow)

(SCULLY comes back and leans close to his face.)

SCULLY: Yes?

(Long pause. They look deeply at one another.)

MULDER: I love you.

SCULLY: Oh, brother... (turns away and leaves the room)

(MULDER, perhaps a little hurt, watches her go. He starts to lie down, but as soon as his face touches the pillow he pulls back up in slight pain and rubs his jaw where 1939 SCULLY hit him. He gazes after her and smiles. Screen shifts over to credits.)

[THE END]
                                   DREAMLAND PART I



SCENE 1
HIGHWAY 375
RURAL NEVADA
11:17 PM

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY driving along a desert road. There are no other cars in sight. They pass a metal sign: "WARNING US MILITARY INSTALLATION DO NOT ENTER RESTRICTED AREA USE OF DEADLY POISON IN "

MULDER: (pointing at a sign) Milepost 134. Two miles to go.

SCULLY: (dryly) I'm all a-tingle. (they share a look) So, Mulder, this supposed clandestine source who's contacted you how do we know that he's not just another crackpot whose encyclopedic knowledge of extraterrestrial life isn't derived exclusively from reruns of Star Trek?

MULDER: Because of where this particular crackpot works. Groom Lake. Area 51. Where the military has conducted...

SCULLY:  for the past 50 years, classified experiments involving extraterrestrial technology.

MULDER: It's all our questions. The proof that we've suspected but never been able to hold in our hands. That... that proof is here.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's the dim hope of finding that proof that's kept us in this car, or one very much like it for more nights than I care to remember. (MULDER looks at her fondly) Driving hundreds if not thousands of miles through neighborhoods and cities and towns where people are raising families and buying homes and playing with their kids and their dogs, and... in short, living their lives. While we - we - we just keep driving.

MULDER: What is your point?

SCULLY: Don't you ever just want to stop? Get out of the damn car? Settle down and live something approaching a normal life?

MULDER: (defensive) This *is* a normal life.

( SCULLY smiles to herself. They hear tires squealing and see two pairs of headlights approaching very quickly from the rear. )

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: I don't know if we're going to meet that crackpot after all.

(They stop as a total of four official-looking white sport utility vehicles surround them. Several armed SOLDIERS get out.)

SOLDIER 1: Out of the car.

(One of the SOLDIERS cocks his rifle.)

SOLDIER 1: Out of the car, sir. Ma'am.

(MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car with their hands raised and stand in front of their car. From one of the vehicles a man wearing a dark suit and white shirt emerges. He is MORRIS FLETCHER - early 40's, slight paunch. He is smoking a cigarette. As he approaches MUDLER and SCULLY, he drops his cigarette on the pavement and grinds it out with his foot.)

MORRIS FLETCHER: May I see some identification please?

(MULDER and SCULLY reach into their pockets and pull out their badges.)

MORRIS FLETCHER: (reading their badges, sighs) FBI. You're going to have to turn around and leave immediately.

MULDER: Why? It's a public highway.

MORRIS FLETCHER: It also borders on a US Government testing ground. What's your business here? (no response) What are you doing out here in the middle of the night?

MULDER: What are you doing out here?

SCULLY: Hiding top secret test flights? (MULDER looks at her) Using technology from UFOs?

MORRIS FLETCHER: (sarcastically) Flying saucers. I got a top secret for you. (to MULDER's ear) There's no such thing as flying saucers.

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder, let's...

(SCULLY pauses as they all hear a rumbling sound. They see a bright light on the horizon that quickly gets closer and passes overhead. As it does, MULDER steps away from SCULLY and looks up in wonder at the bright light. The light passes over and disappears. MULDER looks back down over at . MORRIS, now wearing MULDER's clothes, standing with SCULLY. No one gives any indication that they are aware that something just flew over them or that anything happened.)

SCULLY: (to MORRIS) Come on, Mulder, let's go.

(As MULDER, now wearing MORRIS's clothes standing in MORRIS's place stares in shock, SCULLY gets back into the passenger seat and MORRIS gets into the drivers seat.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

MULDER (as MORRIS) is David Duchovny playing Mulder. We see him as he really is - Mulder, but everyone else sees Morris. MORRIS (as MULDER) is Michael McKean playing Morris but is perceived as Mulder.

(Same scene. MULDER watches as MORRIS backs up the car and turns around. As it begins to pull away, MULDER runs a few steps after it.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Hey! Hey! Hey!

(The SOLDIER beside him raises his rifle and aims it at the retreating car.)

SOLDIER1: Sir, open fire?

MULDER (as MORRIS): No! No. Let them go. Let them go.

SOLDIER 1: Sir?

(MULDER stares at him, unsure of what to do.)

SOLDIER 1: Your orders, sir?

(Pause.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (false confidence) I want to get out of here.

(Another SOLDIER holds the passenger door of MORRIS's car for him. MULDER gets in. Two other Men in Black, HOWARD GRODIN and JEFF SMOODGE are sitting in the back seat.)

HOWARD: Morris. (no response) Morris? (MULDER, realizing they are speaking to him, turns in his seat) What do you think you're doing?

(MULDER looks at the other guy. No response.)

HOWARD: Why'd you let them go?

MULDER (as MORRIS): They didn't know anything.

HOWARD: They were FBI agents obviously here to meet someone, very possibly an informant. You just sent away our best hope of finding out who.

JEFF: We can't just disappear a couple of FBI agents, Howard. We'll get their own people to deal with them. That's what Morris was thinking. Right, Morry? Let's go.

(Later, the MIB's car pulls through an electric gate and enters a large compound with several helicopter looking things flying overhead. Sign says US AIR FORCE AREA 51.)

(MULDER, JEFF and HOWARD enter the compound. They pass a security desk.)

GUARD: Sir.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Yeah?

GUARD: Your identification, sir.

(MULDER looks at JEFF and HOWARD. They both have photo ID cards pinned to their lapels.

GUARD: You do have identification?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (another false smile) Yeah

(MULDER feels around in his pockets and finds MORRIS's ID. It has the word MAJESTIC on it. The picture is of MORRIS. MULDER holds it up next to his face hesitantly and looks to the GUARD. The guard looks carefully at the photo and at MULDER. MULDER reaches up to touch his own face. He is wearing a wedding ring. He looks at his image in the GUARD's monitor and sees the image of MORRIS touching his face. MULDER follows JEFF and HOWARD into a hall. They pass by an open office door where an older man, GENERAL WEGMAN is talking on the phone.)

JEFF: (quietly to MULDER and HOWARD) What's Wegman doing here? Kind of late for the old man to be clocking in.

HOWARD: Something must be up. I'm going to check it out. (he leaves)

JEFF: (grinning at MULDER) Kiss-ass.

(JEFF uses his ID card to key open an office door. Further down the hall, MULDER sees a pair of SOLDIERS approaching. He sees the name MORRIS FLETCHER on a plaque over one of the office doors. He swipes his ID card in the lock and the door opens. After closing the door and exhaling with relief, he looks at the wall of pictures. There are photos of MORRIS with Newt Gingrich, the Reagans, and Saddam Hussein.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (whisper) Scully.

(He goes straight to the phone.)



SCENE 3

(CUT TO: Same time. MORRIS (as MULDER) and SCULLY pull up to a gas station. They sit for a moment. SCULLY looks expectantly at MORRIS.)

SCULLY: Are you all right, Mulder?

MORRIS (as MULDER): What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Well, you haven't said anything since we left those men on the highway. Is something wrong?

MORRIS (as MULDER): I'm fine. Gas cap's on your side.

(SCULLY is surprised at his attitude. Apparently this is not usual procedure, but she gets out of the car.)

SCULLY: Okay... If you don't want to talk about it.

(SCULLY gets the pump and begins putting gas in the car. A cell phone begins ringing inside the car. SCULLY calls through the closed window.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder...

(MORRIS ignores her, playing with the radio. SCULLY closes her eyes briefly in frustration.)



SCENE 4

(CUT TO: MORRIS's office. MULDER is waiting for SCULLY to answer.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Come on, Scully, pick up.

(The office door opens suddenly. )

JEFF: Bastard!

MULDER (as MORRIS): (hanging up quickly) Huh?



SCENE 5

(CUT TO: Gas station. SCULLY has opened the car door and answered the phone. MORRIS has the radio turned way up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

( She tries to hear over the radio, then reaches out and turns it down herself.)

SCULLY: Hello?!

(She hangs up in disgust and gets back out of the car.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): Oh, Dana? Want to pick me up a pack of Morleys, please?

SCULLY: Since when do you smoke?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Well... you're not going to be a Nazi about it, are you?

(SCULLY has no answer. She closes the door and goes back to the gas pump.)



SCENE 6

(CUT TO: MORRIS's office.)

JEFF: I ran a reverse trace on all the outgoing calls. We've definitely got a leak.

(MULDER almost tips the desk chair over trying to lean back. Catches himself.)

JEFF: He called the FBI this morning from Wegman's office.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Wegman?

JEFF: The leak! He used the guest phone in Wegman's office. He's rubbing our noses in it.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Hmm. In what?

JEFF: In the fact that he works in this building. That he has access to everything-- all our work-- and we don't know who he is.

(The phone on the desk begins ringing.)

JEFF: Morris?

MULDER (as MORRIS): Yeah?

JEFF: You going to answer that?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (shakes his head, then laughs uncomfortably and nods) Oh. Yeah. (picks up the receiver) Hello?

(MRS. FLETCHER is in a suburban middle class house. She is 40ish, wearing a bathrobe. She is not happy.)

MRS. FLETCHER: (on phone) What are you doing there?!

(MULDER sees picture of MORRIS with a woman and two kids, a teenage girl and a younger boy.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) I'm just trying to work that out.

MRS. FLETCHER: (on phone) It's midnight. I've been waiting up.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) I didn't know.

MRS. FLETCHER: (on phone) What do you mean, you didn't know? You said you'd call. Morris...

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) I forgot.

MRS. FLETCHER: (on phone) You always forget. Well, this time, don't forget the milk.

(She hangs up. MULDER looks at the phone for a second then hangs up also.)

JEFF: The wife?

(MULDER nods. JEFF imitates cracking a whip at MULDER.)

JEFF: Come on, man. Let's go home.

(JEFF opens the door and goes out. MULDER holds back a moment with an expression of sheer dread.)

(Short time later. JEFF and MULDER pull up in front of a typical suburban home. MULDER doesn't move. JEFF pats him on the shoulder.)

JEFF: Come on, Morry.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (not happy to be here) There it is, huh? Home sweet home.

(JEFF chuckles.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (getting out of the car) All right.

JEFF: Good night.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Ciao.



SCENE 7

(On his way up the walk, MULDER notices the large white electric? fence around the development. He enters the house quietly. No one is downstairs. He picks up the phone next to the stairs. The operator answers.)

OPERATOR: Base operator.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) (was expecting a dial tone) Oh, uh... I, uh...

OPERATOR: Would you like an outside line, Mr. Fletcher?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) No. Thank you. Good night.

(MULDER slowly slowly opens a bedroom door. He sees MRS. FLETCHER asleep in the bed holding a pillow. He slowly slowly closes the door and goes back down stairs. He sits in a recliner in front to the TV and begins looking for a channel.)

STATION 1: (Pee Wee's Playhouse type of show) Look, kids, it's Larry, the creepy...

STATION 2: (nature show)...September, along the....

STATION 3: (gunfire)

STATION 4: WOMAN: Want to play? MAN: I think we already are.

(On the screen a man and woman begin to undress each other. Moaning )

(MULDER raises his eyebrows, looks around, then shrugs and pushes the chair into a reclining position. He gets comfortable with a small smile and watches the TV.)



SCENE 8
2:04 AM

(Same night. Desert. A sport utility bounces over the terrain as it pulls up to a crash scene. Lots of military around, men in haz-mat suits putting out the fires. GENERAL WEGMAN gets out of the SUV and is met by one of the Men in Black, HOWARD.)

HOWARD: It was a routine test flight, sir. The craft suddenly lost altitude at 2317 hours over highway 375.

GENERAL WEGMAN: What happened?

HOWARD: We haven't yet determined that, sir. We have recovered the flight data recorder as well as the two pilots.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Alive?

HOWARD: (pause) We found the copilot over here.

(He leads GENERAL WEGMAN over to a large boulder in which the COPILOT is almost completely entombed. Only his head and shoulders are sticking out. He is barely alive and seems to be in great pain.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: My God.

HOWARD: The other man's alive, but, uh...

GENERAL WEGMAN: But what?

HOWARD: We're not sure yet.

(They cross over to one of the tents and find the PILOT sitting huddled on the ground.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: What happened, Captain?

(The PILOT looks up helplessly at GENERAL WEGMAN and begins trying to communicate in a foreign language.)



SCENE 9
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC
9:42 AM

(Next day. SCULLY is sitting on couch outside AD KERSH's office. KERSH's ASSISTANT, a young attractive blond woman sits at the reception desk. SCULLY keeps looking around impatiently and at her watch.)

SCULLY: (to KERSH's ASSISTANT) I'm sure he's on his way.

(KERSH's ASSISTANT gives her an unfriendly smile. SCULLY sees MORRIS pass by in the hall. She jumps up and calls to him.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MORRIS (as MULDER): (entering the office) Hey... Hey, Dana. How's it going?

SCULLY: Mulder... Where have you been?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Oh, sorry, I just got a little lost on my way in.

SCULLY: You got lost.

MORRIS (as MULDER): I'm just a little, you know, little lost in my head.

SCULLY: Yeah.

MORRIS (as MULDER): Yeah. One of those days. Yeah. (to KERSH's ASSISTANT) Hi, there. How are you this morning?

KERSH'S ASSISTANT: The Assistant Director is waiting, sir.

MORRIS (as MULDER): Great. Let's do it.

(SCULLY takes a moment, then follows MORRIS into AD KERSH's office.)

AD KERSH: My two frequent flyers. I'm to understand you were in Nevada yesterday and after-- what's it been?-- Two, three conversations such as this on the matter.

SCULLY: Well, sir...

AD KERSH: This morning I got a phone call from the Pentagon demanding that the two of you be reprimanded for trespassing on a top-secret military installation. What do you think you were doing there?

SCULLY: We were following a lead, sir.

AD KERSH: And that's part of your current caseload? A legitimate investigation?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Agent Scully and I were contacted by a confidential source.

AD KERSH: What source?

MULDER: Oh, if I had the name, I'd give it to you. (SCULLY looks at him sharply) Some whistle-blower working inside the so-called Area 51. Said he had some "big deal" information. I got to tell you... The whole thing turned out to be just one gigantic mistake on our part.

(SCULLY is extremely uncomfortable.)

AD KERSH: Agent Mulder, you were specifically ordered not to pursue any line of investigation pertaining to the X-Files.

MULDER: Sir, you're absolutely right. And on behalf of Agent Scully and myself, I'd like to apologize for our blatant disregard of your direct order. You have our word. We will never ever do that again.

(SCULLY is speechless. They leave the office. SCULLY stops MORRIS just as they enter the hall.)

SCULLY: Mulder. Mulder!

MORRIS (as MULDER): (turns and smiles down at her) What?

SCULLY: What was that about?

MORRIS (as MULDER): What was what about?

SCULLY: "I'd give you his name if I had it"? Whatever happened to protecting our contacts? Protecting our work?

MORRIS (as MULDER): He asked. Hang on a second.

(MORRIS goes back over to KERSH's ASSISTANT and whispers in her ear. She giggles and nods. He pats her on the back, then crosses back to SCULLY.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): (smiling) Well... Okay, then.

(SCULLY gives the questioning "Look.")

MORRIS (as MULDER): (defensive) What?

SCULLY: What is going on with you?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Will you please stop trying to pick a fight with me?

SCULLY: Mulder, you are acting bizarre.

MORRIS (as MULDER): (glancing back to the ASSITANT's office) Jealous?

(MORRIS gives her a knowing smile and slaps her on the butt as he passes. SCULLY turns and stares at him in shock.)



SCENE 10

(FLETCHER house. MULDER is still asleep on the recliner, turning restlessly. TV is still on the porn channel. A light is turned on. A hand reaches out and taps him hard on the shoulder. MULDER opens his eyes and sees a woman in front of him, hands on her hips. Her face is in shadow.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Scully?

MRS. FLETCHER: (furious) I can't believe you. (she turns off the TV) I just can't believe you! (steps on the bottom of the recliner popping MULDER up to a sitting position) And who is Scully?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (a question) Good morning.

MRS. FLETCHER: You could do me the courtesy of coming to bed. Pretend we have a happy marriage. What if Chris or Terry had come down here first? Seeing their father being a pervert! Did that ever occur to you?

(She walks away without waiting for an answer. MULDER gets up and begins looking around the living room. His clothing and hair is disheveled.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Hey, uh... (doesn't know her name) Um... Honey? I ne... Have you... Have you seen my car keys? I thought I might have left them...

(A blonde teenage girl comes down the stairs.)

TEENAGER: Morning, Dad.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Morning... Terry.

TEENAGER: Oh, my God! (she bursts into tears and runs back upstairs)

JOANNE FLETCHER: (coming out from kitchen) Morris... What did you do to Chris?

(MULDER tries but has no answer. MRS. FLETCHER goes back to the kitchen.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (under his breath) Where are my keys?

(A boy, about 10 comes down the stairs.)

BOY: Yo, dad.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Good morning, Terry.

BOY: Not Terry.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Chris.

BOY: (disgusted) Terrence. "Terry's" for wusses.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (under his breath) Oh, and Terrence isn't? Hey, uh, Terrence how about helping your old Dad find his car keys?

(In the kitchen MRS. FLETCHER is beating some eggs. TERRY sits at the table and pours cereal. Everyone ignores MULDER. MRS.FLETCHER opens the refrigerator, then glares accusingly at MULDER.)

MRS. FLETCHER: No milk.

(MULDER reaches for a set of keys on the table. MRS. FLETCHER gets them first.)

MRS. FLETCHER: I'm taking the minivan.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (almost pitiful) Don't I have my own car?

(CHRIS enters and sits at the table.)

MRS. FLETCHER: Chris, did you give your father back his car keys?

(Not looking at him, CHRIS holds out a set of keys to MULDER. Just as he is about to take them, she drops them to the ground. He stoops and picks them up.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Okay, well, uh... Everybody have a, uh... a good day at your various, uh... (realizes no one is paying attention) All right.

(He turns to leave.)

CHRIS: Mom!

MRS. FLETCHER: Morris! What about Chris?

MULDER (as MORRIS): Chris?

CHRIS: You said you'd give me an answer today.

MRS. FLETCHER: Her nose. You said you'd give her an answer about her nose.

(Family waits in anticipation. This is obviously a very important decision.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Um... I think...

(CHRIS gives him a little girl look.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): I think she's a little young for plastic surgery don't you think?

(CHRIS cries again.)

MRS. FLETCHER: Oh, for God's sake, Morris-- a nose ring! She said she wants a nose ring!

CHRIS: (to MULDER) I hate you! I wish you were dead.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Well, my work here is done. Have a nice day.

(He makes it to the front door. MRS. FLETCHER follows him. Fabulous melodramatic music underscores the scene.)

MRS. FLETCHER: You want a divorce, don't you? Just say the words-- "Joanne, I want a divorce."

MULDER (as MORRIS): Joanne? (happy to know her name now) Joanne, no.

JOANNE FLETCHER: I will not live this way, Morris. I will not let you walk in and out of this house like a total stranger. Maybe it's better if you just...

MULDER (as MORRIS): Sorry. I'm just not myself lately.

JOANNE FLETCHER: Morris... You are wearing your suit from yesterday.

(CUT TO: MULDER upstairs looking in a closet filled only with black suits and white shirts.) MULDER (as MORRIS): Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Johnny Cash.

(Country music rift. MULDER takes one of the suits out of the closet and carries it to the bed. He begins to undress then notices his reflection in the mirror, which is of MORRIS. Wearing just boxers, an undershirt, and socks, he walks up to the mirror. As he raises his hand, so does the MORRIS- reflection. They breathe fog on the window and wipe it off, wiggle their butts, walk away from the mirror, then turn to catch each other. They walk out of each others sight, then coming dancing across Chuck Berry-style. In the middle of the dance, JOANNE FLETCHER enters with the phone. MULDER freezes.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: Morris... What are you doing?

(MULDER breaks into a bad Tai Chi move for her benefit.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: (hands him the phone) It's for you. (she leaves)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Thanks. (into phone) Mul... Morris.

JEFF: (on phone) Morry, it's Jeff. Where the hell are you?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) Uh, I'm just running a little late.

JEFF: (on phone) Well, get your ass down here tout de suite. We got something big going down.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) Bigger than what?

JEFF: (on phone) Big as in I can't say anything more on the phone. Just get down here.



SCENE 11

(Inside the Area 51 compound. The PILOT from the crash scene the night before is sitting in an observation room speaking foreign language. GENERAL WEGMAN, HOWARD, and JEFF are watching.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: Do we know what he's saying?

HOWARD: It seems he's praying, sir. We've identified the language-- a Native American dialect. Hopi, to be exact. The pilot's name is Captain Robert McDonough. Born in Missoula, Montana. No known foreign language skills. Only since the crash he claims to be one Mrs. Lana Chee a 75-year-old Hopi Indian woman born and raised on the Moapa Reservation about 35 miles from here.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Is it some kind of shell shock?

HOWARD: We don't think so, sir. This is Mrs. Lana Chee.

(They enter another room where a very old, small Native American woman snaps a perfect salute.)

HOWARD: We picked her up on the reservation this morning.

GENERAL WEGMAN: (saluting self-consciously) At ease.

(HOPI INDIAN WOMAN puts hands behind back and opens legs in military "at ease" stance.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: (not sure how to deal with this) What's your name?

HOPI INDIAN WOMAN: (spoken with military precision) Captain Robert McDonough, sir. I apologize for my present condition and appearing out of uniform, sir.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Um... Do you know... What happened last night, Captain?

HOPI INDIAN WOMAN: Sir, we launched from base at 2300 hours and headed south. At approximately 2315 we lost power in the right rear quadrant.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Do you know what, uh... Do you know what caused the power loss?

HOPI INDIAN WOMAN: No warning lights came up on the panel. All systems checked out in preflight. She just wasn't in the mood to fly, sir.



SCENE 12

(FBI bullpen. MORRIS and SCULLY are sitting at their desks side by side. MORRIS is playing a golf game on his computer. SCULLY is working on hers, but glances worriedly over at MORRIS.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): Come on, baby, be the hole. (makes the shot) Ow!

SCULLY: Mulder!

MORRIS (as MULDER): (proudly to SCULLY) I got a birdie.

(The phone rings. SCULLY answers.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(MULDER is calling from an outdoor payphone at a gas station.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) Oh, thank goodness, Scully, it's me.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry, who is this?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) It's me, Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) I'm sorry I couldn't call sooner. Look, something really weird happened last night when that UFO passed over us.

SCULLY: (on phone) UFO?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) You don't remember? You don't remember. Okay, the man that you're with, that's not me. His name is Morris Fletcher. He's an Area 51 employee.

SCULLY: (on phone) Morris Fletcher.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) That's right. Everybody here seems to think that I'm him, but I'm not. I'm me. I'm Mulder.

SCULLY: (whispering to MORRIS) Psst.

(MORRIS reaches over and picks up the other line.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) As long as they think that I'm him I have access but I'm going to need your help. (hears the click as MORRIS picks up) What was that?

SCULLY: (on phone) Uh... What was what?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) This may not be a secure line.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, uh... Where are you?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) Better not say. Look, just get out here as soon as you can.

SCULLY: (on phone) How can I get in touch with you?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (on phone) You won't. I'll get in touch with you.

(MULDER hangs up the payphone. In the office, so do SCULLY and MORRIS.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): Who do you suppose that was?

SCULLY: That wasn't your source? Well, I'll run a trace.

MORRIS (as MULDER): Uh... No, no. I think we should notify El Jefe ASAP. (getting up) We don't want our collective asses chewed out all over again.

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you sure that's the best thing to do?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Look, little lady, I think it's time you got your panties on straight. We're federal officers... We go by the book.

(He goes out of the room. Again, SCULLY stares after him in shock.)

(CUT TO: MULDER buying sunflower seeds in the gas station.)

RUDE ATTENDANT: That'll be $1.89. You get 11 cents change.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (opening the bag of seeds) Keep it.

RUDE ATTENDANT: (leaving coins on the counter) Wow. Maybe I'll just close early.

(MULDER gets in the car and drives away. The camera stays focused on the desert landscape. After a few beats, a cloud of dust and several tumble weeds blow across the screen. Back inside the gas station, we hear a rumbling sound and things begin to fall off the shelves. There is a shot of the dime and the penny shaking on the counter and of a very surprised RUDE ATTENDANT. Then all the windows of the station are shattered inward.)



SCENE 13

(Just after MULDER has left the gas station. MULDER stops as he sees several of the white sport utilities pass him going the other way. The last one stops. JEFF rolls down the window.)

JEFF: Turn around, big guy. We got trouble.

(MULDER turns his car around and follows them back the way he came. As he drives away we see two Indian Burial looking ceremonial crosslike things beside the road.)

(They reach the gas station which is now is a shambles. Gas from the pumps is all over the parking lot.)

SOLDIER 1: Keep back! We got a spill!

(MULDER runs into the gas station.)

SOLDIER 1: Sir!

HOWARD: Hey, Fletcher! What the hell's he doing?

(HOWARD and JEFF follow MULDER into the station.)

JEFF: Fletcher, what are you doing?

MULDER (as MORRIS): There was a man in here, the attendant.

(MULDER searches through the gas station. They find the RUDE ATTENDANT behind the counter. His lower body is completely imbedded in the floor. He is groaning in pain, barely conscious.)

JEFF: Holy mother of...

HOWARD: It's happened again.

MULDER (as MORRIS): What's happened again?

HOWARD: Let's get out of here.

MULDER (as MORRIS): We got to help this man.

HOWARD: We got to help ourselves. Whatever caused this could come back.

MULDER (as MORRIS): We can't just leave him here.

JEFF: Morris...

HOWARD: What the hell's the matter with you?

JEFF: Morris 

HOWARD: I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. Let's go.

MULDER (as MORRIS): This man needs a doctor.

(One of the SOLDIERS shoots the RUDE ATTENDANT.)

HOWARD: Not anymore.

(They leave the station.)

HOWARD: (over his shoulder to SOLDIERS) Burn it.

SOLDIER 1: Clear perimeter, 200 feet! Let's go! All right, everybody, pull back!

(All but SOLDIER 1 run a safe distance from the building.)

JEFF: (holding MULDER's arm) Come on, Morry. That guy was dead long before we found him.

(SOLDIER 1 lights a flare and throws it onto the gasoline soaked pavement. The station explodes. MULDER sighs.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER's apartment building. SCULLY comes out of the elevator and goes toward MULDER's door. A few feet away, she hears giggling, then sees KERSH's ASSISTANT, jacket off, hair messed up come out of the apartment, then lean back in for a kiss. The door closes and she passes SCULLY in the hall tossing her jacket over her shoulder on her way to the elevator.)

KERSH'S ASSISTANT: (cattily, wiping at her lipstick) Agent Scully.

(SCULLY stand frozen for a moment, then steps forward and knocks firmly at MULDER's door.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): (inside the apartment) Just can't get enough, huh?

SCULLY: (calm, but angry) It's me.

(MORRIS, smoking, opens the door. His shirt is half on, tie hanging loosely around his neck. He is completely unfazed by her anger.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): Oh, hey, Dana.

SCULLY: What do you think you're doing?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Oh, you know, just a little lunch break. What's up?

SCULLY: (trying to be professional) We got the trace back on the call we received this morning. It came from a gas station pay phone off of highway 375 three miles east of Groom Lake.

MORRIS (as MULDER): And?

SCULLY: And I'm thinking it was your source although I don't know why he'd try and impersonate you.

MORRIS (as MULDER): Maybe so.

SCULLY: You don't think that we should follow up on this?

MORRIS (as MULDER): Are you out of your pretty little mind?

SCULLY: (so mad she can barely speak) Am I out of my mind? Mulder, you are out of your mind! What is up with you?! I'm thinking about having you examined for mental illness or-or drug use or... Or maybe a massive head injury! This is an X-File your life's work, your crusade!

MORRIS (as MULDER): As I understand it, we're off the X-Files.

(SCULLY, no longer able to speak, slams the door as she leaves.)

(MORRIS, now alone looks in the mirror to fix his tie. The reflection is of MULDER.)

MORRIS (as MULDER): (pouting) Bitch.



SCENE 15

(Area 51 lab. GENERAL WEGMAN, HOWARD, JEFF, and MULDER are looking at a small lizard whose head is embedded in a small rock. The body twists weakly.)

HOWARD: This was brought to a local vet. Some kid found this in the desert ten miles east of the gas station.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Show me on the map.

(They cross to a transparent wall map.)

HOWARD: (pointing) Right here.

GENERAL WEGMAN: This is where you found the gas station attendant?

HOWARD: Yes, sir. We located the pilot at the crash site here and the Indian woman right there.

GENERAL WEGMAN: (pointing to another dot) What's this?

HOWARD: That, we believe, is ground zero. Once we analyze the flight data recorder we hope to confirm it's where the warp began.

(HOWARD holds up the recovered flight data recorder.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): "Warp?"

JEFF: (to MULDER) Beam me up, Scotty.

HOWARD: That's a tear in the space-time continuum an anomaly created by the malfunction of the aircraft which was operating in gravity pulse mode before it went down.

GENERAL WEGMAN: We've been flying these things since '53. I never heard of anything like this.

MULDER (as MORRIS): According to quantum physics, it's possible.

HOWARD: Anti-gravity systems utilize bends in space and time for propulsion. A sudden shift in a craft's trajectory could create the kind of distortion we're witnessing right here.

JEFF: If this is where your so-called warp began we would have all seen it and the three of us were out on highway 375 at the time, sir intercepting two FBI agents.

HOWARD: (disbelieving) A lizard and a rock existing in the same time and space. The fact that none of us remembers seeing it is evidence that my theory is correct, sir.

JEFF: And how's that?

MULDER (as MORRIS): Lost time.

HOWARD: (nodding) Lost time is a common symptom of close proximity to anti-gravity propulsion systems.

JEFF: Then how come my head isn't in a rock, or Morris'?

HOWARD: That's one question I haven't been able to answer. It is possible we suffered consequences from our exposure that we're not fully aware of.

MULDER (as MORRIS): What do we do about it?

(They look at MULDER strangely.)

HOWARD: That's your department-- keep it out of the paper, make sure the witnesses disappear.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Well, yeah, but I mean, how do we reverse it? How do we get the lizard out of the rock?

HOWARD: Who says we can?



SCENE 16
HIGHWAY 375
10:12 PM

(SCULLY driving alone, looking at a map. She passes the burned gas station, then turns around and goes to investigate the parking lot. She finds a penny that has been fused inside a dime. She picks it up and looks at it.)



SCENE 17

(FLETCHER household. Next morning. MULDER is again asleep on the recliner. JOANNE FLETCHER steps on the bottom to pop him up again.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: This is not a marriage. It's a farce.

MULDER (as MORRIS): What?

JOANNE FLETCHER: You're not attracted to me anymore. I disgust you, don't i?

MULDER (as MORRIS): No. No. It's not... It's not that you're disgusting. I-i-it's just that...

JOANNE FLETCHER: It's just that you don't want to ever make love to me ever again, that's all. That and you mumble something about Scully in your sleep. Who is Scully, Morris? Is it another woman?

MULDER (as MORRIS): Does Scully sound like a woman's name to you?

JOANNE FLETCHER: Who is Scully? Tell me.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Oh, Joanne, I'm sure I've told you many times in the past that there are things about my work that unfortunately, I have to keep a secret.

JOANNE FLETCHER: Oh, no, buster. That's not going to fly this time.

MULDER (as MORRIS): My point is that there are a lot of things you don't know about me. And... I've just... I've been under a lot of pressure lately. I mean, up is down and black is white. I don't know where I stand anymore. I don't even know... who I am really anymore. I just... I know for sure that I am not the man you married. I'm just not. And I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.

JOANNE FLETCHER: Oh, god, Morris. I didn't know. They have that pill now. (understanding laughter ) We can work this out. There's other ways to be intimate.

(She hugs him. The doorbell rings.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): I think that that was the doorbell.

JOANNE FLETCHER: We can make this work.

(MULDER gives a silent yell of joy as she turns away to go answer the door. Big Duchovny mug. JOANNE FLETCHER opens the door. It is SCULLY.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: Yes?

SCULLY: Hi. My name is Dana Scully. I'm looking for Morris Fletcher.

(JOANNE FLETCHER's happy face falls.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: (yells) Morris!

(MULDER comes to the door with a big grin when he sees SCULLY. JOANNE FLETCHER slaps him.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: You son of a bitch.

(She goes back into the house.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry. Uh, Morris Fletcher?

MULDER (as MORRIS): (quietly) Scully, it's me. It's Mulder.

(MULDER closes the door and pulls SCULLY into the driveway.)

SCULLY: (nervous) You're, uh... You're the man from the other night? From Area 51?

JOANNE FLETCHER: (yelling from inside the house) Liar!

SCULLY: You phoned me. Would you mind telling me what this is about?

MULDER (as MORRIS): I'm Mulder. I'm really Mulder. I switched bodies, places, identities with this man Morris Fletcher the man that you think is Mulder, but he's not. (sees his reflection in the car window - of MORRIS) Of course you don't believe me. Why was I expecting anything different? Your full name is Dana Katherine Scully. Your badge number is... Hell! I don't know your badge number. Your mother's name is Margaret. Your brother's name is Bill Jr. He's in the Navy and he hates me. (no response from SCULLY) Lately, for lunch, you've been having this six-ounce cup of yogurt, plain yogurt, into which you stir bee pollen because you're on a bee pollen kick even though I tell you you're a scientist and you should know better.

JOANNE FLETCHER: (opens the door and dumps all of MORRIS' black suits onto the front steps) Cheater!

SCULLY: Look... Any of that information could have been gathered by anyone.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Even that yogurt thing? That is so you. That is so Scully. Well, it's good to know you haven't changed. That's somewhat comforting.

SCULLY: I don't know what the point of all of this is.

MULDER (as MORRIS): I'll prove it to you.

SCULLY: No. You won't, but I wouldn't mind if you came clean with me.

MULDER (as MORRIS): Scientific proof about what happened to us on that road two nights ago. Fair enough?

(JOANNE FLETCHER opens the front door again and yells out.)

JOANNE FLETCHER: I am calling the police!

(MULDER clasps his hands, begging SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher. (walks away)

MULDER (as MORRIS): I will prove it to you, Scully. Tonight. I'll prove everything. Okay?

(SCULLY gets into her car without speaking to him. Camera POV switches to another car's rearview mirror in which we see MULDER watching SCULLY drive away. Then the driver's hand moves the mirror to show his own reflection which is  MULDER. The driver is MORRIS. He picks up his cell phone.)

(CUT TO: HOWARD's office. Phone ringing )

HOWARD: (entering the office and answering phone) Howard Grodin.

MORRIS (as MULDER): (on phone) Mr. Grodin, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder the Federal Bureau of Investigation. How are you this morning?

HOWARD: (on phone) How did you get this number?

MORRIS (as MULDER): (on phone) Well, frankly, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. Sir, I am obligated to tell you that you have a security leak in your facility. A man with whom you've worked very closely has contacted this office on several occasions and offered me access to highly classified information.

HOWARD: (on phone) Would you happen to have a name for this man?

MORRIS (as MULDER): (on phone) Why, yes. Yes, I would.



SCENE 18

(MULDER goes into the deserted lab and takes the flight recorder. He places it in a brown paper bag, then sneaks back out. Camera pans over to show that HOWARD watched him from a corner of the room.)



SCENE 19

(SCULLY driving. Her cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (answering phone) Scully.

AD KERSH: (on phone) You're in Nevada again.

SCULLY: (on phone) Uh... Sir, I am...

AD KERSH: (on phone) Do not speak, Agent. Listen. Your partner already apprised me of his conversation with the air force in his fervent desire to save you from making a fatal career mistake. Therefore, you will follow my instructions to the letter.

SCULLY: (on phone) Sir, I don't know what Agent Mulder might have told you, but I...

AD KERSH: (on phone) You will follow my instructions to the letter. Otherwise, don't bother coming back from Nevada.



SCENE 20
AHEARN'S SERVICE STATION
LINCOLN COUNTY, NEVADA

(Night. MULDER pulls up in front of another gas station. He walks in carrying the brown paper bag with the flight recorder. He sees SCULLY standing near the refrigerated drink aisle.)

ATTENDANT: Can I help you?

(MULDER ignores the ATTENDANT and goes to SCULLY.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): Scully, I got it. I got the proof.

(She says nothing. MULDER looks back at the ATTENDANT who ducks down under the counter. Bright lights as several vehicles pull up outside, briefly illuminating the Morley Cigarettes ad on the door. The SOLDIERS run in and take the flight recorder from MULDER. They push him up against the counter and begin putting cuffs on him.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (betrayed) Scully? You?

(JEFF, HOWARD, and MORRIS enter. MORRIS goes over to stand beside SCULLY. MULDER sees MORRIS. He begins to struggle as they start to drag him out of the station.)

JEFF: Damn it, Morris.

MULDER (as MORRIS): (to MORRIS) You! You son of a bitch! You orchestrated this whole thing! He's not me, Scully! Would I do this?! Would I do this?! Scully...! Scully!

(SCULLY watches them take him out, a look of suspicion, perhaps dawning realization on her face. She takes a few steps toward him.)

MULDER (as MORRIS): (yelling back to her) No, you bastard, tell them the truth! Scully, he's not me! He's not me! Scully! He's not me!

(The SOLDIERS drag him out.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]


                                   DREAMLAND PART II


SCENE 1

(Man's hand opening a file on Fox Mulder. Early 1970's 8mm home movie of a young Fox and Samantha Mulder getting ready for Halloween. He is dressed as Spock from Star Trek, she is dressed as a fairy. When his fake ear falls off he stamps on it and runs out of frame. His mother gets him back into the shot and the three of them wave at the camera. It does a close up of Samantha, then the screen goes blank.)

MORRIS: (voiceover) Once upon a time, there was a guy with the improbable name of Fox Mulder. He started out life happily enough, as these things go. He had parents who loved him, a cute kid sister. He had a roof over his head, got all his flu shots, had all his fingers and toes and aside from being stuck with the name "Fox" which probably taught him how to fight-- or not-- he pretty much led a normal life. But the worst thing by far-- the biggest kick in the slacks this kid Fox ever got-- was what happened to his sister. One day, she just disappeared.

(Camera pans across trophy wall of all MULDER's diplomas and awards. Then across some X-Files memoribilia that must have survived the fire. Finally, view of man's lapel to which MULDER's FBI ID is clipped, then up to his face which we perceive is MORRIS FLETCHER.)

MORRIS: Now, Fox buckled down and worked his butt off. Graduated top of his class at Oxford then top of his class at the FBI academy. None of that hard work made up for his sister, though. It was just a way of putting her out of his mind. Finally, the way I figure it, he went out of his mind and he's been that way ever since. Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career, lost the respect of supervisors and friends and now lives his life shaking his fist at the sky and muttering about conspiracies to anyone who will listen. If you ask me, he's one step away from pushing a baby carriage filled with tin cans down the street. But now, all that's going to change.

SCENE 2

(Last scene of Dreamland I - Gas station - MULDER has been arrested by the Area 51 Men In Black and is handcuffed and placed in a SUV as SCULLY watches, having been an unwilling part of the set-up that led to his capture. MORRIS stands beside her.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Tell them the truth, you lying son of a bitch! He's not me, Scully! Scully! Scully, he's not me!

(SCULLY reluctantly watches the MIB vehicles drive off. MORRIS joins her outside.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: You hate me now, right? Dana, I'm sorry I naked on you to Kersh, but I...I was scared you were going to lose your job.

SCULLY: You did the right thing, Mulder.

MORRIS AS MULDER: I did?

SCULLY: I've been telling you for years you should play more by the book, haven't I?

MORRIS AS MULDER: Hey, it's the new me.

(SCULLY looks out after the cars that took MULDER away.)



SCENE 3

(Area 51 brig. MULDER is being led down a corridor by two guards. He is wearing leg irons. The guards push him into a plexi-glass cell and close the door.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey... Hey, fellas, take... What about these? Come on, fellas.

(The guards leave without removing the leg irons. LANA CHEE, the OLD HOPI INDIAN WOMAN who now has the memories of the PILOT, CAPTAIN ROBERT MCDONOUGH from Dreamland part 1is in the next cell. She is smoking a cigarette. She comes over to the barrier that separates them.)

LANA CHEE/PILOT: (laughs) You ain't going nowhere, mibby. You and me have had our asses officially disappeared. Looks like we're up fudge creek.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Who are you?

LANA CHEE/PILOT: Call sign's Maverick. Not like I'm going to be hot- sticking it anytime soon

MULDER AS MORRIS: Are you all right, Ma'am?

LANA CHEE/PILOT: (offended) "Ma'am?" (grabs crotch and walks back to her cot) Kiss my ass, you desk monkey.

(MULDER stares at her.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(Bullpen office area. MORRIS is playing a golf game on his computer.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: No, no, no. Up, up... Whew. (ball goes in) I am Tiger Woods.

(MORRIS quickly turns off his computer monitor as SCULLY enters with a cardboard box and begins collecting things from her desk. She is not happy.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: So, what did Kersh say?

SCULLY: He said that I was willful, insubordinate and not a team player and the FBI didn't need agents that weren't team players.

MORRIS AS MULDER: What a jerk. Then what?

SCULLY: Two-week suspension without pay.

MORRIS AS MULDER: You're not serious. Who does he think he is?

SCULLY: (heading out the door with her belongings) See you in two weeks.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Dana? You suppose a home-cooked meal might ease the pain a little? Say, at my place 8:00?

(SCULLY stares at him as if thinking about it, then gives a small nod of affirmation and leaves. MORRIS taps the door as it closes and returns to his game with a big grin.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Think she likes me, Tiger.



SCENE 5

(Area 51 brig. MULDER - in hell - is lying on the cot in his cell. It appears that he has been listening to his cell mate for a LOOONG time.)

LANA CHEE/PILOT: So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears Rio flying back seat and I'm thinking, hell, man I'm going to give this cherry the ride of his life." So I'm putting the spurs to her, you know? And I'm doing a little hassling with my wingman, Buzzsaw. Now, Buzzsaw...

MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey, Maverick would you mind?

LANA CHEE/PILOT: Hold up. Buzzsaw gets on my zero. He's right on my zero. And when Buzzsaw gets on your zero...

MULDER AS MORRIS: Maverick...?

LANA CHEE/PILOT: ...he's like a damn dog tick.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Maverick?

LANA CHEE/PILOT: You ain't shaking that son of a gun.

MULDER AS MORRIS: (really frustrated) Hey, Grandma Top Gun, will you shut the hell up?!

LANA CHEE/PILOT: You're my bitch now pencil-neck.

(She has come up to the wall separating them and flicked her cigarette into his cell. MULDER, furious, reches throught the gap in the wall and tries to grab her neck. She laughs at him. GUARD enters and opens MULDER's cell door.)

GUARD: General Wegman wants to see you.

(CUT TO: GENERAL WEGMAN's office. MULDER sits across from WEGMAN. JEFF and HOWARD stand next to him.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: Son... You got a set on you. I'll say that much.

JEFF: You had us fooled. Why didn't you tell us what you were doing from the start?

MULDER AS MORRIS: (confused) Meaning?

GENERAL WEGMAN: It's the wrong one. You replaced the flight data recorder. This one's from...

HOWARD: A scrapped F-111, sir. It's junk. You gave the FBI the wrong flight data recorder. Why?

JEFF: Morry, if you were running a scam on the FBI why didn't you let us in on it?

MULDER AS MORRIS: (faking it) I didn't know if I could trust you. We have a security leak, gentlemen and for all I knew it was one of you. That's why I decided I should approach Agent Scully alone to find out who her contact is. Unfortunately, her partner Agent (said with disgust) Mulder screwed everything up.

HOWARD: So why didn't you tell us all this afterward?

MULDER AS MORRIS: I knew that you wouldn't believe it until you figured it out for yourself.

HOWARD: So the real flight data recorder is safe?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

HOWARD: And you will bring it back?

MULDER AS MORRIS: (laughing) Of course.

GENERAL WEGMAN: (proud) By God, you do got a set on you. I wish I could say the same about some of your colleagues. About those who proffer rumor and innuendo those who make dangerous accusations.

HOWARD: Sir, Morris's behavior seemed to....

GENERAL WEGMAN: (to HOWARD) You can explain yourself to the review panel in Washington. I've already wired them recommending censure for your actions. You're lucky I didn't throw you in the stockade.



SCENE 6

(MULDER's apartment. MORRIS enters carrying two grocery bags. He looks at the apartment with a critical eye.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Uh-huh.

(MORRIS sets the bags down in the kitchen and takes three fat candles out of one of the bags and goes back to the living room.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: A little mood lighting for the bedroom. (looks around and pauses) No bedroom.

(MORRIS goes over to a closed door. He tries to open it. Nothing happens. He tries again. Nothing. He pulls really hard. The door pops open and several boxes and porno magazines fall out. The room is completely filled waist high with boxes, old furniture and papers.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: This guy hasn't been laid in ten years.



SCENE 7
FLETCHER RESIDENCE
RACHEL, NEVADA

(MUDLER pulls into the driveway next to a minivan. All of MORRIS' belongings are piled up in the middle of the driveway. He sees a plain sedan pull up a few doors down and stop. No one gets out. CHRIS, the teenage daughter, comes out of the house. She has a gold nose ring.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: (trying to be friendly) Hey, Chris. Hey, I like the, uh... The, uh... The nose... (he touches the ring and she jerks back)

CHRIS: Ouch! As if.

(TERRY, the younger brother, also comes out.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Terry. Buddy. Hey, Terence. Sorry. How's it going?

TERRY: Mom says she's taking out a restraining order on you.

(CHRIS and TERRY get into the minivan and drive away. MULDER waves, but there is no response. Giving up, he goes into the house. He looks out the window and sees the men in the sedan are watching his house. JOANNE comes up behind him.)

JOANNE MORRIS: What are you doing back?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne...

JOANNE MORRIS: Your stuff is all outside. Take it and get out.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne, listen to me. There's something I got to tell you.

JOANNE MORRIS: I've heard enough from you for one lifetime, Morris. Go tell it to that tramp of yours, that Scully, whatshername.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Dana Scully- Special Agent Dana Scully.

JOANNE MORRIS: Special Tramp Dana Scully.

MULDER AS MORRIS: She's my partner, Joanne.

JOANNE MORRIS: I'm supposed to be your partner.

MULDER AS MORRIS: My name is not Morris Fletcher. It's Fox Mulder. Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. Dana Scully is my FBI partner. I am not your husband we are not married, we are complete strangers and I have a whole other life that I'm desperately trying to get back to.

JOANNE MORRIS: You know, Morris most men when they have a mid-life crisis they go out and buy themselves a sports car. They don't run around calling themselves Fox.

MULDER AS MORRIS: I want you to look out the window. Will you just look out the window with me for a second? See that car down there? See the two men in it? They're surveilling me. They're spying on me. I don't know if your husband ever told you this but he has a very dangerous job and those two men in that car, like you, think that I'm him only they don't trust me. So, one false move and I'm history. Which means that your husband will also be history because I won't be able to get back and set things the way they're supposed to be. Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

JOANNE MORRIS: (not believing him) Morris, if you don't like the man you've become I don't blame you one bit. But this flight from reality isn't the answer. Accept who you are. However repulsive that may be.

(MULDER nods as she walks away.)



SCENE 8

(MULDER's apartment. SCULLY knocks. MORRIS answers wearing an apron that says "something smells good.")

MORRIS AS MULDER: Perfect timing. Welcome.

(SCULLY looks around in surprise at the clean apartment.)

SCULLY: Wow. Mulder.

(MORRIS takes her coat. SCULLY lets him take it but is obviously surprised.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: You like, huh? Yeah, I thought it was time I stopped living like a frat boy. Come on and see the rest of the place. Over there.

(Leads her into the bedroom which is now spotless. Well, except for the spots on the leopard skin comforter on the canopied bed.)

SCULLY: I didn't even know you had a bedroom.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh, yeah. Yeah, got to have someplace to lounge around and read the Sunday New York times, you know.

(Pats the foot of the bed, inviting her to sit.)

SCULLY: Uh, no, that's okay. Thanks.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Seriously, just check it out. Seriously.

(He pulls her to the bed. She sits. It's a waterbed. He sits beside her and they both fall back onto the bed.)

SCULLY: Oh!

MORRIS AS MULDER: Whoa! Uh-oh.

(They are looking up at the overhead mirror. The reflection shows MULDER and SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER AS MORRIS AS MULDER: Maybe I like to read the New York Times backwards.

(MULDER as MORRIS as MULDER turns on his side to face SCULLY. Next shot is of MORRIS as MULDER.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Do you hate it?

SCULLY: (pause) No, I don't hate it.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Well, all right then. Uh, don't go away.

(MORRIS goes back to the kitchen, gets the chilled champagne and two flutes and carries them back to the bedroom dancing and singing a Marvin Gaye song from the seventies.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Let's get it on Let's get it on Let's get it on Let's get it on Tonight is the night...

(Closes the bedroom door with his foot behind him.)



SCENE 9

(Overhead mirror shot of MULDER as MORRIS as MULDER laughing and handing SCULLY a champagne glass.)

SCULLY: ,Do you know what would really be fun?

MORRIS AS MULDER: What?

(She dangles her handcuffs in front of him.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh, yeah. Me first?

SCULLY: You first.

(MORRIS takes the handcuffs and puts one end on his left wrist and the other around the bedpost.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (shy) First time. Now what?

(Turns in anticipation back to SCULLY. His look quickly turns to panic when he sees her pointing her gun at him.)

SCULLY: You're not Mulder.

MORRIS AS MULDER: What?

(Champagne bottle still in his lap pops open.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Baby...

SCULLY: (aiming a little lower) "Baby" me and you'll be peeing through a catheter. Your name is Morris Fletcher. It was Mulder who was arrested in the desert. He was telling the truth about you. Now, how do we get things back to normal?

MORRIS AS MULDER: (giving up) How should I know? I wouldn't do it even if I could. You saw my wife. Do you think I want to go back to that? Two kids who'd probably kill me in my sleep for the insurance money. A $400,000 mortgage on a house that just appraised at $226,000. And my job... Yee-gods. You think being a man in black is all voodoo mind control? I can see the paperwork.

SCULLY: Are you through?

MORRIS AS MULDER: As far as I'm concerned this thing is a gift from heaven. Besides, no one is ever going to believe you so you might as well just get used to me being here.

SCULLY: Or I just shoot you... Baby.

MORRIS AS MULDER: (pleading) I'm telling you, I have no idea how to change things back.

SCULLY: What about Mulder's source? The man he was supposed to meet in the desert? What about him? Do you know how to get in touch with him?

MORRIS AS MULDER: I don't know anything about that. Sorry. You're out of luck.

(Phone rings. They wait for the machine to pick up.)

ANSWERING MACHINE: (MORRIS' voice) Hello, hello. I'm very busy entertaining a *special* guest. Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

(MORRIS looks embarrassed. SCULLY looks disgusted.)

MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Agent Mulder, I'm trying you one last time. Are you or are you not interested in the classified information I have to give you? Please pick up the phone if you're there.

(SCULLY indicates for MORRIS to pick up. He does and hold the phone so that both he and SCULLY can hear.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

MAN ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Agent Mulder, listen very carefully.



SCENE 10
FLETCHER RESIDENCE
4:47 PM

(FLETCHER house. MULDER is sitting in a chair in front of the window keeping an eye on the surveillance car. He plays with the blinds with his sock foot.)

JOANNE MORRIS: Well, I guess we've given the neighbors enough to talk about. For God's sake, Morris at first you couldn't wait to get away from me and now you won't leave the house.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Where can we go?

JOANNE MORRIS: What do you mean?

MULDER AS MORRIS: You're right. We should get out of the house. Go someplace with a lot of people.

JOANNE MORRIS: Someplace with a lot of people?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Mm-hmm.

JOANNE MORRIS: In Rachel, Nevada?

MULDER AS MORRIS: (smiling and stroking her face) What do you say?



SCENE 11

(Night. Inside SCULLY and MORRIS' car parked outside the Little A'Le Inn, Earthlings Welcome, a country western bar/hotel.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: All right, let's run through this one more time. I'll go in there alone, just like you told me to. He'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap.

SCULLY: And?

MORRIS AS MULDER: And if I try and slip out the back door (points finger at his head like a gun) da-da-da-dee-dee-dee.

SCULLY: Get going.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Can't we start over? You know, do that thing with the handcuffs?

(SCULLY holds up and cocks her gun.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Probably not your scene.

(MORRIS enters the bar and begins looking around.)

COUNTRY MUSIC ON JUKEBOX:
I have waited for what seems
Like a whole light-year
Just to see your face
Once again, my dear
Shiny brown-eyed moonlight,
Sunlight, starlight
With big dark eyes
That send me out of sight
Now I'm staring
At the stars...

(Camera has panned over to the table where MULDER and JOANNE are drinking a beer and a white wine. MULDER keeps looking around the bar)

JOANNE MORRIS: Are you expecting someone?

MULDER AS MORRIS: No, I'm not expecting someone.

JOANNE MORRIS: Because if you're here expecting someone and not to buy me a drink, you should tell me now so I can divorce you and take the house.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne, have another white wine.

(MULDER taps on her glass to signal the waiter to bring her another.)

Staring at the stars
Wondering where you are...

(MORRIS joins a man wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap. It is GENERAL WEGMAN.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (amazed and very amused) You're the guy?!

GENERAL WEGMAN: Sit down.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Well, I'll be damned.

(CUT TO: MULDER and JOANNE's table. MULDER sees JEFF and some other MIBs enter the bar.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Whoa, ooh, that beer, it went right through me. I got to... I'll be right back.

(CUT TO: WEGMAN's table.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: You sabotaged a UFO?

GENERAL WEGMAN: Keep your voice down. I didn't intend for it to crash, Agent Mulder. I just meant to disable the stealth module so you could see it.

(CUT TO: Outside in the parking lot. MULDER is sneaking through the cars trying handles to find an unlocked door. By chance, he opens the passenger door of SCULLY's car.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder? Is that really you?

MULDER AS MORRIS: (getting in the car with her) What are you doing here?

SCULLY: I'm trying to figure out a way to help you.

(CUT TO: JOANNE sitting at the table alone, waiting. She is served another glass of wine.)

Now I'm staring at the stars...

(CUT TO: WEGMAN's table.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: What, are you, like, disgruntled?

GENERAL WEGMAN: You make me sound like some postal clerk. What you came for is on the floor by your feet.

(MORRIS looks down and sees a brown paper bag containing the flight data recorder. He smiles.)

Starlight, star bright...

(CUT TO: JOANNE walking out to parking lot.)

JOANNE MORRIS: Morris?

(She sees MULDER and SCULLY sitting in the car. She returns to her table and tries not to cry. MORRIS, paper bag in hand salutes GENERAL WEGMAN and starts out of the bar. He sees JOANNE, obviously upset, and stares at her. He's torn. He sees JEFF shaking his head at some other Men in Black. MORRIS ducks into the Men's room.)

In my memory you are moonlight, starlight
With big dark eyes that
Send me out of sight
Now I'm staring at the stars
Wondering where you are
Wondering if I'll ever see
Your face again
Now I'm staring at the stars
Wondering where you are...

JEFF: (coming over to JOANNE's table) Joanne? Hey, how's it going? Listen, have you seen Morry?

(MULDER enters the bar again.)

JOANNE MORRIS: You bet I've seen him.

(JOANNE throws her glass of wine in MULDER's face.)

JEFF: Hey, hey, whoa, guys. Guys. What the hell was that, Morry?

MULDER AS MORRIS: I guess I make a lousy husband.

JEFF: I'll talk to her.

(MULDER goes into bathroom and starts to try to clean his shirt. Looks into the mirror and sees reflection of a MULDER holding a brown paper bag. He angles the mirror to show his own reflection which is that of a MORRIS with a wine soaked shirt. He turns to face MORRIS as MULDER.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: So you're the guy that wants my life. I assume that includes all the ass-kickings.

(MULDER locks the bathroom door.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh, no... You don't want to do this.

(MULDER slams MORRIS up against the wall.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Yeah, I do.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Jeff's outside.

MULDER AS MORRIS: So what?

MORRIS AS MULDER: If he sees us together, we're both dead. Especially when he sees this.

(MORRIS holds out paper bag. MULDER looks inside and sees the flight data recorder.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: You take that to Scully right now.

MORRIS AS MULDER: You must have some sort of waxy buildup. I said Jeff's here. No way am I going out there until he leaves. You sneak it past him. You're his buddy.

MULDER AS MORRIS: His buddy? He doesn't trust me as far as he can throw me. You saw to that.

(CUT TO: WEGMAN's table. GENERL WEGMAN leaves a tip then starts out of the bar. Sees JEFF and his cronies.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: Oh, geez.

(GENERAL WEGMAN ducks into the men's room He paces for a moment then looks up to see MULDER and MORRIS peeping over the stall wall.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Hey.

...as long as the sun would shine
You would love me
Love me
And I hope
You'll love the sunshine
One more time...

(SHORT TIME LATER: GENERAL WEGMAN exits the bathroom observed by SCULLY and JEFF.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: Jeff.

JEFF: General Wegman.

GENERAL WEGMAN: You men, come with me. (leads them outside)

JEFF: Sir... What are we, uh...?

GENERAL WEGMAN: There. Detain that man.

(Points at MULDER carrying a brown paper bag across the parking lot.)

JEFF: Morris... Stop.

(They take his arms.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey, guys.

JEFF: What's in the bag, Morris?

MULDER AS MORRIS: It's, uh... Beer.

GENERAL WEGMAN: You sure it's not a flight data recorder?

MULDER AS MORRIS: No, it's beer.

(JEFF looks in the bag. It is beer. They all look up to see a car driving off. MULDER nods at WEGMAN. The car contains SCULLY and MORRIS with the flight data recorder.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (in the car with SCULLY, chuckling) Suckers.



SCENE 12

(Lone Gunmen Office. FROHIKE is serving huevos rancheros to BYERS and LANGLY. Very domestic little scene.)

LANGLY: Mmm. More huevos rancheros.

FROHIKE: Mas huevos rancheros.

BYERS: Por favor. (Door buzzer sounds.)

SCULLY: Open up. (Video feed show MULDER and SCULLY waiting outside the door. FROHIKE opens the many locks on the door and lets SCULLY and MORRIS in.)

FROHIKE: Mulder... If I'd known you were coming I would have made more salsa.

SCULLY: We need your help right now.

LANGLY: (taking the flight data recorder) Who crashed?

SCULLY: Who, what, why. I need to know everything that's on that data recorder.

BYERS: It's similar in size and shape to the FDRs on the SR-71.

FROHIKE: (looking at the FDR) Well, that's definitely not standard issue.

BYERS: (to MORRIS) Where did you get this?

SCULLY: Groom Lake. Outside Area 51.

FROHIKE: Dreamland.

LANGLY: The Aurora spy plane.

SCULLY: What's that?

FROHIKE: Black world. Top, top secret. A skunkworks special.

BYERS: Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance aircraft fueled with slush- hydrogen.

LANGLY: Or methylcyclohexane.

(MORRIS, reading the latest issue of the Lone Gunman, begins giggling.)

FROHIKE: What's with him?

MORRIS AS MULDER: You guys like the name? I'm going to go with either "Aurora" or "Borealis."

FROHIKE: What the hell's he talking about?

BYERS: Mulder...

SCULLY: He's not Mulder.

LANGLY: Huh?

SCULLY: (uncomfortable) We think the crash of this particular aircraft-- whatever it was-- resulted in a, uh... (sighs)

MORRIS AS MULDER: My name is Morris Fletcher. I work inside Area 51. I assumed Mulder's identity through a warp in the space-time continuum.

(LGM laugh, then get serious when they see SCULLY is not laughing.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (leans down close to FROHIKE) Trust me, little man, I ain't him. Oh, I love you guys. I really do. I mean, you're the "Lone Gunmen," aren't you? You guys are my heroes. I mean, look at this crap you print.

BYERS: (defensive) We uncover the truth.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh, the truth. Well, see that's what's so great about you monkeys. Not only do you believe this horse pucky that we create you broadcast it as well. I mean, look at this.

(Shows LGM headline " Saddam testing Mandriod Army in Army Iraqi Desert.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: There is no Saddam Hussein. This guy's name is John Gillnitz. We found him doing dinner theater in Tulsa. Did a mean King and I. Plays good ethnics.

LANGLY: You're trying to say that Saddam Hussein's a government plant?

MORRIS AS MULDER: I'm saying I invented the guy. We set him up in '79. He rattles his saber whenever we need a good distraction. Ah... If you boys only knew how many of your stories I dreamed up while sitting on the pot.

FROHIKE: What stories?

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh, I'm sorry, Melvin, that's classified.

FROHIKE: (threatening him with spatula) The name's Frohike, you punk ass. What the hell you do with Mulder?

SCULLY: Shut up, all of you. If you guys want Mulder back, get me these results.



SCENE 13

(GENERAL WEGMAN's office. WEGMAN is alone, shredding documents. Knock at the door.)

GENERAL WEGMAN: Who is it?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Morris Fletcher.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Come in. We shouldn't be seen together. Not after last night. Fletcher... Mulder... Whoever you are.

MULDER AS MORRIS: I'm hoping this'll be our last meeting. Agent Scully's flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder.

GENERAL WEGMAN: It'll be too late to save me.

MULDER AS MORRIS: I know. The real Morris Fletcher knows you're the leak.

GENERAL WEGMAN: Once you get back-- if you get back-- he'll have me arrested. Disappeared. Even if he doesn't his colleagues will figure out soon enough I sabotaged that craft.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Why'd you do it?

GENERAL WEGMAN: I didn't mean for it to crash. I just wanted you to see it.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Well, why?

GENERAL WEGMAN: There comes a time when you... look back instead of forward... See the sum of your life. My entire career has been spent hiding the truth from the American people destroying, in a way, that which was most precious to me.

MULDER AS MORRIS: What is the truth?

GENERAL WEGMAN: You mean... You don't know?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Don't know what?

GENERAL WEGMAN: The truth - what *is* going on here at Area 51? What are these black-budget projects? We just fly these birds. They don't tell us what makes them go. They engineer them all up in Utah.

MULDER AS MORRIS: Well, if you don't know, why'd you call me?

GENERAL WEGMAN: Well, I... I've seen your file. You've chased flying saucers for years. (really asking him) Do aliens really exist, Agent Mulder?

(MULDER just stares at him.)



SCENE 14

(Lone Gunmen Office. Computer screen starts displaying information.)

FROHIKE: Something's coming up.

BYERS: Got it.

SCULLY: What is it?

BYERS: We broke the encryption.

LANGLY: This baby records the telemetry of 28 systems including airspeed, fuselage torque and delta-v.

FROHIKE: Yeah, all the usual readouts, but, uh... What are these?

BYERS: Tachyon flux... Gravitational displacement.

FROHIKE: "Aurora," my ass. What have you guys been flying out there?

(MORRIS raises his eyebrows mysteriously.)

SCULLY: All right, I want you guys to analyze that data. Morris...

MORRIS AS MULDER: (holding up paper "Minx or Mandroid.") This is one of mine.

SCULLY: Get your butt in gear.

MORRIS AS MULDER: You're going to miss me when I'm gone.

FROHIKE: Fat chance, laughing boy.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Back off, sneezy.

SCULLY: (stepping between them) Enough. Call me when you guys have some answers.



SCENE 15

(Night. Outside Area 51. Two GUYS and a GIRL walking come upon a white mailbox all by itself.

GUY 1: Ah, far out. The black mailbox.

GUY 2: Dude, that's a white mailbox.

GUY 1: No, they painted it white to hide it. This is the black mailbox. The best place to see Freedom Mountain and the UFOs over Dreamland, man. (GUY 2 and the GIRL start making out. ) I know a guy who saw five in one night. He said they danced in the sky. (rumbling sound) You guys hear that? What the hell? (ripple passes over them) Cool. Did you guys see that?

(GUY 1 turns to see that GUY 2 and the GIRL have merged into each other. Her arm is completely through his chest and their faces are grotesquely connected. GUY 1 stares at them in horror.)



SCENE 16

(Night. Desert. SCULLY and MORRIS pull up beside MULDER's car. SCULLY gets out and joins MULDER about twenty feet away. MORRIS stays in the car.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: You don't look too happy. Don't tell me I'm going to have to put two kids through school.

SCULLY: (hesitantly) That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?

(MULDER nods.)

SCULLY: (hugging herself) I, uh... I just got off the phone with Frohike. They were able to download and analyze the crash data and, yes, there was an anomalous event that night.

MULDER AS MORRIS: And how do I get back?

SCULLY: (not easy for her to say) Well, that's just it. It's all about random moments in time... About a series of variables approaching an event horizon. And even if we... could recreate that moment if we could sabotage another craft... Mulder, if we were... If we were off... If the event were off by even one millisecond...

MULDER AS MORRIS: I might wind up with my head in a rock.

SCULLY: Something like that, yeah.

(Long pause.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: (depressed) What about him? I mean, me. Whatever. Whoever he is.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder has become AD Kersh's new golden boy. He's been tasked with returning the flight data recorder that he and I stole. The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh even more than I do to my priest. I'm just tagging along for the ride.

MULDER AS MORRIS: What do you mean, "just tagging along"?

SCULLY: I'm out of the Bureau. I've been censured and relieved of my position.

MULDER AS MORRIS: No. You can explain it to them like you explained it to me. You have the data. You can make them understand. You can get your job back.

(SCULLY looks at him with affection. His response was completely different from MORRIS' fake sympathy when she told him.)

SCULLY: I'd kiss you if you weren't so damn ugly.

(MULDER smiles at her and nods.)

( MORRIS honks the horn at them.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: (yelling out the window) Take a picture-- it'll last longer.

(MULDER and SCULLY pause a moment as they look over at the car.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: (through clenched teeth) If I... shoot him is that murder or suicide?

SCULLY: Neither, if I do it first.

(SCULLY squeezes his arm in farewell, then walks toward the car. MULDER stops her.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey, Scully...

(MULDER holds out his closed hand to her. She holds out her palm. He pours a handful of sunflower seeds into her hand, then takes one back and puts it in his mouth. They look at each other. MULDER sadly watches as SCULLY gets in the car and it drives away.)



SCENE 17

(CUT TO: GUY 1 stops a car on the desert highway.)

GUY 1: (frantic) Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! You got to help me! You got to help me! Open the window! Please, open your window!

(It is HOWARD GRODIN in the car,)

GUY 1: I need to talk to you! Please, I need somebody to help me. (Camera view of just their feet as GUY 1 falls as they follow the path toward the couple.) It's this thing... It was like, like, like a wave... Like all squiggly and everything... (GUY 1 trips and falls, gets up) And... And their faces, they, they stuck together! And, and, and her arm-- it was coming through his chest!

(HOWARD shines his flashlight on the couple. They are making out on the ground. They turn in surprise as the light hits them.)

GUY 2: Sam, man, where you been? Who's the dude?

GUY 1: I swear, man... They were messed up.

HOWARD: (staring at the couple who are now completely normal) I believe you.



SCENE 18

(Inside SCULLY and MORRIS' car. Day. Desert highway. SCULLY ignores him.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: So the motel guy wants cash. Won't take credit card-- do you believe that? So then it hits me-- I flash him my badge: "Fox Mulder, FBI." I tell him we're investigating crappy motels in the Southwest. He'd better watch his behind. So guess what? The guy gives me the room for free and he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot. I love this job! Listen, Dana, after we return this flight recorder what do you say I have a word with the big man-- see if I can get you your job back? We could have lots of fun together once you got to know me. You know I'd change.

SCULLY: I've still got my gun.

MORRIS AS MULDER: All right, already.

(They pass the gas station that was destroyed in Part One.)

SCULLY: Wait a second, hold on. Back up.

MORRIS AS MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: (an order) Back up.

(SCULLY gets out of the car and walks up to the gas station. She stares in amazement. It is completely undamaged. The PREVIOUSLY RUDE ATTENDANT from Part One comes out to greet her.)

PREVIOUSLY RUDE ATTENDANT: Can I help you, ma'am?

SCULLY: I don't understand. This-this place was burnt to the ground.

PREVIOUSLY RUDE ATTENDANT: I don't think so.

SCULLY: Yeah... This place, two nights ago.

PREVIOULSLY RUDE ATTENDANT: I think I'd remember that.



SCENE 19

(Area 51 brig. HOWARD and two guards escort the pilot ROBERT McDONOUGH/LANA CHEE (chanting) to the brig. They remove LANA CHEE from her cell.)

LANA CHEE/PILOT: What's going on?



SCENE 20

(FLETCHER house. MULDER is loading MORRIS' things into a U-Haul. MORRIS and SCULLY drive up.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: What are you doing here?

SCULLY: I need to talk to you. Something's happened.

(In the front door, JOANNE and TERRY are struggling to get MORRIS' recliner outside.)

JOANNE MORRIS: Morris! Don't forget your stupid chair! You and it should be very happy together! (sees SCULLY) Terence, get back inside. (he does) You got a lot of gall coming back here, sister

MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne, I told you-- I'm not your husband. (points to MORRIS) This man is.

JOANNE MORRIS: (to SCULLY) You come here to watch my family fall apart? You getting some kind of big kick out of that?

SCULLY: (to MULDER) I have to talk to you alone.

JOANNE MORRIS: (to SCULLY) Homewrecker!

(MULDER and SCULLY step away from the others. MORRIS looks at JOANNE with pity. She is still trying to get the chair out of the door. He walks up to her.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: Careful. You're going to bust a lung.

JOANNE MORRIS: Leave me alone.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Joanne... What he said about me being your husband-- it's true.

JOANNE MORRIS: Get the hell off my porch.

MORRIS AS MULDER: We got married on June 13, 1978. It rained that day. You got mad at me at the reception because I said couldn't see the cake behind your fat ass. (JOANNE turns and looks at him.) Remember our first apartment-- that dump in Pentagon City? You'd turn the air conditioner on and the lights would go out? Or when you were pregnant how I'd tickle your kneecaps to make you laugh? Remember? Remember the night Chrissy was born? When I held her in my arms all red-faced and screaming?

JOANNE MORRIS: (crying) That was the only time I ever saw you cry. Oh, my god... Morris? Is that you?

MULDER AS MORRIS: Come on, Morris. Let's go.

JOANNE MORRIS: What do you mean, go? Where are you taking him?

SCULLY: Mrs. Fletcher, we have reason to believe that whatever event caused this to happen may be in the process of reversing.

MULDER AS MORRIS: We got to get back to that highway, back to the exact spot where this all began. It may be our only chance.

(2 SUVs of MIBs pulls up. JEFF approaches them.)

JEFF: Sorry, Morris. A traitor's a traitor.

MULDER AS MORRIS: This isn't what it looks like.

SOLDIER: (retrieving the flight data recorder from SCULLY's car.) Got it!



SCENE 21

(Night. Inside JEFF's SUV. MULDER, SCULLY, and MORRIS are sitting in the back seat. They enter Area 51 space, same location as beginning of Dreamland part 1. There is a group of white SUVs waiting for them.)

SOLDIER: (driving) Sir.

(SOLDIER stops the car. JEFF gets out and goes up to HOWARD who has been waiting for them.)

JEFF: What are you doing?

HOWARD: I'm cleaning up a mess.

JEFF: What are you talking about?

HOWARD: About an hour ago I put Captain McDonough and Mrs. Chee back where they belong. Now it's their turn. (indicating MORRIS, MULDER, and SCULLY.)

MULDER AS MORRIS: The warp that started this is snapping back like a rubber band.

SCULLY: Only we have to be in its path when it happens.

(Rumbling sound.)

MULDER: (to HOWARD) Why are you doing this?

HOWARD: Till now, I had a spotless career record. I want that back.

(They all listen to a rumbling sound.)

MORRIS AS MULDER: So this is time snapping back?

MULDER AS MORRIS: It'll be like the last few days never happened. You won't remember any of this.

MORRIS AS MULDER: Oh. Well, in that case, Dana... It's been real.

(MORRIS slaps SCULLY on the butt. MULDER glares at him. Wave passes over them. SCULLY grips MULDER's hand. He is wearing clothing from last episode.)

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder. Let's go.

(SCULLY gets in the passenger seat. MULDER and MORRIS look at each other. MORRIS glances down at his wedding ring, then lights a cigarette and gets in his SUV. MULDER gets in the car with SCULLY.)



SCENE 22

(MULDER's apartment building. MULDER gets out of the elevator just as his cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

(SCULLY is in the office. A man is mopping the floor.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. I just wanted to let you know that we slipped under Kersh's radar. Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, yeah?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I'm sorry that your confidential source didn't pan out.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, I guess you were right, Scully. Just another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek.

SCULLY: (on phone) Good night.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully? I, uh, know it's not your normal life, but... Thanks for coming out there with me.

SCULLY: (on phone) You're welcome.

(SCULLY opens her desk drawer to put away a file and looks curiously at the fused dime and penny inside. MULDER reopens his apartment door and looks at the number on the door to make sure that it is his.)

[THE END]

                                    HOW THE GHOSTS STOLE CHRISTMAS


SCENE 1
CHRISTMAS EVE
SOMEWHERE IN MARYLAND

(Night. Outside a spooky old mansion. Car radio is playing Christmas songs. We hear Bing Crosby's version of "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas". We see that it is MULDER's radio. SCULLY drives up beside him. They both roll down their power windows.)

BING CROSBY: Have yourself a merry little Christmas let yourself be light From now on, our troubles will be out of sight....

MULDER: (happy to see her) I almost gave up on you.

SCULLY: Sorry. Checkout lines were worse than rush hour on the 95. If I heard "Silent Night" one more time I was going to start taking hostages. What are we doing here?

MULDER: Stakeout.

SCULLY: On Christmas Eve?

MULDER: It's an important date.

SCULLY: No kidding.

MULDER: Important to why we're here. Why don't you turn off your car and I'll fill you in on the details.

SCULLY: Mulder, I've got wrapping to do. It's the night before Christmas.

BING CROSBY: Here we are...

(MULDER looks in the back of SCULLY's car. It is completely filled with bags of packages.)

MULDER: Oh.

BING CROSBY: Happy golden days of yore...

(SCULLY rolls up her window, gets out of her car and joins MULDER in his car.)

SCULLY: Let's hear it. Give me the details.

MULDER: Look, if you've got Christmas stuff to do I don't want to... you know...

SCULLY: Mulder, I drove all the way out here. I might as well know why. Right?

MULDER: I just thought you'd be more... curious.

SCULLY: Who lives in the house?

MULDER: No one.

SCULLY: Then who are we staking out?

MULDER: The former occupants.

SCULLY: They've come back?

MULDER: That's the story.

SCULLY: I see. The dark, gothic manor the, uh, omnipresent low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth. Wait-- is that a hound I hear baying out on the moors?

MULDER: No. Actually that was a left cheek sneak.

SCULLY: Mulder, tell me you didn't call me out here on Christmas Eve to go ghost busting with you.

MULDER: Technically speaking they're called apparitions.

SCULLY: Mulder, call it what you want. I've got holiday cheer to spread. I've got a family roll call under the tree at 6:00 a.m.

(MULDER locks her door.)

MULDER: I'll make it fast. I'll just give you the details.

SCULLY: Okay.

MULDER: (mysteriously) Christmas, 1917. It was a time of dark, dark despair. American soldiers were dying at an ungodly rate in a war-torn Europe while at home, a deadly strain of the flu virus attacked young and old alike. Tragedy was a visitor on every doorstep while a creeping hopelessness set in with every man, woman and child. It was a time of dark, dark despair.

SCULLY: (not impressed) You said that.

MULDER: But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of star-crossed lovers tragedy came not from war or pestilence-- not by the boot heel or the bombardier-- but by their own innocent hand.

SCULLY: Go on.

MULDER: His name was Maurice. He was a... a brooding but heroic young man beloved of Lyda, a sublime beauty with a light that seemed to follow her wherever she went. They were likened to two angels descended from heaven whom the gods could not protect from the horrors being visited upon this cold, grey earth.

SCULLY: And what happened to them?

MULDER: Driven by a tragic fear of separation they forged a lovers' pact so that they might spend eternity together and not spend one precious Christmas apart.

SCULLY: They killed themselves?

MULDER: And their ghosts haunt this house every Christmas Eve.

(SCULLY laughs.)

MULDER: I just gave myself chills.

SCULLY: It's a good story, Mulder... And very well told but I don't believe it.

MULDER: You don't believe in ghosts?

SCULLY: That surprises you?

MULDER: Well... Yeah. I thought everybody believed in ghosts.

SCULLY: Mulder, if it were any other night I might let you talk me into it but the halls are decked and I got to go.

(SCULLY gets out of the car and heads for her car. MULDER also gets out and heads for the house.)

MULDER: My best to the family.

SCULLY: What are you doing? Mulder, don't you have somewhere to be?

MULDER: I'm just going to take a look.

SCULLY: (alone, to herself) I'm not going to do it. My New Year's resolution.

(SCULLY checks her pockets. No keys. She looks in MULDER's car. No keys. She looks in her car. No keys.)

(Sound of door creaking as MULDER enters the house. He turns on his flashlight and shines it around the foyer. Thunder rumbles as SCULLY follows him into the house.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Change your mind?

SCULLY: Did you take my car keys?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: Come on, Mulder. Don't kid around.

MULDER: Why would I take your car keys?

SCULLY: Maybe you, uh... Maybe you grabbed them by mistake.

MULDER: Maybe it was a ghost.

(They both look up at the knocking sound above them, then over at the clock chiming in the foyer. Note the name on the clock: J. Cameron. Cute "Titanic" ref. Sound of wind blowing.)

MULDER: That's a cold wind.

SCULLY: There must be a window open upstairs. You know, the weather report said that there was an 80 percent chance of rain maybe even a... maybe even a white Christmas.

(Sound of thunder crashing. Front door slams shut. SCULLY runs to try to open them. They do not budge.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Same scene.)

MULDER: I think the spirits are among us.

SCULLY: (still trying the doors) Mulder, will you quit trying to scare me and help me get these doors open.

MULDER: Sounds like there's somebody walking around upstairs.

(More knocking upstairs.)

MULDER: There. You hear that?

SCULLY: Mulder, I really have to go.

MULDER: There's nothing to be afraid of.

SCULLY: I'm not afraid, okay?

MULDER: Ghosts are benevolent entities.

(Sound of chains clanking from above.)

MULDER: Mostly.

SCULLY: You are not scaring me, Mulder.

(SCULLY checks her watch. 11:03. She looks at the clock in the hall. It also reads 11:03.)

SCULLY: Look, I really have to get home.

(MULDER starts up the stairs leaving SCULLY alone. Lightening flashes showing her the silhouette of a figure next to the window. When the lightening flashes again, the figure is gone. SCULLY follows MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Shh! What was that?

(The knocking stops.)

SCULLY: These are tricks that the mind plays. They are ingrained cliches from a thousand different horror films. When we hear a sound, we get a chill. We-we see a shadow and we allow ourselves to imagine something that an otherwise rational person would discount out of hand. The whole... Mulder...? (follows him up to the second floor) The whole idea of a benevolent entity fits perfectly with what I'm saying. That a spirit would materialize or return for no other purpose than to show itself is silly and ridiculous. I mean, what it really shows is how silly and ridiculous we have become in believing such things. I mean, that... That we can ignore all natural laws about the corporeal body- (MULDER tries a locked door) that-that we witness these spirits clad in-in their own shabby outfits with the same old haircuts and hairstyles never aging, never... Never in search of more comfortable surroundings-- it actually ends up saying more about the living than it does about the dead.

MULDER: (trying another locked door) Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: I mean, Mulder, it doesn't take an advanced degree in psychology to understand the... the unconscious yearnings that these imaginings satisfy. You know, the-the longing for immortality the hope that there is something beyond this mortal coil- (MULDER tries another locked door) that-that we might never be long without our loved ones. I mean, these are powerful, powerful desires. I mean, they're the very essence of what make us human. The very essence of Christmas, actually.

(They both turn as a door creaks as it opens slightly by itself. A light is on in the room behind it.)

MULDER: Tell me you're not afraid.

SCULLY: All right. I'm afraid... but it's an irrational fear.

(SCULLY takes a few breaths, then heads for the cracked open door.)

MULDER: (not moving) I got your back.

SCULLY: (whispers) Thank you.

(SCULLY pushes the door open and looks inside.)

SCULLY: Mulder, did it occur to you that there aren't ghosts here but that somebody actually might be living in this house?

MULDER: No one lives here.

SCULLY: But when you and I were sitting out in the car there was not a light on. And look at this.

(MULDER and SCULLY walk into an elegant turn of the century two story library. There is a ladder leading down to the lower level. Furniture is covered with white cloth. Chandelier. Great harpsichord music.)

MULDER: Must have been some kind of electrical surge.

SCULLY: Mulder, did you happen to notice the clock downstairs is keeping perfect time?

MULDER: Is it?

SCULLY: And how do you explain that?

(Indicates smoking fireplace. They go down the ladder to the fireplace.)

SCULLY: This fire has just gone out.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Don't look so disappointed.

MULDER: Why would anyone want to live in a cursed house?

SCULLY: Mulder, it's not enough that it's haunted? It has to be cursed?

MULDER: Every couple that's ever lived here has met a tragic end. Three double murders in the last 80 years. All on Christmas Eve.

(From above there is the sound of a door slamming and a thumping.)

MULDER: Whoa... There's that sound again

(They look down at the floor boards which are creaking. MULDER moves the furniture out of the way and puts his ear down to the floor. The doors to the library creak. SCULLY looks up at them, then notices that the ladder to the upper level of the library is missing.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(SCULLY turns back to MULDER who has gotten up from the floor and is holding the flashlight under his chin in the classic "scare the bejeebees out of your little sister/friend" pose. It works. SCULLY turns and screams and he screams back at her.)

SCULLY: That's not funny!

MULDER: (chuckling) I think there's a hiding space under the floorboards.

SCULLY: What are you going to do?

MULDER: There may be somebody trapped under there.

SCULLY: Mulder, don't.

MULDER: I got to get them out.

SCULLY: Not now.

MULDER: Hey, you have a gun, right? Rationally, you've been in much more dangerous situations.

(MULDER begins pulling up floor boards. Exposes a very dead man.)

MULDER: I was half right.

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

(MULDER keeps pulling up boards, exposes another body.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully... Look at this.

SCULLY: It's a woman.

(SCULLY shines her flashlight on the two very decomposed corpses. Woman appears to have a bullet wound in her belly, man a wound in his chest.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it looks like they were shot to death.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: You know what's weird?

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Mulder, she's wearing my outfit.

(SCULLY and the female corpse are both wearing a white blouse and black jacket.)

MULDER: How embarrassing.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, you know what? He's wearing yours.

(MULDER checks what he's wearing- white T-shirt and leather jacket.)

MULDER: Oh... Scully...

SCULLY: That's us.

(They run out of the room and into  the library again. Great flashlight sequence, shining opposite directions, then over each other.)

MULDER: (realizing) Hey, Scully...

SCULLY: This is the same room.

(They try again, and enter the library again. They still see the dead bodies.)

MULDER: All right. I'm beginning to... Get this.

SCULLY: You go through that door and I...

MULDER: I should come out... This door.

SCULLY: Right.

(MULDER crosses to the opposite end of the room and exits into the library again. SCULLY waits for him to enter the door next to her, but he doesn't. They are separated.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully!

(Doors slam between them. MULDER crosses to the door that just closed. He goes through it into the library again. The room is empty.)

MULDER: Scully!



SCENE 3

(Same scene continued. MULDER is banging on the door trying to connect with SCULLY.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully. Scully, can you hear me?

(MULDER shoots the lock off the door, then opens it only to find that the doorway has been bricked up. He turns to see MAURICE, an older man wearing a hat standing in the room.)

MULDER: Hey! Who are you?

MAURICE: That's a question I should be asking being this is my house you're standing in. This isn't one of those home invasions, is it?

MULDER: No.

MAURICE: Good. Would you like me to show you the door?

MULDER: That's very funny.

MAURICE: I wasn't making a joke.

MULDER: Have you looked at the door?

MAURICE: Uh-huh, I'm looking at it now.

MULDER: Tell me what you see.

MAURICE: I see a door with the lock shot off it. You going to pay for that?

MULDER: That's a door with a brick wall behind it.

MAURICE: (disbelieving) Okay, sure.

MULDER: You're playing tricks on me.

MAURICE: If I am, I'm sorry but I don't know any tricks.

MULDER: Yeah? That's a trick in itself, isn't it? You've been playing tricks on us since we got here.

MAURICE: Am I to take it we're not alone?

(MULDER chuckles.)

MULDER: Ah, that's very funny coming from a ghost.

MAURICE: ( laughs heartily ) Yeah, oh... the gun fooled me a little at first. You're a ghost hunter, huh? And you think I'm a ghost, huh? I've seen a lot of strange folks coming around here with a lot of strange equipment but I think you must be the first I've seen come armed.

MULDER: Strange folks?

MAURICE: Mm-hmm.

MULDER: Like those folks under the floorboard

(MULDER turns and shines his light on the floor, but the corpses are missing, the floor untouched.)

MULDER: How did you do that?

MAURICE: I didn't do anything.

MULDER: There were corpses here-- bodies buried under the floorboards.

MAURICE: Why don't you have a seat, son.

(Short time later. MULDER is sitting with his face in his hands.)

MAURICE: You drink? Take drugs?

MULDER: No.

MAURICE: Get high?

MULDER: No.

MAURICE: Are you overcome by the impulse to make everyone believe you?

(MULDER looks up at him in surprise.)

MAURICE: I'm in the field of mental health. I specialize in disorders and manias related to pathological behavior as it pertains to the paranormal.

MULDER: Wow. I didn't know such a thing existed.

MAURICE: My specialty is in what I call soul prospectors-- a crossaxial classification I've codified by extensive interaction with visitors like yourself. I've found you all tend to fall into pretty much the same category.

MULDER: And what category is that?

MAURICE: Narcissistic, overzealous, self-righteous egomaniac.

MULDER: That's a category?

MAURICE: You kindly think of yourself as single-minded but you're prone to obsessive compulsiveness workaholism, antisocialism... Fertile fields for the descent into total wacko breakdown.

MULDER: I don't think that pegs me exactly.

MAURICE: Oh, really? Waving a gun around my house? Huh? Raving like a lunatic about some imaginary brick wall?

(MULDER looks over at  the brick wall in the doorway.)

MAURICE: You've probably convinced yourself you've seen aliens. You know why you think you see the things you do?

MULDER: Because I have seen them?

MAURICE: 'Cause you're a lonely man. A lonely man chasing paramasturbatory illusions that you believe will give your life meaning and significance and which your pathetic social maladjustment makes impossible for you to find elsewhere. You probably consider yourself passionate, serious, misunderstood. Am I right?

MULDER: "Paramasturbatory"?

MAURICE: Most people would rather stick their fingers in a wall socket than spend a minute with you.

MULDER: All right, now just, uh... Just back off for a second.

MAURICE: Spend every Christmas this way... Alone?

MULDER: (confident) I'm not alone.

MAURICE: More self-delusion.

MULDER: No, I came here with my partner. She's somewhere in the house.

MAURICE: Behind a brick wall?

(MULDER smiles and nods.)

MAURICE: How'd you get her to come with you? Steal her car keys?

(MULDER drops his smile.)

MAURICE: You know why you do it-- listen endlessly to her droning rationalizations. 'Cause you're afraid. Afraid of the loneliness. Am I right?

MULDER: I'd just like to find my partner.

MAURICE: Good... Easy. Piece of cake.

(MAURICE gets up and walks through the clear doorway. He turns back to face MULDER.)

MAURICE: Brick wall (indicates doorway) ... Or brick wall? (points to his head) Go ahead, change your life.

(MULDER gets up and starts to walk through the now clear doorway. He runs into an invisible wall which we quickly perceive as the brick wall again. MAURICE is now out of sight. MULDER turns to see the now dark library which quickly cuts to SCULLY's version of the library.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(SCULLY backs away from the locked door then turns and screams when she sees LYDA, an older woman dressed in a long white dressing gown. LYDA screams back. SCULLY frantically tries to get her gun out of the holster at the small of her back, but is shaking so badly she can't get hold of it.)

LYDA: No, no, please, I won't hurt you.

SCULLY: I'm a federal agent! I'm armed.

LYDA: (turning on lights) You're what?

SCULLY: (finally getting her gun out) I'm armed.

LYDA: You said...

SCULLY: (gun shaking) I'm armed.

LYDA: You're a federal agent?

SCULLY: Please, I'm a little on edge. Don't come any closer. My name is Special Agent Dana Scully. And, uh, I can... I can show you my I.D.

LYDA: My goodness, I... I thought you were a ghost.

SCULLY: I can assure you that I'm not. I, uh, I got stuck in this room looking for my partner.

LYDA: Oh, the gangly fellow with the distinguished profile.

SCULLY: You've seen him?

LYDA: With you in the foyer. I thought he was a ghost, too.

SCULLY: Oh... That was you.

LYDA: I sleepwalk sometimes. I thought maybe I'd dreamed it. But then here you were again.

SCULLY: (catching her breath) I am sorry... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I, uh... It's just that we found bodies.

LYDA: Bodies... Where?

SCULLY: Right...

(The floor is untouched.)

LYDA: You look like you saw a ghost. There are ghosts in this house, you know.

SCULLY: (raising gun again) Who are you?

LYDA: I live here, thank you very much.

SCULLY: Where's my partner?

LYDA: Why are you pointing that gun?

SCULLY: There were corpses right there underneath the floor!

(LYDA chuckles.)

LYDA: I think maybe the ghosts have been playing tricks on you.

SCULLY: I don't believe in ghosts.

LYDA: Then what are you doing here?

SCULLY: It's my partner.

LYDA: He believes in ghosts?

SCULLY: Yeah.

LYDA: Oh, you poor child. You must have an awful small life. Spending your Christmas Eve with him... Running around chasing things you don't even believe in.

SCULLY: Don't come any closer.

LYDA: (coming closer) I can see it in your face... The fear... The conflicted yearnings... A subconscious desire to find fulfillment through another. Intimacy through co-dependency.

SCULLY: What?

LYDA: Maybe you repress the truth about why you're really here pretending it's out of duty or loyalty-- unable to admit your dirty little secret. Your only joy in life is proving him wrong.

SCULLY: You don't know me. And you don't live here. This isn't your house.

LYDA: You wouldn't think so, the way I'm being treated.

SCULLY: Well, then why is all the furniture covered?

LYDA: We're having the house painted.

SCULLY: Well then where's your Christmas tree?!

LYDA: We're Jewish. Boo.

(SCULLY turns as MAURICE enters the room.)

SCULLY: Hold it right there. Don't make me shoot you. Stay where you are.

MAURICE: We really attract them, don't we?

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

MAURICE: Mulder? Is that his name?

SCULLY: Where is he?

MAURICE: He'll be along.

SCULLY: Move over there.

(They just look at her.)

SCULLY: (trying to sound authoritative) Both of you, move. Move over there. Move other there.

MAURICE: This violates our civil rights. I have friends at the ACLU.

SCULLY: Put your hands up.

(They do. LYDA has a gunshot hole through her abdomen. SCULLY stares at her, then walks over to MAURICE and lifts his hat. There is a gunshot hole through is head. Camera pans to show her looking through the hole, then SCULLY faints. LYDA and MAURICE put their hands down.)

MAURICE: You see what we've resorted to? Gimmicks and cheap tricks. We used to be so good at this.

LYDA: We used to have years to drive them mad. Now we get one night.

MAURICE: This pop psychology approach is crap. All it does is annoy them. When's the last time we actually haunted anyone?

LYDA: When was the last time we had a good double murder? Not since the house was condemned.

MAURICE: This is embarrassing-- amateur kid stuff.

LYDA: Look, if we let our reputations slip they're going to take us off the tourist literature. Last year no one even showed up.

MAURICE: Oh, of all days, why did you pick Christmas? Why not Halloween?

LYDA: (grabbing him by the lapels) Now, who is filled with hopelessness and futility on Halloween? Christmas comes but once a year.

MAURICE: You're right. These two do seem pretty miserable. We need to show them just how lonely Christmas can be.

LYDA: Now that's the old Yuletide spirit.

(They kiss and begin laughing.)



SCENE 4

(MULDER's version of the library. Flashlight in his mouth, MULDER is straining to pull himself up to the upper level of the library. LYDA watches from the lower level. Just as he gets up, LYDA enters the upper level.)

LYDA: Are you Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Who are you, now?

LYDA: What are you doing using my chair for a ladder?

MULDER: I'm trying to get out of this room.

LYDA: Trying to get out?

MULDER: Excuse me.

LYDA: No, no. You can't get out that way.

(MULDER hesitates, then pokes her in the shoulder. She is solid. He pushes her against the wall.)

LYDA: Masher.

MULDER: Frump.

(MULDER opens the door and is confronted by another brick wall.)

LYDA: I don't know who you're calling a frump but I don't appreciate that-- being manhandled, or called names. Certainly not at this hour.

MULDER: You're a ghost.

LYDA: Oh, more names!

(They go down the suddenly reappeared ladder to the chairs on the lower level.)

MULDER: What happened to the star-crossed lovers?

LYDA: Oh, let me tell you the romance is the first thing to go.

MULDER: (realizing) It's you. You're Lyda, and that was Maurice. But you've aged.

LYDA: I hope your partner finds you a lot more charming than I do. (prances to bookcase) Let's see. Where is it?

(LYDA mutters as, by themselves, books pull out of bookcase. MULDER is fascinated.)

LYDA: No, no, no, no... (continues muttering ) there it is. (selects a book - The Ghosts Who Stole Christmas) I was young and beautiful once, just like your partner. Whoo! Look at us. Maurice was so handsome. (fire blazes up) He didn't have a gut.

(She hands MULDER the book which has a picture of an attractive couple in it - chapter title - Tale of the Star Crossed Lovers.)

LYDA: I hope you're not expecting any great advantages to all this.

MULDER: To all what?

LYDA: I'm assuming you came here with similar misconceptions.

MULDER: We came here looking for you.

LYDA: Oh, yeah? You didn't come here to be together for eternity?

MULDER: (chuckling) No.

LYDA: Because you're filled with despair and woeful Christmas melancholy?

MULDER: Why?

LYDA: (sighing) Maybe it was your partner then.

MULDER: (crossing his arms over his chest) What about her?

LYDA: You knew this house was haunted.

MULDER: Yeah.

LYDA: Maybe you two should have discussed your real feelings before you came out here. I'm speaking from experience.

MULDER: What experience?

LYDA: I'm not going to get into semantics. A murder-suicide is all about trust.

MULDER: I thought you had a lovers' pact.

LYDA: (laughs) Poetic illusions aside, the outcome, Mulder, is pretty much the same.

(LYDA stands and holds open her robe exposing the bullet wound.)

MULDER: (shocked) Oh...!

LYDA: I don't show my hole to just anyone.

MULDER: (rather disgusted) Why are you showing it to me?

LYDA: It isn't like you're going to be eating any Christmas ham, is it?

MULDER: Oh, you're trying to tell me that Scully's going to shoot me. Scully is not going to shoot me.

LYDA: Suit yourself, but if you shoot first, for her, the rest is an act of faith.

MULDER: I wouldn't shoot her.

LYDA: Maybe she shoots herself.

MULDER: (confidently) I wouldn't let her.

LYDA: The bodies under the floor-- maybe that was just some kind of Jungian symbolism. Or maybe... there's a secret lovers' pact.

MULDER: (sighing with a smile) We're not lovers.

LYDA: And this isn't a pure science. But you're both so attractive and there'll be a lot of time to work that out. (holds a gun out to him) Go ahead, take it.

(MULDER quickly checks his holster and finds that the gun is missing)

LYDA: Take it. Think of it as the last Christmas you'll ever spend alone.

(LYDA disappears letting the gun fall into a surprised MULDER's hand.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY's version of the library. SCULLY wakes up from her faint and looks around holding her gun and flashlight. Tries a locked door.)

MAURICE: (sitting in one of the chairs) I locked it. For your protection.

(SCULLY whips around to face him.)

SCULLY: Stay away from me. Look, I want you to get me out of here. I am quite capable of pulling this trigger.

MAURICE: I'm glad to hear it. You may well have to defend yourself against that crazy partner of yours.

SCULLY: What have you done with him?!

MAURICE: Kept him safe from his own mad devices-- at least for now. Do you have any idea why he brought you here to this house?

SCULLY: Look, all I know is this is just some bad dream. This is all in my head.

MAURICE: Yet here you are waving a gun at me like your partner.

(There is a pounding at the door.)

MULDER: (outside door) Hey, Scully!

MAURICE: Do you realize how seriously disturbed that man is? How dark and lonely? What he's capable of?

MULDER: (outside door) Scully?!

SCULLY: Mulder!

(SCULLY starts to run to the door, but stops for MAURICE.)

MAURICE: Want your car keys?

(MAURICE dangles her car keys in front of her. She stares at them.)

SCULLY: Where did you get those?

MAURICE: He's got nowhere to go this Christmas. No one to go with. Did he happen to mention a story about a lovers' pact?

SCULLY: Where did you get those keys?

MAURICE: The man is acting out an unconscious yearning. The deep-seated terror of being alone.

(More pounding on door.)

MULDER: (outside door) Scully... Scully, are you there?!

SCULLY: I'm here, Mulder!

MULDER: (outside door) Open the door, Scully!

SCULLY: (taking keys, to MAURICE) Open the door.

(MAURICE goes reluctantly to the door.)

MAURICE: I've seen it happen too many times in this house.

SCULLY: I don't believe you. Just open the door.

MAURICE: But...

SCULLY: Open the door!

(MAURICE opens the door and MULDER enters the room, gun drawn.)

MULDER: Where's Scully?

SCULLY: Mulder?

(MULDER turns to face her and fires his gun at her.)



SCENE 5

(Scene continues. MULDER, holding his gun keeps advancing on SCULLY. She holds her gun, but doesn't fire. He fires, shattering a mirror behind her.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing? (he fires again) Mulder!

MULDER: There's no getting out of here, Scully. There's no way home. (fires)

SCULLY: Mulder, come on... Mulder, don't come any closer. You're scaring me. Put the gun down!

MULDER: You going to shoot me?!

SCULLY: I'm not going to shoot you! I don't want to shoot you!

MULDER: (maniacal) It's me or you... You or me. One of us has to do it.

SCULLY: Mulder, look... We don't have to do this.

MULDER: Oh, yes, we do.

SCULLY: We can get out of here.

MULDER: Even if we could what's waiting for us? More loneliness! And then 365 more shopping days till even more loneliness!

SCULLY: I don't believe what you're saying! Mulder, I don't believe a word of it.

(MULDER lowers the angle of the gun and fires. SCULLY drops her gun and stares down in shock at the bullet wound in her abdomen. She looks back up at MULDER who is biting his lower lip as if in pain himself, but still has a wild look in his eyes. Slowly she falls to the floor, still staring up at him.)

MULDER: Merry Christmas, Scully.

(MULDER raises the gun to his own temple. Camera angle changes, showing us that is not MULDER, but LYDA.)

LYDA: And a happy New Year.

(MAURICE walks over and restrains MULDER/LYDA from firing the gun.)

MULDER/LYDA: Let me go!

(Camera angle changes. We see again that it is LYDA. SCULLY still sees MULDER.)

LYDA: Let me go!

SCULLY: Mulder!

LYDA: Let me go... Let me go...

MULDER/LYDA: Let me go!

MULDER: Scully!

(CUT TO: MULDER entering another version of the library. SCULLY lies bleeding on the floor. He runs to her side.)

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (weak) Mulder... Is that you?

MULDER: What did you do?

SCULLY: I didn't believe it, Mulder.

MULDER: You didn't believe what?

SCULLY: I didn't believe that you'd do it... That I would...

(MULDER looks down and sees that she has raised her gun to his chest.)

SCULLY: Merry Christmas, Mulder.

MULDER: (not pulling away) What are you doing?

(She fires the gun. MULDER, in shock falls back bleeding from the chest.)

(LYDA, lying where MULDER just perceived SCULLY, giggles happily. Old phonograph player begins playing "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas." )

(SCULLY groggily rolls over and begins pulling herself out of the room.)

MUSIC:
Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let yourself be light
From now on, your troubles will be out of sight

(MULDER is stumbling down the stairs, bleeding heavily.)

Have yourself a merry little Christmas Make the Yuletide gay From now on, our troubles will be miles away Here we are, as in olden days

(MULDER reaches and falls into the foyer which has a trail of blood across it. He sees SCULLY a few feet away also crawling to the door.)

MULDER: Scully?

Happy golden days of yore Faithful friends who are dear to us Gather near to us...

MULDER: (gasping) Scully...

Through the years, we all will be together...

(SCULLY rolls over painfully and points her gun at MULDER. MULDER manages to point his gun at her.)

Until then, we'll have...

SCULLY: ( whispering as she lowers the gun and falls back on to the floor) Ah... I'm not going to make it.

MULDER: (holding his gun on her) No, you're not... Not without me, you're not.

SCULLY: Are you afraid, Mulder? (gasping) I am.

MULDER: I am, too.

(They both drop their guns and roll over painfully.)

Faithful friends who are dear to us Gather near to us...

MULDER: You should have thought of this.

SCULLY: You should have.

MULDER: (accusing) You shot me first!

SCULLY: (also accusing) I didn't shoot you. You shot me.

If the fates allow Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow...

(With dawning realization, MULDER stands up.)

MULDER: Scully...

SCULLY: What?

(SCULLY coughs.)

MULDER: Get up.

SCULLY: I can't.

MULDER: Get up... You're not shot.

(MULDER holds his bloody shirt away from his stomach.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: Come on. It's a trick. It's all in your head.

(He pulls SCULLY to her feet and holds out her bloody shirt. She looks down, then they both run out the now unlocked front door. Once outside, they look down at their now clean shirts, then run to their cars and drive off quickly.)

Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry... little Christmas now.

(Inside, clock begins striking twelve. MAURICE and LYDA are sitting in the library.)

LYDA: You hear that? It's Christmas.

MAURICE: One for the books.

LYDA: We almost had those two, didn't we?

MAURICE: ( chuckling ) Almost had them.

LYDA: Two such lonely souls.

MAURICE: We can't let our failures haunt us.

LYDA: You wonder what they were really out here looking for.

MAURICE: Hard to say. People now... This is just another joyless day of the year.

LYDA: Not for us.

MAURICE: No. We haven't forgotten the meaning of Christmas.

(They hold hands and fade away as the clock strikes twelve.)



SCENE 5

(MULDER's apartment. Later that morning, but still dark outside. MULDER, still dressed in his jacket, is on his couch watching a black and white version of A Christmas Carol. He looks rather depressed.)

TV SCROOGE: (laughing) I don't deserve to be so happy. I can't help it. I just can't help it.

TV NARRATOR: Scrooge was better than his word. ( knocking ) He became as good a friend, as good a master and as good a man as the good old city ever knew or any other good old city, town or borough in the good old world. And to Tiny Tim...

(There is a knocking sound. He looks up first, then realizes it is his door. He looks around the corner of the wall, then shuts off the TV and opens the door. It is SCULLY, also still dressed.)

SCULLY: I, uh... I couldn't sleep. I was, um... ( sighing )

(MULDER puts his arm around her shoulders and pulls her into the apartment and closes the door. They are both exhausted.)

MULDER: Come in. Aren't you supposed to be opening Christmas gifts with your family?

SCULLY: Mulder... None of that really happened out there tonight... That was all in our heads, right?

MULDER: (unsure of what to say) I-it must have been.

SCULLY: Mmm. Not that, uh, my only joy in life is proving you wrong.

MULDER: When have you proved me wrong?

SCULLY: Well... Why else would you want me out there with you?

MULDER: You didn't want to be there?

(SCULLY has no answer. They both think about it.)

MULDER: (self-analyzing) Oh, that's, um... That's self-righteous and... narcissistic of me to say, isn't it?

SCULLY: No, I mean... Maybe I did want to be out there with you.

(They look at each other for a moment.)

MULDER: Now, um... I know we said that we weren't going to exchange gifts but, uh... I got you... a little something.

(With a shy smile, he holds out a small wrapped tubular present - about the size of a short paper towel roll insert.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Merry Christmas.

SCULLY: Well, I got you a little something, too.

(Embarrassed she holds out a small rectangular wrapped gift - size of a small book. Or a video. He chuckles as they take each other's presents. He shakes his, and she grins happily, then like kids they run over to the couch and begin opening their gifts as the camera pans away outside the window through the falling snow.)

BING CROSBY: Have yourself a merry little Christmas now.

[THE END]

                                       TERMS OF ENDEARMENT



SCENE 1
HOLLINS, VIRGINIA

(Doctors office. The obstetrician, DR COUVILLION is talking to LAURA and WAYNE WEINSIDER. They both look slightly nervous about what they are hearing and seeing on the sonogram that he has handed them. LAURA is very pregnant.)

DR COUVILLION: It's important that you realize sonograms are by no means an exact science. I don't want to alarm you or have you jump to conclusions because honestly, it's not something that we're perfectly able to explain.

LAURA: But I-I don't see anything.

DR COUVILLION: As I said, we may be premature in a diagnosis. It may simply be... An intermediate stage of growth.

WAYNE: But there's a problem.

DR COUVILLION: We see a development-- an abnormal bony formation involving the upper vertebrae and something growing here-- on the plates of the skull.

(WAYNE stand and crosses away.)

LAURA: Wayne...

(DR COUVILLION leaves them alone.)

WAYNE: Sweetness?

LAURA: It might be nothing. I'm serious. Dr. Couvillion really just wants to wait and see.

WAYNE: I just... want it to be normal.

LAURA: Oh, Wayne... let's go home, okay? Come on.



SCENE 2
HOLLINS, VIRGINIA

(Later, they are home getting ready for bed. WAYNE brings LAURA a glass of milk and she drinks it and takes a pill from her bedside table.)

LAURA: Thank you.

(They turn off the light and cuddle. He caresses her stomach.)

WAYNE: I love you, Laura... no matter what. You know that? Poopydoo?

LAURA: I know. Good night, Wayne.

WAYNE: Good night, Laura. Sweet dreams.

(She turns on her side, and he holds her close to him.)

(Later that night, LAURA wakes up suddenly. She looks over to the side of the bed and sees that WAYNE is missing.)

LAURA: Wayne!

LAURA: Wayne!

(She hears a growling noise She sees a demonic figure standing at the foot of her bed amid flames. She begins screaming in terror.)

LAURA: Wayne! Please, what are you doing?! No...

(The growling continues and the figure grabs her by her legs and drags her to the foot of the bed and holds her legs apart. Camera angle moves to just show her face as she screams in terror, then pain. The demon works frantically between LAURA's legs. She leans up and bites his neck, but he pushes her down.)

LAURA: Stop it! Wayne! Where are you?! Stop him!

(We her a baby crying. The demon figure holds a baby up. It has tiny horns.)

LAURA: Please, don't take my baby! Please, don't take my baby! Wayne! Wayne!

(She wakes up crying. It was a dream. Wayne is beside her trying to comfort her.)

WAYNE: Laura?

LAURA: My baby!

WAYNE: Laura, it's okay. Laurie, you're having a dream.

LAURA: Oh, it was terrible.

WAYNE: It's okay. Shh.

LAURA: Oh... it was... Trying to steal our baby.

(WAYNE reaches under the sheet to stroke her stomach. He pulls his hand back and it is covered in blood. They stare at it in shock. He pulls the sheet down. Her stomach is much smaller and her nightgown is covered in blood. LAURA begins screaming.)

SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(X-Files Office. AGENT SPENDER is interviewing DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS.)

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: It's not the kind of case where I quite know where to turn, you understand. Down in Hollins we do get our share of the oddball. On the whole, though, we're pretty much like any other little town. You got your home break-ins, your smash and grabs... nothing too wild. But given the victim's statement, the unusually vivid detail... Well, I just had to take Laura's word about her baby being abducted. I hear you specialize in these kind of cases.

AGENT SPENDER: You've come to the right place, Deputy, uh... (checks the report in his hand) Stevens. Now this woman making these claims she's your sister?

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Yes, sir. Laura Weinsider.

AGENT SPENDER: Mm-hmm.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: I've heard about the things people been saying about her, not to my face, of course, but... real mean and awful things about what Laura's part is in all this.

AGENT SPENDER: Now it says here, a doctor's report the day before revealed to her ah... abnormalities in the ultrasound.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Yes, sir, that is true, but nothing conclusive, mind you.

AGENT SPENDER: I see. Okay, Deputy. We're going to put this right into our priority caseload.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Boy... I really want to thank you. I know Laura's really itching to talk to somebody who will really listen to her.

(DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS leaves the room. AGENT SPENDER glances at the report again, then reaches behind him and feeds the report into the paper shredder.)



SCENE 4

(Hollins, Virginia. Average small town. DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS is sitting in his squad car #1223 talking to his passenger.)

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: I know this went right into your caseload but I never imagined you would get here so soon, Agent, uh...

(The passenger is, of course, MULDER. He is holding the report from the last scene that has been taped back together.)

MULDER: Oh, Mulder. Fox Mulder. Though I ask you not to make that known to anybody. The FBI likes to keep our work on these cases very hush-hush.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Sure, of course but I would like to thank Agent Spender.

MULDER: Oh. No, no, no. I'll thank him for you because I have to call in my, uh, progress report.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: I hope you have something to call in.

MULDER: Oh, me, too. All right.

(They get out of the car and go inside the WEINSIDER house. Later, MULDER interviews LAURA WEINSIDER. She is very upset. WAYNE has his arm around her.)

LAURA: I kept calling it a nightmare... But how many people's nightmare's come true?

MULDER: Not many. Certainly not in the way yours did, Mrs. Weinsider.

LAURA: When I was having it... it just seemed so real.

MULDER: You mentioned a fire in the room, in your account and a, uh... a devil that held your legs...

LAURA: So that he could take the baby.

MULDER: But according to your statement  your baby... was not a normal baby.

LAURA: No. It was some kind of monster. With, um...horns and a tail. (begins crying) Can you excuse me?

(She leaves the room.)

WAYNE: My wife appears so resilient, but I know she's suffered ever since the doctor told us about the complications.

MULDER: Um... You were right there in bed with your wife the whole time Mr. Weinsider?

WAYNE: Yes. I woke her up.

MULDER: But according to... your wife's statement, at one point she... she reached over for you in the bed and you weren't there.

WAYNE: Well, it was a dream.

MULDER: (suspicious) Yeah. Mind if I use your phone... Wayne?

WAYNE: Sure, of course.



SCENE 5
US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE
WASHINGTON, DC
11:17 AM

(A TINY closet of an interviewing room. SCULLY is interviewing MR GINSBERG. She sounds very bored.)

SCULLY: Remember your truthfulness is important, Mr. Ginsberg and as a prospective federal employee, I will remind you to answer as honestly as possible. Okay?

MR GINSBERG: Sure. Fire away.

SCULLY: (reading) "Do you, or have you ever smoked marijuana?"

(MR GINSBERG looks like Jerry Garcia. Total hippie. The man knows his way around a joint.)

MR GINSBERG: Nope. No, siree.

(SCULLY just stares at him for a moment.)

SCULLY: (reading) "Have you consorted with people who have now or in the past?"

MR GINSBERG: (thinking carefully) No... I really don't think so.

(SCULLY's cell phone rings to her great relief.)

SCULLY: Ah. (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, it's me.

(SCULLY looks over at MR GINSBERG and mouths "Would you mind." He nods and steps out of the room.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, where are you? I waited 45 minutes for you this morning.

MULDER: (on phone) I, uh... Before I tell you I-I'm going to ask you to keep an open mind.

SCULLY: (on phone, knowing exactly what he's up to) This isn't an X-File?

MULDER: (on phone) Call it what you like. Here in Roanoke they're calling it a demon baby snatching.

SCULLY: (on phone) You're in Virginia?

MULDER: (on phone) Look, I want you to look at this woman's charts. Strange in utero deformities were detected. I'm going to courier them to you, all right?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, we are supposed to be doing background checks not chasing X-Files.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, Spender just round filed this case-- it's unconscionable.

SCULLY: (on phone) And what do you call rooting through his trash?

MULDER: (on phone) Like that's any different from the assignment we're stuck with.

SCULLY: (on phone) "We," Mulder? I'm stuck with it. You're not here.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, this is a classic case of demon fetal harvest- what they called in the middle ages atum nocturnem-- the impregnation of an unwitting woman by a dark lord of the underworld...

SCULLY: (on phone) As host for his demon seed.

MULDER: (on phone) Exactly.

SCULLY: (on phone) I saw Rosemary's Baby on cable the other night.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, but this is the real deal. You check that woman's charts, you'll get hard evidence. Check her prenatal ultrasound.

(We see WAYNE standing in another room listening to the baby monitor which is picking up MULDER and SCULLY's conversation.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder...

MULDER: (on phone) Just humor me, Scully. Take a look at those medical records. I think they'll prove my theory.



SCENE 6
10:56 PM

(WEINSIDER's bedroom. LAURA is looking for something.)

LAURA: Wayne, have you seen my nightgown?

(No answer. The bedroom is empty.)

LAURA: I can't find...

(She goes downstairs.)

LAURA: Wayne Wayne? Wayne!

(Outside, the trash/leaf incinerator is burning. WAYNE is digging for something in a pile of leaves. LAURA goes outside and sees the fire. WAYNE pulls a small wrapped bundle out of the leaves.)

LAURA: (crossing the yard) Wayne?

(LAURA slowly approaches the incinerator and sees a small figure burning. WAYNE touches her back. Startled, she turns to him.)

WAYNE: (concerned) Laura? What are you doing?

LAURA: What are you doing?

WAYNE: Burning leaves.

LAURA: As this time of night?

WAYNE: Well, you asked me to rake up the yard. It was in the job jar. Hey, come on. You're making me feel weird.

LAURA: Come to bed, Wayne. Please.

WAYNE: I will, honey. I just wanted... I just wanted everything to look perfect when you woke up. I'll be right in.

(She slowly goes back to the house. WAYNE looks back at the now visible tiny skeleton in the incinerator and tears begin falling down his cheeks.)



SCENE 7
6:57 AM

(Next morning. MULDER is sleeping in his car outside the WEINSIDER house. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

(SCULLY is sitting in front of her office computer. She looks very tired.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I think I found what you're looking for. I've been up all night going over the medical charts on the Weinsider baby.

MULDER: (on phone) What'd you find?

SCULLY: (on phone) The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of? They're all here, but they're subtle.

MULDER: (on phone) Describe them to me.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, they look to be discrete bony deformities. There are spurs on the superior aspect of the scapula and small protuberances on the skull adjacent to the coronal suture.

MULDER: (on phone) "Protuberances?" You mean, like horns?

(MULDER looks down at a portrait of LAURA and WAYNE in his file and sketches a pair of horns on WAYNE's head.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, they could be recessive characteristics expressed as vestiges of primitive morphology or a developmental anomaly like craniosynostosis.

MULDER: (on phone) Do you think this is something that could be passed along by the father?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, I wouldn't look to the father as any kind of dark force here, Mulder. I think it's the mother and Virginia law on third- trimester abortions requires you to put her under arrest.

MULDER: (on phone) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: (on phone) Labor was induced, Mulder. In the mother's blood, there was found a significant trace of an herb called mandrake. It's a poison that's been known to facilitate self-abortion.

MULDER: (on phone) "Mandrake?"

SCULLY: (on phone) It's also been known to be used as an hallucinogenic.

MULDER: (on phone) You think Mrs. Weinsider self-prescribed?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I called the doctor on a hunch and he said that the father was very upset about the news while the mother was quite the opposite. Look, Mulder, I'm going to fax this information to you so that you can present it to the commonwealth attorney for the county of Roanoke but I think we have your baby snatcher here.

(MULDER watches as WAYNE drives away in a red convertible sports car. WAYNE sees MULDER also.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah? What? Yes?

SCULLY: (on phone) I suggest that you proceed very carefully. This could be very emotional for everybody concerned.

MULDER: (on phone) All right, thank you.

(MULDER hangs up and goes up to the house.)



SCENE 8

(Different house. WAYNE knocks at the door. BETSY, very pregnant, opens the door for him. Where LAURA was mousy, this woman is Glamour!Pregnant.)

BETSY: What are you doing?

WAYNE: Sorry. I forgot my key.

BETSY: Well, where have you been?

WAYNE: I told you I was going to be on the road until Tuesday... Poopydoo.

BETSY: I was just so worried, Wayne. We're getting so close now.

WAYNE: Honey... (kisses her forehead) I wouldn't let anything happen not to our little bundle of joy.

(He gently strokes her belly.)



SCENE 9

(Weinsider house. MULDER, LAURA, and DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS and some OFFICERS are inside the kitchen. DEPUTY STEVENS is very upset.)

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: I'll tell you who's been taking hallucinogenics. She didn't take poison. My sister had never even heard of... whatever it is.

MULDER: Mandrake.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: "Mandrake." Where would she even get such a thing?

LAURA: All I took were some herbal sleep aids.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: You don't need to say anything, Laura.

MULDER: Hey, why don't you just let your sister talk? It might clear things up.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Not without a lawyer.

MULDER: She's not under arrest.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: You're damned right she's not and I didn't call you down here to tell me rumors that I've already heard. My sister's no baby killer!

(WAYNE enters the house and looks around in surprise.)

WAYNE: What's going on?

LAURA: They're accusing me of taking the life of our baby.

WAYNE: Who's accusing you?

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Who do you think? I don't know where you been, Wayne but I'm the only one keeping the dogs from the door.

WAYNE: Well, a man's got to make a living.

MULDER: Wayne-- Mr. Weinsider-I-I don't want to arrest Laura. I'm sure you'd hate like the devil for that to happen as well.

(MULDER and WAYNE stare at each other.)

WAYNE: I should say so.

MULDER: So why don't you tell Deputy Stevens that it's okay to search the premises so we can clear up any misunderstanding about who's responsible for what happened here?

WAYNE: Of course.

(DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS and the OFFICERS go outside and begin looking around. Inside, WAYNE watches them search the area around the incinerator.)

WAYNE: Laura, could you come here?

(MULDER comes out of the kitchen with a large jar of fiber dietary supplement.)

MULDER: Whatever else we find I know everybody in this house is regular.

(MULDER goes out to the incinerator.)

LAURA: (inside, to WAYNE) I know there's nothing they're going to find but why do I feel guilty anyway?

WAYNE: Laura, there's something I need to tell you about that... Something that I've kept secret for reasons that I think will explain for themselves.

LAURA: What? What are you talking about?

WAYNE: Well, I don't exactly know how to say this. I'm sure that you might find it painful, as I do.

LAURA: Wayne, what?

WAYNE: On the night... the night that you lost the baby I had gotten up because I couldn't sleep and when I came back to bed, you were... you had... our little baby in your hands. You were in some kind of trance. I couldn't get you to wake up. You keep chanting over and over "zazas, zazas, nastanada zazas and..."

LAURA: (horrified) Wayne...

WAYNE: All I could do was take our little boy, our little baby and wrap him up so I could make sure that no one could ever learn the truth.

LAURA: Oh, my god.

WAYNE: And the other night when you saw me outside... when I was burning the leaves?

LAURA: No! No.

WAYNE: Laura, I was just doing it to protect you. I knew that I could never bring back our little boy, our precious little Wayne, Junior but I couldn't bear losing you.

(LAURA is sobbing in his arms.)

OFFICER: (outside) Hey! Take a look at this!

(MULDER and the OFFICERS look in the incinerator then look up to the house.)

(Later, LAURA still crying is sitting at the table with DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS. He looks at her sympathetically. MULDER stands in the doorway watching both LAURA and WAYNE who is in the room, his head in his hands.)

LAURA: (still crying) I don't know what to tell you. All I can think... when they told me that something was wrong... that there was a problem, was that this thing that was growing inside me was evil. I kept thinking that maybe it was something I did wrong and that this was my punishment. I told Wayne that everything was going to be okay... but I lied, but you have to believe me, Arky! I didn't mean to kill it. (crying louder) I didn't know what I was doing. It was the herbal medication. That's all I can think.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: (reluctanly) Laura, Laura... I don't think you should say any more. I'm going to have to read you your rights. We're going to have to go down to the station and do all that. I'm sorry.

(DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS leads her out the door.)

WAYNE: (calling after her) You're going to be okay. I'm going to get the best attorney.

(The door closes. MULDER looks at WAYNE suspiciously.)

MULDER: I know what you are.

(MULDER also leaves.)



SCENE 10

(WAYNE is driving very fast in his convertible red sports car. The radio is playing loudly "I'm Only Happy When It Rains" by Garbage. He dials his cell phone.)

RADIO: I'm only happy when it rains I'm only happy when it's complicated And though I know you can't appreciate it I'm only happy when it rains...

(BETSY, at home, answers her phone.)

BETSY: (on phone) Hello?

WAYNE: (on phone) Hi, Betsy, it's me.

BETSY: (on phone) Wayne, where are you?

WAYNE: (on phone) I'm on my way.

BETSY: (on phone) You're late, Wayne.

WAYNE: (on phone) I want to be there, honey. I don't want to be the kind of husband who isn't there every step of the way.

BETSY: (on phone) You've already missed a lot of steps. Anyway, it's just a sonogram.

WAYNE: (on phone) No, it's not just a sonogram, honey it's a picture of the expression of our beautiful love.

BETSY: (on phone) Wayne, what have you been smoking?

WAYNE: (on phone) I'm three blocks away, Betsy. I'm going to be pulling up in front of the house in less than five minutes.

BETSY: (on phone) Okay. I'll wait for you.

WAYNE: (on phone) Okay. Five minutes.

(Another car pulls up beside WAYNE at a stoplight. MULDER is driving.)

MULDER: Hey, Wayne. Where you going?

WAYNE: What?

BETSY: (on phone) Who you talking to? Who are you talking to?

MULDER: You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.

BETSY: (on phone) Wayne.

WAYNE: I'm late for an appointment.

MULDER: Really? An appointment? Appointment with who?

WAYNE: A business client.

BETSY: (on phone) Wayne, I'm hanging up now. (she does)

MULDER: Right, you're in the insurance business. That must take you out on the road an awful lot, huh?

WAYNE: Look, I'm an insurance medical technician, not that it's any of your business.

MULDER: So where is our appointment? How far do we have to go?

WAYNE: What?

MULDER: Come on, Wayne, I'll race you.

(WAYNE floors the gas pedal as the light changes, but MULDER stays right with him.)

RADIO: I only smile in the dark...

(Short time later, BRITTON house. MS BRITTON, mid-thirties, opens the door for WAYNE. MULDER is waiting at the curb beside their cars.)

WAYNE: Oh, hi, Ms. Britton. Wayne Weinsider. Remember me? Harmony Mutual Insurance? You had an appointment to have some blood taken.

MS BRITTON: It's for next Tuesday.

WAYNE: I know that, Kim. Can I call you Kim? I was in the neighborhood and... well, insurance isn't something you want to be without, even for just a week.

(Later, he is taking a sample of blood from MS BRITTON's arm.)

MS BRITTON: What do you do with that?

WAYNE: Oh, they check it out, make sure you're not a policy risk.

(Three young boys run loudly through the room.)

MS BRITTON: Slow down, monsters.

(Kids run out of the house.)

WAYNE: Those your kids?

MS BRITTON: Why, yes.

WAYNE: I love kids. Got a baby on the way myself. Seems like I've been trying forever. Hold that. (he puts gauze on her arm to stop the bleeding) Those are fine-looking boys. You don't know how lucky you are. Two cells, with all that can go wrong, and there they are...perfect.

(When he leans over to place the sample into his tray, MS BRITTON sees two little protuberances on the back of his neck. When he sits back up, she looks sympathetically at him.)

WAYNE: You okay? You're not feeling faint, are you?

MS BRITTON: No. I'm okay.

(They hear a horn honking. Looking out the window, WAYNE sees that MULDER is leaning against the convertible watching them. He looks up at the house and waves and smiles at WAYNE.)

WAYNE: (to MS BRITTON) Can I use your phone?

(Later, WAYNE comes out of the house. Kids are laughing and playing with the car with plenty of encouragement from MULDER.)

WAYNE: I want those kids out of my car.

MULDER: Okay, speed racers. That's enough driver's education for today.

(Kids get out of the car and run off.)

WAYNE: (to MULDER) Having your fun?

(MULDER's cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, you're busted.

MULDER: (on phone) What?

SCULLY: (on phone) I just got an earful from Assistant Director Kersh who got a call from Mr. Weinsider who says that you're harassing him.

WAYNE: Leave me alone. (drives off - license DNJ 534)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder...Mulder, I have to tell him something. What do you want me to say?

MULDER: (on phone) Tell him I'm down here doing a background check on somebody. (hangs up)

(SCULLY sighs and hangs up)



SCENE 11
ROANOKE COUNTY JAIL

(Prison. WAYNE joins LAURA in her cell.)

WAYNE: I got a message you needed to see me, Laura. What is it?

LAURA: I'm afraid.

WAYNE: Well, I've been meeting with attorneys and... given the circumstances and your emotional state they feel confident of an acquittal if that's what you're worried about, Laura.

LAURA: No, Wayne. I've been thinking.

WAYNE: Thinking. About what?

LAURA: About your story. About how it doesn't make sense. You said you... wrapped the baby up to hide it but what they found in the fire was wrapped in the nightgown I had on when I woke up from my nightmare.

WAYNE: But that's not possible, Laura. You must be mistaken.

LAURA: And I keep thinking about... the face of that terrible creature at the end of the bed. And I remember something that I didn't tell anybody. Not even you.

WAYNE: Laura, you're scaring me. No matter what you believe I only have one desire: to protect you. To put this all behind us.

(As WAYNE embraces her, she pulls his collar down slightly, exposing the bite mark she put there the night she lost the baby.)

WAYNE: (sighing, resigned) Why'd you go and do that, Laura? You've got to know that I love you. And I just wish... you could've been the one.

(Laura gasps as he grabs her wrist.)

LAURA: Let me go, Wayne.

(WAYNE begins inhaling. We see the breath come out of LAURA and flow into WAYNE's mouth. LAURA collapses.)



SCENE 12

(Prison. Short time later. EMTs are trying to resuscitate LAURA.)

EMT 1: What's her rhythm?

EMT 2: She's still in v-fib. Charge the paddles to 200.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: What happened?

EMT 1: I'll start an IV

WAYNE: She just collapsed.

EMT 2: Clear. Paddles are charged. Stand by to defib.

WAYNE: It was like...

EMT 2: Clear.

WAYNE: It was like she died right in my arms.

EMT 2: Charging to 300. Going again. Clear.

(Monitor begins beeping.)

EMT 2: We got a heartbeat.

WAYNE: What?

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Laura, can you hear me? Laura, can you hear me?

(MULDER comes over to see and he and WAYNE exchange a glance.)

EMT2: I need to get this woman to the hospital right away. I need a neurologist consult down at the ER hang an IV of lidocaine, and let's get her out of here.

EMT 1: Okay.

EMT 2: Got it?

(WAYNE, very surprised, watches as the take her out.)



SCENE 13

(Night. BETSY's house. WAYNE parks his car in the garage and ducks under the door as it closes. He runs in the front door and finds BETSY sitting on the couch.)

BETSY: That was a long five minutes.

WAYNE: I can explain.

BETSY: Oh, please, Wayne. I've heard all your excuses. Besides, everything went fine without you. It always does.

WAYNE: Did you get the sonogram?

BETSY: Yes.

WAYNE: Bring it back home?

(BETSY picks up a folder and looks uncomfortable)

WAYNE: Is there a problem?

BETSY: The doctor found something. She doesn't know yet but there's some kind of bony growths on the baby's spine and skull. It may just be a stage of development. She really just wants to wait and see.

WAYNE: (sad, looking at the sonogram image, knowing what he will have to do) Okay. Sure. Whatever happens, you know I love you. No matter what.

BETSY: Do you, Wayne? 'Cause sometimes I wonder what's going on inside your head.

WAYNE: Nothing but good thoughts. You and this baby are my hopes and dreams.

BETSY: Mine, too.

WAYNE: Why don't I get you a warm glass of milk and we'll go to bed.

BETSY: Okay.



SCENE 14
ROANOKE COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER
10:02 PM

(Hospital. SCULLY stares at MULDER as he walks in.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you asked me to come down here and then you're nowhere to be found.

MULDER: I was down in the basement at county records doing a background check.

SCULLY: Mulder... It's me. That's your cover story, remember?

MULDER: That's where I was. I was piecing together the history of the man that did this to her.

(They look over to where LAURA is lying in a coma.)

SCULLY: That's why I was looking for you because, in fact, nobody did anything to her. Mulder, there is absolutely no evidence of bodily injury of overdose, of suffocation, of anything that would explain why she was in a coma.

MULDER: Perfect.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, I don't think you heard what I said. I did a complete medical review, just as you asked. What I'm saying is that there is not a shred of evidence to implicate the husband or anyone.

MULDER: Not a shred of evidence is exactly the evidence I'd hoped you'd find. Check this out.

SCULLY: (reading file MULDER hands her) Ivan Veles, born Czechoslovakia in 1956. Married twice, widowed twice, no children. Prosecuted twice for murder of wives Gisele and Helga. Acquitted twice on lack of evidence. Who is Ivan Veles?

MULDER: Wayne Weinsider. He's a Czech national, emigrated in 1994. He's also known as Bud Hasselhoff, also known as Gordy Boitano.

SCULLY: Gordy Boitano.

MULDER: There's more. Read on.

SCULLY: (reading) In Slavic societies the name Veles was synonymous with... the Devil. From the Lithuanian root "Vele"-- a horned demon who sucks the souls of the innocent. Mulder, you're not suggesting that he is himself... a devil, are you?

MULDER: I'm not suggesting anything. I think the facts speak for themselves.

SCULLY: Mulder, I will accept that a man can be demonic that he may have demon-like attributes but why would a demon-- if there were such a thing-- BOTHER WITH A 9:00-to-5:00 make room for daddy routine just so he can off his wife and unborn child?

MULDER: I don't know why; I'm not a psychologist but this is the best explanation for how that I've heard.



SCENE 15

(BETSY's house. WAYNE fixes a glass of warm milk. The milk is glowing as he carries it upstairs into the bedroom. BETSY is already in bed.)

WAYNE: This will put you to sleep on a cloud. Where troubles melt away.

(BESTY sighs and drinks the milk.)

BETSY: Sometimes I remember why I married you.

(Night. An excavation team is at work in the Weinsider's yard digging and using explosives.)

OFFICER 1: All the way down?

OFFICER 2: Yeah.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: All right. They're checking it out now.

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up and get out of their car.)

OFFICER 1: It's pretty hard. Get me the pick.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: (to MULDER and SCULLY) We got technology out here. Subterranean mapping equipment out from richmond p.d. still can't find a damn thing.

OFFICER: Over here! We got something. Daniel, bring that light over here.

(DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS, MULDER, and SCULLY run over to where the OFFICER is digging.)

MULDER: You're going to find discrete osteopathic deformities to the upper vertebrae, two bony protrusions between the parietal and occipital lobes of the skull.

(SCULLY reaches into the excavated hole and brushes dirt off of a tiny ribcage.)

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Good lord.

MULDER: Put out an APB for your brother-in-law. He's not going to come back here.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: What are you talking...?

MULDER: Just find him.

(MULDER and SCULLY go back to their car.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you talking about?

MULDER: He's done this to other women here, Scully just like in Czechoslovakia. My guess is that baby we just dug up belonged to one of Wayne's other wives.

SCULLY: What are you saying, that he's trying to propagate? He's trying to breed?

MULDER: He's exercising his biological imperative and he'll do anything or say anything he has to to succeed.

SCULLY: But it doesn't make sense, Mulder. If he's trying to breed then why would he be snatching his own babies and burying them in his backyard?

MULDER: Because they're demons and he wants a normal child.



SCENE 16

(BETSY's bedroom, later that night. BETSY wakes up alone in bed to the same vision that LAURA did earlier, flames reflected on the wall and headboard, growling sounds. BETSY screams as the demon figure at the foot of the bed grabs her legs and spreads them as he pulls her to the foot of the bed.)

BETSY: No! No! Wayne! Wayne! What are you doing?!

(BETSY suddenly sits up, fully in control, and grabs the demon by it's chin. The demon, no longer in shadow, is a very startled WAYNE.)

BETSY: (warning) Maybe you didn't hear me! I said, what are you doing, Wayne?



SCENE 17

(Night. MULDER and SCULLY driving. MULDER is on his cell phone. SCULLY is writing down the information he is getting.)

MULDER: (on phone) 15527 Leahy. That's in Cave Spring. It's West Roanoke. Cave Spring. Thank you. Thank you very much for your help.

(MULDER hangs up.)

MULDER: Scully, hold on.

(MULDER quickly turns the car around, tires screeching.)

SCULLY: (sighing) Mulder, where are we going?

MULDER: Harmony Mutual Insurance has a second address for Wayne Weinsider all the way across the other side of Roanoke County.

SCULLY: Do you think he's got a second wife?

MULDER: Well, think about it, Scully. He meets or screens prospective women through work. That's probably why he came to this country in the first place-- bigger gene pool more women-- then he plants as many seeds as he can. Let's just hope he hasn't been able to harvest many more of them.

SCULLY: Mulder.

(Suddenly, another car approaches. They barely avoid crashing into each other. BETSY gets out of the car crying. She is covered in blood and no longer pregnant. She runs to MULDER and SCULLY who have also gotten out of their car.)

BETSY: Please! Please. He took my baby! He took my baby!

SCULLY: It's okay, ma'am.

BETSY: Wayne. Wayne. He took my baby.



SCENE 18

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at BETSY's house. Television is showing an old movie. ? on the movie.)

TELEVISION:

MAN: How are you, sweetheart?

CHILD: Is he going to die?

MAN: Of course not. People don't die from chicken pox.

WOMAN: Did you ever have chicken pox?

MAN: I've had everything. How about you?

WOMAN: I've been trying to remember.

MAN: You won't have to try long. You'll know in a day or two.

WOMAN: That's what's worrying me. You can go on down. I'll be down in a minute.

CHILD: I bet she's going to die.

MAN: Will you stop talking like that?

(MULDER and SCULLY find WAYNE outside with a shovel. He is crying as he digs in the ground. They hold guns on him.)

MULDER: Wayne! It's over.

WAYNE: A normal life. A family. That's all I ever wanted.

MULDER: Where's the baby, Wayne?

WAYNE: How could she do this to them?

MULDER: Put the shovel down. Your lies won't work anymore.

WAYNE: My lies? What about her lies?

SCULLY: Whatever the truth, Mr. Weinsider you can't hope to bury it now.

WAYNE: I'm not burying anything. I'm digging it up.

MULDER: Where's the baby?

WAYNE: Don't you understand? She took it. Betsy took it!

MULDER: You can't blame anyone else like you did with Laura.

WAYNE: Don't you see? Betsy isn't like Laura. Betsy is...

(WAYNE collapses as bullets rip through his body. Shots came from DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS. OFFICERS converge on the scene.)

SCULLY: Get the paramedics!

WAYNE: I just wanted what everyone wants.



SCENE 19

(Hospital Emergency Room. WAYNE, unconscious, is placed on a gurney next to LAURA who is also unconscious.)

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Hey! Don't even think about it! You put that guy someplace else! I don't want him in sight of my sister.

NURSE: Sir, he just got out of surgery.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Give me this. (grabs the gurney)

MULDER: (pulling him back) Hey, cut it out! Come on. You're in enough trouble as it is. You don't want to complicate your situation further by endangering his life again, do you?

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: That son of a bitch better live so I can beat the truth out of him. Find out why he did it... and how the hell he did it.

MULDER: I think the why is directly related to the how.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: What do you mean? What do you mean by that?

MULDER: We should just go talk to this other wife of his. This woman Betsy. Come on.

DEPUTY ARKY STEVENS: Wait a minute.

(They leave the room. WAYNE wakes up and looks over to LAURA. We see breath rising out of WAYNE and flowing across and into LAURA's mouth. WAYNE's monitor flatlines. LAURA begins breathing hard.)

NURSE: Mrs. Weinsider?

NURSE 2: Flat line.

NURSE: I can't believe it. Page Dr. Nyland up here. Just breathe deep, Mrs. Weinsider. Can you breathe for me?



SCENE 20

(Outside BETSY's house. A team is excavating some very small graves. SCULLY is examining the remains. MULDER joins SCULLY.)

OFFICER: Going to get a couple of more shots over here.

MULDER: (to SCULLY) How many?

SCULLY: Four total. All here for some time. Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder. No osteological deformities. And Betsy's baby isn't here. There are no fresh graves.

MULDER: I know.

SCULLY: What do you think he did with it?

MULDER: I don't think he did anything with it.

SCULLY: But she was recently pregnant. I mean, I-I saw her records. There are sonograms in the house. Showing the same defects.

MULDER: These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.

SCULLY: Well, whose babies were they?

MULDER: I think Wayne realized something last night. That's why he was out here digging. He realized that he'd met someone even more evil than he was-- who would sacrifice what he desperately wanted for himself.

SCULLY: Betsy?

MULDER: It was no coincidence that she ran into us last night. We were taken in by her just like Wayne was-- by a woman who would say anything or do anything to get what she wanted-- who was even more driven than he was.

SCULLY: to what?

MULDER: To have what only Wayne could give her.



SCENE 21

(Red convertible again on the road. BETSY is driving, music playing. There is a baby carrier on the seat beside her. She smiles down at it's occupant. We see the hand of the infant which is scaly and demonic. BETSY's eyes glow red.)

RADIO:
I'm only happy when it rains
You know I love it when the news is bad
Why I feel so good to feel so sad
I'm only happy when it rains
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me
Pour your misery down
Pour your misery down on me...

[THE END]



                                    RAIN KING


SCENE 1
KRONER, KANSAS
FEBRUARY 14
VALENTINES DAY

(Night. We see a hand take a cute Valentine's Day card "BE MY DREAM VALNETINE" and sign it "Love, Sheila XOXOX." Card goes out of frame then comes back with a heavy lipstick kiss mark on it. SHEILA FONTAINE, late 30s, slightly overweight, pretty, dressed in a red negligee sets the card down on a gift and lights a candle. She eats from a heart shaped box of chocolates and watches the weather on the local news channel KPJK Channel 5.)

ANNOUNCER: (on TV) This is really shining right out into the studio. (laughs) The malfunction cut off power to rural parts of Kroner County. Up next, the amazing story of two giant pandas in love. But first, let's check in with Holman Hardt and the weather.

HOLMAN: (on TV) Well, still no rain in sight for the Kroner Hills region as yet another winter storm passes south of us. I'll have all the numbers and my five-day forecast right after this.

(The door opens and SHEILA gets up to greet her boyfriend, DARYL MOOTZ. He is angry.)

SHEILA: Hey, baby, you're home early.

(DARYL holds up a newspaper wedding announcement "Fontaine to marry Mootz" with their pictures."

DARYL: Sheila, we got a really big problem here. What in the hell were you thinking?

SHEILA: (playfully dipping the negligee off of one shoulder) Happy Valentine's Day.

DARYL: We made a deal. We agreed to keep the engagement secret until I said so.

SHEILA: I know, but I just wanted everybody in town to know why I've been so happy the last few months. (kisses him, he pulls away)

HOLMAN: (on TV) ...to yet another bone-dry day. Current temperature in Kroner is 45 degrees.

SHEILA: I know business has been slow but we can't stop living just 'cause it hasn't rained in a spell.

DARYL: Maybe we should just call off the engagement.

SHEILA: Don't do this, not today. It'll rain soon. I can feel it.

DARYL: I-I just need time to think. (looks at box of chocolates) Oh, look at that. And you wonder why your ass is so big.

(DARYL slams the door as he goes out.)

DARYL: (mockingly as he walks to his car): "It'll rain soon. I can feel it."

(DARYL gets in his car. Inside the house, SHEILA looks sadly at the wedding announcement, then picks up the stereo remote and flicks through stations. She stops at a song by the Carpenters "Rainy Days and Mondays" -very sad song - and looks sorry for herself.)

RADIO: (Carpenters) What I got they used to call the blues Nothin' is really wrong Feelin' like I don't belong Walkin' around 

(In his car driving down the road, DARYL begins singing along with the same station.)

DARYL AND RADIO: Some kind of lonely clown Rainy Days and Mondays always get me down...

(DARYL reaches into a cooler in his car and pulls out a beer and begins drinking it. Several empty cans are floating in the cooler. It begins to rain.)

RADIO: Funny, but it seems I always wind up here with you Nice to know somebody loves me Funny, but it seems that it's the only thing to do Run and find the one who loves me

(Heavy rain turns into hail. The windshield wipers are no use.)

DARYL: I'll be damned.

RADIO: What I feel has come and gone before

DARYL: Yee-ha! Ow!

(DARYL loses control of his car. He spins out and crashes.)

(DARYL's car sits by the side of the road. He appears to be in great pain. Hail hits him on the head. Close up of the hail hitting the ground shows that every other piece is shaped like a heart.)

RADIO: No need to talk it out We know what it's all about Hangin' around Nothin' to do but frown Rainy days and Mondays always get me down Hangin' around Nothin' to do but frown Rainy days and Mondays always get me down.

SCENE 2
KRONER, KANSAS
SIX MONTHS LATER

(Small airplane lands on a very small, very dry airstrip with nothing but an Airstream trailer. MAYOR JIM GILMORE and an eight year old in a leotard, RHONDA, the BATON TWIRLING GIRL approach. MULDER and SCULLY get out of the small plane. SCULLY looks at MULDER as if to say, "This was your idea." BATON TWIRLING GIRL presses a button on her cassette player and begins dancing and twirling her baton.)

SCULLY: (to MULDER) Don't look at me. This was your idea.

MAYOR: Agent Mulder, welcome to Kroner. I'm Jim Gilmore, the mayor. We spoke on the phone.

MULDER: Nice to meet you, sir.

MAYOR: If I'd have known you was bringing the missus, I would've arranged for fancier accommodations.

(MULDER purses his lips, smiles, and looks away as if to say "I'm staying away from that one.")

SCULLY: (professional) I'm Agent Scully, Agent Mulder's partner. I'm... sure the accommodations will be just fine.

MAYOR: (embarrassed) My apologies, ma'am. We appreciate your flying clear out here to help solve our crisis. I'd hoped for a bigger welcome, but, well... (to BATON TWIRLING GIRL) Okay, Rhonda that's enough. Go find your mama!

(The girl turns off the player and goes back behind the trailer.)

SCULLY: Uh, sir you mentioned a crisis. Agent Mulder has been a little  ah  vague as to the specifics of this crisis.

(MULDER looks innocent.)

MAYOR: It's all around us-- runted crops, field fires, bankruptcies... This drought is destroying people's lives, and it's wrong for a single man to prosper at the expense of others.

SCULLY: A single man?

MAYOR: Daryl Mootz. He's a local fella charging people for rain.

(MAYOR hands MULDER a brochure entitled "Rain King" with a picture of DARYL on it. MULDER glances at it and shows it to SCULLY. Apparently, he is already familiar with it.)

SCULLY: You mean cloud seeding?

MAYOR: The hell I do. I mean he shows up at a farm, does his dog and pony act and the heavens weep.

SCULLY: Well, sir, if this man Mootz could, in fact, somehow produce rain then what's the crime?

MAYOR: I believe Daryl's causing the drought... so he can charge folks for the rain.

(SCULLY looks at MULDER. He looks innocent.)

SCULLY: And this is what you told Agent Mulder when you spoke earlier?

MAYOR: Yes, ma'am. He seemed real eager to help us.

(SCULLY looks at MULDER. He looks innocently back at her.)



SCENE 3

(MULDER and SCULLY get out of their rental car downtown Kroner and begin walking down the street.)

MULDER: Come on, Scully. You act like I intentionally misled you. Over the past 30 years this town has had more tornadoes heat waves and hailstorms than any other town in the country. It's like ground zero for extreme weather.

SCULLY: (not believing it) A man... controlling... the weather.

MULDER: Well, if that's true-- if Daryl Mootz is controlling the weather for profit-- then that is a crime and that should be investigated.

SCULLY: Mulder, I see the vacant buildings. I see the signs. These people are scared. But there have always been droughts and natural disasters and people are always looking for a scapegoat.

MULDER: Yeah, but how many scapegoats lease office space?

(MULDER holds the door as they enter a fancy office. CINDY, a very perky very young woman with curly blonde hair, is on the phone under a sign proclaiming "Rain King.")

MULDER: (holding out his badge) Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. We're looking for Daryl Mootz.

CINDY: (holding up a finger) One second. (into phone) Yes, ma'am. Appendix "C." That's right. I need a six-pack of beer, a carton of Morley Lights, and a big old bowl of jellybeans. And can you pick out all the green ones 'cause he don't like the green ones. You're welcome. (she hangs up and looks at MULDER and SCULLY) Now, what can I do for the FBI?

MULDER: We want to see the king.

CINDY: I'm sorry. Mr. Mootz is out of the state till this afternoon on business.

MULDER: Well, when you say "on business" you mean he's making it rain?

CINDY: Uh-huh. He's just across the state line into Nebraska. Town of Wymore.

SCULLY: If we could get a list of all the people who have employed his services, it would be helpful.

CINDY: (suspicious and defensive) I don't understand. Does he... Don't y'all need a warrant or a subpoena or something like that?

SCULLY: We usually just say, "please."

CINDY: What are you investigating Daryl for? He's a hero in this community.

SCULLY: So you actually believe that he makes it rain?

CINDY: I know it to be fact. He saved my daddy's farm. How dare you people.

(MULDER glances over to the TV where HOLMAN HARDT is giving the weather.)

HOLMAN: (on TV) ...the only rain in the area is localized up around Wymore...

CINDY: See? Daryl's making that rain.

SCULLY: Is it possible that he could have just followed it up there?

(CINDY glares at SCULLY, then pulls a desk drawer open and rudely hands SCULLY a sheet of paper.)

CINDY: Here's your damn client list. You'll see. Every one a satisfied customer.

MULDER: (still interested in the TV) This, uh, TV station-- is that far from here?



SCENE 4
KPJK TELEVISION STUDIO
12:41 PM

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the local TV station. SHEILA runs up to greet them exuberantly.)

SHEILA: Oh! We were beginning to worry that you wouldn't make it. Is this your first time in a TV studio? How exciting. I couldn't be happier for the two of you.

SCULLY: I'm not su...

(MULDER stops SCULLY, interrupting whatever she was going to say. They watch as SHELIA runs and gets HOLMAN and brings him over. HOLMAN HARDT is a shy sweet man, same age as SHEILA.)

SHEILA: Holman, I'd like to introduce you to the Gundersons.

HOLMAN: (shaking their hands) Congratulations! I hope you have a truly romantic getaway.

SHEILA: Aren't you glad you watch Channel Five weather?

SCULLY: (showing badge) We're Agents Mulder and Scully. We're with the FBI.

SHEILA: FBI? Oh, my goodness! I thought you were the "Watch the Weather and Win" contest winners.

HOLMAN: See, we haven't had any rain in months and... well, people tend to blame the messenger.

SHEILA: Oh, there's the Gundersons. Over here!

(The GUNDERSON's, an older plain-looking farm couple come over. They look NOTHING like MULDER and SCULLY. Very funny.)

MULDER: (smiling at SCULLY) It's like looking in a mirror.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are in HOLMAN's office. They sit together on the couch.)

HOLMAN: When I first saw the pair of you I thought you were rather smartly dressed for a farm couple. Make yourselves at home.

MULDER: Well, from what I've read about Kroner you've had more than your fair share of unusual weather.

HOLMAN: Well, we certainly have. To you, Kroner must seem small and simple but through the eyes of meteorology-- low pressure systems, storm fronts, tornado watches-- Kroner is sophisticated, complex and... well... sexy. (SCULLY raises her eyebrows. MULDER nods, and grins at SCULLY.) And... frankly I can't imagine a more exciting place to be a meteorologist.

SCULLY: Uh, Mr. Hardt, what can you tell us about Daryl Mootz?

HOLMAN: The Mayor called you in, didn't he? He thinks Daryl's causing the drought.

SCULLY: You don't think he's responsible.

HOLMAN: Of course not. A huge high-pressure system is the primary culprit. There's no credible evidence to suggest that Daryl, or any man can be held accountable for our predicament.

SCULLY: Thank you. (to MULDER) Can we go now?

MULDER: No, no, um... What about the rain?

HOLMAN: Well, that's a more clouded issue if you'll excuse my pun.

MULDER: (holding the list they got from CINDY) I have a list of over 40 names here-- people in four different counties-- who claim that Daryl Mootz has made it rain for them.

HOLMAN: I went to high school with Daryl. Different social circles and... frankly, he's about the last man I would give credit to for anything...

SCULLY: I hear a big "but" coming.

HOLMAN: Daryl appears to be the real deal. I can't explain it, but... where he wanders, showers follow.



SCENE 5
MONROE FARM
4:07 PM

(Very dry farm in Nebraska. Family and neighbors have a tent and lots of food set up. Looks like a family reunion. MULDER and SCULLY arrive and look around.)

SCULLY: Look at the desperation on these people's faces, Mulder. They're ready to believe anything.

MULDER: According to his schedule the King should have been here by now.

(A large red GMC pick-up truck, Kansas license plate RAIN KNG pulls up.)

FARMER AND FAMILY: Here he comes! Here he comes! He's here! Oh, isn't that sweet? That's sweet.

(DARYL gets out of the truck. He is missing his right leg from the knee down. CINDY hands him a pair of crutches and makes his way to a chair under the tent and opens a beer from a nearby cooler.)

DARYL: Man! What could we use around here, a little rain? (laughing) Oh, look at this! Ah! Take these, will you, somebody? (someone takes his crutches) Ah. Mmm.

(CINDY brings a large case over and opens it to reveal a booted prosthetic leg.)

DARYL: That is the wrong damn boot, now, isn't it, hon? Be a good girl, and go on and get me the red snakeskin.

(CINDY goes back to the truck. MULDER and SCULLY walk up to DARYL.)

DARYL: (sarcastically) Well, looky here. The FBI.

SCULLY: We just came to see the show. I guess, uh, we're a little early.

DARYL: Oh, ye of little faith. That truck out there of mine is a whole lot faster than my rain clouds.

CINDY: (coming back over with another prosthetic leg) Excuse me.

DARYL: (putting on the leg) Thank you.

MULDER: How do you explain your unique ability?

DARYL: I don't. It's complicated.

MULDER: Try me. I watch the Weather Channel.

DARYL: If you're wondering did I ask for this gift no, sir, I did not, no more than I asked to lose this here limb. But I should've expected it and I'll tell you why. Because I come from a long line of healing people. I'm a spiritual man, in touch... with the really real. The, the unseen real.

(He signals CINDY and she starts a tape player. Mid-tempo pop music begins playing and DARYL begins dancing.)

DARYL: And I... am one 64th Cherokee and I can summon up my ancestors to bring water to this thirsty land. Yeah!

(As DARYL gets more involved in his oh-so-strange dance, MULDER follows SCULLY a few yards away.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are we doing here?

MULDER: Well, this is not without historical precedent. The Old West was full of traveling men who claimed to be rainmakers. The Pueblo Indians even had a rain dance.

SCULLY: Mulder, that is not a rain dance. My Irish Aunt Olive has more Cherokee in her than Daryl Mootz. I mean, look at him, Mulder. Does that look like a man who can control the weather?

(There is a thunderclap, and then MULDER and SCULLY are drenched as rain begins pouring down. The family begins squealing with delight and hugging each other. DARYL points his fingers like guns at MUDLER and SCULLY and grins triumphantly.)



SCENE 6

(TV station. SHEILA comes into HOLMAN's workstation and sits companionably on his desk where he is typing on his laptop.)

SHEILA: Are we still going to the reunion together on Friday?

HOLMAN: Absolutely. Social event of the decade.

SHEILA: Hard to believe it's been 20 years since we finished high school. Where did the time go? What were those FBI people looking for?

HOLMAN: Oh, they were asking questions about Daryl. About making it rain.

SHEILA: I wish they'd just go back to wherever they came from and leave him alone.

HOLMAN: (disbelieving) You don't still love him, do you? I can't believe you still care about him after the way he treated you.

SHEILA: I know.

HOLMAN: He never loved you, Sheila. All he cared about was your money, and as soon as he got some of his own... he just 

SHEILA: He left. I know. But I think he used to love me.

HOLMAN: (gently) There are other men who will love you more.

SHEILA: FBI-- my lord. I don't think I'll be able to sleep knowing they're poking round.



SCENE 7

(Night. Cool View Motor Court. Stormy weather. Sign is flickering. SCULLY turns restlessly in her bed, turns on the bedside light and looks in disgust at the banging sound then at the clock. 3:07-8 AM. She sighs and lies back down. MULDER is in his room looking through the file. "26 TORNADOS DAILY." The storm grows worse. He goes to the open window and sees a cow out in the field looking back at him. With a surprised "moo," the cow suddenly flies straight up into the air. MULDER looks up trying to figure out where it went, then leaps out of the way as the mooing again gets closer and the cow comes crashing through the ceiling landing on his bed.)



SCENE 8

(Hotel, next morning. SCULLY is in MULDER's room looking up through the giant hole in the ceiling. A MAN WITH A CHAINSAW is getting ready to cut up the cow.)

MAN WITH CHAINSAW: Ma'am, unless you want to get covered in hamburger I reckon you should step outside.

(SCULLY leaves the room as the man starts up the chainsaw. The HOTEL MANAGER, a woman in a housecoat and fat curlers in her hair, follows SCULLY down the walkway.)

HOTEL MANAGER : Oh, miss, we moved your boyfriend's things into your room.

SCULLY: He's my partner, and we prefer separate rooms.

HOTEL MANAGER: Oh, old-fashioned are you, huh? Well, we're booked solid with the high school reunion. You can take it or leave it.

(SCULLY goes over to where a DOCTOR is checking a cut on MULDER's left arm.)

DOCTOR: We can just butterfly it. I've got my kit over in the car.

MULDER: Scully, I don't think it's a coincidence that a cow gets hurled at me just as we're down here investigating the weather.

SCULLY: (checking his scalp and forehead) Mulder, did they check you for head trauma?

MULDER: I'm telling you, that cow had my name on it.

(HOLMAN arrives and comes up to MULDER and SCULLY. He is very concerned.)

HOLMAN: Agent Mulder, are you all right? I feel terrible. If there's anything I can do, please don't hesitate.

SCULLY: Perhaps there is. Mr. Hardt, would you please reassure Agent Mulder that this cow incident was, in fact, a natural phenomenon?

HOLMAN: With pleasure. Uh, it's my belief that a mini-twister picked that poor creature up, lifted it about 12,000 feet where the air cooled and, uh... I'm just grateful you weren't hurt any worse.

(SHEILA arrives. She is on the verge of tears.)

SHEILA: Excuse me.

HOLMAN: You shouldn't be here.

SHEILA: Holman, don't make this any harder. (to MULDER and SCULLY) It's my fault. I did it.

(Later they are sitting in SCULLY's room. SCULLY sits on the bed beside a crying SHEILA and periodically hands her tissues from a box. DOCTOR is bandaging MULDER's arm.)

SHEILA: (crying) I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. It's not something that I can control.

MULDER: Are you saying that you're somehow responsible for the...

SHEILA: I murdered that poor cow!

SCULLY: Uh... Holman just explained to us that, uh, that a mini-twister is what caused the accident.

SHEILA: He's just being sweet, covering for me. He knows the truth. (sighs) This isn't the first time something like this has happened. The night of my senior prom a tornado demolished our high school...

(QUICK FLASHBACK: Exterior of high school gym. Heavy winds and rain. A couple in full prom regalia walking toward the building are suddenly lifted into the air and blown away by the storm.)

SHEILA: And then... On my wedding day, a day I'd always dreamed about the ceremony was outdoors on the Fourth of July weekend. It snowed six inches.

(QUICK FLASHBACK: SHEILA and wedding party stand outside in heavy snowfall.)

SHEILA: Then three years later my husband ran off with some gal from the phone company and on the day that our divorce was finalized I stepped out of the courthouse and... you know how you-you-you can see shapes in those big fluffy clouds?

(MULDER nods. SCULLY smiles tightly.)

SHEILA: Well... I swear that every cloud in that big blue sky was a face laughing at me...

(QUICK FLASHBACK: a very eighties looking SHEILA stands on courthouse steps looking up at clouds that all look like smiling faces.)

SHEILA: (sighing) And that was about ten years ago and that was the last time it happened until last night.

MULDER: What's your connection to Daryl Mootz?

SHEILA: Well... We used to be engaged. (sniffling)

SCULLY: You two were engaged?

SHEILA: Yeah, about six months ago and, um... we had a fight and he took a drive, and... and a... and a freak hailstorm cost him his leg.

MULDER: And ever since then, the rain's been following him.

SHEILA: Am I under arrest?

MULDER: No. I can tell you without a doubt that you're not responsible for any of that weather.

SHEILA: Oh... But...

MULDER: Agent Scully and I specialize in these types of cases and-and-and although you may have had some bad luck you didn't cause any of it.

SHEILA: Are you sure?

MULDER: Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm sure. Scully, you have any doubts?

SCULLY: (definitively) No.

MULDER: You see?

SCULLY: No doubts.

SHEILA: I really want to believe you. Thanks.

(SHEILA kisses MULDER's hand affectionately and gazes up at him. SCULLY raises brows.)

MULDER: You're welcome.

(SHEILA leaves after clasping HOLMAN's hand.)

DOCTOR: That hailstorm didn't cause Daryl's car crash.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

DOCTOR: The weather was bad, but Daryl was drunk and driving too fast.

HOLMAN: Drunk? I... never heard that.

DOCTOR: We all felt that Daryl losing his leg was punishment enough.



SCENE 9

(Nebraska farm. CINDY is massaging DARYL's shoulders as he sits in the tent while it rains outside.)

DARYL: People don't realize how hard a work this is. I mean, sure, it looks like I'm just sitting here, but... My powers of concentration... Oh, yeah, oh, right there, yeah, yeah. Yeah, oh, you... You're worth every penny. Now, what was I saying?

CINDY: "Powers of concentration."

DARYL: Yeah, right. Right. I... m-my brain's functioning on something like-- I don't know-- 14 different levels taking in a whole bunch of variables like wind velocity and-and humidity and...

CINDY: Daryl... Do you hear that?

DARYL: Hear what?

CINDY: The rain stopped.

DARYL: Uh-oh.



SCENE 10

(Motel. SCULLY's room #10. MULDER is lying on SCULLY's bed going through the file. SCULLY enters and sits in the chair.)

SCULLY: Next flight out is 10:00 tomorrow morning.

MULDER: Look at this, Scully (holds up newspaper) September 20, 1991, it rained rose petals for nearly an hour.

SCULLY: (exasperated) Mulder, we're going home. The rain stopped this afternoon. Daryl Mootz is being sued by about 50 people. There's no case... And you told Sheila yourself that she wasn't controlling the weather.

MULDER: She's not. Neither is Daryl. Check this out-- on the same day that it rained rose petals. "Irene Hardt, beloved wife and devoted mother passed away yesterday afternoon... She's survived by one son, Holman Hardt."

SCULLY: Oh, so, now you're saying that Holman Hardt...

MULDER: Holman Hardt is manufacturing the weather. Did you see how relieved he was when he learned that Daryl was drunk? I've been doing some checking. Holman Hardt has been hospitalized five times with nervous exhaustion, each time coinciding with a major meteorological event.

SCULLY: Mulder, it is still a huge leap to say that he's manufacturing the weather.

MULDER: Most people will admit that the weather plays a significant role in the way they feel, right? There's even that disorder.

SCULLY: "SAD"-seasonal affective disorder.

MULDER: Mm-hmm, yeah. Well, who's to say that it doesn't work the other way around-- that the way someone feels can affect the weather... that the weather is somehow an expression of Holman Hardt's feelings or-or-or better still, the feelings that he's not expressing?

(SCULLY gives him "A Look.")



SCENE 11

(HOLMAN's dressing room.)

HOLMAN: I've tried to say this a thousand times... tried to express the... fire that burns inside this... humble exterior. Sheila, you're the reason I remained in this town all these years.

(His phone rings but he ignores it.)

HOLMAN: I wake up each day knowing...

(Phone rings again. Sighing in frustration, Holman turns away from the mirror that he was talking to and answers the phone.)

HOLMAN: Hello?

SHEILA: Holman, it's me. Working late?

HOLMAN: Sh-sheila, hi. (stammers) Yeah, um... I was just thinking about you. I'm looking forward to the reunion tomorrow night.

SHEILA: Me, too.

HOLMAN: You sound in a good mood.

SHEILA: Well, I am, Holman, and it's all because of you. I wanted to let you know that I've been thinking about what you said about Daryl yesterday and I realized that you were right.

HOLMAN: I was?

SHEILA: Yes, you were, and I am so over him. "Daryl who?" That's what I say. I realized that I've been chasing the wrong kind of guy. I need someone who I can talk to. I need someone who I can feel safe with.

HOLMAN: (so happy he can barely speak) I can't tell you what that means to me.

SHEILA: Holman, I want to ask you something and I hope that we can keep it our secret for the time being.

HOLMAN: Of course, Sheila, anything.

SHEILA: Well, what do you think of Agent Mulder?

(Outside the studio, thunder crashes.)



SCENE 12

(Next morning 9:40 AM. TV station. MULDER knocks and enters HOLMAN's office.)

MULDER: Hey, Holman.

HOLMAN: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I've come to say good-bye, Holman.

HOLMAN: You're leaving.

MULDER: Yeah. But I want you to get some help before you kill somebody.

HOLMAN: Help? What are you talking about?

MULDER: You know what I'm talking about. You're not just a weatherman, you're the weatherman. You're the person who's been affecting the weather.

HOLMAN: Agent Mulder, if I could control the weather don't you think I would make it rain? That I would end this drought?

MULDER: I don't think it works that way. I don't think you don't do it on purpose. I just think you bottle up your emotions-- anger, grief, or love or whatever-- and then, as a response, it rains or hails or there's a flying cow.

HOLMAN: That poor animal.

MULDER: And whatever it is, you got to let it out.

HOLMAN: I can't.

MULDER: Yeah, you can. (sits beside him) It's Sheila, isn't it? You love her. You've always loved her. That, uh, tornado at the high school... that was you, wasn't it?

HOLMAN: The night of our senior prom, I, uh... accidentally stumbled upon her and her boyfriend... in flagrante delicto. And the next thing you know...

MULDER: And you've never told her the way you feel?

HOLMAN: How can a frog tell a swan that he loves her?

MULDER: Well, you better tell her or you're going to kill somebody. (crosses to the door)

HOLMAN: W-well, you got to help me.

MULDER: I got a plane to catch.

HOLMAN: You can't go. If you don't help me, who will?

MULDER: I am meeting my partner at the airport.

(MULDER's cell phone rings.)

MULDER: Excuse me. Hold on. (into phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: (on phone) I'm on my way.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm not so sure. Have you looked outside lately? It's pea soup. Our plane can't take off until after this fog lifts.

(She looks out the window at a barely visible car.)

MULDER: (on phone) Fog? (looks accusingly at HOLMAN) Holman!

(HOLMAN shrugs.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Holman?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah... he wants advice. Dating advice.

SCULLY: (on phone) Dating advice? From whom?

MULDER: (on phone) Yours truly. (VERRRRY LOOOONG pause) Hello? Hey, Scully. Scully, you there?

SCULLY: (on phone) I heard you. Mulder, when was the last time you went on a date?

MULDER: (on phone, one word at a time) I will talk to you later.

SCULLY: (to herself, after hanging) The blind leading the blind.



SCENE 13

(RAIN KING office. CINDY runs an adding machine tape and hand it to DARYL who looks at it in disbelief.)

DARYL: This red number?

(CINDY nods sadly as he bangs his head on the desk.)

CINDY: Daryl, you're like one of those tragic rock stars. You know, like, like Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain. You just shine too bright for too short a time. (strokes his hair) We'll tell our kids all about it.

DARYL: Kids. Can't afford kids. If I don't come up with a lot of cash pronto I am in deep doo-doo.

CINDY: Dairy Queen will take me back. I get almost six dollars an hour.

DARYL: Shh. I'm thinking. There's got to be somebody...

CINDY: We'll get the money, baby.

DARYL: (sudden realization) Sheila.

CINDY: (sharply) what about her?

DARYL: Cindy... You have been real sweet and all but I think we can use some time apart.

CINDY: What? Are you breaking up with me?

DARYL: Nothing personal. (leaves)



SCENE 14

(TV station)

HOLMAN: I've been envious of men like you my whole life. Based on your physical bearing, I'd assumed you were... More experienced. I mean... You spend every day with agent Scully a beautiful, enchanting woman. And you two never, uh...? (no response from MULDER) I... confess I find that shocking. I... I've seen how you two gaze at one another.

(Long pause. Then MULDER puts his arm on HOLMAN's shoulders and leads him toward SHEILA's office.)

MULDER: This is about you, Holman. I'm here to help you. I'm perfectly happy with my friendship with Agent Scully.

HOLMAN: So according to your theory I walk in there, tell her I love her and the drought will end?

MULDER: (straightens HOLMAN's tie) Just tell her how you feel.

(HOLMAN starts to go into SHEILA's office.)

MULDER: And Holman. I do not gaze at Scully.

(HOLMAN enters SHEILA's office.)

HOLMAN: Hey.

SHEILA: Hey. I can't find my notes for my... (finds a folder) presentation. Here they are.

HOLMAN: You got a minute?

SHEILA: For you, always. Are you excited about the high school reunion tonight?

HOLMAN: Of course. Uh... You're busy. We can talk later.

SHEILA: Oh, what is it?

(HOLMAN stares at her.)

HOLMAN: (stammers) I... I love you.

SHEILA: (with friendly love) I love you, too. Holman. What's wrong?

(MULDER is standing outside the office, waiting for HOLMAN.)

WOMAN IN TV STATION: Is that rain? (thunderclap) Oh, my gosh, it is! It's raining!

(MULDER looks out the window as it begins raining heavily. HOLMAN comes out of SHELIA's office.)

MULDER: Well?

(SHEILA comes out of the office and smiles at MULDER. Doesn't glance at HOLMAN.)

SHEILA: Good afternoon, Agent Mulder. See you tonight, Holman.

(She leaves.)

MULDER: (grinning at HOLMAN) Oh, you did it.

HOLMAN: (morbid) No, you did it.

MULDER: What are you talking about?

HOLMAN: She said that she loves me but that she's in love with you.

(MULDER looks at him in shock.)

(Out in the hall DARYL confronts SHELIA and grabs her arm.)

DARYL: What do you mean there's somebody else?

SHEILA: Daryl, this isn't the place.

DARYL: Just tell me who it is.

SHEILA: Let me go!

MULDER: (entering) Hey! Hey, Daryl. Cut it out, man.

(SHEILA looks at MULDER worshipfully.)

DARYL: (jealous) Him? This is the guy?! Oh, what's he got that I ain't got?

SHEILA: A job. A way with words. Intelligence. Good looks.

DARYL: Good looking? I'll show you good looking.

(Clumsily, DARYL swings at MULDER who easily dodges.)

SHEILA: Daryl! No, not his face!

(DARYL swings again.)

MULDER: Daryl.

SHEILA: Don't you hit him in the face!

(MULDER swings DARYL around and up against the wall and handcuffs him.)

DARYL: Oh, good. Picking on a cripple. You'll hear from my lawyer.

SHEILA: (to MULDER) You deserve a big reward.

(MULDER shakes his head. SHEILA grabs MULDER and kisses him passionately, pushing him against the wall, just as HOLMAN and SCULLY come around the corner into the hall. HOLMAN just stares in shock then leaves quickly. SCULLY looks surprised, mouth open, and takes a deep breath as MULDER, embarrassed, pulls away, hands on his hips. He has bright red lipstick smeared over his lips. SHEILA smiles.)

SCULLY: (uncomfortable) Mulder, the fog has lifted and if you're ready... the plane is waiting.

MULDER: (looking through a window at a weather monitor) Scully, do you know anything about, um... weather radar?

SCULLY: A bit. Why?

MULDER: What does red mean?

SCULLY: Thunderstorms, I think.

(SCULLY joins him at the window. A storm of hurricane proportions is approaching the area.)

MULDER: Looks like we're not going to be able to catch our plane.



SCENE 15
KRONER HIGH SCHOOL
8:33 PM

(Rain is pouring outside a gym decorated in a Wizard of Oz theme. Disco ball. Balloon rainbow. Couples at their 20th reunion dance to 70s tunes. Balloon decoration proclaims "There's No Place Like Kroner." Buckets are set around to catch the leaks.)

MUSIC: So I'd like to know where You got the notion
Said I'd like to know where You got the notion
Rock the boat Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat Don't tip the boat over
Rock the boat Don't rock the boat, baby
Rock the boat...

(Thunder crashes outside. MULDER and SCULLY look around the dance floor.)

SCULLY: Seven inches in the past six hours. The national weather service has issued a flash flood warning for the county. Mulder, are you sure he's here?

MULDER: If she's here, he'll be here.

MUSIC: So I'd like to know where You got the notion Said I'd like to know where You got the notion So I'd like to know where You got the notion So I'd like to know where You got the notion...

(MULDER and SCULLY find HOLMAN and pull him out into the hall.)

MULDER: Come on, Holman, now make it stop.

HOLMAN: This is your fault, not mine.

MULDER: My fault?

HOLMAN: You were kissing her.

(Lights flicker. SHEILA joins them in the hall.)

SHEILA: Oh, look who's here's some of my favorite people. Old friend,  (crosses to MULDER and smiles at him)  and new ones.

HOLMAN: You look very lovely tonight, Sheila.

SHEILA: Thank you. You look handsome. (to MULDER) Both of you.

(Intro for "The Things We do for Love" begins playing.)

SHEILA: Oh, I love this song. Agent Mulder, care to dance?

SCULLY: Holman was just telling us that, uh, that he wanted to dance.

MULDER: Yes, he was.

HOLMAN: I would be honored.

SHEILA: (disappointed) Okay.

MULDER: (desperate) Tell her, Holman.

MUSIC: You lay your bets and then you pay the price...

SHEILA: What was that Agent Mulder said? Tell me what?

HOLMAN: Oh, no big deal.

SHEILA: We tell each other everything, don't we?

HOLMAN: Well... um... when I stopped by your office this afternoon... when I said that...

SHEILA: When you said you loved me.

HOLMAN: What I meant to say... what I wanted you to understand... is that I'm in love with you. That I've loved you since high school.

MUSIC: Ooh, you make me love you Ooh, you've got a way...

(MULDER and SCULLY stand watching SHEILA and HOLMAN. They are swaying to the music. Very funny. As thunder crashes, SHEILA runs away from HOLMAN and into the bathroom. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MULDER: I'll build the ark, you gather the animals.

(SCULLY heads to the bathroom.)

MULDER: (calling after her) I was kidding.

(SCULLY enters the ladies room where SHEILA is staring at herself in the mirror.)

SCULLY: Sheila... (clears throat) my partner has a theory and even though I don't share his belief I feel that, given the circumstances you should hear his theory because it involves you and Holman. Agent Mulder believes that the drought, this storm these bizarre set of weather conditions that have plagued you over the years are... are caused by Holman. Specifically, that... that his emotions are somehow manifesting themselves in the weather and Agent Mulder believes that-that Holman is... unwittingly destroying this town because of his unspoken love for you.

SHEILA: You love him, don't you?

SCULLY: (softly) What?

SHEILA: You're jealous because Agent Mulder and I have a special connection and you're trying to divert me to Holman.

SCULLY: What?

(Back out in the gym, DARYL enters the dance floor through an outside door. He is unshaven and drunk. He is using his crutches.)

DARYL: It is good to be the king! It is good to be the king! Where's Sheila?

MULDER: Where's your leg?

DARYL: Cindy took it. Said I'd have to crawl back to her. Now, where's Sheila?

(In the bathroom.)

SHEILA: (disbelieving) Not even a kiss? (SCULLY shakes her head) Trust me, the man knows how to kiss. I just never thought of Holman that way, you know. He's my closest friend. And to not even suspect...

SCULLY: Well, it seems to me that the best relationships-- the ones that last-- are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship. You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere. And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with.

(The sinks begin filling up with dirty water.)

SCULLY: The storm drains are filling up. Let's get out of here.

(They run back out to the dance floor where DARYL is swinging his crutches at MULDER.)

DARYL: I'll teach you to mess with my woman. If I had two legs I'd kick your...

(DARYL falls against a chair. The electricity fails.)

SCULLY: I called the police.

MULDER: You might want to take a look at the king-- make sure he's all right. Whatever happened to Sheila?

(SHEILA walks up to where HOLMAN is sitting alone with his head in his hands.)

SHEILA: Is it true? That you make the weather? Because of me? The tornado in high school, snow at my wedding?

HOLMAN: I'm so sorry.

SHEILA: Daryl's rain?

HOLMAN: Can't explain the logic of it. Yes. Some strange manifestation of guilt.

SHEILA: Even this rain? Because you love me?

HOLMAN: Because... I love you.

(SHEILA kisses him softly.)

SHEILA: That is the most romantic thing I've ever heard.

(SHEILA kisses him passionately. Electricity comes back on with sparks and flashes.)

WOMAN: It stopped!

(Lots of cheering and applause. Music comes back on with JUDY GARLAND singing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow.")

MUSIC: Somewhere Over the Rainbow Way up high...

(CINDY runs in with one of DARYL's legs under her jacket.)

DARYL: I'm sorry, baby.

CINDY: Me, too. I brought you a leg.

DARYL: Oh...! Why you so good to me, honey?

(They kiss.)

MUSIC: ...Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue And the dreams that you dare to dream ready to come true...

(All the couples are dancing and kissing. MULDER and SCULLY look around.)

MULDER: I didn't know reunions could be so...

SCULLY: Wet?

(HOLMAN and SHEILA walk up to MULDER and SCULLY.)

MULDER: Well, how'd it go?

HOLMAN: You should try it sometime. Shelia?

(MULDER and SCULLY watch them leave.)

MUSIC: ...Away up on the chimney tops That's where you'll find me...



SCENE 16
EPILOGUE

(Nine months? Later. SHEILA is at home watching the weather while cuddling her baby.)

HOLMAN: (on TV) I can't imagine a more beautiful day than today. We have about a 30% chance of showers tomorrow which should make all of our farming friends real happy.

MUSIC: ...Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow...

SHEILA: (to the baby) You're a chip off the old block, yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

MUSIC: ...Why, oh, why can't I?

(Camera pans outside the window to show rainbow ending in the back yard.)

SCENE 1
ST. KATHERINE'S HOSPITAL
9:29 PM

(Hospital corridor. An ORDERLY/INTERN guy runs up to DR. KATRINA CABRERA, hands her a file and they walk quickly down the hall.)

ORDERLY: Dr. Cabrera.

DR CABRERA: Where is he?

ORDERLY: He's down in trauma. They said you'd know what's wrong with him.

DR CABRERA: Who transferred him from ICU?

ORDERLY: I did-- he was scheduled for, uh... (checks the chart)  therapeutic plasmapheresis. They were prepping him. He went into shock.

DR CABRERA: What are his vitals?

ORDERLY: Not good. Pulse is 40. Blood pressure 80/50. His GCS is six.

DR CABRERA: Okay. Get on the phone to the FBI. There's an Agent Scully that should be notified.

ORDERLY: FBI?

DR CABRERA: This man is an FBI agent.

ORDERLY: What's wrong with him?

DR CABRERA: What's wrong with him is he's going to die.

(The ORDERLY stares after her as she enters a room. The patient is SKINNER. His veins appear to be throbbing and hardened all over his body giving his skin a nasty blue mottled appearance.)

DR CABRERA: Can you hear me? Mr. Skinner?

(She leans down close to his mouth. SKINNER whispers inaudibly.)

DR CABRERA: I'm not understanding. Can you speak up?

(SKINNER whispers to her again. She understands him and stares at him in shock.)

ORDERLY: What'd he say?

DR CABRERA: A name.

(SKINNER's heart monitor flatlines.)

ORDERLY: He's coding on us. (picks up defibrillator paddles - a NURSE greases them) Clear.

(DR CABRERA doesn't move from SKINNER's side.)

ORDERLY: Dr. Cabrera, clear. Dr. Cabrera!

DR CABRERA: Let him go.

(SKINNER stares sightlessly.)

SCENE 2

(Camera pans back from close up of SKINNER's unfocused eye. By the end of his voiceover, a NURSE pulls a sheet over SKINNER's face. He is dead.)

SKINNER: (voiceover) Every minute of every day we choose. Who we are. Who we forgive. Who we defend and protect. To choose a side or to walk the line. To play the middle. To straddle the fence between what is and what should be. This was the course I chose. Trying to find the delicate balance of interests that can never exist. Choosing by not choosing. Defending a center which cannot hold. So death chose for me.



SCENE 3
SOUTH STREET GYM
24 HOURS EARLIER

(Dimly lit gym with boxing rings like in the "Rocky" movies. All men. A man, the TRAINER is helping SKINNER put on boxing gear.)

TRAINER: Good aim! Good aim! Go easy on him, Slugger. I need him to lock up for me tonight, okay?

(SKINNER climbs into the ring and begins boxing with DRE, a very strong looking young guy.)

TRAINER: (coaching them) Don't telegraph that left, Dre. Stevie Wonder would see that one coming. You're fighting the FBI now, Dre. Fight smart. Go!

(SKINNER begins losing focus. All is blurry and echoing. He sees the blurry image of a scruffy looking, long-haired BEARDED MAN watching him. In slow motion, DRE hits SKINNER hard in the head, knocking him to the floor.)

SKINNER: Oh! Uh!

(The TRAINER gets in the ring and pulls the protective helmet off SKINNER.)

TRAINER: Hey, Slugger. You okay? Slugger, can you hear me?

(SKINNER is barely conscious.)

TRAINER: Talk to me. You all right? Slugger.

(SKINNER blacks out and fades into  )



SCENE 4

(St. Katherine's Hospital. Later that evening. SKINNER wakes up in a hospital bed. A very PERKY NURSE is leaning over him.)

PERKY NURSE: Mr. Skinner. Mr. Skinner. Hi. You going to stick with us now?

(SKINNER exhales.)

PERKY NURSE: Do you remember what happened?

SKINNER: I was boxing. I must've gotten tagged.

PERKY NURSE: Yes, you did. At least you didn't get your ear bit off. That's something, right? Dr. Plant will be with you in a minute.

(She leaves. SKINNER sits up. He is in a t-shirt and gray boxers. His cell phone rings.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Yeah. Skinner. Hello.

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) Walter... Skinner.

SKINNER: (on phone) Who is this?

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) Have... you heard... the news? It's... in... you.

SKINNER: (on phone) What is this?

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) You... have... 24 hours... to go.

SKINNER: (on phone) What is this? What do you want?

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) You... are... already dead.

(Clock on the wall says that it is 9:33. SKINNER hangs up. DR. PLANT, a friendly older man, enters the room and rinses his hands quickly.)

DR. PLANT: Mr. Skinner. Didn't expect to see you up and around. You must be feeling better. Can you take a seat on that table for me, please?

( SKINNER gets on the table groaning a little at the pain in his chest.)

DR. PLANT: I'm Dr. Plant. I was here with you before. You probably don't remember.

(DR PLANT checks SKINNER's eyes with a penlight.)

SKINNER: No.

DR. PLANT: Well, the good news is... your dilation's back to normal. Plus you still have both your ears.

(SKINNER chuckles politely.)

SKINNER: I heard that one.

DR. PLANT: I'm going to release you. But I suggest that you rethink the boxing. You're not 20 anymore.

SKINNER: There's nothing wrong with me?

DR. PLANT: Well, you got your bell rung. Other than that, I think you're fine. Might want to ice that bruise.

SKINNER: What bruise?

DR. PLANT: Right here.

(DR. PLANT pulls up SKINNER's shirt to reveal a big nasty bruise on his chest.)

SKINNER: How the hell did I get that?

DR. PLANT: Must've taken a hard one to the ribs. But there's nothing broken. No internal bleeding. Like I said... You'll live.

SKINNER: (quietly) At least.



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS
10:21 PM

(MULDER is sitting alone at his desk in the bullpen. No lights are on. He is flinging sharpened pencils into the ceiling. He sees SKINNER walk slowly past out in the hall. MULDER gets up and finds SKINNER lying on the couch in his dark office.)

SKINNER: What is it, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I just, uh... I thought I'd poke my head in and say hey.

SKINNER: (weakly): Hey.

MULDER: (smiling) What, are you sleeping one off?

SKINNER: No, I was having trouble seeing. It's nothing. I just didn't think I should drive.

MULDER: You going to be all right, sir?

(Skinner does not answer.)

11:09 PM

(Short time later. SCULLY gets off the elevator and joins MULDER and SKINNER in the darkened office. MULDER is sitting on the desk.)

MULDER: He's going to tell you he's all right.

SKINNER: That's because there's nothing wrong with me.

SCULLY: Not that I could tell if there was. Why are all the lights out?

MULDER: He's having trouble with his eyes. He's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage.

(SCULLY kneels down to look at SKINNER's ribcage. MULDER flicks on a bright desk lamp and shines it operating room light style on the bruised area.)

SCULLY: What did you do?

SKINNER: It's nothing.

(The bruise looks worse.)

SCULLY: Says who?

SKINNER: The doctor who released me from the hospital.

(Skinner grunts in pain as SCULLY touches the bruise.)

MULDER: That was the second opinion. The first was unsolicited. A phone call at the hospital. A scrambled voice telling him he had 24 hours to live.

SKINNER: That was somebody yanking my chain. Look, I got a clean bill of health. (tries to sit up)

SCULLY: Hey, hey, hey. (gently pushes him back down) In the last 48 hours, did you eat or drink anything that tasted metallic or otherwise odd?

SKINNER: Oh, come on. Are you thinking that I'm poisoned?

SCULLY: Did the doctor take your blood?

SKINNER: Yes. And it checked out.

SCULLY: Well, if you were poisoned, it could have been overlooked.

SKINNER: If it did, why call and tell me at the hospital?

MULDER: To scare you. See what you'd do. Who you'd turn to.

SKINNER: (sarcastically) Oh. This is about you.

MULDER: Or about the X-Files.

SKINNER: You are so paranoid, Mulder. You're not even on the X-Files anymore.

SCULLY: I know. But you are. You still supervise them.

(MULDER goes into interrogation mode, arms crossed, very direct.)

MULDER: What happened today? Anything out of the ordinary?

SKINNER: I'm not going to play this game.

SCULLY: Look, it could've been anything. It could have been the slightest touch, or a handshake.

MULDER: This morning, you woke up...

SKINNER: I woke up.

MULDER: Alone?

SKINNER: (defensive) Yes. Alone.

MULDER: And how'd you get to the office?

SKINNER: The same way that I always do-- I drove.

SCULLY: And then what?

SKINNER: Then nothing-- I had meetings, I went to the gym, to the hospital, and now I'm here.

MULDER: Just slow down. One step at a time. How'd you get from the parking garage to your office?

SKINNER: The elevator.

MULDER: And then what?

SKINNER: (sighs) I walked up the hallway.

(In slow motion flashback, SKINNER gets off the elevator and walks into his office, nodding to his assistant.)

SKINNER: I passed the same dozen people that I pass every morning. I went to my office. I said good morning to my secretary. She said good morning to me. I returned calls, I did paperwork I was here for the rest of the day.

MULDER: Now think. There's got to be something.

SKINNER: In the hallway, there was a man. He stopped me. He wanted to know the time.

(FLASHBACK: SKINNER gets off the elevator again, but an older man, DR KENNETH ORGEL, briefly stops him by touching his wrist with a black gloved hand.)

MULDER: Did he touch you?

SKINNER: He grabbed me. On my right wrist.

(SKINNER looks at his wrist.)

SCULLY: It wouldn't necessarily leave a mark. Some poisons are absorbed through the skin.

MULDER: What time was it?

(Later, MULDER, SCULLY, and SKINNNER watch as a TECHNICIAN runs back the surveillance video for the front entrance of the FBI building. He stops on the older man, DR KENNETH ORGEL.)

MULDER: There you are.

SKINNER: That's him. Right there.

SCULLY: Wait a second. Back up. It can't be. That's Kenneth Orgel. An advisor to a Senate subcommittee on ethics and new technology.

SKINNER: He's a scientist?

SCULLY: A physicist. Very well known, as far as physicists go.

MULDER: (reading the log) He signed in here as a visitor to the office of Assistant Director Walter Skinner.

SCULLY: Why would he be coming to see you?

SKINNER: I'd like to ask him that myself.

SCULLY: Sir, if this man poisoned you, you should be off your feet and under a doctor's care.

SKINNER: If this man poisoned me I'm going to put a gun to his head, find out why and ask him how he's going to make me well.

(SKINNER leaves.)

SCULLY: What hospital was he at?

MULDER: St. Katherine's.

(MULDER follows SKINNER.)



SCENE 6
CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND
11:32 PM

(Shot of cars crossing bridge into Maryland. MULDER and SKINNER knock at the front door of a house. SKINNER winces as the porch light is flicked on. DR ORGEL opens the door a few inches.)

DR. ORGEL: (warily) Yes?

SKINNER: Dr. Orgel? Kenneth Orgel?

DR. ORGEL: Yes.

SKINNER: Do you know who I am?

DR. ORGEL: No.

SKINNER: My name's Walter Skinner. I'm an Assistant Director at the FBI.

MULDER: Dr. Orgel, you visited the FBI this morning. You came to see Mr. Skinner.

DR. ORGEL: No... uh, you must be mistaken. Sorry, you'll have to come back another time.

(DR. ORGEL closes the door. MULDER smiles at SKINNER.)

MULDER: Go around back.

SKINNER: What?

(SKINNER goes around back. MULDER knocks loudly. DR ORGEL opens the door again.)

DR. ORGEL: Please, you're bothering me.

(As DR. ORGEL tries to close the door, MULDER pushes it in and then ducks as a gunshot from inside the house sends a bullet through the door and hits the porch light. SKINNER bursts through the back door. Inside the house are several Arabic men who grab DR. ORGEL and hold him as a hostage.)

SKINNER: (pointing his gun) Federal agent!

(SKINNER is hit on the head from behind and falls to the floor. MULDER runs toward him.)

SKINNER: Go!

(MULDER chases after the men who fire at him as they run. Cool movie theme music. Action!MULDER tackles one of the men, TUNISIAN MAN, as the rest drag DR. ORGEL into a car, license # JP 259 and speed away.)

MULDER: Drop the gun. Drop it!

(The man does and MULDER pulls him up. Back inside the house SKINNER is in pain. He gingerly touches his neck where his veins have begun to swell. His vision is blurry as he sees MULDER and his prisoner enter the house again.)

(SKINNER, MULDER, the TUNISIAN MAN are standing on the front porch.)

TUNISIAN MAN: (something Arabic and angry)

MULDER: Yeah, so's your mom.

TUNISIAN MAN: (something Arabic and angry)

MULDER: Hey, give it a rest, huh?!

(SKINNER looks in the TUNISIAN MAN's jacket and finds some diplomatic papers.)

TUNISIAN MAN: (something Arabic and VERY angry)

SKINNER: Let him go, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What?

SKINNER: He's got diplomatic papers. (to TUNISIAN MAN) It's our mistake. You can go. (to MULDER) Just let him go.

(MULDER is not happy, but releases him. TUNISIAN MAN leaves angrily.)

SKINNER: Get in the house. The police are going to be here any moment. I don't have time to stand around and answer any questions. His name is Alexander Lazreg-- L-a-z-r-e-g. He's the cultural attache with the Tunisian mission here in D.C. See what else you can find out about him.

MULDER: (looking at the veins on SKINNER's neck) You need to get to a hospital.

SKINNER: No. I'm trying to stay out of one.

(SKINNER leaves as MULDER enters the house.)



SCENE 7
1:06 AM
20 HOURS, 29 MINUTES REMAINING

(SCULLY is at St. Katherine's Hospital with DR. PLANT. They walk down a corridor and into a lab.)

DR. PLANT: The boxer-- FBI.

SCULLY: Yes, you released him from your care earlier this evening.

DR. PLANT: Is he not all right?

SCULLY: Well, that's why I'm here. He may have been poisoned.

DR. PLANT: You're kidding. By who?

SCULLY: I don't know. In fact, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for.

DR. PLANT: Well, you're lucky. He's on a government HMO. No one's even bothered to handle his samples yet.

(SCULLY crosses over to a refrigerated cabinet containing several vials of blood.)

SCULLY: Is this them in here?

DR. PLANT: (nervous) I'm not supposed to let you have those-- not without a written release from the patient.

(SCULLY takes some vials of blood out and reads the label on them.)

SCULLY: We may not have time. He may not have time either.

DR. PLANT: He had absolutely no symptoms of poisoning.

(SCULLY looks closely at the blood in the vials. Something is not right. It looks like something has settled to the bottom.)

SCULLY: Are you sure these haven't been processed?

DR. PLANT: I'm not sure, but I doubt they've even been touched.



SCENE 8

(DR ORGEL's house. MULDER is going through stacks of papers on the desk, then tossing them to the floor. A COP walks in and looks at the mess that MULDER is making.)

COP: I'm not so sure you should be doing that.

MULDER: This is a crime scene. What would you rather I be doing?

COP: I'm concerned for Dr. Orgel's personal property and the preservation of evidence.

MULDER: I'd be a lot more concerned with the preservation of Dr. Orgel. (In the trash, MULDER finds a picture of DR. ORGEL and SENATOR MATHESON - MULDER's patron from first season - smiling as they hold a official looking folder between them.) Hello, Senator...



SCENE 9

(Hospital lab. SCULLY and DR. PLANT are running tests on the blood with a computer.)

DR. PLANT: It's carbon. Pure carbon. How in the world would that get into his bloodstream?

SCULLY: How is it working as a poison?

DR. PLANT: By all rights, it shouldn't be.

SCULLY: Look at them-- just rattling around in the solution.

DR. PLANT: It's just bizarre. (sees something on the screen) Did you see that?

SCULLY: Did you just touch something?

DR. PLANT: No, I didn't.

SCULLY: It just multiplied. Look! It just did it again.

DR. PLANT: Zooming in.

(DR PLANT types some keyboard commands. They see what looks like a bunch of tiny little eight pointed bug-like cells multiplying every few seconds among the regular cells.)

DR. PLANT: What the hell are they?



SCENE 10
4:01 AM

(SENATOR MATHESON's mansion. A BUTLER lets MULDER in and leaves him in the foyer.)

BUTLER: Wait here, please.

(After a moment, SENATOR MATHESON comes down the stairs belting his bathrobe.)

SENATOR MATHESON: I don't have to tell you how late it is, do I, Agent Mulder? But I suspect that wasn't even a consideration of yours.

MULDER: Actually, time is my only consideration, Senator. (shows him picture) This was taken only three days ago. It's of you and Dr. Kenneth Orgel holding a Senate Resolution-S.R. 819, I think it's called. What is that?

SENATOR MATHESON: A funding bill. What is this all about?

MULDER: A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 819. I don't know how, I don't even know why but I'm betting you do.

SENATOR MATHESON: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I don't even really know yet; all i have are a few pieces: a Tunisian diplomat, this Dr. Kenneth Orgel, this health bill, S.R. 819-- all leading up to a plot to kill an Assistant Director of the FBI. Does that make sense?

SENATOR MATHESON: The bill you've referred to will provide money and supplies to the World Health Organization, medical technology to third world countries. I have aided you in the past with information, Fox, and advice, which right now is to leave here at once and never again suggest to anyone my involvement in any such dark intrigue. Am I understood?

MULDER: This man may die; he may only have a few hours to live.

SENATOR MATHESON: My intention is to save lives, Fox but I can't save his. (opens the door for MULDER) Good night, Fox. Drive safely.

(MULDER slowly and reluctantly leaves.)



SCENE 11
EMBASSY ROW GARAGE
5:10 AM

(Parking garage. TUNISIAN MAN from DR. ORGEL's house gets ticket and pulls into the garage in same car from the kidnapping. A moment later, SKINNER pulls up and follows him in. SKINNER is checking the veins in his neck when TUNISIAN MAN fires into SKINNER's windshield. SKINNER falls out of view. TUNISIAN MAN goes up to SKINNER's window then ducks and runs as SKINNER suddenly sits up and fires at him. SKINNER, in great pain gets out of the car and searches among the parked cars. He can barely focus. TUNISIAN MAN is about to shoot SKINNER when a car driven by the BEARDED MAN suddenly whips around the corner and hits the TUNISIAN MAN killing him. SKINNER rolls out of the way and collapses against a car denting the fender and setting the car alarm off.)



SCENE 12
6:14 AM
15 HOURS, 21 MINUTES REMAINING

(St. Katherine's Hospital lab. SCULLY is still looking at the blood.)

SCULLY: Dr. Plant?

DR. PLANT: What? What is it?

SCULLY: I think I've found it. I think I found what the carbon's doing. It's, uh...it's not just reproducing itself. It has behavior. It's creating something, a-a matrix stimulated by blood flow in response to movement. It's multiplying and solidifying in an orderly fashion. It's building valves or-or dams in the vascular system.

DR. PLANT: (shocked and amazed) It's building a heart attack.

(A NURSE enters the room.)

NURSE: Dr. Plant? You're doing blood work on a Walter Skinner?

DR. PLANT: Yes.

NURSE: I just heard on the radio there's a Walter Skinner who's been picked up by paramedics at a parking garage downtown.

SCULLY: Where are they taking him?

NURSE: D.C. General.



SCENE 13

(Emergency operating room. DC General Hospital. DR. CABRERA and a team of NURSES are getting ready to operate on SKINNER who is veinier than before and unconscious. They have removed his shirt and have his arms stretched out.)

DOCTOR: Did you see this? We've got some sort of extreme vascular event here. How is he even still alive?

DR. CABRERA: We'll take the left arm first. Mark it just above the bicep. Let's get to it.

DOCTOR: I'll get this side.

(SCULLY and DR PLANT enter the ER.)

DOCTOR: Hey, you... Out.

SCULLY: I know this man.

DOCTOR: I don't care. This is a sterile operating room.

DR. CABRERA: Get these people out.

SCULLY: Look, I'm sorry. His name is Walter Skinner. We've been investigating his illness. What are you doing?

DR. CABRERA: If he's gonna live, he's gonna have to lose his arms.

SCULLY: No, that's not going to save him. It's his blood.

DR. CABRERA: Who the hell is this woman?

DR. PLANT: She's a doctor.

SCULLY: You're not going to solve anything until you get a scope into him. Nothing else is going to work. Look, if you want to save this man listen to what I'm saying.

(Later, SCULLY walks beside a barely conscious SKINNER as they wheel him down a corridor on a gurney.)

SCULLY: It's okay, sir. Lie back down. We're just moving you to another room.

SKINNER: (very weakly) Who did this to me?

SCULLY: That's what Mulder's trying to figure out right now. But we're going to take good care of you. I promise. We're going to do everything we can.

(SKINNER has flashbacks over the last few hours, getting hit, DR. ORGEL, etc.)

SKINNER: I don't know. I can't remember.



SCENE 14
8:58 AM

(FBI building. SCULLY with very wrong hair . Oh  never mind. It's not SCULLY. SKINNER's ASSISTANT gets off the elevator and enters her office. She sees a man in SKINNER's office going through the desk frantically.

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: Sir? Is that you? (sees that it is MULDER) Agent Mulder!

MULDER: Hey, do you have the key to this drawer?

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: What are you doing?

MULDER: AD Skinner's in the hospital. Somebody poisoned him.

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: Poisoned him? Why?

MULDER: For doing his job.

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: I-I don't understand.

MULDER: I'm looking for anything that relates to a Senate Resolution: S.R. 819. If you want to save his life, you'll help me open this drawer.

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: I don't have the key.

MULDER: You have a letter opener? In your desk? Something?

(MULDER goes back out to her desk and finds a letter opener. Then he looks down at the mail on the desk and picks up a large envelope with an official looking Senate stamp on it.)

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: Is he going to be all right?



SCENE 15

(D.C. General Hospital. MULDER enters and finds SCULLY [in very flattering burgundy scrubs] in SKINNER's room. They speak together quietly and privately.)

MULDER: What's his condition?

SCULLY: He's stable, but it's not good, Mulder. He's got extreme vascular trauma and distension. His... his blood has become a weapon against his body.

MULDER: Well, can you fight it?

SCULLY: We don't know what it is. I mean, the best that we can do is keep lasering his arteries open. But it's only going to be a matter of time before we lose. I mean, it's-it's building walls in his vessels faster than we can tear them down, and... and we just don't have the technology to combat it.

MULDER: Maybe we do.

(He shows her the folder he took from SKINNER's office. It has SENATOR MATHESON's name on it.)

SCULLY: What is this?

MULDER: I found this with Skinner's morning mail. He was doing a security check on a Senate bill for violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology.

SCULLY: Yeah, but this is just a routine procedure, Mulder. The FBI does dozens of these a year.

MULDER: No. This bill was going to vote in the Senate. All it was waiting on was Skinner's review and an analysis by Dr. Kenneth Orgel.

SCULLY: You're saying that Dr. Orgel poisoned Skinner in order to cover up his analysis?

MULDER: No. Orgel didn't poison anybody. Orgel came to the FBI to tell Skinner what he knew-- that there was a gross violation of export laws involving new technology.

SCULLY: New technology.

(A cell phone begins ringing.)

MULDER: You know what that means?

SCULLY: Well, I think I might.

(The ringing continues. MULDER checks his pocket.)

MULDER: That's not me.

(A NURSE comes out of SKINNER's room with a ringing cell phone.)

NURSE: You want to get this? It was in his pants pocket.

MULDER: Thank you. (into phone) Hello.

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) Might as well give up.

SCULLY: Who is it?

MULDER: It's a computer synth voice.

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) You  can't. stop it.

MULDER: Somebody that must know he's here.

ELECTRONIC VOICE: (on phone) Walter Skinner... your time...

(MULDER hands the phone to SCULLY and runs off. The BEARDED MAN is standing nearby with an amazing Palm Pilot-like electronic writing pad thing on which he is writing the words that MULDER and SCULLY are hearing on the phone. He sees MULDER and begins running.)

(MULDER chases the BEARDED MAN downstairs and into the parking deck.)

MULDER: Federal agent! Stop right there!

NURSE: Sir!

MULDER: Hey!

(MULDER enters the parking deck and pulls out his gun. He aims quickly at a sound, but it is just a blonde nurse. He waves her on and keeps looking between the cars. Suddenly, the BEARDED MAN starts his car and drives off. ICanCatchMovingCars!MULDER chases it, then runs to the stairs and follows the car to the exit where he finds the BEARDED MAN's car wrecked at the gate. Cool Movie theme music. The BEARDED MAN is gone. The gate attendant, a young Hispanic woman, is speaking rapidly in Spanish She is most upset at the broken gate.)



SCENE 16

(SENATOR MATHESON is driving his car. His car phone rings.)

SENATOR MATHESON: (on phone) Yes.

BEARDED MAN: (on phone) The bill is in danger, Senator. A new threat has emerged.

SENATOR MATHESON: (on phone) You shouldn't have called me.

BEARDED MAN: (on phone) Blood will be on your hands.

SENATOR MATHESON: (on phone) I don't buy your hollow threats.

(The BEARDED MAN is at a pay phone. His voice seems somewhat  familiar.)

BEARDED MAN: (on phone) Well, Dr. Orgel does. You can ask him.

SENATOR MATHESON: (on phone) What have you done with him?

BEARDED MAN: (on phone) I can tell you where to find him.



SCENE 17
FBI IMPOUND GARAGE
12:11 PM

(FBI GARAGE TECHNICIAN comes over to MULDER.)

GARAGE TECHNICIAN: The car is leased, part of a fleet service that services the diplomatic counsel corps.

MULDER: What other forensic evidence were you able to lift?

GARAGE TECHNICIAN: Not much on the outside. It's not surprising considering the condition of the vehicle. Inside we found a couple hairs-- human-- from an expensive wig.

(Holds up an evidence bag with some blonde hairs.)

MULDER: (looking at the hairs) Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful. What else?

GARAGE TECHNICIAN: Well, we scraped the tire treads, found something odd. It's full of polychlorinated biphenyls-- PCBs. Over 500 parts per million. Now that's the kind of levels you used to see in the 1970s. Right before the EPA got fangs. (hands MULDER a vial of tire scrapings)

MULDER: From where?

GARAGE TECHNICIAN: Well, the PCBs are saturated evenly in the clay, uh... Demo site, maybe, or, uh, an old power plant.



SCENE 18
2:04 PM

(SENATOR MATHESON, license plate S4578, enters a deserted warehouse at a power plant. A flock of pigeons startle him. He walks through the building and opens another door and finds a man, DR. ORGEL, lying strapped to a table.)

DR. ORGEL: Who's in here? Is someone there? Oh... Senator, please, let me go.

(DR. ORGEL has same symptoms as SKINNER, veins standing out all over his body. He is gasping in pain.)

DR. ORGEL: I need... water.

SENATOR MATHESON: (unstrapping DR. ORGEL) Who did this to you?

DR. ORGEL: Hurry... please. It's... killing me.

SENATOR MATHESON: They believe you have exposed them to the FBI-- to Walter Skinner.

DR. ORGEL: No. I told the FBI nothing. I told them nothing. Please, I promise not to expose anyone.

(The BEARDED man is sitting in the shadows with his computer pad. There is a half-shaded cone shaped display on the screen. The BEARDED MAN operates the pad so that the cone becomes completely shaded. As he does, DR. ORGEL begins yelling and groaning as the veins on his body swell and harden even more. SENATOR MATHESON backs away in horror. DR. ORGEL screams in pain.)



SCENE 19
5:32 PM
3 HOURS, 56 MINUTES REMANING

(D.C. General Hospital. SCULLY enters SKINNER's room. He is looking bad.)

SCULLY: Sir, there's something I'd like to try. It's a treatment called therapeutic plasmapheresis. It requires filtering all of the blood in your body. It's a radical procedure and there is a danger that your body might go into shock.

SKINNER: I'm in your hands. I think I owe you an apology, Scully. You and Mulder.

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: I've been lying here thinking. Your quest... it should have been mine.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

SKINNER: If I die now, I die in vain. I have nothing to show for myself. My life...

SCULLY: Sir, you know that's not true.

SKINNER: It is. I can see now that... I always played it safe. I wouldn't take sides. Wouldn't let you and Mulder... pull me in.

SCULLY: You've been our ally more times than I can say.

SKINNER: Not the kind of ally that I could have been.

(SCULLY gently clasps his wrist. SKINNER suddenly flashes back to seeing the BEARDED MAN in the hall of the FBI building, the gym, and at the hospital.)

SKINNER: I remember now.

SCULLY: What?

SKINNER: I can't see his face, he has a beard.

SCULLY: Try.

SKINNER: He was at the gym. At the hospital. He killed that man. He was at the FBI when Orgel approached me.

SCULLY: He was following you?

SKINNER: The tape... he's on the surveillance tape.



SCENE 20
5:56 PM

(MULDER pulls up behind SENATOR MATHESON's car, a Honda, at the warehouse. He gets out of the car and goes inside also encountering the attack pigeons. MULDER finds SENATOR MATHESON standing next to the table where DR. ORGEL was strapped, but it is now empty.)

SENATOR MATHESON: You must be surprised to see me here. I'm sure I'm not the man you're looking for.

MULDER: Where is he? Where's Orgel?

SENATOR MATHESON: Orgel is dead.

MULDER: I don't believe you. You lied to me this morning; you're lying to me now.

SENATOR MATHESON: Drop this, Fox.

MULDER: Where is Orgel?! I need to know what he knows. A friend of mine is dying.

SENATOR MATHESON: I tell you, they killed him. What Orgel knows died with him.

MULDER: Tell me what you know, Senator. This is about S.R. 819 isn't it? What the hell did they put in Skinner?

SENATOR MATHESON: I'm sure you already have some idea, Fox.

MULDER: It's the same technology that S.R. 819 will export.

SENATOR MATHESON: Technology that the world believes is purely theoretical.

MULDER: Nanotechnology. Microscopic, atom-sized machines? Machines can be stopped.

SENATOR MATHESON: Your friend is already dead.

MULDER: I don't believe that.

SENATOR MATHESON: If you pursue this, Fox, they will kill you.

MULDER: Not before I expose you and your role in this.

(MULDER angrily begins walking away back to the door.)

SENATOR MATHESON: (desperate) My role? I am a victim here. Don't you understand that? I'm fighting for my life.

MULDER: I will stop this!

SENATOR MATHESON: (more desperate) It's too late, Fox. It's too late!

(MULDER leaves.)



SCENE 21

(Hospital. 9:32 PM. Same scene as end of teaser. SKINNER is looking even worse. His heart monitor is beeping steadily, then flatlines.)

ORDERLY: All right, he's coding on us. (gets ready to defibrillate) Clear. Dr. Cabrera, clear. Dr. Cabrera?

DR. CABRERA: Let him go.

ORDERLY: (looking up at the clock) Call time of death, 9:33.

(NURSE pulls the sheet over SKINNER's face. A few yards away, the BEARDED MAN is holding his computer pad which is displaying a fully shaded cone. He slides the shading completely away. Under the sheet, SKINNER suddenly gasps for breath. The ORDERLY and NURSES immediately run to him. SKINNER looks over and sees the BEARDED MAN. A cart passes between them and the BEARDED MAN vanishes.)



SCENE 22
THREE WEEKS LATER

(MULDER and SCULLY are sitting in front of SKINNER's desk.)

SCULLY: Sir, I've spoken with your doctors and your prognosis is excellent. Whatever you are infected with appears to be dormant and your recovery is being hailed as miracle.

MULDER: The man who poisoned you was at the FBI that day. Scully was able to pull these off the security video tapes. (hands two pictures of the BEARDED MAN to SKINNER) Hopefully, it might jog your memory. Maybe you can identify this man.

SKINNER: (glancing briefly at the photos) No, I'm sorry.

MULDER: S.R. 819 was withdrawn by committee late last night. Without explanation.

SKINNER: Good. So this man failed then?

MULDER: If that was his true motive. If he wanted to poison you to prevent you from investigating S.R. 819, why call you to tell you that? This man worked for the government that was to receive this technology. He drove one of their cars and he killed one of his own to save you.

SKINNER: So you still think this is about you? About the X-Files?

MULDER: Yes. Yes, I do. And I have an idea who may be behind all this. But I'd need your authority to continue the investigation.

SKINNER: I have neither the authority nor the will to allow your continued inquiry into this matter. You'll perform your duties as directed by AD Kersh and only AD Kersh.

(MULDER and SCULLY stare at SKINNER in surprise.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: This matter's closed, Agents. Am I clear?

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 23

(FBI parking garage. SKINNER walks to his car. He uses a remote to unlock the car then gets in and sits for a moment. He speaks to a figure in the back seat.)

SKINNER: I've been expecting you to show up.

(The figure closes the lid on the computer pad.. It is the BEARDED MAN who is no longer bearded.)

NO LONGER BEARDED MAN: You know I can push the button any time.

SKINNER: What do you want from me? What's this about, Krycek.

(The NO LONGER BEARDED MAN who we now see is KRYCEK leans forward.)

KRYCEK: All in good time.

(KRYCEK gets out of the backseat leaving SKINNER alone.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
NEW YORK CITY

(Early evening. Inside a high rise office tower an elevator opens. A YOUNG WOMAN pushes her mail cart out of the elevator. When the wheels catch, she smiles her thanks as ALFRED FELLIG, mid sixties, helps her push it all the way out. She walks down the deserted hall delivering mail to several offices including Public Relations and Morgan Maxwell. At one point she looks back nervously and sees FELLIG watching her silently. He follows her on down the hall and back to the elevators. She punches the down arrow several times, then gets on quickly when the doors open. There are a few other people on the car. Just as the doors are almost closed, FELLIG stops them, and also gets on. FELLIG faces the reflective doors and we see that he sees all the other passengers in black and white. He pushes "17." They go down a floor, and FELLIG gets off to the YOUNG WOMAN's great relief. FELLIG turns and watches them as the doors close. As soon as the elevator starts down again, the lights begin flickering. There is a long pause, then there is the sound of tearing metal then of the snapping cable. The passengers scream as the elevator begins to freefall. FELLIG, who began running down the stairs as soon as he got off the doomed elevator, reaches the basement and gets out his camera. Emotionless, he watches the elevator doors shake and listens to the rushing wind and the screams of the passengers as the car hurtles downward and crashes before him. He begins snapping pictures as the doors crack open and a woman's arm limply falls out. Her fingers move once then fall still.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(MULDER and SCULLY's desks in the FBI bullpen. Along with some other agents, they are both on their phones looking less than thrilled to be there. MULDER is playing with something. ?)

MALE AGENT: (on phone) Just a routine background check. Now, to the best of your knowledge has Mr. Wisnowski ever used any illegal drugs? Which illegal drugs?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, in the time that you worked with... Ms. Ermentrout did you find her to be a trustworthy person? (very bored) Punctual. Punctual is good.

SCULLY: (on phone) No, no, ma'am. This is just a routine background check. Mr... Mr. Garber is not in any legal trouble whatsoever. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for your time. (hangs up)

MULDER: (hand over the receiver) Hey, Scully maybe if we get really lucky next time they'll let us clean toilet bowls.

SCULLY: You ready to quit?

MULDER: No. That would make way too many people way too happy.

(SCULLY starts do dial another number, but stops and answers as the phone rings.)

SCULLY: Scully. (she listens) I'm on my way.

(SCULLY hangs up, then whispers to MULDER as she gets up from her desk.)

SCULLY: I've been called into Kersh's office.

(MULDER starts to get up. SCULLY stops him.)

SCULLY: (whisper) Just me.

MULDER: (surprised) Just you? (loudly calling out after her) Don't forget your toilet brush. (then quickly into the phone which he hadn't covered) No. No, ma'am, not you.

(KERSH's office. KERSH is looking at SCULLY's personnel file. SCULLY knocks at the door and enters. Another very young good-looking agent, PEYTON RITTER is with him.)

AD KERSH: Agent.

SCULLY: Sir.

AD KERSH: Dana Scully, this is Agent Peyton Ritter with the Bureau's New York office.

SCULLY: (shaking his hand) Agent Ritter.

AGENT RITTER: Hi.

(RITTER looks nervously to KERSH.)

AD KERSH: Show her what you have.

AGENT RITTER: Uh, well, our office is currently updating its case filing system. While I was involved in this project-- scanning old crime scene photographs into the computer-- I came across this.

(He hands her a file containing a picture of a dead woman next to a clock.)

SCULLY: (reading) Margareta Stoller age 57, cause of death-- an overdose of Nitraz....

(SCULLY looks questioningly at RITTER and KERSH.)

AGENT RITTER: Take a look at when they found her.

SCULLY: (READING) A NEIGHBOR CALLED THE POLICE AT 11:14 p.m.

AGENT RITTER: So what's wrong with that picture?

SCULLY: The clock says that it's 45 minutes earlier. Well, a clock can be wrong.

AGENT RITTER: They certainly can. So, I checked the Post from the following day. These are straight from their photo files.

(Hands her more pictures of the same scene, but the clock shows a later time.)

SCULLY: Hmm. Almost an hour and a half later.

AGENT RITTER: Two different negatives, same photographer. (hands her FELLIG's file) The guy's name is Alfred Fellig. He's rattled around Manhattan for years. Apparently a stringer for the wire services and on-call guy for NYPD.

SCULLY: And you suspect this man Fellig? You think that Mrs. Stoller wasn't a suicide?

AGENT RITTER: This guy's into taking pictures, right? So I'm thinking, what if... what if he poisons this woman and gets his jollies by snapping a few of her dead body then winds up back in the same apartment an hour later, after Midtown North calls him over to do the job.

SCULLY: That's quite a theory.

AGENT RITTER: Yeah. Well, the thing of it is he might have done it on more than one occasion. Now, I sifted through probably 2,000 of his police photos. Now, these three have measurable solar shadows. And since we know the location in each case...

SCULLY: You can tell the time of day by the shadows.

AGENT RITTER: Right. And with it, these three are looking every bit as hinky.

SCULLY: (reading) You've got another suicide here a heart attack and a very obvious murder for which another man was convicted. There's no consistent MO.

AGENT RITTER: There's no consistent anything. I could sure use your help.

AD KERSH: (to RITTER) Agent, would you step outside, please.

AGENT RITTER: Sure.

(AGENT RITTER steps outside. KERSH closes the door and turns to SCULLY.)

AD KERSH: I would say he has a promising career ahead of him. So did you... at one time.

(SCULLY just looks at him with barely veiled hostility. )

AD KERSH: With your expertise in forensic pathology you would be a substantial asset to this investigation. I know it would provide more challenge to you than running background checks.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately.

AD KERSH: Agent Mulder's a lost cause. I'm taking the chance you're not. It's you and Ritter. Do not let me down.

(KERSH walks away. SCULLY sighs quietly and keeps her mouth tightly closed. )



SCENE 3
PACIFIC STREET, BROOKLYN

(A city bus stops and a BLUE COLLAR WORKER, 50's, gets off. FELLIG watches him. The BLUE COLLAR WORKER is seen in black and white. BLUE COLLAR WORKER goes into his apartment. He is sweating, in pain. He sees FELLIG watching him through the window. Suddenly, the BLUE COLLAR WORKER grabs his arm in pain and falls to the floor in the throes of a heart attack. FELLIG enters the apartment and begins taking pictures of the dying man.)



SCENE 4

(FBI bullpen. MULDER is looking at crime scene photos on his computer. SCULLY returns to her desk. MULDER doesn't look up.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Hmm?

(SCULLY sees what he is looking at.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: Being nosy. (looking up at her wistfully) Eating my heart out. They're sending you on an X-File.

SCULLY: (packing up her briefcase) It's not an X-File.

MULDER: That's not what I'm reading. I'm thinking murder by telekinesis. I'm thinking maybe a shamanistic death touch. I'm thinking about the Muslim superstition that to photograph someone is to steal their soul.

SCULLY: Thank you. All very helpful.

MULDER: So they're splitting us up, huh?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: No?

SCULLY: This is a one-time thing.

MULDER: Who told you that? Obviously, if you do a good job they're not going to stick you back here.

(They look at each other. SCULLY sees AGENT RITTER enter the room.)

MULDER: Right?

(SCULLY walks around MULDER and turns his monitor off as AGENT RITTER approaches them.)

AGENT RITTER: Agent Scully we're all set.

SCULLY: Peyton Ritter, this is Fox Mulder.

AGENT RITTER: It's a pleasure to meet you, Fox.

(MULDER doesn't rise from his chair as he looks intently at AGENT RITTER and shakes his hand.)

MULDER: (polite, but unenthusiastic) A pleasure to meet you,  Peyton.

SCULLY: We should get going.

AGENT RITTER: Off to New York.

(AGENT RITTER looks at MULDER again, then he and SCULLY leave. MULDER watches them go.)



SCENE 5
15TH STREET PRECINCT, MANHATTAN

(SCULLY and AGENT RITTER hand FELLIG's file to a DESK SARGEANT sitting at a desk.)

AGENT RITTER: Alfred Fellig-- what can you tell us about him?

DESK SARGEANT: What's to tell? He's one of about 10,000 people in town who have an official license to piss people off.

SCULLY: Well, he sometimes doubles as a crime scene photographer for your precinct.

DESK SARGEANT: Yeah, he comes in, snaps a picture. Keeps to himself.

SCULLY: There's not much in the way of personal information there.

DESK SARGEANT: There's not supposed to be. It's just a yearly renewal form.

SCULLY: Would you happen to know when the original background check was done?

(DESK SARGEANT shakes his head.)

(Later, SCULLY and AGENT RITTER are in a storage room going through old files.)

AGENT RITTER: Here he is again. Yearly renewal dating back to January, 1970 but still no original.

SCULLY: I think I've got it. 1964.

AGENT RITTER: Old-timer. Anything interesting?

SCULLY: Maybe.

(SCULLY looks curiously at the pictures of FELLIG on the renewal forms.)

AGENT RITTER: What you doing?

SCULLY: Take a look at this.

(SCULLY sorts through the papers. FELLIG's pictures on each of the renewal forms. He looks the same age, about sixty-five, on each. 1996, 1992, 1987, 1985, 1973, 1971, 1967, 1964)

SCULLY: 1996... '87...'73

AGENT RITTER: The guy's a regular Dick Clark. I don't know what to tell you, Dana. Other than the fact that this guy's always been a geezer, this is looking like a dead end.



SCENE 6
JEROME AVENUE, THE BRONX
2:18 AM

(A YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT UP SNEAKERS is running down a dark street pursued by another man.)

YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT UP SNEAKERS: Help! Help! Somebody call the police! Man, what do you want from me? Are you crazy?

(He rolls across a car's hood. The woman inside the car looks frightened and drives off quickly.)

YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT UP SNEAKERS: Help! Help me, please! Come on lady, please! Help me! Man, what do you want from me, man? No! No no no no!

(YOUNG MAN WITH LIGHT UP SNEAKERS screams as the other man grabs him and stabs him to death, then takes his sneakers and runs off when he hears the sound of a camera flashing up above him. FELLIG comes down a fire escape staircase and begins taking pictures of the dead man. He turns to see the murderer, MALCOLM WIGGINS standing beside him holding a knife. WIGGINS stabs FELLIG in the back several times, then runs off with the camera. FELLIG' fingers move, then weakly reaches back and pulls the knife out of his back and leaves it on the pavement in a pool of blood and walks off.)



SCENE 7

(Bronx crime scene. Next day. SCULLY and AGENT RITTER look at the bagged bloody knife.)

AGENT RITTER: The prints are Alfred Fellig's. Positive match right off his 1964 background check. I took the liberty of slipping them into the SAFIS database. First thing this morning, boom! Up they came.

SCULLY: You're thinking this was Fellig's work?

AGENT RITTER: It's a lock. The wound measurements match with the knife. I'd say he got pretty sloppy in his old age.

(SCULLY looks down at the large blood stain left by FELLIG's wounds.)

SCULLY: What's this?

AGENT RITTER: A whole lot of blood.

SCULLY: Yeah. I got that.

AGENT RITTER: It's pretty clear he took a second victim.

SCULLY: Where's the second body?

NY DETECTIVE: They found your boy.

AGENT RITTER: Fellig? Where?

NY DETECTIVE: Home watching TV. They're bringing him in now.

AGENT RITTER: Yes!

(SCULLY does not look convinced.)



SCENE 8

(Interrogation room at 15th St. Precinct. AGENT RITTER is geekily getting the recording equipment ready. SCULLY watches him as she paces. She is unimpressed.)

AGENT RITTER: Check. Check. January 4, 11:36 a.m. 15th precinct, Manhattan. Agents present: Dana Scully and Peyton Ritter. Initial interview with...

(AGENT RITTER looks up as FELLIG enters the room.)

AGENT RITTER: Alfred Fellig.

(FELLIG sits at the table. He seems to be moving a little stiffly as if he is in pain. AGENT RITTER places the microphone very close to FELLIG. FELLIG gives AGENT RITTER an odd look.)

FELLIG: (leaning forward to speak into the microphone uncomfortably) Hello.

AGENT RITTER: (tough guy) You're a photographer. I've seen, uh... seen some of your work. You, uh... specialize in some pretty dark subject matter. (showing some of FELLIG's pictures) You're, uh... you're around death a lot. It must... it must fascinate you. (FELLIG stares at him, waiting.) Am I... boring you, Mr. Fellig?

FELLIG: Ask me a question already.

AGENT RITTER: All right. I want to know how you always happen to be Johnny-on-the-spot every time somebody dies. You're always there to take the picture. How does that happen?

FELLIG: I have a... a nose for news.

SCULLY: (taking over) Mr. Fellig your fingerprints were found on a murder weapon at a crime scene. Could you give us a full accounting of your activities last night?

FELLIG: The Bronx. I was on the job. Saw some jibone stealing a kid's tennis shoes. He chased me. Ran off.

AGENT RITTER: He ran off? Some... unidentified murderer.

FELLIG: I guess I could identify him.

SCULLY: Your fingerprints were found on the knife. How did they get there?

(FELLIG murmurs uncomfortably.)

FELLIG: He left the knife behind. I guess I touched it... briefly.

SCULLY: Why would you do that? Were you injured Mr. Fellig? You seem to be in pain. Were you attacked? We found other blood at the crime scene and, when we have it tested I'm wondering if we're going to learn that it's yours.

FELLIG: I got cut some.

SCULLY: May we see?

(FELLIG stands and pulls his shirt off.)

SCULLY: May I help you?

(She pulls his bloodstained undershirt up showing several almost healed stab wounds on his upper back. AGENT RITTER opens the door and calls to one of the officers outside the door.)

AGENT RITTER: Hey. Hey, take Mr. Fellig to get his blood drawn. Photograph his back, too.

(The officers escort FELLIG out of the room.)

AGENT RITTER: (to SCULLY, confrontational) Hey, I'm confused. I thought we were trying to bust this guy not look for reasons to let him go.

SCULLY: (calmly) I thought we were looking for the truth.

(AGENT RITTER leaves the room.)

(Later, out in the main part of the station, SCULLY's cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone, disguising his voice Thurston Howellishly - very cute) Hi. My name is Fox Mulder. We used to sit next to each other at the FBI.

(They both smile. SCULLY sighs.)

MULDER: (on phone, normal voice) How's your X-File coming?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's not... (waits for AGENT RITTER to step away) We haven't made much headway. We arrested Alfred Fellig and we just released him.

MULDER: (on phone) You can't hold him? What about the stabbing?

SCULLY: (on phone) How do you know about that?

MULDER: I told you I'm nosy. Why are you letting him go?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, we were able to pull another set of prints off of the knife. They belong to a convicted murderer by the name of Malcolm Wiggins.

(MULDER types WIGGENS name into his computer and pulls up WIGGEN's criminal file.)

SCULLY: (on phone) That and the fact that Fellig's blood was found all over the crime scene tells me that his story checks out. At least that particular story, anyway.

MULDER: (on phone) But you still think Fellig's a murderer, huh?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know what to think. (looks up as FELLIG passes her) He's, uh... unusual.

MULDER: (on phone) As in he, uh, plugs up like a cork when you stab him?

(MULDER is looking at an image of FELLIG's stabbed back on his monitor.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, where are you getting this stuff?

MULDER: (on phone) Well, young man Ritter has been sending progress reports to Kersh. My computer may have inadvertently intercepted a few of those. He's got nice things to say about you, though... mostly. Why don't you let me do a little background check on Fellig for you.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder...

MULDER: (on phone) Come on. It's, you know... it's what I do now. I'm getting good at it.

(SCULLY sighs.)



SCENE 9
DEAN STREET, BROOKLYN
1:53 AM

(Stakeout. AGENT RITTER is sitting in a car watching FELLIG's apartment. SCULLY opens the passenger door and gets in.)

SCULLY: I'm parked around the block.

(Hands him her keys.)

AGENT RITTER: Fellig's asleep. I haven't seen him move in over four hours. (sarcastically) Have a lovely evening.

(AGENT RITTER gets out and leaves. SCULLY slides over to the driver's side and looks through some more crime scene photos. She glances up at one of FELLIG's darkened windows and hears then sees him taking pictures of her. She sighs.)

(A few minutes later, inside the building. SCULLY knocks at FELLIG's door.)

SCULLY: Mr. Fellig, open up, please!

(He lets her in. She holds out the photo of the dead woman next to the clock that AGENT RITTER first showed to her in KERSH's office.)

SCULLY: Explain this.

FELLIG: What?

SCULLY: You took that photo an hour before police arrived. You then purposely covered up that fact by photographing the scene again.

FELLIG: I don't think I remember that one.

SCULLY: You have, Mr. Fellig, a long and uncanny history of being the first person at the scene of a death. You also have a history of covering up that fact. Why?

FELLIG: Am I under arrest again?

SCULLY: Are you a murderer?

(He shakes his head slowly.)

SCULLY: Well, then explain yourself, sir. Because, I promise you until you do, you will not get a moment's peace.

(FELLIG sighs and picks up his camera bag.)

FELLIG: You want to take a ride with me? You come with me. I'll show you.



SCENE 10

(An hour later. SCULLY and FELLIG are driving in his car in a bad section of the city.)

SCULLY: It's been an hour. Are we going to drive around all night?

FELLIG: Yeah. This is it. This is what I do. Looking for the shot.

SCULLY: What shot?

FELLIG: The shot.

(He stops the car near a prostitute.)

FELLIG: Her. She's about to die.

SCULLY: What... what are you talking about?

FELLIG: It could happen in the next minute, in the next hour but it'll happen. It's as plain as day.

SCULLY: Look, Mr... Fellig, I don't know what you're planning but nobody here is going to die.

FELLIG: (getting his camera ready) I'm not planning anything. I'm just here to tell you what's going to happen.

SCULLY: (disbelieving) That  that woman right there is going to be murdered?

FELLIG: I didn't say "murdered." She's a smoker. She might die of lung cancer. The "how" is always a surprise. I... I just always know "when."

SCULLY: You want me to believe that?

(A man comes up to the HOOKER and begins hassling her.)

HOOKER: Get out of my face. Get off me!

(FELLIG turns on his camera. SCULLY gets out of the car and runs up to the HOOKER and the man who is arguing with her. She grabs the guy and pushes him to the ground and handcuffs him.)

SCULLY: FBI! Don't move!

HOOKER HASSLER: Damn, man! Where'd you come from?

SCULLY: Shut up! Get down! Back up!

HOOKER: (taunting) You're not such a big man now!

(SCULLY takes a gun from the man and looks over at FELLIG who is snapping pictures.)

HOOKER HASSLER: That gun ain't mine, Red.

(SCULLY backhands him in disgust. Not hard. An "I'd hit you a lot harder if I wouldn't get in trouble, you scumbag" slap.)

SCULLY: (to HOOKER) You all right?

HOOKER: I'm out of here.

(The HOOKER steps off the curb and is immediately hit and killed by a very large truck. SCULLY stares in shock at the dead woman under the truck as FELLIG drives off.)



SCENE 11

(NEXT MORNING. 8:00. Precinct station. AGENT RITTER angrily runs up to SCULLY who is processing the HOOKER HASSLER. SCULLY looks dirty and exhausted.)

AGENT RITTER: Dana, what the hell is going on?

SCULLY: Assault and possession of an unregistered handgun. I'll be with you in a minute.

AGENT RITTER: Why didn't you call me sooner?

SCULLY: I apologize.

AGENT RITTER: What, you blew off the surveillance?

(SCULLY keeps her mouth tightly closed and leads him into a private room.)

SCULLY: No offense, but the surveillance was blown before I got there.

AGENT RITTER: So, wait, wait-- you blew off the surveillance and what, took a little joyride with him?

SCULLY: I confronted Fellig. I questioned him further about his involvement in the deaths that he photographed. Is that okay with you?

AGENT RITTER: What did he say?

SCULLY: He said that he can tell when people are about to die. Look, if New York passes a Good Samaritan law we might be able to nail him on that but other than that, I doubt we're going to get him for murder.

AGENT RITTER: Wrong. Let me show you something.

(He leaves the room. She hesitates a moment then follows him into an observation room. Through the one way glass they see WIGGINS, the man who killed the KID WITH THE LIGHT UP SNEAKERS.)

AGENT RITTER: They picked up Mr. Wiggins last night. Now, he says that it was Fellig who killed that kid in the alley, not him. He said he just happened along and he had to fight for his life.

SCULLY: A convicted murderer half Fellig's age.

AGENT RITTER: He said he would have come in on his own but he said he was afraid we wouldn't have believed him.

SCULLY: He's right. Tell me, Ritter, did he have any help concocting that story?

AGENT RITTER: (defensive) Look, Fellig is a murderer. Whether or not he did this specific one, I don't care-- not if it buys me a few days in the box with him.

SCULLY: No judge is going to issue a warrant based on this.

AGENT RITTER: No, no, no. I know the judge. We'll have it by noon.

(SCULLY stares at him, then turns away.)

AGENT RITTER: You know, Kersh warned me about you.

SCULLY: Uh, he did?

AGENT RITTER: Yeah-- you and your partner. God knows his reputation precedes him so I guess I should have seen this coming. You muck up my case, and Kersh'll hear about it. Are we clear, Dana?

SCULLY: (coldly correcting him) Scully.

(Her cell phone rings.)

SCULLY: And we're done with this conversation.

(AGENT RITTER leaves. SCULLY answers her phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah?

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, uh, how's that X-File coming? And before you tell me that it's not an X-File...

SCULLY: (on phone) It is.

MULDER: (on phone) What happened?

SCULLY: (on phone) Alfred Fellig seems to know an awful lot about death.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, yeah? Well, that's not surprising, given that he's reached the ripe old age of 149.

SCULLY: (on phone) Excuse me?

MULDER: (on phone) I did a little low-tech background check on him. This stuff is so old that they don't even keep it on record on the computer but Alfred Fellig doesn't exist before 1964 but one Henry Strand does. He applied for a press pass from the Jersey City police in 1939 at the age of 53. His prints match Fellig's.

SCULLY: (on phone) But Mulder, that must be some kind of a mistake.

MULDER: (on phone) You think? Because this Henry Strand does not exist before 1939. However, one L.H. Rice is on record as having sat for the New York State civil service exam. Now, the records don't show whether he passed or not but his thumbprint? Fellig's. Want to know what L.H. Rice's birthday is? April 4, 1849. I'm not good at math, but I'm figuring that's a whole lot of candles on the cake.

SCULLY: (on phone) I have spent time with this man and-and he can't be more than 65 years old.

MULDER: (on phone) I-I think that's what he wants you to think. Now we're talking about a guy for whom the phrase "life in prison" carries some seriously weighty connotations. I think you should get to him before he vanishes and becomes someone else.



SCENE 12

(Day. FENNIG walks up to his apartment building and sighs as he passes SCULLY who turns and follows him up to his rooms. He places his camera bag down beside the police scanner.)

SCULLY: You are going to be arrested, Mr. Fellig, in two hours, charged with murder, and this time you won't be able to just change your name.

FELLIG: I showed you what I do last night. I just take the pictures.

SCULLY: What you showed me was a contemptible lack of compassion for another human being. You showed me that you profit off of people's deaths. Now, why shouldn't you go to prison?

FELLIG: What, do you want me to cry for them? You want me to make like I feel sorry for them? I don't. Lucky bastards. Every one of them.

SCULLY: "Lucky"?

FELLIG: I'm just there to get the shot. I don't take those people. He does.

SCULLY: Who's he?

(FELLIG goes behind a hanging blanket to a darkroom area. After a moment, SCULLY follows. FELLIG turns on a small light and shows her a picture of a dead girl with a blurred image above her.)

FELLIG: That's him. He's the one who takes them.

SCULLY: You're saying that this is a photograph of Death itself?

FELLIG: It's a glimpse, just a glimpse. It's closer than I've gotten in... well, I-I can't even count the years.

SCULLY: And this is the shot that you spoke of-- this is... what you try and get?

FELLIG: Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: Mr. Fellig, I know... that you know more about photography than I do but this is just a lens flare.

FELLIG: You're right. I do know more about photography than you do.

SCULLY: (sighs) Okay, I mean... mmm  for the sake of argument... why bother? I mean, why... why take a picture of Death?

FELLIG: So I can look into his face. So I can die. Pills don't work. Razors... (shows SCULLY his scarred wrists)  gas... bridges--- I can't tell you how many bridges I've jumped off of. All I get is wet. I got left behind. I don't want to be here anymore. I can't even remember a time when I did. And... this... this is all I know... to do.

SCULLY: You know I don't believe you.

FELLIG: Yes, you do. That's why you're here.

(SCULLY looks at the pictures again. One is very old. A dead woman from the 1920's. Signature at the bottom is Louis Brady Photography, 1928 or 1925.)

SCULLY: How is it you know when people are about to die?

FELLIG: Oh... You chase it long enough you pick it up.

SCULLY: Excuse me.

(SCULLY steps out into the hall. She is very tense and nervous. She dials her cell phone. MULDER picks up in the middle of the first ring.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone, very quietly) Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: (on phone) Hi.

SCULLY: (on phone) Those other two names that you said that Fellig went by-- Strand and Rice...?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. Henry Srand and L.H. rice.

SCULLY: (on phone) What about Louis Brady?

MULDER: (on phone) Uh, no, but there's a... there's, like, a big gap before 1939.

SCULLY: (on phone) Will you check it out for me?

MULDER: (on phone) Absolutely, yeah.

(FELLIG is in the doorway listening.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sticking here to make sure he doesn't bolt. Louis Brady, Mulder. Tell me what you find out.

(SCULLY hangs up and goes back into the darkroom.)

SCULLY: Mr. Fellig?

(FELLIG bumps into her.)

FELLIG: Oops. Excuse me. I have some film out. Hold on a second.

(He turns off her cell phone, which he just stole from her pocket, and places it on a shelf then turns the light back on.)



SCENE 13
FBI ARCHIVES
9:32 AM

(MULDER finds an old file on LOUIS BRADY. He is a murderer from the 1920's. Case # 50-0026. It was never closed.)

(In New York, AGENT RITTER is driving. His cell phone rings.)

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) Ritter.

(MULDER is at his desk quickly stuffing files into a case.)

MULDER: (on phone) Agent Ritter, it's Agent Mulder. Is Agent Scully there with you?

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) No, she's not. Nobody seems to able to find her.

MULDER: (on phone) Me neither, and D.C. Cellular says her phone is turned off.

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) What can I do for you, Agent?

MULDER: (on phone) Well, you can find her for me.

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) Listen, Agent Mulder, I'm on my way to arrest Alfred Fellig.

MULDER: (on phone) Good, because that's where I think she is. And you were right, Fellig is a murderer. Under the name of Louis Brady, he suffocated two patients in a Connecticut hospital. He says he meant to catch up with death. One year into his prison sentence he walked off a work detail. The manhunt never officially ceased.

(MULDER is leaving the office.)

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) When was this?

MULDER: (on phone) 1929.

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-- when?

MULDER: (on phone) Look, Ritter, don't sweat the math. It's him. Just get there and find Agent Scully.

AGENT RITTER: (on phone) All right. I'm on it.



SCENE 14

(FELLIG's darkroom. SCULLY watches as FELLIG works with some film.)

SCULLY: You know, most people want to live forever.

FELLIG: Most people are idiots. Which is one of the reasons I don't.

SCULLY: I think you're wrong. How can you have too much life? There's too much to learn, to experience.

FELLIG: 75 years... is enough. Take my word for it. You live forever, sooner or later you start to think about the big thing you're missing and that everybody else gets to find out about but you.

SCULLY: What about love?

FELLIG: What, does that last forever? 40 years ago I drove down to the city hall, down to the hall of records... record archives, whatever they call it. I wanted to look up my wife. It ... bothered me I couldn't remember her name. Love lasts... 75 years, if you're lucky. You don't want to be around when it's gone.

(Looks back at SCULLY, then quickly looks at her again in surprise. She is very tired, rolling her head as if to relieve a cramp in her neck. He sees her in black and white.)

FELLIG: Count your blessings.

(She looks up at him curiously.)

SCULLY: Why are you this way? I mean, if this is true give me something in the way of proof... help me find some science that I can hang this on.

(FELLIG is loading his camera.)

FELLIG: It has nothing to do with science. Someone took my place.

SCULLY: Took your place?

FELLIG: I don't know her name. I don't think I ever knew it. I had yellow fever way the hell back then when it killed half of New York. Washington Square Park was a common grave they had so many bodies. They'd bury them shallow. They wrapped them in-in yellow sheets and the yellow sheets would stick up through the mud. I was in a city-run contagion ward. I was out of my head with fever... out of my mind. And I saw him-- saw Death. Wish I had had a camera then. At first, I... just saw him out of the corner of my eye. Then he got bolder and he started flitting around the room and he'd take this person and he'd take that person and I never saw his face. I didn't want to see his face. I figured if I saw it, he'd take me, too.

SCULLY: But he didn't.

FELLIG: No. There was a nurse. She did the best she could. Back then, medical science was... they couldn't find their ass with both hands-- they still can't-- but she did the best she could. She sat with me, held my hand and I was on my deathbed and he came for me. I didn't look at him. I closed my eyes and turned my head. I didn't tell her not to look at him. I wanted her to look at him... I wanted her to look at him instead of me. And then I came to and the fever broke. They were carrying her out wrapped up in a yellow sheet. Since that time I realized you got to be careful what you wish for. I missed my chance. You're very lucky, you know that?

SCULLY: What do you mean? (no answer) Wait a minute. Say what's on your mind. You mean lucky like the others? You want me to believe that I'm about to die?

FELLIG: I just want to take the picture.

SCULLY: You took my picture. You took my picture last night. Is this why?

FELLIG: No, that was different.

SCULLY: I'm not going to die! (he turns on the camera) Turn that off.

FELLIG: No.

(SCULLY grabs his arm and they struggle as she pulls him to a table.)

SCULLY: Turn it off right now! Put it down!

FELLIG: There is nothing to be done for it.

(She handcuffs him to the table, looks at her watch, then frantically searches her pockets for her missing phone.)

SCULLY: You took my phone. Why?

FELLIG: Please, just give me a chance.

SCULLY: What don't you want me to know?

FELLIG: He's coming.

SCULLY: What don't you want me to know!?

FELLIG: He's coming and you should just make your peace.

SCULLY: Shut up!

(The front door crashes open.)

FELLIG: He's here.

(SCULLY shields her eyes as in slow motion the darkroom blanket is lifted and a figure steps in, gun raised. FELLIG raises his camera. The gun fires, shattering the camera lens and going on through FELLIG who falls to the floor. SCULLY stares straight ahead in shock at AGENT RITTER who is still holding the gun.)

AGENT RITTER: Agent?

(He sees the bullet wound in her stomach and runs to her as she slides to the floor leaving a smear of blood on the wall behind her.)

AGENT RITTER: (almost crying) Oh, god. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

(He presses his fingers against the wound, then against her neck to check her pulse. Blood is now everywhere. He dials his phone with shaking hands.)

AGENT RITTER: Come on... Come on... Dammit!

(AGENT RITTER runs out and yells down the hall leaving FELLIG and SCULLY alone.)

AGENT RITTER: We need some help in here!

(FELLIG takes off the shattered, bloody camera and picks up a smaller camera and gets ready to take a picture of SCULLY as she dies. He looks at her through the lens for a moment, then puts down the camera and takes her hand. Blood is now trickling from her mouth.)

FELLIG: (gentle) Do you see him? Do you see him? Don't look. Close your eyes.

(Still in black and white, SCULLY's eyes slowly drift close. He looks down at their clasped hands. His arm slowly fades into black and white, hers goes back to color. He looks up in awe at the bright light and everything fades away.)



SCENE 15
NYU MEDICAL CENTER
ONE WEEK LATER

(MULDER stands outside SCULLY's hospital room watching AGENT RITTER talk to her. AGENT RITTER comes out of the room.)

MULDER: (flatly) You're a lucky man.

(AGENT RITTER, having no response, walks away. MULDER enters SCULLY's room, smiles warmly, and takes her hand for a very intimate handhold. )

MULDER: Coroner's report came back on Fellig. Says he died of a single gunshot wound. That's all it said. (sits on the bed beside her) Well, I, uh... talked to your doctor and... he says you're doing great. You're making the fastest recovery he's ever seen.

SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder, I don't even know how I entertained the thought. People don't live forever.

MULDER: No, no, I-I... I think he would have. I-I just think that  that death only looks for you... once you seek its opposite.

(They look at each other for a long moment.)

[THE END]


                                      TWO FATHERS
      



PREVIOUSLY ON THE X-FILES

(Series of clips from previous seasons.)

(From Erlenmeyer Flask 1X23.)
DEEP THROAT: Evidence still exists.
SCULLY: Where?
DEEP THROAT: High-containment facility, Fort Marlene, Maryland.
SCULLY: What do they have there?
DEEP THROAT: The wellspring, Miss Scully-- the original tissue. (SCULLY lifts an alien fetus out of a cryogenic container.)

(From 731 3X10.)
(SCULLY standing in an empty car with the FIRST ELDER.)
SCULLY: Mulder, I'm standing in a train car just like the one on your alien autopsy video. Only I realize that I've been here before.
MULDER: What are you talking about Scully? (SCULLY opening her eyes in shock as a drill approaches her swollen belly.)
SCULLY: This is where they brought me. This is where they put the implant in my neck in one of these cars.

(From Erlenmeyer Flask - tanks with human alien hybrids being stored at the Zeus Storage warehouse.)
MULDER: They've been doing experiments since World War II-- tests on innocent civilians-- trying to make an alien/human hybrid.

(From Patient X/The Red and the Black 5X13/5X14 - CASSANDRA SPENDER in her wheelchair.)
CASSANDRA SPENDER: Cassandra Spender.
CASSANDRA SPENDER: I have been a multiple abductee for many years.
SCULLY: I learned about you from your son.
CASSANDRA SPENDER: Jeffrey.

(From The End 5X20. SPENDER and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN in the hall.)
SPENDER: Who are you?
CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm your father.

(From The Red and the Black 5X14.) (Shots of the Ruskin Dam attack and counter attack - lots of spaceships and burning bodies.)
KRYCEK: Hear this, Agent Mulder. There is a war raging. Unless you pull your head out of the sand, you and I and over five billion other people are going to go the way of the dinosaur.
CASSANDRA: Now is a time of war and stress among the alien nations. The different races, they're in upheaval. (Picture of the faceless ALIEN REBEL.)
ELDER: What the hell is he?
WELL MANICURED MAN: An alien rebel. He's a resistance fighter. (SCULLY watches faceless ALIEN REBEL approach her on the dam.) (ELDERS looking through the observation windows at DOCTOR working on MARITA COVARRUBIAS who is infected by the black oil.)
FIRST ELDER: The facial scars appear to be protection.
SECOND ELDER: Protection against what?
FIRST ELDER: Infection by the black oil.
CASSANDRA: They're going to be calling me. I can feel it. (From The Red and the Black - CASSANDRA is being levitated into the spaceship from Ruskin Dam as SCULLY and others watch, arms outstretched.)
SCULLY: (voiceover) No! Cassandra! They're taking her.

(Sound of machinery humming as DOCTORS work on an unconscious patient in a train car. The DOCTORS are all wearing gas masks. They make an incision across the patient's abdomen with a laser. Green fluid bubbles out, then the cut heals itself perfectly and instantly. The DOCTORS look at each other.)



SCENE 1
POTOMAC YARD
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

(Night. A sedan pulls up beside the train car as the DOCTORS come out of the train car. DR. EUGENE OPENSHAW gets out of the sedan.)

DOCTOR 1: (shaking his hand) Dr. Openshaw, congratulations. Your work-- it's completed. You should see her.

(DR OPENSHAW enters the car and tenderly takes the patient's hand.)

DOCTOR 1: 25 years... she must seem like an old friend.

DR OPENSHAW: Yes.

DOCTOR 1: We're, uh... going out to celebrate. If you'd like to come...

DR OPENSHAW: No. You go on ahead.

(DOCTOR 1 leaves. Outside, the other DOCTORS waiting in a van watch in horror as a faceless ALIEN REBEL grabs DOCTOR 1 and sets him on fire with a long metal object. The ALIEN REBEL then sets the occupants of the van on fire, then enters the train car. DR. OPENSHAW tries to back away, but is hit and also set on fire. The ALIEN REBEL looks down at the unconscious patient's unblemished abdomen then up at her face. It is CASSANDRA SPENDER.)

SCENE 2

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is sitting in a dimly lit room smoking a cigarette and talking to someone. We do not know who it is.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: This is the end. I never thought I'd hear myself say those words after all these years. You put your life into something... build it, protect it... The end is as unimaginable as your own death or the death of your children. I could never have scripted the events that led us to this. None of us could. All the brilliant men... the secret that we kept so well. It happened simply, like this. We had a perfect conspiracy with an alien race. Aliens who were coming to reclaim this planet and to destroy all human life. Our job was to secretly prepare the way for their invasion. To create for them a slave race of human/alien hybrids. They were good plans... right plans. Kept secret for over 50 years, ever since the crash at Roswell. Kept secret from men like Fox Mulder. Plans that would have worked had not a rebel alien race come to destroy them. Had not my own son chosen betrayal. Or chosen to betray more wisely.

(Camera pans over as if to show the other person, but instead fades into )



SCENE 3

(X-Files office. SPENDER is alone working. SKINNER knocks on the open door and enters.)

SPENDER: AD Skinner . I... I didn't hear the elevator. I was working here.

SKINNER: Working on what, Agent Spender?

(SPENDER clears his throat uncomfortably.)

SPENDER: Progress report on the X-Files.

SKINNER: Progress report to who?

SPENDER: Just to file.

SKINNER: I wasn't aware that you'd made any progress. In the months since your assignment, I've received but one memorandum. Are you planning to hit me all at once?

SPENDER: Uh, it's been slow going.

SKINNER: Truth is your purpose here is not to make any progress, isn't it? Truth is you have no interest in the X-Files. Beyond a certain... personal case. (looks down at open file on a young CASSANDRA SPENDER) Your mother's abduction.

SPENDER: Alleged abduction.

SKINNER: That's what I'm here about.



SCENE 4
POTOMAC YARD,
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

(Day. Later. SKINNER and SPENDER arrive at the train car from the teaser. SKINNER driving, their license - Virginia SBF-687. Lots of police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances. Burned bodies in bags. They enter the train car.)

SPENDER: What happened here?

SKINNER: No one knows yet. A group of people were burned alive here. Another man's on life support. Only your mother survived.

SPENDER: Where is she? Where is she?

SKINNER: They've got her outside.

(SPENDER quickly exits the train car and goes over to an ambulance where an EMT is giving oxygen to CASSANDRA SPENDER who is wrapped in a blanket.)

SPENDER: Mom? (sits beside her) Mom... It's me, Jeffrey. Mom, what happened to you? You've been gone so long I thought I'd never see you again.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Oh... Don't cry, honey.

SPENDER: Where have you been?

(She sighs.)

SPENDER: What did they do to you?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I need to talk to someone.

SPENDER: You can tell me.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I need to speak to Agent Mulder.

(SPENDER angrily gets out of the ambulance and follows SKINNER who overheard the conversation.)

SPENDER: I don't want him talking with her.

SKINNER: Why?

SPENDER: He's forbidden from the X-Files. He's to stay out of this.

SKINNER: She's asking for him.

SPENDER: She's my mother.

SKINNER: What are you afraid of, Agent Spender?

SPENDER: Of Agent Mulder filling her head with alien-abduction nonsense.

SKINNER: Are you afraid of the truth?

SPENDER: I want to know who did this to her and why. That's all I want.

SKINNER: Then why not use every resource available to you?

(Long pause.)

SPENDER: I'll send you a progress report.

(SPENDER walks away. SKINNER shakes his head and follows.)



SCENE 5

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN continues:)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: My son refused to believe that his mother had been abducted... though it had been going on for years. Even after I schemed to put him in charge of the X-Files where Fox Mulder had amassed so much evidence of our secret plans he still couldn't bring himself to accept the possibility of alien life. When he did... come to believe... when the facts became so glaring he turned... not to me, his father, but to the man I'd ruined. The man I'd chosen for him to replace.



SCENE 6

(Gym basketball court. Several men, including MULDER in a torn Knicks sweatshirt and sweatpants, are playing. MULDER makes a basket, then stops when he sees SCULLY enter the gym. She is wearing a shorter than usual business suit and trenchcoat.)

BASKETBALL PLAYER: (to MULDER) Hey, Milk, let's play ball.

(MULDER waits for SCULLY to get closer.)

BASKETBALL PLAYER: (irritated, to MULDER) Yo, Homestyle, cough up the rock.

SECOND BASKETBAL PLAYER: Got Nick over here?

THIRD BASKETBALL PLAYER: Yeah, yeah, I got Nick!

(MULDER tosses the ball over his shoulder to a teammate, then turns, recieves and casually shoots the ball, making the basket.)

MULDER: Game.

BASKETBALL PLAYER: (shaking his hand, not accepting the basket) Oh, no, no. Aw, it don't work like that.

(MULDER joins SCULLY at the side of the court.)

MULDER: Hey, Homegirl, word up.

SCULLY: Mulder it's my distinct impression that you just cheated. And that you're not coming in again today.

MULDER: Oh, Scully, I got game.

SCULLY: Yeah, you got so much game I'm wondering if you have any work left in you.

MULDER: No, I'm ready to J-O-B just not on some jagoff shoeshine tip.

SCULLY: (VERY small smile) No "jagoff shoeshine tip"?

MULDER: (smile) No background checkin' jagoff shoeshine tip.

SCULLY: Well, about your J-O-B, Mulder somebody's been trying very hard to reach you by phone. Somebody who wants you back at the FBI ASAP.

MULDER: (more serious) About what?

SCULLY: About an X-File.



SCENE 7
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(FBI bullpen. MULDER enters and finds SPENDER siting at MULDER's desk writing a note.)

MULDER: You looking for work, Agent Spender? 'Cause if you are, I got a whole pile in that middle drawer that I'd love to shove down someone's throat.

SPENDER: I was just writing you a note. I think you know why I'm here.

MULDER: They found your mother.

SPENDER: She wants to talk to you.

MULDER: I didn't hear the magic word.

SPENDER: Look, Agent Mulder I'm not going to get down on my knees here.

MULDER: Are you asking me, Agent Spender?

SPENDER: My mother's been gone for almost a year. She turns up in a train car where she's been operated on by a group of doctors who were burned alive. I just want the truth.

MULDER: The truth is out there, Agent Spender. Maybe you should find it for yourself.

(SPENDER walks away.)



SCENE 8
ST.MARK'S MEDICAL CENTER
ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA

(Hospital. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN enters a room where a badly burned DR OPENSHAW is lying in a hyperbaric chamber.)

DR. OPENSHAW: I expected you sooner.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I've been at the train yard. I'm trying to tidy things up.

DR. OPENSHAW: The overkill will be hard to divert attention from. But not as hard as from Cassandra. You have no idea, do you? Cassandra is a success.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (shocked) No, she can't be. Not now.

DR. OPENSHAW: I had prepared a syringe for her as agreed. But the rebels came.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (realizing) They saved her to expose us.

DR. OPENSHAW: She's the key to everything.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I won't let her out of our hands.

DR. OPENSHAW: They will run medical tests on her. It's only a matter of time. Cassandra must be terminated.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN looks off sadly.)

DR. OPENSHAW: They will come and question me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I know. I'm sorry.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN regretfully turns a knob that shuts off the oxygen to the chamber.)

DR. OPENSHAW: A man should never live long enough to see his children or his work destroyed.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN watches sadly as DR. OPENSHAW begins to have trouble breathing.)



SCENE 9
SILVER SPRINGS, MARYLAND

(Large mansion. Phone rings. The SECOND ELDER picks it up.)

SECOND ELDER: (on phone) Hello.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) Have you heard the news?

SECOND ELDER: (on phone, looking out the window) No.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) The rebels have struck.

SECOND ELDER: (on phone) Where?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) In Virginia. During one of our medical procedures. They killed the project doctors. Burned them.

SECOND ELDER: (on phone) All of them?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) Yes. Dr. Openshaw died in the hyperbaric chamber this evening.

SECOND ELDER: (on phone) My god.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) I've called an emergency meeting of the Syndicate. Only the future rides on our response.

SECOND ELDER: (on phone) I'll be on a plane.

(As he hangs up, the door bell rings. He opens the door. The man looks like DR. OPENSHAW.)

SECOND ELDER: (surprised) Dr. Openshaw?

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE DR. OPENSHAW: I've come to see you.

(The SECOND ELDER reaches out and scratches off MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE DR. OPENSHAW's face. Underneath, we see that it is actually a faceless ALIEN REBEL. The ALIEN REBEL grabs the SECOND ELDER by the throat as the camera pans up. We see flames rising up and hear screaming.)



SCENE 10
9:42 PM

(FBI bullpen. MULDER is sitting alone at his desk looking at computer images of the burned doctors from the train car. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Didn't expect to find you here.

MULDER: Where did you expect to find me?

SCULLY: I thought Agent Spender offered you an X-File assignment.

MULDER: It wasn't exactly an offer.

SCULLY: But isn't it just the opportunity you've been waiting for?

MULDER: It is an opportunity made to order for the powers that be.

SCULLY: You think it's a setup?

MULDER: This is exactly the kind of mistake they've been waiting for to come down on me full force.

SCULLY: But Agent Spender asked you.

MULDER: LIKE I SAID: not exactly.

(SCULLY notices what MULDER is looking at on the computer.)

SCULLY: We've seen this before. Bodies set aflame with no conclusive cause of combustion. Mulder...

MULDER: (looking at her, gently) I know.

SCULLY: I was with Cassandra Spender when she disappeared. You sat with me while I was under hypnosis when I spoke of just these sorts of details.

MULDER: I have no doubt that what Cassandra would tell us would expose more than just what happened to her.

SCULLY: I was taken to one of those train cars. I was tested, just like Cassandra. What if what she tells us could expose who did this to me? Mulder, Agent Spender doesn't have to know.

(MULDER looks at her, then considers it.)



SCENE 11

(Close up of something green and slimy. Camera pulls back to show that it is a bowl of lime Jello. Hospital room. CASSANDRA SPENDER is lying in bed eating said Jello. There is a woman with very short dark hair sitting with her. CASSANDRA looks up happily as SCULLY enters the room.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (swallowing a mouthful of Jello) Oh, my god. My god...

SCULLY: (embracing her) Cassandra.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Oh, Dana. Oh, my god.

SCULLY: It's so good to see you. (to DARK-HAIRED WOMAN) We're old friends. (to CASSANDRA) If I can get ahold of a wheelchair you want to go out for some fresh air?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (smiling) I don't need a wheelchair.

(CASSANDRA SPENDER gets out of bed and wiggles her toes on the floor. SCULLY stares in amazement. CASSANDRA SPENDER puts on a robe.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: But I am dying for a cigarette.

(They go out into the hall.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: It feels so good to walk. The doctors don't know what to say. I told them they wouldn't believe how it happened and they wouldn't. No, I'm not going to tell anybody this time because nobody believes you anyway. They want to hear it but they just think you're crazy. I guess I wouldn't believe it either except that it happened to me. No, I'm only going to tell somebody I can trust and who can do something about it. I was hoping when I saw you that Agent Mulder was going to be coming in the door behind you.

SCULLY: (smiling) I've got a surprise for you, Cassandra.

(Short time later, CASSANDRA enters a deserted lab/storage room, followed by SCULLY. MULDER sticks his head out from behind a shelf.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Shh. Shhh. Shhhh.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Oh, my god. (laughing) Oh, my god, I think I'm going to pee the floor.

MULDER: (nervous chuckle) Don't... don't do that.

(CASSANDRA SPENDER hugs MULDER warmly.)

MULDER: Look at you.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I told you about their power. You said you didn't believe it.

MULDER: Well, I had reasons for doubt when I met you, Cassandra.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You just doubted yourself. You were just doubting you'd ever see her again, weren't you? (MULDER looks up at SCULLY) Your sister.

SCULLY: Agent Mulder told me he believed he saw his sister... last year.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: That wasn't her, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Then where is she?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (lighting a cigarette) Out there, with them. The aliens.

SCULLY: Cassandra, you were found in a train car. You'd been operated on by doctors.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Yes, that's right.

SCULLY: And these are the doctors who cured you?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: No. The aliens cured me. The doctors were working with the aliens. That's what I wanted to tell you.

MULDER: What?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I told you that the aliens were here to do good and that I was being used as an oracle to spread the word. Only now I know what the aliens are here for and it isn't good.

MULDER: What are they here for?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: To wipe us off the planet. They're taking over the universe. They're infecting all other life-forms with a black substance called Purity. It's their life force. It's what they're made of.

MULDER: It's the virus-- the black oil.

SCULLY: But, Cassandra, the doctors weren't infected. They were burned.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: By another race of aliens. A rebel force that are mutilating their faces so that they won't be infected. This is what I couldn't tell my son Jeffrey.

SCULLY: Why couldn't you tell Jeffrey?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Because he doesn't believe me... even though his life is in danger by these same rebel aliens.

SCULLY: Spender's life's in danger?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: He's in with the men that have been working with the alien colonists for 50 years.

SCULLY: Working to do what?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Whatever it is they did to me... and to you, Dana.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MULDER: And you know who these men are?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (bitterly) Oh, sure. One of them's my ex-husband... Jeffrey's father.



SCENE 12

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN continues:)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: She'd begun to figure it out. Cassandra was beginning to realize her role in the greatest science project that man had ever known. She was the center of 50 years of work... The key to all of our plans... something even my colleagues didn't realize yet. I killed to keep them unknowing. I killed Dr. Openshaw so they wouldn't discover her. When it's Cassandra I should have killed... Cassandra who needed to die. I couldn't do it. With all the blood on my hands I couldn't kill the mother of my own son, a woman I never even loved. My colleagues never knew, focused as they were on the new threat-- the faceless alien rebels who'd burned our doctors alive... But my colleagues had become old men blind to the fact that the faceless rebels already held the upper hand... that they'd used their powers of disguise to infiltrate our group.



SCENE 13

(KRYCEK is addressing a room full of ELDERS and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN at the 46th Street location in New York City. He is showing slides of the burn victims.)

KRYCEK: Rebels have attacked and burned project facilities in New Mexico and the Southwest. The medical staff at our Arizona research facility's been slain. The train-car deaths cost us. Work on the human/alien hybrids will suffer the death of Dr. Openshaw.

FIRST ELDER: What do they want?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: To expose our enterprise-everything we've worked for.

THIRD ELDER: Well, some hotshot reporter's going to put the pieces together not to mention law enforcement.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We have our control on the federal agencies. Our new man at the FBI's very capable of diverting attention.

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER: (the guy we saw attacked and presumably killed by the ALIEN REBEL) Why not side with the rebels... join their alien resistance?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and the others stare at the SECOND ELDER.)

THIRD ELDER: It's an option.

KRYCEK: It's an option you declined long ago. Resistance was futile then. Why would it be any less so now? That's why you voted against it-- against men like Bill Mulder. Collaboration has allowed you to prepare... to stall colonization. I mean, how close are you to developing a human/alien hybrid? That alone ensures your survival.

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER: As slave laborers for the aliens.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and KRYCEK are very suspicious of the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER.)

KRYCEK: What about your vaccine? By collaborating, you bought yourself time to secretly develop a way to combat the aliens-- to fight the future.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Alex, enough! (looks at the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER thoughtfully) For 50 years, we've worked on this project-- 50 years since Roswell. We can't sacrifice ourselves for every new threat can we now?



SCENE 14

(MULDER and SCULLY sneak into the X-Files office. There are two nameplates on the door - Agent Jeffrey Spender and Agent Diana Fowley.)

SCULLY: Why risk getting caught here?

MULDER: They're going to be monitoring any work on our machines, in or out. We need access to files. And a name that'll raise flags.

(MULDER sits at the desk and turns on SPENDER's monitor. He runs a search for "Spender." Pictures of SPENDER, JEFFREY #10487and SPENDER, CASSANDRA #53934 come up.)

SCULLY: Maybe she was making it all up.

(MULDER shakes his head and types another command. He and SCULLY stare at the screen, then look at each other.)

MULDER: Smokey's got a name.

(Screen has picture of CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN with name Spender, C.G.B.. The reference number has No Information Available)

(SKINNER enters the office.)

SKINNER: (no nonsense) Get up from the desk. Get up, turn the computer off, grab whatever you took or printed out and give it to me. Let's go, Agents. They're coming.

(MULDER turns off the monitor.)

MULDER: Who?

SKINNER: Just go.

(As they quickly exit the office, SPENDER and some other agents come around the corner and confront them.)

SPENDER: Assistant Director. I'll assume you came down to apprehend these agents for unauthorized entry into my office. I'll make sure it's duly noted in the report of their dismissal.

(MULDER, SCULLY, and SKINNER can say nothing.)



SCENE 15

(SPENDER enters a dimly lit room where CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is smoking. He sits across from him in one of the leather chairs.)

SPENDER: I've done as you've asked. Mulder's been brought up to his superiors. He and his partner will be processed out of the FBI. I've done as you've asked. Now, I would like you to do for me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Do for you?

SPENDER: I think I'm entitled.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (surprised) To...?

SPENDER: The truth. The truth about my mother. She won't tell me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Because you won't believe her. Maybe you won't believe me. Maybe it's better not to know.

SPENDER: (standing, aggressive) Look, I need to know.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You need to show me that you're capable of handling the responsibility that comes with this knowledge.

SPENDER: Don't try me, old man.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN stands and slaps SPENDER hard across the face.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I gave you responsibility. I gave you a position. I gave you the things that you couldn't get yourself and you can't do the job!

SPENDER: Keeping Fox Mulder down is not a job. It's your dirty work!

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN slaps him hard again. SPENDER sits heavily.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (disgusted) You pale to Fox Mulder.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN walks out of the room.)



SCENE 16

(MULDER is shooting baskets alone at the gym court. SCULLY enters with a large box under her arm.)

SCULLY: I bet you're curious about C.G.B.

(MULDER keeps dribbling the ball.)

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: C.G.B. Spender-- his name. Cigarette-Smoking Man?

MULDER: What's it stand for?

(Shoots another basket.)

SCULLY: It's an alias, as far as I can figure. One of hundreds.

MULDER: Scully, you want to go one-on-one? We got nothing but time now that we're on administrative leave.

SCULLY: Aren't you curious what I've got in the box? Everything I could find on him.

MULDER: Nothing you could ever find would be accurate or credible.

(Shoots another basket.)

SCULLY: Maybe. But there's a picture you're going to want to see.

(MULDER looks at the picture of two young men. Clothing suggests early seventies. BAD hair.)

MULDER: That's C.G.B. Spender and my father.

SCULLY: It was taken in 1973. I traced the connection to something they worked on together for 25 years at the state department. A highly classified project. There's more, if you're ready. (Mulder nods) Cassandra Spender is, indeed, the mother of Agent Jeffery Spender and the ex-wife of C.G.B. Spender. But there's something that you're going to be surprised to find out. She was first abducted in 1973 on the night of November 27.

MULDER: That's the same night as my sister.

SCULLY: And there are other names connected to C.G.B. Spender and your father-- Ph.D.s., doctors... one a Nobel winner for early works in genetics. A Dr. Eugene Openshaw. (MULDER looks at picture.) He was the doctor that was found amongst the burn victims clinging to life beside Cassandra Spender. He died the next day in the hospital before he was questioned.

MULDER: The project is still going on.

SCULLY: Yeah.



SCENE 17

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN - aka C.G.B. SPENDER - continues:)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: If Mulder hadn't known of his father's history with me he was fueled now with names and dates and... certainties. I couldn't stop him any longer-- stop him from learning our sins. His father's and my own. The truth was out there fatally exposed. I had one last hope. One chance to preserve my legacy.



SCENE 18
DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON
7:10 PM

(Night. A dark car pulls up to where SPENDER is waiting on the corner. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN gets out and lights a cigarette.)

SPENDER: I waited, like you asked.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Good. I'm pleased. I was doubtful after our last meeting.

SPENDER: You have a new job for me?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Yes. I may have been unduly harsh. You deserve a fighting chance to prove your father wrong.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN hands SPENDER a cylindrical palm sized metal object - the alien ice pick, stiletto thing we first saw at end of season three and newsgroup named a "plam.")

SPENDER: What is it?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: A weapon.

(SPENDER is startled when the pick pops open after he pushes a button.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: A man has infiltrated the group that I work with. That's to kill him.

SPENDER: I don't understand.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: He's pretending to be a member of our group disguising himself as a man he's already killed. You will greet him as that man. Engage him in conversation. Then put that in the back of his neck. (holds open car door) You can do it, Jeffrey.

(SPENDER gets into the back seat of the car. KRYCEK, the driver, looks back at SPENDER distrustfully.)

KRYCEK: Watch where you point that.

(SPENDER retracts the pick and KRYCEK drives off. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN watches them go.)



SCENE 19

(Later. Car pulls up in front of the SECOND ELDER's mansion. SPENDER gets out and goes to the front door. He rings the bell and the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER comes to the door.)

SPENDER: Sir, my name is Jeffrey Spender. My father sent me to see you.

(MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER opens the door.)

SPENDER: I have a message from the group.

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER: They've changed their minds?

SPENDER: That's what I'm here about.

(The MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER steps away from the door. SPENDER enters and follows him into the living room.)

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER: Sit. Please. What have you to tell me?

SPENDER: (hiding something in his hand) Something I've been entrusted with. It's, uh, it's a name, actually-- one that will have meaning for you. (holds out a card)

(SPENDER drops the card as if by accident. The MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER gives him a look of disgust.)

SPENDER: I'm sorry.

(When the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER bends to retrieve it, SPENDER attacks with the plam, but the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE THE SECOND ELDER sees it and grabs SPENDERs arm easily deflecting the attack. SPENDER scratches at the face revealing the faceless ALIEN REBEL. Then the ALIEN REBEL stiffens and falls to the floor as KRYCEK stabs him in the back of the neck. SPENDER and KRYCEK stare at each other for a moment. Green fluid comes out of the ALIEN REBEL's neck.)



SCENE 20

(MULDER's apartment. MULDER opens the door for SKINNER to enter.)

MULDER: (quietly) Thanks for coming. I know it's late and you've been forbidden to have any contact with us.

(SKINNER enters the apartment and sees SCULLY getting up from the couch.)

SCULLY: Sir.

SKINNER: You say Cassandra Spender's life is in danger.

MULDER: Her life's been in danger going on 30 years... just not the way I think it is now.

SKINNER: In danger from who?

MULDER: Men who've conducted medical experiments in what began as a secret government project but what is now the most private global enterprise.

SKINNER: Enterprising to do what?

MULDER: To develop alien/human hybrids that will survive the viral apocalypse when aliens colonize the earth.

SKINNER: And I suppose you have proof of this?

MULDER: Files that Agent Scully dug up that make all the right connections to Dr. Eugene Openshaw to my sister, to my father... to Agent Spender's father.

SKINNER: Agent Spender's father?

MULDER: The Smoking Man.

SKINNER: (very surprised) What?!

SCULLY: It's true, sir. We have documented evidence.

SKINNER: Then you believe this, Agent Scully? This whole account?

MULDER: I know that Agent Scully has her doubts about the purposes of these experiments but I also know that she herself believes she was a test subject when she was abducted four years ago.

SKINNER: If Cassandra Spender's life was in danger, why not Scully's?

MULDER: Because I believe Cassandra Spender represents the final stages of these experiments-- that she may very well be the first successful alien/human hybrid.

SKINNER: What I don't understand is if she was a success, then why is her life threatened?

MULDER: Because... the men who created her would rather kill her than let her expose the enterprise.

SKINNER: She's under 24-hour guard.

MULDER: Assigned by Agent Spender?

(SKINNER thinks about that.)



SCENE 21

(At the ELDER's mansion SPENDER sits staring at the dead ALIEN as green fluid bubbles out of the back of the neck. He looks a bit sick. KRYCEK enters the room again.)

KRYCEK: You've never seen one before, have you?

(SPENDER shakes his head.)

KRYCEK: It's shocking at first. The acceptance of the idea, it's... It's something you thought only children and fools believed in. It undermines your beliefs-- in yourself, in the world... but then you come to understand.

SPENDER: Understand what?

KRYCEK: Well, the responsibility that this knowledge demands but the men who have it. The great sacrifice by great men like your father.

SPENDER: What sacrifice?

KRYCEK: The sacrifice of your mother.

SPENDER: What do you know about that?

KRYCEK: (surprised that SPENDER doesn't know) Just that she's... been the subject of an experiment for 25 years.

SPENDER: My father's involved in that? Is he?

KRYCEK: Your father directs the experiments.

SPENDER: So... I'm protecting her now so the experiments can continue?

KRYCEK: That's why he put you on the X-Files. That's why your father sent you here tonight. You're protecting the project, Jeff. Making the sacrifices. So that you can be a great man, too.

SPENDER: (getting up and leaving the room angrily) I'll be my own great man.



SCENE 22

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN - aka C.G.B. SPENDER - continues:)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I've trusted no one. Treachery is the inevitable result of all affairs. Every man believes he has his own good reason. I have little doubt of my son's disloyalty to me. Certainly he led Mulder and Scully to us. His mother must know by now her central role in the grand plan... That's she's as much alien as human. Do you wonder why I've chosen you? You've never betrayed me. Now I need someone to trust.

(We now see that he has been talking to AGENT DIANA FOWLEY.)

DIANA FOWLEY: (standing) I'll help you. It's not too late.

(As she leaves she touches his shoulder comfortingly.)



SCENE 23

(Hospital. There is no guard outside CASSANDRA SPENDER's hospital room. SKINNER enters. The bed is empty.)

SKINNER: Cassandra? (knocking at the bathroom door) Ms. Spender?

(The bathroom is also empty. SPENDER quickly enters the room.)

SPENDER: (seeing the empty room) Where's my mother?

SKINNER: You tell me, Agent Spender.

SPENDER: Where's the guard? I had a guard posted here.

SKINNER: I got here and she was gone.

SPENDER: He took her.

SKINNER: Who?

(SPENDER picks up the phone.)

SKINNER: Agent Spender?



SCENE 24

(MULDER's apartment. There is loud pounding on the front door. MULDER checks the peephole, looks back at SCULLY, then opens the door for a very frightened and breathless CASSANDRA SPENDER. MULDER closes the door behind her.)

MULDER: Cassandra?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I can't believe I found you.

SCULLY: How did you find us? Cassandra?

MULDER: How did you get here? How did you get out of your room?

SCULLY: How did you get your clothes?

(More knocking at the door.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Oh, Agent Scully, Agent Mulder you cannot let them find me.

(There is more loud pounding at the door. CASSANDRA SPENDER is terrified.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You cannot let them have me!

(CASSANDRA frantically grabs for MULDER's gun. They struggle.)

MULDER: Let go!

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You have got to kill me now!

(MULDER raises his hand to keep her back.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (desperate) If you don't kill me, it all starts. There won't be any stopping it. I am the one. You have to shoot me... Please!

(More knocking. MULDER unholsters his gun and raises it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?

MULDER: Stand away, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder, we have to protect her.

(The pounding at the door continues, getting louder. MULDER aims the gun at CASSANDRA SPENDER's head. Pounding now sounds like someone is breaking the door down.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder!

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                ONE SON


SCENE 1

MULDER: (voiceover) Two men, young, idealistic - the fine product of a generation hardened by world war. Two fathers whose paths would converge in a new battle - an invisible war between a silent enemy and a sleeping giant on a scale to dwarf all historical conflicts. A 50-years war, its killing fields lying in wait for the inevitable global holocaust.

(Photograph of A young Bill Mulder and Young Cigarette Smoking Man going up in flames, fading into flashback of large hanger at an Air Force base with younger Elders.)



SCENE 2
OCTOBER 13, 1973
10:56 PM

MULDER: (voiceover) Theirs was the dawn of Armageddon. And while the world was unaware, unwitting spectators to the hurly-burly of the decades-long struggle between heaven and earth there were those who prepared for the end; who measured the size and power of the enemy, and faced the choices: stand and fight, or bow to the will of a fearsome enemy. Or to surrender - to yield and collaborate. To save themselves and stay their enemy's hand. Men who believed that victory was the absence of defeat and survival the ultimate ideology... No matter what the sacrifice.

(A bright light appears at one end of the hanger. YOUNG CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN walks forward and lays down a folded American flag. Several small gray aliens approach.)

SCENE 3

(SCENES from last weeks episode, Two Fathers.)

(MULDER's apartment. MULDER is aiming his gun at CASSANDRA SPENDER. SCULLY is protesting loudly.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (desperate) Shoot me now, before it's too late!

SCULLY: Mulder?!

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Shoot!

(Several people in biohazard suits knock down the door and enter the apartment with hoses blasting out water (?) full force onto MULDER, SCULLY, and CASSANDRA.)

MULDER: Who are you!

CDC BIOSUIT MAN: Get down! Get down!

MULDER: Who are you?!

CDC BIOSUIT MAN: Down! Down! On the floor!

MULDER: What's going on?!

CDC BIOSUIT MAN: Get on the ground! Get on the ground!

MULDER: Who are you?!

CDC BIOSUIT MAN: Drop down! Drop! Drop!

(MULDER, SCULLY, and CASSANDRA all lie down on the floor as the hoses blast away at them. One of the CDC men pneumatic nails the door closed again.)

MULDER: Who are you?!

CDC BIOSUIT MAN: We're with the Centers for Disease Control. Remain calm and where you are for your own good. You're gonna be transported to a quarantine facility as soon as we can secure the environment.

SCULLY: Quarantine for what?

(DIANA FOWLEY enters the apartment, also wearing a biohazard suit.)

DIANA FOWLEY: A contagion. A contagion of unknown origin.



SCENE 4

(MULDER is standing naked under a showerhead, eyes closed. Camera pans around to show SCULLY in a stall next to him also standing quietly under the spray. A very low wall separates them. The water shuts off. MULDER turns to SCULLY and glances down at her briefly. They look at each other briefly. SCULLY turns away.)



SCENE 5

(Later. MULDER and SCULLY now dressed in medical scrubs but still very wet, are being checked for radioactivity by a pair of technicians.)

MULDER: There must be some kind of mistake. I signed up for the aroma therapy treatment.

SCULLY: Are we going to be able to talk to somebody who can tell us what this is all about?

(The radioactivity technicians leave.)

MULDER: Where the hell do you think we are?

SCULLY: I think, based on our travel time probably Fort Marlene. High risk decontamination and quarantine.

(A pair of doctors, male for MULDER, female for SCULLY, enter with kits and begin checking them out. DIANA FOWLEY, no longer in the biohazard suit, enters. SCULLY is very defensive throughout the scene.)

DIANA FOWLEY: I'm going to beg for your understanding and forgiveness and offer my humblest apologies for the way this went down. I didn't have a lot of choices. I owe your neighbors apologies as well. It's going to be some time before they get back in the building. We're still acting on a CDC Level - Four quarantine protocol.

SCULLY: Based on what information?

DIANA FOWLEY: That Cassandra Spender had contracted a highly contagious vectoring organism which produces a spontaneous cellular breakdown and combustion.

SCULLY: What?

DIANA FOWLEY: She was and remains the only surviving victim of an unspecified medical experiment that killed seven doctors with violent and unexplained burning.

MULDER: Who called you?

DIANA FOWLEY: Agent Spender.

SCULLY: Where's Cassandra?

DIANA FOWLEY: She's isolated... pending full and satisfactory medical evaluation.

SCULLY: Cassandra Spender was in a general hospital environment for days. We met with her, and yet on a whim you call in the third battalion. It's unjustified and highly suspicious as to motive.

MULDER: (patiently) Scully...

DIANA FOWLEY: What motives are you suspecting?

SCULLY: Your isolation of Cassandra.

DIANA FOWLEY: She's Patient Zero.

SCULLY: No one is sick or infected here. I mean, I assume that based on you walking in here dressed to the nines offering apologies masquerading as explanations.

MULDER: (firmly) Scully...

SCULLY: Mulder, I want to see Cassandra.

DIANA FOWLEY: I told you-- she's isolated.

SCULLY: Yes, and I am a medical doctor.

DIANA FOWLEY: Who is suspended indefinitely from her position at the FBI.

(SCULLY angrily pulls the blood pressure cuff from her arm and strides out of the room. MULDER and DIANA FOWLEY look at each other.)

(Later. Scully opens a locker and removes a plain gray dress, looks at it in disgust and puts it back in the locker as MULDER enters the locker room.)

SCULLY: They've burned our clothes.

MULDER: Hey... I heard gray is the new black.

SCULLY: Mulder, this stinks, and not just because I think that woman is a... well, I think you know what I think that woman is.

MULDER: (sarcastic) No. Actually, you hide your feelings very well.

SCULLY: Agent Spender calling the Centers for Disease Control? Mulder, this is just somebody using their position to stage a hi-tech government kidnapping.

MULDER: Apparently not. I just spoke to AD Skinner. He was at the hospital when Cassandra went missing. He heard Spender make the phone call to the CDC.

SCULLY: But she wasn't sick, Mulder. I mean, the remarkable thing is she was well.

MULDER: Well, then why did she come to my apartment demanding to be killed?

SCULLY: Because of everything that had been done to her-because of the tests, because of the medical experiments and the implant put in her neck - the same thing that was done to me. She just wants it to stop. And I'm telling you, they have taken her so that it can continue.

MULDER: No. It won't continue. It doesn't have to anymore. She knows what she is, Scully. That's why it's so dangerous for her to be alive. That's why she came to my apartment asking to be killed.

SCULLY: What is she?

MULDER: I think she's the one, Scully.



SCENE 6
EAST 40th STREET
NEW YORK CITY

(ELDER's conference room. KRYCEK is holding a medical file.)

KRYCEK: I recovered all the medical records form the hospital. The doctors who examined her before she escaped are telling us Cassandra Spender may be the culmination of 25 years of this group's finest efforts.

ELDER 3: That's why the rebels struck. They were trying to kill her.

KRYCEK: They killed everyone but her. They struck to keep her alive - keep us from killing her.

FIRST ELDER: What do the rebels want?

ELDER 3: To destroy us. They know that when the aliens learn of Cassandra colonization will begin.

ELDER 4: We must destroy Cassandra.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No. Let colonization begin. We must turn over Cassandra. Save ourselves.

ELDER 4: Bill Mulder was against this. He said this would be our tragic mistake.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Bill Mulder sacrificed his only daughter because he knew this day would arrive. What choice have we... If you want to see your families survive? If we want to see those we sacrificed returned to us?



SCENE 7
FORT MARLENE
DECONTAMINATION FACILITY
9:02 PM

(MULDER enters a deserted hallway. He is wearing a suit that is much too small for him and white socks. Very funny. He sees a nurse with very large white hair.)

MULDER: Hello? Hello? Oh, oh, Ma'am. These shoes? They're, they're two sizes too small. I was wondering if I could get a ...

(NURSE disappears.)

MULDER: (frustrated) A pair that fit, maybe?

(The nurse with big white hair disappears. Down the hall, MULDER sees a woman in a hospital gown duck out of view. He limps/runs after her. He enters a lab and looks around.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: (voice) I can't be seen with you.

MULDER: Marita?

(MARITA COVARRUBIAS shows herself. She looks bad - hair unkempt, face is lined and tired.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: If they catch me with you, they'll kill me this time.

MULDER: Who?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: The Smoking Man and... his group.

MULDER: What have they done to you?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Tests. Terrible, terrible tests.

MULDER: Like the tests on Cassandra Spender?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: No. No, Cassandra Spender is part of a program that's been going on for 25 years. A hybrid program.

MULDER: Then what were the tests on you?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: (bitter) I was infected with the alien virus - the black oil. My tests were on the vaccine against it... being developed in secret.

MULDER: In secret from the alien colonists. The hybrid program was in cooperation with the aliens but the conspirators never intended to succeed... to finish the work.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: They were buying time.

MULDER: To make a vaccine and build a weapon.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: But Cassandra Spender happened.

MULDER: She's the first, isn't she? She's the first successful alien/human hybrid.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: If she is... and the aliens learn a hybrid exists... colonization of the planet will begin. With no stopping it.



SCENE 8

(CASSANDRA SPENDER is tied to a medical gurney in a room with lots of medical equipment. SPENDER enters.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Jeffrey. Jeffrey. Jeffrey.

SPENDER: Mom... How are you feeling?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Uh, fine. Why are they keeping me here?

SPENDER: I'm keeping you here because you're safe here.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Safe from who?

SPENDER: You know who. From my father.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You can't keep me safe from him.

SPENDER: I can, Mom and I'm going to. There won't be any more tests on you.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You don't understand. You don't understand about me.

SPENDER: I do. I understand everything now.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You don't understand what will happen... what will happen to you if they find me out. You've got to let me go.

SPENDER: They'll just hurt you again, Mom.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Yes. You must let them. Or everyone dies. Everyone. Jeffrey... please... (SPENDER walks to the door.) Jeffrey... Jeffrey! Jeffrey...

(SPENDER leaves the room closing the door behind him.)



SCENE 9

(LONE GUNMAN office. There is a buzz at the door. FROHIKE goes to the door and unlocks all eight locks and opens the door for MULDER.)

MULDER: The latest in home security.

FROHIKE: Hey, you get through this, you got to come through me.

MULDER: I got a call from Scully. Said it was urgent.

(MULDER enters the office. All three GUNMEN are present and also SCULLY in a fetching black turtleneck ensemble.)

SCULLY: I'll ask you to hear me out before you launch any objection. Mulder, I asked them to pull up everything they could on Diana Fowley.

MULDER: (sigh) I don't have time for this.

SCULLY: Mulder, she's playing you for a fool.

MULDER: I know her, Scully. You don't.

SCULLY: You knew her. You don't anymore. I think we can prove that to you.

BYERS: She took a position in the FBI's foreign counter-terrorism unit in 1991. Seven years in Europe.

SCULLY: Yet there isn't a single piece of information available on her activities in the FBI files.

MULDER: (gives a sarcastic melodramatic gasp) I hope you've got something more than that to indict her with.

SCULLY: Travel records pulled from airline manifests that had been purged from her FBI records. Extensive movement throughout Western Europe. Almost weekly trips to and from Tunisia.

MULDER: For the purpose of what?

LANGLY: That's what we couldn't figure until we took a flyer and we found this.

FROHIKE: Mutual UFO network logs.

MULDER: MUFON.

SCULLY: Special Agent Diana Fowley of the FBI was visiting every European chapter collecting data on female abductees.

MULDER: So she's collecting data. Big deal.

SCULLY: Or hiding it.

MULDER: Scully, you're reaching.

SCULLY: Mulder, when I was abducted a chip was put in my neck. When I happened upon a MUFON group filled with women who'd had the same experience.

MULDER: So you're suggesting that Diana is monitoring these abductees? Monitoring these tests?

SCULLY: You tell me that Cassandra Spender is the critical test subject - the one who could prove everything. And yet, who is watching over her? Mulder, I can prove what you're saying or I can disprove it but not when Diana Fowley is keeping us from even seeing her. Mulder, ask yourself why there is no information whatsoever on Special Agent Diana Fowley. Why she would suddenly happen into your life when you are closer than ever to the truth. I mean, you... you ask me to trust no one and yet you trust her on simple faith.

MULDER: Because you've given me no reason here to do otherwise.

(Long Pause.)

SCULLY: Well, then I can't help you anymore.

MULDER: Scully, you're making this personal.

SCULLY: Because it is personal, Mulder. Because without the FBI personal interest is all that I have. And if you take that away then there is no reason for me to continue.

(MULDER watches her as she walks past him and out of the office.)



SCENE 10
THE WATERGATE APARTMENTS
7:04 PM

(MULDER gets out of the elevator and walks down the hall checking the door numbers. He is obviously unfamiliar with this hallway. He knocks at one of the doors.)

MULDER: Diana? Diana?

(There is no answer. MULDER gets out his lockpick kit and opens the door and enters the apartment. He turns on his flashlight and looks around the apartment. He finds a carton of cigarettes in one drawer and a lot of lingerie in two other drawers. He draws his gun as the door opens again and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN enters.)

MULDER: (aiming gun at CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN) Sorry. Nobody home. What are you doing here?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The door was open. I came in.

MULDER: Interesting company you keep.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No more interesting than your apparent ah... lingerie fetish.

(MULDER pushes CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN into a chair.)

MULDER: You feeling smug, C.G.B.? Yeah, I know your name. I know your game and I got nothing to lose.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I remember looking over a gun barrel at you once before, Agent Mulder. You couldn't pull the trigger then. What makes you think you can do it now?

(MULDER cocks the gun.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I came here looking for my son.

MULDER: Why?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Because he's betrayed me. He's chosen the wrong side. He's chosen to believe in your cause.

MULDER: That presumes my cause is wrong.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Oh, it is, Agent Mulder. It is.

MULDER: I'm not the one using innocent people - innocent women - as lab rats, trying to create a hybrid - an alien/human hybrid - so that I might save my own sorry ass when they finally come knocking...

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN smiles.)

MULDER: You find that funny?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Your father was against it, too, back in '73. The lone dissenter. But he came to his senses. And gave up your sister, Samantha.

MULDER: He didn't give up my sister. He was forced to. You made him do it.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Oh, you're wrong, Agent Mulder. I can't tell you how wrong you are. How wrong you've always been. We had agreed to cooperate with the alien colonists. By a majority vote taken by the group your father and I worked for. A group that came together at the State Department on a project dating back to 1947, to Roswell.

(Flashback to YOUNG BILL MULDER striding angrily up to ELDERS in the HANGER in 1973.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The vote changed that, though. It changed everything. We no longer cleaved to any government agency. We would now work privately, on our own project. That was your father'S objection: that we would ally ourselves with the alien colonists.

MULDER: Towards your own selfish end.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We forestalled an alien invasion.

MULDER: No, you only managed to postpone it.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We saved billions of lives.

MULDER: You put those lives on hold so you alone could survive.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No, Agent Mulder, so you could. That's exactly what your father failed to realize. He railed at us and our plans even as the process had begun. While the group had agreed to the most painful sacrifices. Sacrifices that... no one else would ever be asked to make.

(Flashback of group of children and YOUNG CASSANDRA walking through the hanger.)

MULDER: You gave them your children! You gave them your wife! You sent them away... like they were things.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We sent them away, Agent Mulder because it was the right thing to do.

MULDER: You sent them away to be tested on.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We sent them so they would come back to us.

(Flashback of doors of hanger opening into a bight light and children and YOUNG CASSANDRA walking into it. ELDERs watch sadly.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Don't you see? You can't think these choices were made lightly. They were the most painful decisions of our lives. Watching our families' faces...

MULDER: You're a liar. My sister wasn't taken from any hangar. She was abducted from our home right in front of me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Because your father was late to understand the necessity. That he, too, must give up one of his children to the alien colonists. The aliens insisted on it. It was the only way they would give us the one thing that we needed.

(Flashback of biosuited doctors handling the alien fetus from Erlenmeyer Flask.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The one thing without which we could not proceed. You see, the alien fetus would give us the alien genome... the DNA with which we could make a human hybrid. A new race, Agent Mulder. An alien/human hybrid who could survive the holocaust. So you could survive. And live to see your sister.

MULDER: (lowering the gun, walking away) And now you've succeeded?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Quite... in spite of ourselves. (taking out cigarette) The plan was to stall, to resist.

MULDER: To work secretly on a vaccine.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: That was your father's idea. To use the alien DNA to make a vaccine. To save everyone. The world. It's the reason I come along. But it's too late now. Colonization is going to begin. There will be a sequence of events. A state of emergency will be declared because of a massive outbreak of the alien virus delivered by bees. And the takeover will begin. I have only to hand over Cassandra.

MULDER: You can't do that.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Our hand's been forced by the faceless rebels. We've no choice.

MULDER: (standing) Stop it now or I will stop it.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No, Agent Mulder. You won't stop it. Not if you want to see your sister again.

MULDER: You stop it... or everyone dies.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No. (standing) I live. You live... to see your sister return. It's what your father realized. It's just what you'll realize as your father's son. Or die in vain with the rest of the world.

(MULDER looks down at a folded piece of paper in CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's hand.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Save her. Save yourself.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN hands MULDER the paper and walks out of the apartment. MULDER looks very troubled.)



SCENE 11
EAST 46th STREET
NEW YORK CITY

(SPENDER enters the ELDER's conference room. It is deserted except for KRYCEK.)

KRYCEK: You're looking for your father. He's gone. They've all gone.

SPENDER: But they're coming back.

KRYCEK: No. No, they left for good.

SPENDER: What do you mean?

KRYCEK: Well, they've abandoned these offices.

SPENDER: But they've been here for 50 years.

KRYCEK: I don't think you understand.

SPENDER: Where did they go?

KRYCEK: To West Virginia. They'll be transported by the colonists and begin medical preparations to receive the hybrid genes. Except for your father. He's gone to get your mother.

SPENDER: No one can get to her. I've got her secured away.

KRYCEK: Secured away? He's already had his doctors looking at her.

SPENDER: I've got her under guard.

KRYCEK: She's probably being prepared as we speak, Jeffrey.

(SPENDER leaves quickly.)



SCENE 12

(CASSANDRA's medical room. DOCTOR's enter with a hypodermic needle.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: What do you want now?

DOCTOR: Just lie back, Cassandra. We're just going to remove...

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You leave me alone. Leave me alone!

DOCTOR: Cassandra. Lie back. Relax. It'll be easier.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Damn it. Help! Leave me alone! Oh, no, you're not going to dope me! No, don't dope me!

DOCTOR: Roll over, please. Roll over.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: (screaming) No! No! Don't! Damn you! Bastards

(They inject her. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN enters the room.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: . ( sighs ) The biggest bastard of all.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I need a few minutes.

(DOCTORS exit.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: They never question it do they?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: What?

CASSANDRA SPENDER: Your power and authority... When you're really such a coward.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I... I came in hopes that we might speak of the future... not the past.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I'm at a disadvantage... since you've stolen the past from me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I won't defend myself. Except... except to say that... We're here now only because of what I've done. It's due to it.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I know it now. Only now. But for so many years, I didn't understand-- through all the abductions and the tests- that it was you.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I ordered them, yes. But it was never my intention to harm you.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: God.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It was to save you. And Jeffrey.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: You can never save our son. He knows what you've done to me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I saved you.

CASSANDRA SPENDER: There's only one way... to save him. Only one thing you must do.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (shaking his head on the verge of tears) I can't do it to you. I can't.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN exits the room quickly.)

CASSANDRA SPENDER: I must die or they all die. No! No.



SCENE 13

(MULDER is still sitting in DIANA FOWLEY's apartment as she enters and is startled.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Geez.

MULDER: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

DIANA FOWLEY: Fox, what are you doing?

MULDER: Nothing. Not a damn thing.

(DIANA FOWLEY turns on the light.)

MULDER: I came here looking for evidence.

DIANA FOWLEY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: Evidence that you'd lied to me-- that you had loyalties other than to me or to the X-Files.

DIANA FOWLEY: Nothing could be further from the truth, Fox. Nothing.

MULDER: I didn't find anything Diana. But something found me.

DIANA FOWLEY: What?

MULDER: Fate. Destiny. Whatever it's called when you... when you realize the choices you thought you had in life were already made.

DIANA FOWLEY: (kneeling in front of him) Fox, what happened here?

MULDER: You were being paid a visit by young Jeffrey Spender's father. The Cigarette-Smoking Man came looking for his son who has now taken up the futile cause that used to be mine-- against his father.

DIANA FOWLEY: Why futile?

MULDER: Because there's nothing to be done. And at some point, you just have to accept that the only way those you love are going to survive is if you give up.

(MULDER hands her the slip of paper from CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN - which reads EL RICO AIR FORCE BASE.)

MULDER: That's where it all begins. That's where we need to be if we want to survive it.

(DIANA FOWLEY leans in and kisses him on the lips gently. MULDER puts his arms around her shoulders, breaking the kiss, but still holding her.)



SCENE 14
FORT MARLENE
10:13 PM

(Medical facility. SPENDER enters the room where CASSANDRA SPENDER was kept. He looks at the empty bed in frustration. MARITA COVARRUBIAS enters.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Please help me. They're going to leave me here.

SPENDER: (nervous) Please stay away from me. I can't help you.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: They're packing everything up. They aren't coming back here. I know you. I can help you.

SPENDER: You can't help me.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: I know where they're taking her. I know how they're taking her. You've got to trust me, Jeffrey.



SCENE 15
ROOM 36
CRYOLAB
PURITY CONTROL

(DOCTOR puts on protective gear and enters cryolab. He pulls the alien fetus out of liquid nitrogen and puts it into another container. The White haired nurse enters the room.

DOCTOR: Shut the door. This is a highly sensitive area. Get back. You're at high risk of contamination. Leave the room.

(The "NURSE" grabs the DOCTOR by the throat and strangles him. DOCTOR scrapes off the nurses face showing that it is actually a faceless rebel. A few moments later "he" leaves the lab.)



SCENE 16

(MULDER comes out of the apartment with DIANA FOWLEY.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully. It's me.

SCULLY: (on phone,driving) Mulder, I was just dialing you. Where are you?

MULDER: (on phone) I'm with Diana.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm coming to get you.

MULDER: (on phone) No. We're coming to get you. You're coming with us.

SCULLY: (on phone) No, Mulder, listen to me. I'm going to take you to Cassandra.

MULDER: (on phone) Cassandra's gone, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) I know, but I know where she's gone to, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, it's no use.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I'm going there whether you're coming or not.

MULDER: (on phone) Going where?

SCULLY: (on phone) To the Potomac yards. They're transporting her by train car.

MULDER: (on phone) Who gave you this information?

SCULLY: (on phone) Agent Spender called me.

MULDER: All right. I'm going to send you on ahead.

DIANA FOWLEY: What is it? What did she say?

MULDER: This may be our last chance to stop them.



SCENE 17

(Train yards. Sound of bell clanging . SCULLY is driving car with MULDER alongside the moving train.)

MULDER: Turn around. Turn around, Scully.

(SCULLY U-turns. Train whistle blowing as train accelerates. SCULLY pulls car in front of train. MULDER and SCULLY get out and fire a total of about 14 shots at the train before jumping out of the way as the train crashes into their car.)

DOCTOR: What the hell is that?

(We see the "doctor" that is actually a rebel, on the train.)

(Commercial 3.)



SCENE 18
EL RICO AIR FORCE BASE
11:21 PM

(The ELDERS and their families have gathered.)



SCENE 19

(Train yard. A car pulls up in front of MULDER and SCULLY. SKINNER is driving.)

MULDER: I think this is him.

SKINNER: You going to tell me what the hell is going on?

MULDER: Our lives are in danger. We don't have much time.

SKINNER: Why couldn't you tell me that over the phone?

MULDER: If somebody overheard us, it might create mass panic.

SKINNER: Mass panic over what?

MULDER: El Rico Air Base.

(MULDER gets in the back seat, SCULLY up front.)



SCENE 20

(EL RICO AIR BASE. Medical jeep pulls up. Doctors and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN get out with CASSANDRA still on a gurney.)

FIRST ELDER: We waited to send our communication.

ELDER 3: We were worried something had happened.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Shots were fired at us.

ELDER 3: By who?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I don't know.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN looks around.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We have people missing. Where's Alex Krycek?



SCENE 21

((KRYCEK is walking through halls of FORT MARLENE. He goes into PURITY CONTROL cryolab in a biosuit. He finds the dead DOCTOR and the now missing alien fetus. He is very upset.)



SCENE 22

(Later, KRYCEK is walking purposefully down the hall. SPENDER calls to him from a doorway.)

SPENDER: Krycek! I'm trying to get out of here.

KRYCEK: What are you talking about?

SPENDER: We can't get past security. They won't recognize my authority to

remove a patient.

(KRYCEK looks in the room and is shocked to see MARITA COVARRUBIAS.)

SPENDER: My father did this to her. She wants to tell her story.

KRYCEK: You sorry son of a bitch. You don't get it, do you? It's all going to hell. The rebels are going to win. They took it.

SPENDER: They took what?

(KRYCEK and MARITA look at each other, the KRYCEK leaves.)



SCENE 23

(EL RICO AIR FORCE BASE , ELDERs and their families are gathered. A car pulls up and DIANA FOWLEY and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN get out. Bright light appears at the end of the hanger. Figures begin approaching)

ELDER 3: Who sent the communications?

ELDER 4: No one.

FIRSST ELDER: This isn't supposed to be.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and DIANA FOWLEY run back to their car and drive off.)

ELDER 3: What is this?

(DOCTOR morphs into faceless alien. FACELESS ALIENS approach with fire sticks. ELDERS surround their families, trying to protect them.)

FIRST ELDER: Get back. Back! Back! Back! Back! Get back. Back. Back.

(Fade into sounds of screaming.)



SCENE 24

(AD KERSH's office. SKINNER, SPENDER, MULDER, and SCULLY are present. AD KERSH is looking at photos of the burned bodies from the Air Force base. He is very upset by them.)

AD KERSH: The way these people died... the loss of life here - it is beyond words. I can't imagine how it must be for you - losing your mother.

SPENDER: Yes, sir. But that's not why I asked for this meeting.

AD KERSH: Why did you ask for it?

SPENDER: Because I'm responsible for the deaths of those people at the Air Base hangar in no small way. I certainly didn't prevent them.

AD KERSH: I can assume then you can explain how they died? Because I have yet to hear any explanation.

SPENDER: Agent Mulder can explain it. I think Agent Scully, to an extent. They might have even prevented what you see in those photos.

AD KERSH: Agents Scully and Mulder have been suspended by the FBI.

SPENDER: Also my doing... and my mistake.

AD KERSH: I would ask...

SPENDER: I'd ask, sir - before you tell me that it's not my business - that you do everything you can to get them back on the X-Files. Far worse can happen... and it will.

AD KERSH: Where are you going?

SPENDER: To pack up my office.

AD KERSH: Agent Spender...

(SPENDER leaves the office.)

AD KERSH: (to MULDER, angrily) You have answers now? Why didn't I hear about those answers before?

MULDER: I've had answers for years.

AD KERSH: Then why didn't we hear about them?

MULDER: No one would ever listen.

AD KERSH: Who burned those people?

MULDER: They burned themselves. With a choice made long ago by a conspiracy of men who thought they could sleep with the enemy. Only to awaken another enemy.

AD KERSH: What the hell does that mean?

MULDER: It means the future is here, and all bets are off.

AD KERSH: Agent Scully, make some sense.

SCULLY: Sir, I wouldn't bet against him.



SCENE 25

(X-Files office. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is looking at picture of BILL MULDER and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. SPENDER enters.)

SPENDER: Get out of here.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: This picture you have - I haven't seen it since you were born. You probably don't even know who the other man is.

SPENDER: I don't care. Get out.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It's Bill Mulder, Fox Mulder's father. Isn't that something. He was a good man... a friend of mine... who betrayed me in the end.

SPENDER: I know more than enough about your past... enough to hate you.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Your mother was right. I came here hoping otherwise. (takes out gun) Hoping that my son... might live to honor me... ...like Bill Mulder's son.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN reluctantly aims gun and fires at SPENDER, then tucks gun back into his coat and leaves the office.)

[THE END]

                                       AGUA MALA



SCENE 1
GOODLAND, FLORIDA

(Waterfront house. Sky is dark. Early evening? Hard to tell since a hurricane is wreaking havoc on the shore. Inside the SHIPLEY's house, SARA SHIPLEY is frantically hammering boards over the doors and windows. Rain is pouring into the house. She has to yell to be heard over the storm as she calls to her son.)

SARA: Evan! Evan! Where are you?! Evan! Evan! Evan! Evan, hurry! Please!

(EVAN SHIPLEY, teenage boy, is trying to get water to come out of the kitchen tap. He is wearing a blue football jersey with his last name on it.)

EVAN: Nothing's coming out!

RADIO ANNOUNCER: ...with winds in excess of 100 miles per hour. Currently, the storm system is stalled 25 miles off the Florida coast. Again, the hour's lead story Tropical Storm Leroy has been upgraded to Hurricane Leroy. The entire Gulf Coast is bracing for its arrival.

(SARA runs over to help EVAN. Still, no water will come out of the tap.)

SARA: Damn it!

(SARA turns and sees water bubbling up out of the floor drain. The water looks thick and slimy.)

EVAN: Mom, is Dad going to be all right? Mom? What about Dad? Mom, what about Dad?!

SARA: We need water. Right now!

(She opens washing machine. It is full of water and clothes.)

EVAN: Mom!

SARA: (on verge of panic) Just do as I say, Evan! Come help me! Help me pull the washer out,.please, Evan just help me.

(EVAN looks behind the washer and sees a very wet miserable looking cat.)

EVAN: Mom, Reggie's back here!

SARA: Evan, let the cat alone! All right, unplug the machine, Honey. Unplug the machine. Pull that hose out of the wall. I'm going to pull. I need you to get behind the machine and push. I'm going to pull, you push. (EVAN squeezes himself behind the machine and braces his feet on the wall.) We're going to tip the washing machine over. We need to dump the water out. All right, honey, push! Push! Push, Evan!

(The back feet of the machine come off the floor, but they are not strong enough and it falls back to the floor.)

SARA: (desperate) Push, Evan! Are you pushing?

(More slimy water bubbles out of the drain.)

SARA: Evan! Evan, answer me! (worried, looking over the washer) Evan...

(EVAN is gripping the edge of the washer. Suddenly, his hand is jerked out of view.)

EVAN: Mom!

SARA: Evan! Evan!

(SARA climbs on top of the washer and looks down behind the machine. Several long, white squid-like tentacles are wrapped around EVAN's neck.)

SARA: (screaming and tugging at the tentacles) Let him go! Let go of him! Let go of him! Let him go!

(More slime and another tentacle come out of the drain.)

SARA: Let him g...

(Her words turn into bloodcurdling screams as she is jerked off the machine to the floor.)

SCENE 2

(MULDER's apartment. Camera pans around the apartment as the phone rings and the answering machine comes on. No one is home. We see the guitar player sculpture on his desk for the first time. Mulder might also want to consider purchasing a new answering machine.)

MULDER'S ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, this is Fox Mulder. You can leave me a message after the beep.

(Closed captioning also had this added: "If this is you, Scully, call me on my cell phone. I think you know the number."

ARTHUR DALES: (voice on machine) Agent Mulder, this is Arthur Dales calling from Florida. [Closed captioning also had: Took me three operators to get this crappy connection.] I don't know if you're watching the news but we're in for a hell of a blow in the next 12 to 24. I been through hurricanes, Mulder, been through the alphabet. But I just got a distress call from my neighbor down the road to set my teeth on edge. You don't have much time to get to the airport but if you're the X-Files man you say you are you better get your butt in gear.



SCENE 3
TERRA NUEVA TRAILER PARK
GOODLAND, FLORIDA

(ARTHUR DALES house. Trailer home. He fills a glass with water from a leaky faucet and goes to sit in front of his shortwave radio/scanner. Heavy rain outside.)

RADIO ANNOUNCER: ... a spokesman for the Collier County Emergency Response Team is advising residents to stay off the roads and either wait out the storm in a secure location or proceed to a county emergency shelter. Hurricane Leroy remains some 20 miles off the Gulf Coast sending high winds and up to six inches of rain onto coastal communities. As of yet, it has unleashed none of its potential heavy destruction on a very nervous populace from Naples to Fort Myers. The National Weather Service predicts Hurricane Leroy will make landfall in the next three to four hours, and we'll be coming back to you in a few minutes...

(ARTHUR DALES, early seventies, picks up the glass, then sets it down again, this time with ice and bourbon added. He scans to another channel.)

MAN 1: (on radio) We got no sign of anything amiss here at that residence out on the spit. Place is all boarded up tight, over.

MAN 2: (on radio) Roger that. Maybe the occupants have evacuated, over.

MAN 1: (on radio) Well, that would be the Shipleys, but a neighbor called and says they couldn't have gone too far without their only vehicle which is still in the carport out here, over.

MAN 2: (on radio) Well. That sounds like a real mystery, don't it?

ARTHUR DALES: (gruffly) It sure does, you dumb fathead.

(ARTHUR DALES hears a knock at the door. He is wearing a bathrobe and walks with a cane. He goes over to the door and opens it. open. The wind grabs it and slams it all the way open. MULDER and SCULLY are standing at the door wearing black raincoats.)

ARTHUR DALES: (yelling over the storm) Well, it couldn't be that all the planes out were fully loaded, huh?

MULDER: Mr. Dales, there's a reason that people don't head out into hurricanes.

ARTHUR DALES: (dismissively) Yeah. The hurricane's 20 miles offshore.

(MULDER glances back at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Mr. Dales, can we come in?

ARTHUR DALES: Come in.

(MULDER and SCULLY enter. They are drenched.)

ARTHUR DALES: Who's this?

SCULLY: Special Agent Dana Scully.

ARTHUR DALES: Scully?

MULDER: She's my partner.

(MULDER and SCULLY reach to take off their wet raincoats.)

ARTHUR DALES: Uh-huh. Well, don't get too comfortable. You're going to want to get right back out there.

SCULLY: Out where?

ARTHUR DALES: (to MULDER) Did you tell her what I told you?

MULDER: (crossing to stand beside DALES) Yes, but she's... she's not the type that's easily persuaded.

ARTHUR DALES: (smiles) Is that so?

SCULLY: (drying her hands on a paper towel) What he means is I don't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it's the Lord's gospel truth.

ARTHUR DALES: (to MULDER) Why did you bring her here?

MULDER: Well, she knows your reputation your early work on the X-Files and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things.

(SCULLY sees several empty liquor bottle in the garbage can.)

SCULLY: Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.

ARTHUR DALES: It's a good thing I have a reputation. Otherwise, how could it be impugned?

SCULLY: Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm. I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends.

ARTHUR DALES: The Shipleys-- a young couple with a son. Yeah, he lives out on the end of the sandspit. Sara called me in a panic. She said that something in the house had grabbed Jack, her husband.

SCULLY: In the bathroom, you said?

ARTHUR DALES: Yeah... of all places.

MULDER: It was your description that caused Agent Scully's... (smiles)  dubiousness.

ARTHUR DALES: No. Not my description. No. That was  that was . Sara's. She said... that it had tentacles wrapped around her husband's neck and choking him.

SCULLY: (skeptical) And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?

ARTHUR DALES: No. Both she and Jack are marine biologists. Or at least they were. I fear the worst.

MULDER: She's missing, too?

ARTHUR DALES: Uh-huh. Yeah. I got on the horn to the local constabulary but they're about as... helpful as a fart in a windstorm.

(MULDER is amused by the joke. He looks at SCULLY who is NOT amused by the joke.)

ARTHUR DALES: I would have gone out there myself but for my bad hip.

MULDER: It's not a night that anybody should be out in.

ARTHUR DALES: Well, I don't see that there's a choice.

(MULDER crosses to the door pulling up his hood.)

ARTHUR DALES: If anyone wants to get to the bottom of all this...

(SCULLY looks at him for a moment then also crosses to the door.)

SCULLY: What is it that brought you out here in the first place, Mr. Dales?

ARTHUR DALES: I came down for the weather. Don't sneer at the mysteries of the deep, young lady. The bottom of the ocean is as deep and dark as the imagination.

(MULDER places his hand on SCULLY's shoulder and shares a look with her, then leads her to the door. He opens the door and they go back out into the storm. MULDER closes the door behind them.)



SCENE 4
SHIPLEY RESIDENCE
9:14 PM

(Camera pans around deserted room showing crooked pictures of SARA SHIPLEY and her son and husband. MULDER breaks open the boarded up door. He and SCULLY enter carrying big flashlights.)

MULDER: Hello! Mrs. Shipley!

SCULLY: At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane.

MULDER: Got the place all boarded up. It's from the inside. It makes you wonder how they got out.

SCULLY: Hello! Mrs. Shipley!

(MULDER walks into the laundry room area having switched to a much smaller flashlight for some reason. He sees clothes on the floor and sees slime on a pipe. Of course, he sticks his fingers in it and gets some stuck to his hand. SCULLY enters as he tries to shake the slime off his hand.

SCULLY: Mulder... No sign of life.

MULDER: There's something on the drainpipe. I can't get it off.

(They look up quickly as the washing machine lid rises then falls again. They slowly walk toward it. SCULLY holds big flashlight as MULDER picks up a mop.)

MULDER: I don't know if I'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here.

(MULDER cautiously approaches the washing machine and uses the stick to barely lift the lid. They both yelp as REGGIE THE CAT, very wet, leaps out of the machine and runs outside into the rain.)

SCULLY: How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine?

MULDER: Maybe he was taking a dip... After he finished boarding up the windows.

(They walk farther into the house and find a picture of the family and an interior door completely boarded up.)

SCULLY: Where do you think this leads to?

MULDER: Must be the bathroom. Dales told me the wife told him that the... the husband was grabbed from the bathroom.

(MULDER puts his flashlight in his mouth and begins pulling boards off the door.)

SCULLY: (calling into the bathroom) Mr. Shipley!

MULDER: (flashlight in his mouth) Can you give me a hand with this?

(SCULLY puts her small flashlight in her mouth and begins helping MULDER. They are startled by DEPUTY GREER, a heavyset small town sheriff's deputy, who enters holding a gun on them. MULDER and SCULLY turn, hands in the air, flashlights still in their mouths. Very funny.)

DEPUTY GREER: Well, howdy do! Yeah. Right like that. Keep your hands up there where I can see them. Now who are you and what the hell do you think you're doing?

(MULDER mumbles around the flashlight in his mouth.)

DEPUTY GREER: Yeah. Nice and slow.

(MULDER and SCULLY both slowly remove the flashlights from their mouths, keeping their hands in the air.)

MULDER: You can put the gun down. We're FBI.

DEPUTY GREER: Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.

SCULLY: Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder. I can show you my ba - ...

DEPUTY GREER: (into his radio) This is Deputy Greer. I'm out at the Sandspit Road. I've got two suspects over at the Shipley residence. B and E, possible foul play, over.

MULDER: We're out here like you. We're...

DISPATCHER: (voice on radio) Copy that, 54. Be advised we have no backup units available.

DEPUTY GREER: (into radio) Roger that. (to MULDER and SCULLY) I'm putting you under arrest.

MULDER: We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.

DEPUTY GREER: You have the right to remain silent.

MULDER: Arthur Dales called us.

DEPUTY GREER: Anything you say can and will be used against you. You have a right to a lawyer. If you don't have one...

MULDER: Does that name mean anything to you? Arthur Dales?

DEPUTY GREER: (smiling) I know Dales.

MULDER: All right.

DEPUTY GREER: (laughing) I got a call from him, too. Drunk as a skunk. What's new?

SCULLY: Well, what else would we be doing out here on a night like this?

DEPUTY GREER: You could be looters. For all I know, you could be part of the Manson family.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. With a meow, REGGIE THE WET CAT runs through the house and crawls back out a window. Surprised, DEPUTY GREER looks away from MULDER and SCULLY. MULDER reaches out and grabs DEPUTY GREER's gun and holds it on him. DEPUTY GREER slowly raises his hands.)

DEPUTY GREER: Oh, no. You're going to kill me.

MULDER: No, I'm not, but I'd like to.

SCULLY: (holding up her badge) Deputy...

DEPUTY GREER: The FBI? For real?

(SCULLY smiles tightly and nods.)

SCULLY: I'll be in the car.

(With a look at MULDER, she leaves the house.)

DEPUTY GREER: I got to at least make out a report.

MULDER: No, no, no. Not before you help me finish what you interrupted.

DEPUTY GREER: Yes, sir. May I have my gun, please?

(MULDER pauses, then smiles and hands the gun back.)

DEPUTY GREER: Thank you.

MULDER: Come on.

(DEPUTY GREER and MULDER begin taking boards off the door.).

(Later, SCULLY is outside in the car on her cell phone. She is speaking loudly to be heard over the storm.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. No... Thank you. (hangs up)

(MULDER enters the car and gets into the driver's seat.)

MULDER: No one in the bathroom. The deputy helped me pull off the plywood. There's no sign of anything except more of that slime in the bathtub and maybe three inches of water on the floor. It's weird. It's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door.

SCULLY: Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close the airport. I think we better get out of here.

MULDER: Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?

SCULLY: Yes, I'm curious, Mulder but I'm also suspicious. I mean, I... I think that Mr. Dales' story is fueled by more than his imagination and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball.

MULDER: Don't dismiss him so easily. He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago. He's seen things that I've only read about.

SCULLY: Because sea monsters can only be read about, Mulder, because they don't exist.

MULDER: (in nature documentary narrator voice) If the sea is where life began-- where our ancestors first walked ashore-- then who's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths.

SCULLY: You know what? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family. (MULDER smiles at her.) Mulder, look-- there is nothing more for us to do here. There's nothing that local law enforcement can't do for us. I mean, these people are missing. There's nowhere else to look. I've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales for my conscience... I mean, haven't you?

MULDER: (slight pout) Well, we should at least tell him that we're giving up... shouldn't we?

(Helpless, SCULLY gives him a look.)

(Inside the house, DEPUTY GREER continues to look around alone.)

DEPUTY GREER: (to himself) Sea monsters... FBI agents... I'm the one who could use a drink.

(He notices slimy water bubbling out of the floor drain. He kneels down and uses his Leatherman multitool to pry off the drain cover. He reaches his arm [all the way to the elbow!] into the drain. He grabs hold of something and pulls it out. It is EVAN SHIPLEY's football jersey. He holds it up and looks at it.)



SCENE 5

(MULDER and SCULLY pull up to a road block on a debris strewn road.)

ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY: How do you do, folks? You're going to have to turn around and find yourself someplace dry to spend the night.

MULDER: What's the problem, officer?

ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY: The road's washed out up ahead.

SCULLY: This is an emergency.

ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY: I understand, ma'am but unless your car has wings there's no getting through on this road.

SCULLY: Well, what about the airport? Is there an alternate route?

ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY: Airport? No, not tonight. This hurricane's really bearing down on us. We got trees, power lines down all over the place. You folks really shouldn't be out here. I want you to drive to the first safe place you can find. You understand?

SCULLY: Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area. We're FBI agents and we need to get to where we're going.

ROAD BLOCK DEPUTY: Don't all the nuts roll downhill to Florida.

SCULLY: I'd be happy to show you my I.D

MULDER: (talking over her and rolling up the window) Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate the concern.

(MULDER, pissed off, whips the car around and peels out quickly.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: I was just one howdy do over the line.

(They go back the way they came.)



SCENE 6
THE BREAKERS CONDOMINIUMS
10:42 PM

(DEPUTY GREER pulls up in front of a three story low rent condominium complex. He leaves his blue lights on.)

DISPATCHER: (voice on radio) Car 54, please report back to base.

DEPUTY GREER: (into radio) Yeah, this is car 54. I'm over at Nance Road, over.

DISPATCHER: (voice on radio) We're asking all mobile units to stay off the roads due to extreme weather conditions forecast for the next three to four hours including a flash flood warning now in effect for Collier County. Over.

DEPUTY GREER: (into radio) 10-4. I'm going to make a quick stop in at the Breakers condo complex. Looks like some folks are stranded without power, over.

DISPATCHER: (voice on radio) 10-4, Deputy Greer. Please be advised that we won't be able to give you backup or assistance.

(DEPUTY GREER gets out of his car and enters the complex. REGGIE THE WET CAT jumps out from under the deputy's car and heads outside. Inside the complex DEPUTY GREER begins walking down the hall knocking at each door, then quickly moving on.)

DEPUTY GREER: (loudly) It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff. If you're home, please answer the door. If you can hear me, but you can't answer the door call 911, tell them you need help. Hello? It's Deputy Greer, County Sheriff. If you're home, answer the door. If you can hear me, but can't answer the door call 911, tell them you need help.

(DEPUTY GREER knocks at the manager's door and it swings open.)

DEPUTY GREER: Hello? Hello? Somebody here?

(He walks through the apartment cautiously and approaches the bathroom.)

DEPUTY GREER: Sir? Ma'am? Oh, my god.

(Opening the bathroom door, he sees a figure sitting on the toilet. The figure is completely covered by a thick, slimy transparent substance. DEPUTY GREER leans in closer and sees a wormlike shape moving around in the slime. Suddenly a tentacle shoots out and wraps around his throat. DEPUTY GREER screams and struggles.)



SCENE 7

(MULDER and SCULLY still driving. The rain is worse. SCULLY is trying to get through to someone on her phone.)

SCULLY: (speaking loudly into her cell phone) Hello?

MULDER: The good thing about zero visibility, Scully? Can't get any worse.

SCULLY: (on phone) Is this the Collier County Sheriff? Yes. Oh, hi. We're driving on, uh...

MULDER: Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.

SCULLY: (on phone) Nance Road. (listens for a moment and looks pointedly at MULDER) No, it isn't very smart, is it? (MULDER squinches his faces and sarcastically imitates her nagging) No... Yes, that would be much appreciated. (to MULDER) He's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter.

MULDER: (ready to be out of the car) Not a moment too soon.

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello? Hello... (hangs up in disgust) No service.

MULDER: You know, Scully, someday we're going to look back on this and we're going to laugh. We'll just think of it as, uh... you know man pitted against the forces of nature. Think of it as a test of our mettle.

SCULLY: I don't need my mettle tested.

(There is a loud thump as something hits the roof of their car.)

SCULLY: What was that?

MULDER: I think that was a-a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.

SCULLY: Mulder, we have to pull over. We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees.

MULDER: We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car. At least if we're driving, we're a moving target.

SCULLY: We don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going.

MULDER: (looking out the window) There's somebody, I think who's about to give us directions. Who says there's never a cop when you need one?

(MULDER pulls into the Breakers Condominium's parking lot beside DEPUTY GREER's flashing vehicle. They get out the car and enter the garage area.) : SCULLY: Mulder, isn't that...

MULDER: Forrest Gump. [Closed captioning said: Yup. Sherlock's patrol car.]

(They enter the complex and find the manager's open door.)

SCULLY: Deputy? Hello? Anybody... Mulder, he's in here.

(DEPUTY GREER is lying on the floor gasping for air. His neck is covered in red welts.)

SCULLY: Can you talk to me?

(DEPUTY GREER begins choking.)

SCULLY: You're having trouble breathing? This man needs a trach or he's going to die real soon.

(SCULLY goes to get whatever it is she's going to need for the trach. MULDER goes into the bathroom and looks in the slimy toilet. He pulls out a man's watch.)

MULDER: (to himself) I've heard of passing the time... Ouch.

(SCULLY returns to her patient. She has his Leatherman and a ball point pen cap in her mouth.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady. (MULDER is not thrilled.) Deputy, if you can hear me, just try and relax. Okay. Here we go.

(MULDER holds DEPUTY GREER's head while SCULLY uses the blade on the Leatherman to cut his throat. MULDER looks away quickly.

MULDER: Looks like he was attacked or stung. (looking at marks) What are those?

SCULLY: I don't know but he's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response.

MULDER: Whatever it was, I think it came through the plumbing, through the toilet.

SCULLY: All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as possible.

MULDER: If it's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this building.

(MULDER goes back out into the hall.)

SCULLY: (into DEPUTY GREER's radio) This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I need a medivac unit out here ASAP.

CUT TO: (ARTHUR DALES house. Same time. He is listening to SCULLY's conversation on his scanner.)

SCULLY: (voice, on radio) I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance.

OPERATOR: (voice on radio) Please state your name again, ma'am.

SCULLY: (voice on radio) My name is Dana... Scully.

ARTHUR DALES: (chuckling): Scully! Oh, god.

SCULLY: (voice on radio) I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit for a sheriff's deputy who is injured.

OPERATOR: (voice on radio) You have a deputy down?

SCULLY: (voice on radio) I have a deputy who's been attacked by something as yet unidentified.

ARTHUR DALES: (laugh) Unidentified? My ass!

OPERATOR: (voice on radio) What's his condition, ma'am?

SCULLY: (voice on radio) His vitals are weak and he's in shock. Now, I need him taken to a hospital right away.

CUT TO: (On an upper level of the condominium complex, MULDER sees a young man come out of an apartment carrying a television set.)

MULDER: Excuse me, sir. Is everything okay in your apartment?

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: Uh, yeah, yeah. It's all good.

MULDER: Do you need some help... with your television?

(A few doors down the hall, WALTER SUAREZ comes out into the hall.)

WALTER: I thought I heard voices. Thank god! We didn't think anybody was coming. Are you doctors?

MULDER: No. Do you need medical help?

WALTER: Yeah. We called 911, but no one came and everyone else is already evacuated. We don't have a car and then the phone died.

MULDER: Who's we? Who are you talking about?

WALTER: My wife and I. She's pregnant-- a week past her due date. God, I hope one of you has a car.

(MULDER looks at DOUGIE THE LOOTER then back to WALTER.)

MULDER: You don't know this man, mister...?

WALTER: Uh, Suarez. Walter Suarez. (shines light at DOUGIE THE LOOTER's face) Uh, no. He's not with you?

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: (looking at MULDER) I'll put it back.

MULDER: Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too.

(DOUGIE THE LOOTER carries the television back into the apartment.)

WALTER: (leading MULDER to his apartment) She's right over here. Right this way. Angela this is, uh, Mister...

MULDER: Mulder.

(MULDER enter the apartment and sees a VERY pregnant ANGELA VILLAREAL sitting on the couch. Lots of candles are on the table.)

MULDER: Stay there, Mrs. Suarez. We're going to make sure your baby makes it safely into the world.

ANGELA: (sarcastic and bad tempered) Well, thank you, but I'm not in labor. And my name is not "Suarez." It's Villareal. He tells people I'm his wife. Like he's so macho.

MULDER: Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me.

ANGELA: Why? You got a car? (shrewish) Oh, Walter, here, doesn't have a car. Not to mention a job.

MULDER: Right now, I just want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.

ANGELA: From what?

MULDER: I don't know but it may have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.

WALTER: Who? Where?

MULDER: In the manager's apartment. It could be in the complex's plumbing now.

WALTER: In the plumbing?

ANGELA: That's great. I have to go to the bathroom about every ten seconds.

(She pushes past the men in disgust and leaves the apartment.)

MULDER: (to WALTER) Kid's going to be a fighter. (WALTER laughs nervously) Anybody else in the complex that you know of?

WALTER: No, no one... Oh, there's George.

MULDER: George?

WALTER: Yeah, George Vincent. He lives on the first floor. I went and asked him for help but he just yelled "go away." He never listens to no one.

MULDER: He's going to want to listen to me.

ANGELA: (calling sharply from down the hall) Walter!

WALTER: (already heading to her) Better go.

MULDER: It's for you.

(Later, MULDER knocks at another door.)

MULDER: Mr. Vincent! George Vincent!

GEORGE VINCENT: (opening a small window in the door then slamming it shut) Quit banging on the damn door!

MULDER: I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent. I'm asking you to open the door.

GEORGE: (opening and closing the small window again) You ask away. Then go away.

(Inside the apartment, GEORGE looks through the peephole at MULDER. MULDER leans down and talks to the peephole.)

MULDER: Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment.

GEORGE: You may be in danger if you refuse to quit harassing me. Now, I'm armed in here and I'm within my rights.

MULDER: Well, that's great. But you may not be armed for what it is I'm talking about.

GEORGE: (opens window) What the hell are you talking about? Hmm? It don't matter. I'm armed against it. The Junta, Cuba and Castro. I'm not going to cede my home to no revolutionaries without a fight. You got anything else you want to throw at me-- you bring it on. (slams window shut)

MULDER: All the nuts roll down to Florida.

(Inside manager's apartment. WALTER and ANGELA have joined SCULLY. SCULLY covers DEPUTY GREER with a blanket.)

SCULLY: He's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body. His condition's worsening.

ANGELA: I can see that. What the hell was chewing on his neck?

SCULLY: I don't know. It may have been some kind of a water-borne parasite.

ANGELA: (to WALTER who is holding flashlight for SCULLY) Uh huh. You see that? You see what happens when you live in a dump?

WALTER: Where's Harry?

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.

ANGELA: The slumlord who owns this place.

SCULLY: He may have evacuated.

ANGELA: Harry? Right. And I'm giving birth to the Christ child.

WALTER: Harry's legs hardly work. He's got to use those crutches. (points to crutches against the wall)

ANGELA: He don't have no car. Nobody likes him 'cause he never lifts a finger on this rat trap.

(MULDER enters with DOUGIE THE LOOTER.)

MULDER: Scully, can I talk to you for a second?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER and SCULLY go out into the hall.)

ANGELA: Now, who are you?

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: Nobody.

ANGELA: Nobody? Oh, well, it is so nice to be surrounded by so many great men.

(MULDER and SCULLY are alone in the hall.)

MULDER: We got to out of here as soon as possible.

SCULLY: We can't.

MULDER: We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital.

SCULLY: Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time. The roads are impassable, and I don't even know if the deputy is movable in this condition.

MULDER: You mean we're stuck here?

SCULLY: It looks that way. At least until the weather breaks.

(GEORGE is listening to them from his apartment door. He checks to make sure his gun is loaded. He is very agitated, talking to himself, pacing around the room which is decorated in Late 20th Century Disgruntled American Soldier. Lots of guns and flags.)

GEORGE: Federal agents-- jack-booted fascists bent on trampling the rights of the common man. Don't need their damn help defending my home. Violence in the pursuit of freedom is no vice. Because all that's needed for tyranny to prevail is for good men to do nothing.

(Closed captioning continues: This is a time for action-- to protect my country against those that would spit at the constitution and take a leak on the bill of rights. My cause is just, my will is strong and my heart is that of a warrior. Anyone who wants a piece of me, let 'em bring it on.

(Overhead we see that the glass light fixture is filling with water. Then a tentacle appears in the fixture.)



SCENE 8

(Inside the manager's apartment. SCULLY is examining the conscious DEPUTY GREER. She is wearing an apron with something? on it, a red bandanna around her mouth, a pair of thick reading glasses, and yellow rubber kitchen gloves. There is a thermometer in DEPUTY GREER's mouth. The wounds on his neck look like octopus sucker wounds with a big hole in the middle.)

SCULLY: I don't think these wounds are bites or stings. There's something in here, Mulder, right under the skin. Tongs. (ANGELA passes some kitchen tongs to her.) Mulder, what's his temperature?

(MULDER takes the thermometer out of DEPUTY GREER's mouth and looks at it.)

MULDER: Well, either he's got no temperature or he's about to spontaneously combust.

SCULLY: (also looking at the thermometer) You're not far off. It's 106. Okay, somebody fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer.

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: B-but that thing is in the... plumbing.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his temperature down he's not going to survive this. Now get moving.

(DOUGIE THE LOOTER reluctantly goes into the bathroom.)

SCULLY: We need to put this man in ice water as soon as possible.

(Using the tongs, SCULLY pulls a worm like organism out of DEPUTY GREER's neck.)

SCULLY: I need a container. Mulder, lift him up. We have to get him into the tub.

(MULDER goes to lift up DEPUTY GREER. In the bathroom, ice is poured into the tub, then the faucet is turned on. The water sputters, then flows out. DOUGIE THE LOOTER holds the flashlight as MULDER and WALTER lower DEPUTY GREER into the tub. As they are getting him settled, DOUGIE THE LOOTER sees the watch that MULDER found earlier in the toilet. He makes sure that no one is watching, then smoothly pockets it. They all look up sharply at sounds of yelling and gunfire coming from down the hall. MULDER runs down the hall to GEORGE's apartment. SCULLY and the others stand in the doorway and watch. Inside GEORGE's apartment, GEORGE is yelling and shooting at the ceiling. We catch glimpses of tentacles.)

MULDER: Mr. Vincent?

(MULDER, gun drawn, stands outside the door and waits for a lull in the gunshots. He opens the door.)

MULDER: Drop your weapon! Put it down!'

GEORGE: It's gonna take a whole lot more than this to kill whatever it is I just saw.

(They enter the apartment.)

GEORGE: I don't know what the hell it was but it came down out of there.

(GEORGE points up at the ceiling where an exposed pipe has a large hole in it.)

MULDER: You didn't see it?

GEORGE: I caught it out of the corner of my eye but it swooped down at me. I...

SCULLY: All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.

GEORGE: No, no, this thing came at me.

MULDER: That looks like the four- inch tie-in to the second floor. Whatever it is didn't just rip through the ceiling. Looks like it ripped right through the pipe.

WALTER: Where did it go?

MULDER: I don't know. It must still be in the building. It's probably in the outflow system.

WALTER: Well, maybe it'll just flow back out.

GEORGE: Or maybe it'll come up through the can and grab you by the nugs.

MULDER: Someone's already got him by the nugs.

SCULLY: Look, you guys, whatever this thing is there's no evidence yet that it's going to kill anybody.

WALTER: Well, what about the man in the bathtub?

SCULLY: The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last out this storm. In fact, we may all be safe if we just remain calm.

ANGELA: "Remain calm?" I got to pee so bad my back teeth are swimming.

(Back in the bathroom of the other apartment, DOUGIE THE LOOTER checks to make sure no on else is around, then soaps DEPUTY GREER's finger and works his wedding ring off. He falls back with the force of the pull.)

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: Victory.

(He quickly pulls the shower curtain closed and steps way from the tub. As he does, he accidentally knocks a box of Epsom salts into the tub. He goes out of the bathroom just as MULDER and SCULLY enter the apartment again.)

SCULLY: How is he?

DOUGIE THE LOOTER: (nervously) H-he's good.

ANGELA: (pushing her way to the bathroom) Supertanker coming through.

WALTER: Here, Angela, you can't go in there.

ANGELA: My bladder is pressing against your unborn child, Walter. He's going to have a head like a tortilla.

WALTER: This thing is in the plumbing!

ANGELA: The volume alone could push it right back out to sea.

MULDER: Scully, that's how this thing is here. The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up god knows what and this thing must have been driven into the city's reclamation system through some offshore outfall pipe. From there it gained access to the sewer pipes in this building.

SCULLY: (handing ANGELA a bucket) We'll be waiting for you out here.

ANGELA: Thank you.

(ANGELA goes into the bathroom with the bucket. MULDER and SCULLY begin quietly arguing.)

SCULLY: Mulder, nothing I've seen convinces me there's a monster 

[Close captioning continues: ...lurking in the sewage system. I certainly don't think we can assume George Vincent gave us a factual account of what took place in his apartment. ]

(ANGELA is in the bathroom. The shower curtain is between her and DEPUTY GREER. She pulls up her skirt and sits on the bucket.)

ANGELA: I know you probably can't hear me but no listening anyway, okay?

(In the tub beside ANGELA, tentacles begin covering DEPUTY GREER. In the main room, conversation continues.)

MULDER: Scully, something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean-- something that had been lying there undiscovered for ages, probably.

SCULLY: Mulder, there is no evidence of any creature here. Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites, but something from Jules Verne they are not.

(They are startled as a screaming ANGELA comes running out of the bathroom.)

ANGELA: I saw it! I saw it! It's in the tub with the deputy. It has giant arms like an octopus.

(MULDER goes quickly into the bathroom and kneels down next to the tub. Everyone else follows.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

GEORGE: What the hell is it?

(All that is left in the tub is DEPUTY GREER's uniform. And some slime and the empty box of Epsom salts.)

MULDER: He's gone.

SCULLY: It's gone?

(MULDER holds up the empty wet uniform.)

MULDER: No. He's gone. The deputy.

SCULLY: Where'd he go?

MULDER: I think the deputy went out with the bathwater.

GEORGE: And he was... he was in there with it?

MULDER: No, I don't think he was.

WALTER: Well, she said she saw it.

MULDER: I'm sure she did. Look, Scully, I think I know why nobody's ever seen this thing before. It, it just doesn't live in water. It is water, taking shape only when it attacks, like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing. Virtually unseeable until then.

SCULLY: Mulder, if that were true then this wouldn't be visible, would it? (She holds up a glass jar with the worm thing from the deputy's neck floating in water.) I mean, what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it.

MULDER: Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process. Maybe it needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys.

SCULLY: Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.

MULDER: No, they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was here-- using their bodies to lay its own spawn-- using the body's water content to reproduce itself-- to make itself anew.

WALTER: You mean, he turned into one of those things?

ANGELA: There are more of them?

MULDER: We got to get out of here.

SCULLY: We're in the middle of a hurricane.

MULDER: We got to get to another building.

SCULLY: Mulder, we cant. There's no way we can transport everybody.

MULDER: We can use the deputy's Prowler. How many people? We got two, four... (realizes DOUGIE THE LOOTER is missing and runs out of the room)  son of a bitch.

WALTER: The looter?

(MULDER runs down the hall and into the garage area. DEPUTY GREER's car is gone. So is DOUGIE THE LOOTER. MULDER returns to the hall where SCULLY is waiting for him.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Mulder, if we're going to leave we should leave now.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: MULDER: He took the Prowler, Scully.]

(MULDER looks up at the light fixture in the hall and sees it filling with water, then sees one of the worm/tentacle things through the glass of the fixture. It falls out of the ceiling and onto MULDER.)



SCENE 9

(Hall, short time later. SCULLY comes out of the apartment and sees MULDER at the far end of the hall. He stumbles toward her.)

SCULLY: Mulder?! Hey, Mulder, are you okay?

(MULDER is in pain, gasping for breath. He tries to speak, then comes up to her and shows her the red marks on his throat. Before SCULLY can react, GEORGE grabs her and pushes her back into the apartment and slams the door in MULDER's face.)

SCULLY: Hey... wait a second. What are you doing?!

GEORGE: (aiming his gun at her) I am saving our lives.

SCULLY: That's my partner out there!

GEORGE: If he's your partner he should have listened to you.

SCULLY: You can't just leave him there!

GEORGE: I'm not letting him in.

SCULLY: He'll die!

WALTER: What are you going to do for him?

SCULLY: Well, I can at least keep him breathing!

WALTER: You couldn't save the deputy.

SCULLY: Look, at least let me try. I'm a medical doctor.

ANGELA: That's good... because my water just broke.

(Out in the hall alone, MULDER leans against the wall just trying to breathe. He looks up and sees another tentacle writhing around in another light fixture. Frightened, he stumbles to the open door at the end of the hall.)

(Inside the apartment, WALTER is sitting behind ANGELA supporting her. GEORGE holds a gun on SCULLY who is kneeling between ANGELA's legs.)

WALTER: You're going to be okay.

ANGELA: Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

GEORGE: Isn't much of a choice, really, is it?

(Long pause while he and SCULLY stare at each other.)

SCULLY: (heading to kitchen) We're going to need water. If I'm going to deliver this baby you can put that gun down. (she puts on another pair of gloves)

GEORGE: How do we know you're really a doctor?

SCULLY: You don't. The truth is I've never delivered a baby before. So stand back or make yourself useful but stay out of my way.

(Out in the hall, MULDER runs down the hall to the outside door and falls and lies gasping just inches from the pouring rain outside. He can barely breathe.)

(In the apartment, ANGELA is in full labor, yelling and breathing hard.)

WALTER: Long, even breath!

SCULLY: You got it. Breathe... Breathe. Okay, Angela, I'm going to need you to push, okay? I need you to help me help you. Okay. So let's push.

(ANGELA yells in pain. GEORGE glances up to the light fixture which is filling with water.)

SCULLY: You got it. You got it. You're on the right track. (to GEORGE) I'm going to need some towels, please.

(GEORGE does not move.)

SCULLY: (demanding) I need some towels, damn it!

(GEORGE goes to get towels. Angela is breathing hard SCULLY looks up at the fixture.)

SCULLY: You're doing good. You're doing good. Okay. You're doing good. Okay. Let's go. Okay, push.

(Out in the hall, MULDER lies gasping beside the open outside door. He hears a meow, then turns and sees REGGIE the VERY WET CAT sitting in the rain a few feet from him. He and MULDER stare at each other. One shot he looks a bit  fake, but then he's real and washes his face. )

(In apartment, ANGELA is in final stages of labor. SCULLY keep looking up to the light fixture still filling with water.)

SCULLY: I can feel it up there!

WALTER: She can feel it up there!

SCULLY: Okay, come on. Puuush! Good! You got it. Okay. Here it comes.

WALTER: Here it comes.

SCULLY: Here it comes. It's coming. Okay.

(SCULLY rinses her gloved hands in a bucket of water, then pauses and stares at her hands, then looks up at the light fixture.)

GEORGE: Hey, lady, what are you doing?

SCULLY: It's the water.

WALTER: What? What?

SCULLY: It's the water!

ANGELA: I'm having it! I'm having it! I'm having it!

SCULLY: Okay!

ANGELA: I'm having it!

(SCULLY keeps looking up at the light fixture then back to ANGELA.)

SCULLY: Push!

ANGELA: I'm having it!

(ANGELA begins yelling again. SCULLY sees a tentacle appear in the light fixture. The tentacle in the light fixture suddenly bursts out and grabs GEORGE by the neck and lifts him off the floor.. He drops his gun and begins yelling.)

SCULLY: It's coming! Push! Push!

(ANGELA yells.)

SCULLY: Okay!

(SCULLY takes the baby in her arms as it is born.)

GEORGE: Help!

SCULLY: (to WALTER) Okay, now pick up the gun.

GEORGE: Help! Aah!

SCULLY: (holding the baby) Pick up the gun!

(WALTER picks up the gun. GEORGE is yelling.)

WALTER: Where?

SCULLY: Shoot out the sprinklers! Just point and shoot! Shoot out the sprinklers!

(WALTER aims at the sprinkler head, but GEORGE, still under attack by the tentacles and yelling, keeps swinging into view and blocking the shot. Finally, WALTER shoots the sprinkler head.)



SCENE 10

(Dawn. ARTHUR DALES' house. The storm is over. Outside the trailer, SCULLY is talking on her cell phone. Inside, ARTHUR DALES is looking at the wounds on MULDER's neck.)

ARTHUR DALES: Yes, yes. Eww, god.

(MULDER chuckles, almost as if he is proud of his cool wounds.)

ARTHUR DALES: That's terrible.

(SCULLY enters the trailer.)

SCULLY: Well, it's official. Ten pounds, ten ounces of piss and vinegar. El nino grande-- Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez, Jr.

MULDER: (laughing) Oh, no.

SCULLY: Oh, yes.

ARTHUR DALES: Oh, it's amazing. It's truly amazing.

SCULLY: What's that?

ARTHUR DALES: That you could come here in the face of a hurricane chasing a sea monster, yet, and end up bringing a new... life into the world. And then slaying the monster and save this one's life as he was quite literally circling down the drain.

MULDER: She didn't save my life, really...

ARTHUR DALES: Oh, yes, she did. Yes, with a gun to her head, no less.

SCULLY: (rationalizing) Well, you wouldn't have known to go out in the rain if I hadn't pointed it out that to you that it was the fresh water that killed the organism...

MULDER: No. No no no no  I-I saw the Shipley's cat.

ARTHUR DALES: Uh, well, I-I can't swallow that... No, no, no.

MULDER: I saw the cat, which had been saved which had been in the washing machine. And the Shipleys had boarded up their house which means that the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater  seawater. And then the deputy who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts.

ARTHUR DALES: If Agent Scully had not been there with you I shudder to think what would have happened to you. I'd say you owe her your life. It takes a big man to admit this, but... if I had had someone as savvy as her by my side all those years ago in the X-Files I might not have retired. (MULDER and SCULLY both look down a little embarrassed.) I suggest that we have a toast to your good fortune. And I insist that we have it. So... what'll it be?

(ARTHUR DALES crosses to the "bar" on the kitchen counter mumbling to himself.):

ARTHUR DALES: A little of the... oh, uh... anyone for water?

(MULDER and SCULLY both look up quickly from where they are sitting on the couch.)

MULDER AND SCULLY: (together) No.

[THE END]
                          MONDAY



SCENE 1

(Outside Cradock Marine Bank on 8th Street. SWAT team is getting into position behind the crime scene tape. Police cars pull up. A woman, PAM, is watching from the street. She is late twenties - early thirties. She looks very sad and tired. SKINNER runs up and ducks under the crime scene tape and goes to LIEUTENANT KRASKOW. He shows his badge.)

SKINNER: You in charge here?

LIEUTENANT KRASKOW: Lieutenant Kraskow. Is the Bureau taking over?

SKINNER: You're welcome to any help that I can give you, but that's not why I'm here. What can you tell me?

LIEUTENANT KRASKOW: Silent alarm tripped 30 minutes ago. We think there's one robber, armed. Probably a handgun. Definitely no pro or he would have been long gone. A single gunshot about 20 minutes ago. Blinds are down but we think we've got a body on the floor. But you're not here to take over?

SKINNER: Two of my agents might be in there.

(PAM runs up to them, but a COP grabs her and holds her back.)

PAM: Skinner! Skinner!

COP: Hold it right here.

SKINNER: Do I know you?

PAM: Stop this. Don't let this happen!

(Inside the bank. SCULLY is kneeling on the floor with MULDER's head in her lap. He is bleeding heavily from a gunshot wound to the chest. She is on the verge of tears and pressing her hand over the wound. The other customers and tellers are also on the ground. SCULLY caresses MULDER's face then looks up at the gunman, BERNARD, who is staring down at them breathing heavily. He is not a stable person. Explosives are strapped to his chest. His thumb is on the switch.)

SCULLY: (quietly desperate) You're in charge here, you know. It doesn't have to end like this.

(SWAT team enters the front doors.)

BERNARD: Yeah, it does.

SCULLY: (screaming) Nooooooo!!!!

(BERNARD reaches for the switch on the explosives strapped to his chest. Exterior shot of the building exploding. SKINNER ducks behind one of the police minivans to avoid the debris. Smoke fades to black.)

SCENE 2

(MULDER's apartment hallway. Paperboy delivers paper hard against MULDER's door. MULDER wakes up suddenly. He is on his waterbed and has been sleeping on his right side. He lies still for a moment and realizes something is wrong. Reflected in the overhead mirror, we see him sit up and swing his legs over the side of the bed. He is wearing yellow pajama bottoms. His feet land on his carpet with a splash. The floor is covered in water. He flips the corner of the sheet up and a continuous jet of water spurts out of the bed.)

MULDER: Son of a... (grunts what sounds like "Damn it.")

(He looks at his clock, which has no display. He bangs it against the nightstand. Nothing. He moves the nightstand away from the wall and sees that the stream of water is falling directly on the power outlet. In disgust, he pulls out the plug. He then reaches for his cell phone, but accidentally knocks it onto the wet floor. He looks down at it, sighs, then picks it up. It doesn't work. He pours the water out )

MULDER: (disgusted) Yes... Yes.

(He looks at his watch - Omega. It reads Monday, 7:16 and 9 seconds. He curses under his breath and quickly walks out of his bedroom stepping over his athletic shoes. The phone rings. He tosses the useless cell phone to the floor in the living room and grabs a small pot from the kitchen and goes back to the bedroom, but trips over the athletic shoes and lands flat on the wet floor on his face and stomach. He slowly crawls to the phone and answers it. He puts the pot in position to catch the water.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hello? . It's coming through down there?  Ugh!  It's my damn waterbed. My damn waterbed sprung a leak. I-I-I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed.  I don't know what to tell you.  I-I think it was a gift.  All right.

(He hangs up and puts his finger over the hole in the mattress. For a moment the flow stops, but then water starts spraying out and when he removes his finger, the leak is worse than before. He picks up the pot and pours the water back on top of the mattress, then stares at the leak with hatred and places the pot over it.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(X-Files Office. Yea!! MULDER is at the desk. He opens his paycheck with a letter opener. FOX WILLIAM MULDER 2630 HEGEL PL #42 ALEXANDRIA, VA 26242. He endorses the check. SCULLY walks in.)

MULDER: I know. I missed the meeting.

SCULLY: You didn't miss the meeting. You're extraordinarily late for the meeting. It's still going on.

MULDER: What are you doing down here?

SCULLY: We took a short break and I came looking for you. What are you doing down here, Mulder?

MULDER: (sarcastically) I'm having the best damn day of my life. Any moment I'm about to burst into song-- "Zip a dee doo dah." My, uh, waterbed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock. (SCULLY blinks in surprise.) My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the, uh, damages is going to bounce if I don't deposit my pay. You ever have one of those days, Scully?

(MULDER crosses to the door.)

SCULLY: Since I've been working here? Yeah. When did you get a waterbed, Mulder?

(MULDER pauses in the doorway and thinks about it for a moment. SCULLY stares at him questioningly. MULDER ignores the question. Very funny.)

MULDER: Bank's just down the street. I'll be back in ten. Cover for me, will you?

(MULDER leaves.)

SCULLY: (to herself) When do I not?

CUT TO: (Corner of E Street and 8th Street. Outside the bank. A really ugly car driven by BERNARD with PAM as a passenger cuts across two lanes of traffic and pulls up across the street from the bank. Other cars angrily blow their horns.)

DRIVER: Jerk!

BERNARD: Yeah? You want some? (looks at PAM) We good? Pam?

PAM: Go run your errand already.

BERNARD: (very nervous) Yeah. I just got to go pick something up. No biggie.

PAM: (not looking at him) Right, Bernard. No biggie.

BERNARD: I'll be ten minutes. Wait here for me.

(BERNARD gets out of the really ugly car just in time for a bicyclist to almost hit him. Pam mouths the dialogue along with them.)

BICYCLIST: Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!

BERNARD: You watch it!

(BERNARD goes into the bank. PAM sees MULDER approaching.)

PAM: (sadly) Right on schedule. Poor guy.

(MULDER looks in the car window and stares at PAM for a moment, then continues on into the bank. PAM stares in surprise.)

PAM: (to herself) You never did that before.

(MULDER enters the bank and gets in a long line. At one of the tables, BERNARD is writing on an envelope - "This is a robbery ")

CUT TO: (SKINNER's office. SCULLY is in hell. She and SKINNER and two other agents are listening to AGENT ARNOLD give a report. There is a vertical bar chart next to him. He is EXTREMEMLY boring - flat delivery with meaningless pauses. The chair next to SCULLY is conspicuously empty.)

AGENT ARNOLD: Now, that's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year. Um, other D.O.J. projections estimate a larger, uh, two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate versus the, uh, one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier, uh, Tanner study. However, there is some dispute that the, uh, statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J.-preferred methodology. In any case added variables make crime trends for the coming year particularly hard to predict.

SKINNER: The unpredictable future. Which brings us to Agent Mulder. Will he or will he not grace us with his report?

(SKINNER looks meaningfully at SCULLY who gets up and leaves the office.)

CUT TO: (Inside the Cradock Marine bank. MULDER is still in line behind the WOMAN WHO WILL NEED TO BE SLAPPED. He checks his watch impatiently.)

TELLER: May I help the next in line, please?

CUSTOMER: I've got  a few transactions.

(MULDER checks his watch. BERNARD, having finished writing his note, "This is a robbery. Put the money in the bag  " He takes a moment to breathe heavily, then crumples the note and suddenly turns and points a gun at the customers.)

BERNARD: (yelling) Customers, face down! You know what this is!

WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: (hysterical) Oh, god.

BERNARD: You! On the floor!

WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: (more hysterical) Oh, god, don't shoot us!

BERNARD: Shut up!

MULDER: (kneeling) You're the boss.

(MULDER lies down on the floor next to WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED who begins sobbing.)

MULDER: (quietly to the WOMAN) It's all right.

BERNARD: All right, I'm the boss! No silent alarms, no dye packs. Do it like the insurance company taught you. Start with the counter money. Quicker you go, quicker I go. Everybody else out here on the floor. (TELLER begins removing money.) Ahh! Leave the last one. No tricks. (TELLER pushes silent alarm with her foot) All right, come on. Come on.

MULDER: (disgusted, to himself) Zip a dee doo dah.

(Through a window, MULDER sees SCULLY approaching the bank.)

BERNARD: (to TELLER) All right, get your keys. Come around here. We're going to open up the ATM.

(TELLER obeys.)

MULDER: (to BERNARD) Hey, lock the doors. You forgot to lock the front door.

BERNARD: (to TELLER) On the ground.

(SCULLY enters the bank then pauses as BERNARD points his gun at her. MULDER stands and aims his gun at BERNARD's back.)

WOMAN WHO NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: No!!!

(BERNARD turns and shoots MULDER on the left side of his chest. He falls.)

SCULLY: Drop it! Drop it now!

BERNARD: You drop it!

(SCULLY looks at MULDER lying on the ground. BERNARD opens his jacket to reveal the explosives strapped to his chest.)

BERNARD: You drop it.

(SCULLY stares at him in shock then slowly lowers her gun.)

CUT TO: (SKINNER's office.)

SKINNER: Travel expense reimbursement. Who's got those figures? All I've got here is third and fourth quarter.

AGENT ARNOLD: No?

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: (entering the room) Assistant Director?

CUT TO: (Street outside the bank. PAM is sitting in the ugly car. She hears tires screeching as the SWAT team arrives.)

PAM: (resigned, not looking at them as they run past) Go, go, go.

SWAT TEAM LEADER: Go, go, go!

(PAM gets out of the car. SKINNER arrives on the scene showing his badge.)

COP: Sir.

SKINNER: Who's in charge here?

LIEUTENANT KRASKOW: I am. Unless the Bureau's taking over.

(PAM comes running up to them. A COP grabs her and holds her back.)

PAM: Skinner!

COP: Hey, hold it!

PAM: Skinner! Don't let them charge in there. Skinner!

SKINNER: Do I know you?

PAM: Skinner!

CUT TO: (Inside bank. SCULLY removes MULDER's tie and rips open his shirt - go Scully! - and then cradles MULDER's head in her lap and presses her hand onto the wound in his chest. Throughout the scene, she is on the verge of tears, but stays calm.)

BERNARD: They're supposed to call, right?

SCULLY: They're not going to call. What's your name?

BERNARD: Yeah.

SCULLY: Look, I got to call you something, right? How about Steve? It's a nice... honest name. Steve.

BERNARD: Bernard.

SCULLY: (voice breaking) Bernard. I have to get my partner out of here.

BERNARD: I am blowing this whole freaking place right off the map if they come in here.

SCULLY: Oh... look, they don't know that. Don't you realize that? They can't see you. They don't know what your plan is.

BERNARD: They better know. They damn well better figure it out.

SCULLY: Look... just walk in front of the door and show them.

BERNARD: You want to get me killed.

(SCULLY looks down at MULDER who is barely conscious. She strokes his cheek.)

SCULLY: (quietly pleading) I just want everybody to live. That's all. I just... just show them. You have control over everything that happens here. You do. And it doesn't have to end this way.

(The SWAT team runs in the front doors.)

BERNARD: Yeah, it does.

SCULLY: (screams) Noooooo!!!!

(BERNARD flips the switch on the explosives on his chest. Exterior shot of the bank exploding. SKINNER ducks behind the minivan to avoid the debris. Smoky haze fades to black.)



SCENE 4

(MULDER's hallway. Paperboy flings a paper against the door. MULDER, startled, wakes up on his waterbed. He was sleeping on his back. He notices that the sheets are wet. His feet hit the wet carpet. He finds the stream of water shooting out of the bed.)

MULDER: Oh, son of a...

(He bangs his alarm clock. No response. He knocks his cell phone to the floor, then picks it up to use it, then pours the water out of it.)

MULDER: Son of a bitch.

(He sets the cell phone down and picks up his watch. Monday 7:14 A.M.)

MULDER: Oh... that's great.

(He walks out of the bedroom to his kitchens stepping over his athletic shoes. He returns, steps over his shoes and sets a pot in position to catch the water. His phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?  It's coming through down there?  It's my damn waterbed.  It sprung a leak.  Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed.  I don't know what to tell you.  I... I... I'm sorry. I mean, I...

(He hangs up. He puts his finger over the leak. The leak gets worse. He stands up and begins looking around for something else. He backs up and trips and falls backwards over his athletic shoes. The phone rings again but MULDER, seeing that the pot is already overflowing, ignores it. He goes back to the kitchen.)

CUT TO: (PAM and BERNARD's apartment. PAM is alone in a room on the phone waiting for MULDER to pick up. It rings several times, then she hangs up as BERNARD enters the room.)

BERNARD: Who you calling?

PAM: Nobody.

BERNARD: What do you mean, nobody? It's got to be somebody.

PAM: It's nobody you know, Bernard. Forget it.

BERNARD: There's something I got to do. I want you to come.

PAM: (turning away) I'm not going with you.

BERNARD: Look, I'm not asking. Pam? Don't go getting all weird on me. It'll only take a couple of minutes.

PAM: Look, Bernard, ... just go to work. It's not too late.

BERNARD: I'm not going to work today. And don't say they're going to fire me.

PAM: I wasn't going to say that.

BERNARD: 'Cause you know what? Who cares? Like there's a big future in mopping floors. Like that's something to lose.

PAM: We lose everything.

BERNARD: No, no. I got a plan. This time tomorrow, Pam...

PAM: Everything will be roses.

(They exit the room. Old digital flip clock clicks to 7:17 A.M.)

(X-Files office. MULDER is at his desk opening his paycheck without a letter opener. When he pulls the check out of the envelope, one corner is mangled.)

MULDER: Aw... Damn it.

(SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: I know. I missed the meeting.

SCULLY: Well, not yet, but, uh, only because it's the longest in FBI history.

MULDER: What are you doing down here, then?

SCULLY: Well, I came looking for you. We took a five-minute break (looks at watch) three minutes ago. Mulder, your cell phone's not working. (He glances up at her.) Did you oversleep?

(MULDER is taping the check back together.)

MULDER: Scully, did you ever have one of those days you wish you could rewind and start all over again from the beginning?

SCULLY: Yes. Frequently. But, I mean, who's  who's to say that if you did rewind it and start over again that it wouldn't end up exactly the same way?

(MULDER endorses the check.)

MULDER: So you think it's all just fate? We have no free will?

SCULLY: No, I think that we're free to be the people that we are-- good, bad or indifferent. I think that it's our character that determines our fate.

MULDER: And all the rest is just preordained? I don't buy that. There's too many variables. Too many forks in the road. I meant to be on time to work this morning but my waterbed springs a leak flooding my apartment (SCULLY looks surprised) and the apartment below me so that makes me late for the meeting. Then I realize I got to write a check to cover the damages to my landlord but, as I'm walking to work, I realize that that's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay. So now I got to go to the bank, which makes me even later.

SCULLY: Since when did you get a waterbed?

MULDER: I might just as easily not have a waterbed then I'd be on time for this meeting. You might just as easily have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI, and then we would never have met. Blah, blah, blah...

SCULLY: Fate.

MULDER: Free will. With every choice, you change your fate.

(SCULLY steps forward and takes the signed papers from him.)

SCULLY: Then let's change yours. I will deposit your check. You gather your files, go to Skinner's office, give your report before he takes it out on both of us.

(She leaves. MULDER goes to the file cabinet.)

CUT TO: (SCULLY enters the bank and gets in line. BERNARD is writing another note. "This is a HOLDUP.")

CUT TO:

(X-Files office. MULDER gets some more files out of the cabinet and is almost out of the office when he looks down and sees a paper on the desk. He turns it over. It is his paycheck.)

MULDER: (amazed at his own stupidity) I endorsed my damn check stub.

(He angrily slams the drawer shut and leaves the office with the check. There is a pair of wind up teeth on the desk.)

CUT TO: (MULDER on the street almost to the bank. PAM runs up to him.)

PAM: Mulder! Don't go in the bank today.

MULDER: Excuse me?

PAM: Bernard's in there. Please don't go in the bank.

MULDER: I'm sorry. Do I know you?

PAM: You pass me every day on the street. Every single day. This day, on your way to the bank. And then you go inside, and everybody gets killed-- you, your partner, Bernard, everybody

MULDER: . I pass you... and then we die.

PAM: Yes. Over and over. Only... only last time you looked at me, you looked at me like you knew me. Like you remembered. Please remember me.

(They hear a gunshot from inside the bank.)

PAM: (pleading) Don't go.

(MULDER runs to enter the bank, avoiding cars. Tires screech. MULDER enters the bank and sees BERNARD and SCULLY holding guns on each other. He pulls out his gun. The WOMAN WHO NEEDED TO BE SLAPPED has been shot.)

MULDER: Drop your weapon!

SCULLY: Drop it.

BERNARD: I ain't dropping nothing. You put yours down. I'll shoot her!

MULDER: What do you think I'll do then?

(BERNARD opens his jacket showing the explosives. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MULDER: Bernard... that's your name, right?

(SCULLY gives MULDER an odd look, then kneels down and checks the pulse of WOMAN WHO NEEDED TO BE SLAPPED.)

SCULLY: Bernard, she's not dead. You're not a murderer yet.

MULDER: You can end this the right way.

TELLER: Sir, please. Listen to them. Don't hurt anybody else. A whole lot of police are coming.

(BERNARD stares at her, then lowers his gun in resignation.)

BERNARD: You tripped the alarm.

(BERNARD drops the gun then reluctantly flips the switch on his chest. MULDER runs to try to stop him.)

MULDER: Noooo!!!

(Exterior shot of the building exploding. Outside, PAM ducks behind the car and covers her ears as the debris flies, she cries.)



SCENE 5

(MULDER's hallway. Paperboy delivers paper against MULDER's door, then quick cut to paper delivered again and finally a third time as if to show that the day played three more times. MULDER wakes up on his left side in his waterbed. He realizes he is wet. He finds the leak. He puts his feet on the wet floor. Phone rings. He picks it up knocking his cell phone to the floor.)

MULDER: (on phone, impatiently) Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know. I-I know already.  I'll pay for it.

(He looks at his dead alarm clock then at his dead cell phone. He looks at his watch. Then off camera he trips over his shoes and falls to the ground with a wet thud and yells "Owww!" Time on watch is Monday 7:15 exactly.)

CUT TO: (FBI building. SCULLY is walking to an elevator, cell phone to her ear.)

RECORDING: The cellular customer you are trying to reach is not responding  (closed captioning: We're sorry, the D.C. Cellular subscriber you wish to reach cannot take your call at this... )

(She hangs up and pushes the down button on the elevator. PAM, wearing a tourist badge, comes running up to her.)

PAM: Agent Scully...

SCULLY: Yes?

PAM: Please don't go inside the bank today.

SCULLY: The bank?

PAM: Cradock Marine-- Eighth Street branch a block from here.

SCULLY: Uh... I'm not following. Did-did you get separated from your tour?

PAM: I'm here to see you. I'm begging you... please don't go this time. Don't let Mulder go, either.

(Elevator opens behind SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Um... I'm sorry...

(TOUR GUIDE walks up to them.)

TOUR GUIDE: Excuse me, miss? You're not supposed to be in this area.

PAM: If you walk in that bank, you'll die. Both of you.

(TOUR GUIDE escorts PAM away down the hall. SCULLY makes a scoffing sound and enters the elevator.)

(SCULLY enters the X-Files office. No one else is there. A moment later, MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Oh, hey.

SCULLY: Hey.

MULDER: Did I miss the meeting?

(MULDER opens his paycheck without an opener.)

SCULLY: Huh? No. No, we, uh, took a five-minute break about, uh, three minutes ago. Uh, Mulder, your cell phone's not working.

(MULDER gets a very odd look on his face.)

MULDER: Wow, that is so strange.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: I just got the weirdest sensation of deja vu. I've been having it all morning.

SCULLY: Well, that's fairly common.

MULDER: Yeah, but never to this degree. I mean, I woke up, I opened my eyes I was soaking wet...

(SCULLY looks at him curiously. He endorses his check.)

MULDER: It's a long story but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before.

SCULLY: Well, you may have. Did you do a lot of drinking in college?

(MULDER looks up at her.)

MULDER: I wonder what it means.

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't see why it has to mean anything.

MULDER: Well, you know, some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious. That it represents a desire to, uh, have a second chance to set things right.

SCULLY: Set what kind of things right?

MULDER: Whatever's wrong.

SCULLY: Mulder, it's more likely that we're talking about simple neurochemistry-- a glitch in the brain's ability to process recognition and memory. Doesn't mean that the memory's authentic.

MULDER: Yeah? Well, but what if it were?

SCULLY: What if you'd lived this moment before and now you're living it again?

MULDER: Yeah-- so that I could right some wrong or change fate.

SCULLY: Well, right now I'd say you're fated to go to this meeting.

MULDER: No. Actually, I'm fated to go to the bank.

SCULLY: Mulder... what bank?

MULDER: Cradock. Right down the street.

SCULLY: Eighth Street.

(MULDER pauses in the doorway.)

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: (sighs) Some ... some woman just stopped me in the hallway not ten minutes ago. She knew both of our names and she warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street. She said that we'd die.

MULDER: What did she look like?

SCULLY: Five-eight, thin, green eyes, dyed hair. M-maybe you know her. Maybe... it's just somebody pulling a prank.

MULDER: I'll use the ATM machine. I don't want to tempt fate.

CUT TO: (SKINNER's office. Back to the meeting from hell.)

SKINNER: All right, our next order of business is federal crime projections. Who's got those figures?

AGENT ARNOLD: Uh, right here. Um, if you all could just bear with me one second. (He looks through his files. There is a colored horizontal bar graph next to him.) Uh, "federal crime projections."

(SCULLY looks at MULDER's empty chair.)

CUT TO: (Street outside the bank. MULDER is standing in front of the ATM machine. He seals the envelope, then gets his wallet out, but then sees that the ATM is out of order. He looks apprehensively at the door to the bank, then turns and sees PAM and crosses over to her.)

PAM: (hopefully) Do you remember me?

MULDER: You match a description. You're the, uh...you're the woman that gave a warning to my partner, aren't you? (She nods.) Uh... Have we met?

PAM: More times than I can count. Right here on this sidewalk. Usually, you walk right by. You'll pass a few minutes earlier a few minutes later-- little details, they change. But it always ends the same.

MULDER: What always ends the same?

PAM: I keep having this conversation.

MULDER: We go inside the bank... and we all die. That's what you told my partner. Is... is something going to happen inside the bank? Is there going to be a robbery?

PAM: (on the verge of tears) Every time I tell you there's going to be a robbery you run in there to try to stop it and that's when things go bad. Don't you see? We're all in hell. I'm the only one who knows it. Something went very wrong on this day the first time around. Something got screwed up. Things didn't end the way they were supposed to. Now it's like a needle stuck in a groove.

MULDER: You're saying this day repeats over and over again.

PAM: Until we get it right. Till my boyfriend doesn't blow up that bank. I have tried everything to stop him. I've hid his keys, I've drugged his coffee... I even called the police on him myself. He always gets here. He's meant to. It's you. It's you and your partner every time. If it wasn't for you, nobody would die.

MULDER: If what you're saying is true, how come I don't remember it? How come you're the only one?

PAM: That's got to be 50 times you've asked me that.

MULDER: 51. What's the answer?

PAM: I don't know. I just do. Be glad you don't. Please... you can stop this. You're the variable. It has to be you. I have tried everyone else. All I'm asking is just walk away.

CUT TO: (SKINNER's office. AGENT ARNOLD is droning on. MULDER enters with his files and gives a weak smile to SKINNER who does not smile back. He then notices the empty seat beside him.)

AGENT ARNOLD: That's assuming these trends continue well into the coming year. Other D.O.J.. projections estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate, uh versus the, uh, one to one-and- a-half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study. However, there is some dispute that...

MULDER: (interrupting) Um, excuse me uh... Agent Arnold. Um, where's Scully?

SKINNER: She just left, Mulder -- I assume to look for you.

MULDER: Uh, excuse me. Um...

(MULDER gets back up and leaves the room. SKINNER looks quite over it all.)

AGENT ARNOLD: Umm.

CUT TO: (Inside bank. SCULLY enters and looks around unsuccessfully for MULDER. BERNARD finishes writing and turns around holding his gun on the customers.)

BERNARD: Everybody, face down! You know what this is! Give me the money.

WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: Oh, God! Oh, God...

BERNARD: You! On the floor!

(SCULLY kneels.)

WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: Oh, God, you're going to shoot us? Oh, God he's going to...

BERNARD: Shut up!

WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: He's going to shoot us! Please don't kill us! Please don't do this!

BERNARD: Shut up! (to TELLER) Give me the money!

WOMAN WHO REALLY NEEDS TO BE SLAPPED: Don't shoot us! Don't shoot us!

BERNARD: Damn it, shut up!

(SCULLY slowly reaches for her gun. BERNARD sees her.)

BERNARD: Hey! Hey! Get your hands up where I can see them! Do it! Do it now!

(MULDER enters the bank and pulls out his gun.)

MULDER: Drop your weapon!

(BERNARD turns. MULDER shoots him in the shoulder and BERNARD falls to the ground. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other and then, guns still out, approach him. BERNARD rips his jacket open exposing the explosives strapped to his chest. MULDER and SCULLY freeze.)

MULDER: (quietly repeating to himself) He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.

(BERNARD flips the switch.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 7

(MULDER's apartment hallway. Paperboy delivers the paper against MULDER's door waking him up. Everything in the apartment happens in slow motion, like he is just going through the motions. He wakes up on his left side. He sits up and his feet hit the wet floor. He looks at his watch. Monday 7:15 and 2 seconds. He talks on the phone and hangs up.)

CUT TO: (X-Files office. MULDER is at his desk endorsing his check - Fox W. Mulder. There is a pair of wind-up chattering teeth on the desk. SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: I know, I know. I missed the meeting.

SCULLY: You didn't miss the meeting. You're extraordinarily late for the meeting.

MULDER: (touching her shoulder familiarly and leaving the office) The bank's just down the street. Cover for me, will you?

CUT TO: (BERNARD and PAM pull up in front of the bank in the ugly car. Another car blows it's horn.)

BERNARD: We good, Pam? Pam?

PAM: (not looking at him) I know-- you just got to go pick something up. No biggie.

BERNARD: What is with you? Why are you always in a mood?

PAM: 'Cause nothing ever changes.

BERNARD: Things are going to change. You wait and see. I'll be ten minutes. Wait here for me.

(He gets out of the car and is almost hit by the BICYCLIST. She mouths the words of the next two lines.)

BICYCLIST: Hey, man, you need to watch it next time!

BERNARD: You watch it!

(PAM begins crying quietly. MULDER comes down the street and pauses beside PAM's car window. She rolls it down. She doesn't look very hopeful.)

MULDER: Do I know you?

PAM: Do you?

MULDER: Yeah, you just look really familiar to me.

PAM: Do I?

MULDER: Yeah. No? Uh, all right. I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.

(Inside the bank, MULDER gets in line.)

TELLER: May I help the next in line, please?

(MULDER looks out at PAM sitting in the car, then over to where BERNARD is writing. Camera closes in on MULDER's face.)

MULDER: (whispering): ...He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.

CUT TO: (SKINNER's office. Meeting from hell. SCULLY is very nervous. The graph is now the jagged line type.)

AGENT ARNOLD: ...estimate a larger two to three percent drop in the overall homicide rate, uh, versus the one to one and a half percent cited in the earlier Tanner study. However, there's some dispute that the statistical methodology in this latter study is not the D.O.J.-preferred methodology.

(SKINNER looks at his watch, then looks sternly at SCULLY.)

AGENT ARNOLD: In any case, added variables make crime trends for the coming year...

(SKINNER's assistant enters the office.)

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: Excuse me. Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Excuse me.

(SCULLY gets up from the table and goes out of the office with SKINNER's ASSISTANT.)

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: It's Agent Mulder, and he said it's urgent.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, where are you?

MULDER: (quietly, on phone) I'm at the bank.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, I know where you are, but what's taking so long?

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, I need you to do something for me right now.

CUT TO: (Street in front of bank. Pam is sitting in the car. Her watch says 9:55. SCULLY knocks at the window showing her badge.)

SCULLY: Ma'am, will you come with me?

PAM: Why?

SCULLY: Just come with me, please.

PAM: What's this about?

SCULLY: My partner said you'd know.

(Inside the bank BERNARD is writing his note. "This is a robbery. Put the money in the bag. No alarm. No tricks." MULDER places his gun on top of the note.)

MULDER: (quietly) Take it. I'm a federal agent. I don't want us all to die in here.

BERNARD: What are you talking about?

MULDER: You've got a girlfriend outside in the car and you've got a bomb. Something very bad is going to happen here today and I want you to know that I'm not going to let it happen. But if you walk out that door right now I'm not going to stop you. You're in charge here, Bernard.

BERNARD: You're damn right.

MULDER: You could change your fate.

(BERNARD struggles with the thought for a moment, then sighs, picks up the gun and aims it at the customers.)

BERNARD: Everybody down! Now! You know what this is!

WOMAN WHO UNFORTUNATELY NEVER GOT SLAPPED: No! Oh, god!

BERNARD: Get down!

MULDER: If you don't believe me, ask her.

(SCULLY and PAM enter. SCULLY draws her gun and steps in front of PAM.)

SCULLY: Drop it!

BERNARD: Get away from her, Pam.

PAM: (to MULDER) This isn't gonna work. You can't be in here.

SCULLY: Drop it now!

BERNARD: You drop it.

MULDER: Listen to me, Bernard...

BERNARD: You get her out of here.

MULDER: You get her out of here. You're dooming her. You're making her live this day over and over again-- her, you, me, all of us.

BERNARD: What the hell are you talking about?

MULDER: Every day you die in here and every day it starts all over again. You can't want this for her. It's hell!

BERNARD: Hell? I'm doing this for her.

PAM: Listen to him, Bernard.

BERNARD: (to SCULLY) Put your damn gun down!

MULDER: Put your gun down, Scully. Trust me, it's the only way to get out of here. You got to put your gun down and let them out. He's got a bomb.

(After a long hesitation, SCULLY kneels down and puts her gun on the floor.)

PAM: (crying) Come on, Bernard. Let's go.

(Sirens are heard approaching.)

BERNARD: You son of a bitch!

(BERNARD aims his gun at MULDER.)

PAM: No!

(PAM throws herself in front of MULDER and takes the bullet in her shoulder and falls to the ground. BERNARD, shocked, lets the gun fall to the floor and then drops to his knees. MULDER handcuffs him. SCULLY checks PAM's pulse and then steps away to call 911. MULDER kneels down beside PAM.)

SCULLY: (on phone) This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI

PAM: (to MULDER, a look of wonder on her face) This never happened before.

(PAM's eyes slowly close.)



SCENE 8

(MULDER's apartment hallway. Paperboy delivers paper against MULDER's door. It wakes him up from where he is sleeping  on his couch! He is wearing a gray shirt and dark plaid pajama bottoms. The phone rings and he answers it.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?

(SCULLY is sitting at the desk in the X-Files office playing with the wind-up chattering teeth.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me.

(Mulder looks at his watch. Tuesday 7:20. He gets up and goes to get his paper.)

MULDER: (on phone) I'm late again, aren't I, Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, not yet but Skinner wants to see us in his office as soon as possible. He's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday.

MULDER: (on phone) I'll be there in an hour.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'd like to hear it, too.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, you were there, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) That's not what I mean. You still won't explain what happened yesterday-- how you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives.

MULDER: (on phone) Call it a feeling.

SCULLY: (on phone) And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car?

MULDER: (on phone, looking at the paper) I don't think she was an accomplice. I think she was just trying to get away.

SCULLY: (on phone) Are you okay?

MULDER: (on phone) I'll be there in an hour.

(MULDER hangs up and sets the paper down on the couch. One of the headlines is above a smiling picture of PAM. "Woman Dies in Robbery Attempt")

[Fade to black]

[THE END]

                                 ARCADIA



SCENE 1
SAN DIEGO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

(An ornate sign for the gated entrance for an upscale housing development, The Falls at Arcadia. A man, DAVE KLINE, drives his SUV up to the computer keypad that opens the gate. He doesn't pull close enough and, irritated, he has to open his car door to reach the pad.)

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Welcome to The Falls. Please enter your code now. Welcome to the Falls. Please enter your code now.

(DAVE finally gets his code pushed in, the buzzer sounds and the gate opens.)

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE: Welcome home, Mr. Kline.

(He drives through the gate and into the development. All the houses and lawns are perfectly and identically maintained. DAVE smiles and waves at a neighbor working in the yard, but drops the smile quickly as soon as he is out of view. He pulls into his driveway in front of the three car garage. DAVE gets out of his car and goes to the mailbox with "THE KLINES" written on the side. As he opens it, he jerks his hand back wet with fresh paint. Another neighbor, WIN SHROEDER , is standing nearby smiling and holding a paint can and brush.)

WIN SHROEDER: (friendly) Oops. Did you get some on you, Dave? [Closed captioning said: "That should wash out with a little turpentine."] Sorry about that, Dave. (holding up the paint and brush) Just trying to be neighborly. Got to be up to code.

(DAVE KLINE, gives a forced smile, then irritated, gets his mail including a medium-sized package. Leaving the mailbox open, he goes into the house. [Closed captioning: DAVE KLINE: Jerk.] WIN SHROEDER comes over and carefully touches up the inside lip of the box. Inside the house, DAVE KLINE goes into the kitchen where his wife, NANCY KLINE is arranging flowers in a vase. He slams the package down on the counter.)

DAVE KLINE: (angry) Shroeder's out there painting our mailbox! You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to paint the whole damn house pink.

NANCY KLINE: Dave.

DAVE KLINE: (getting a beer out of the refrigerator) Forget about the mailbox, huh? I'm going to make this whole damn place look like you won it selling cosmetics. How about that? That'll show these Nazis.

NANCY KLINE: Honey, would you just calm down. Rules are rules.

DAVE KLINE: They're repainting our mailbox because it's "Desert Sienna" instead of "Desert Sage." I mean, this guy is a freakin' weirdo.

NANCY KLINE: Hon... what's that package?

DAVE KLINE: I don't know. It doesn't say who sent it.

(He unwraps it. It is a VERY tacky whirligig with a little man who chops wood as the wind blows the propeller.)

NANCY KLINE: Whoa.

DAVE KLINE: Tasteful.

(They both laugh. NANCY KLINE twirls the propeller.)

NANCY KLINE: Boy, the neighbors would really hate that.

(DAVE KLINE considers that. Later that night, the whirligig is on the front lawn twirling and tapping away. DAVE KLINE and NANCY KLINE are in bed asleep. The tapping of the whirligig stops. A breeze moves the curtains. Spooky.) NANCY KLINE: Honey... What is it?

(There is the sound of heavy footsteps and the floor creaking downstairs.)

DAVE KLINE: Stay here.

(He turns on the light, gets out of the bed and picks up a bowling/golf? trophy and holds it like a club. He goes downstairs and looks around. He sees large dirty footprints on the white carpet. We see something very large coming up behind him. He turns and begins screaming at the sight of Mr. Hankey attacking him. Well, at least it's really big, brown and slimy. DAVE KLINE screams. Upstairs, NANCY KLINE is huddled in bed, terrified, listening to the screams and thumps below.)

NANCY KLINE: Dave? Honey?!

(A glass of water beside her shakes with the vibrations. The screaming stops and the heavy footsteps come up the stairs. The large what-ever-it is enters the bedroom. NANCY KLINE begins screaming. The light in the bedroom goes out.)

SCENE 2
SEVEN MONTHS LATER

(A woman, PAT VERLANDER, is standing in front of the KLINE's old house. She is holding a VERY large cellophane wrapped basket with a ribbon saying "Welcome Neighbors" on it. She looks rather nervous. The name on the mailbox now reads "THE PETRIES." A blue minivan and a white moving truck drive up house. MULDER and SCULLY get out of the van. MULDER is in a pink Izod shirt and has a dark sweater tied around his shoulders. SCULLY is in a dark embroidered cardigan and a dark skirt. Very preppy. Throughout the episode when MULDER and SCULLY are in front of others they act like a very friendly yuppie couple, always smiling. Little looks slip through, though. Well done by the actors.)

MULDER: Wow. Take a look at this. Honey, what do you think? Is this place us or what? [Closed captioning also has: "Check this out, sweetie."]

(SCULLY just smiles and joins him as they walk up to PAT VERLANDER.)

PAT VERLANDER: (very friendly) You must be the Petries. Hi. Welcome. Welcome to The Falls.

(She puts the huge basket into SCULLY's arms and giggles nervously.)

MULDER: (shaking her hand) I'm Rob... (puts his hands affectionately on SCULLY's shoulders) ... and this is my lovely wife, Laura.

PAT VERLANDER: Rob and Laura Petrie.

SCULLY: We pronounce it "Pee-trie," actually.

PAT VERLANDER: Oh.

MULDER: Like the dish.

PAT VERLANDER: Well, it's so nice to meet you. I'm Pat Verlander. I live six doors down. I'm the neighborhood welcome wagon.

SCULLY: (struggling with the large basket that MULDER makes no move to help her with) Pleased to make your acquaintance, Pat.

PAT VERLANDER: (looking at her watch, very concerned) I really must say, it's already ten after 5:00. I don't think you're going to make it.

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

PAT VERLANDER: The 6:00 cutoff? All move-ins are required to be completed by 6:00 p.m. (MULDER and SCULLY look at her blankly.) It's in the CC&Rs. It's one of our rules.

(MULDER, SCULLY and PAT VERLANDER enter the house. It is sparkling clean.)

MULDER: Wow. The photos did not do it justice.

(Behind them, some other neighbors are already bringing in boxes and pieces of furniture.)

PAT VERLANDER: (quietly, to other neighbors) Guys, fast, fast now. Come on.

(MULDER smiles down at SCULLY, and pats her on the shoulders. She turns, probably expecting him to help her with the heavy basket, but he turns away looking at the house. She pauses a moment, then sets the basket down on a chair that someone has just carried in.)

MULDER: The previous owners left it so clean.

PAT VERLANDER: What do you do for a living Mr... Petrie? That's right, isn't it?

MULDER: (big grin, putting his arm around SCULLY's shoulders and hugging her) Yeah, I, uh... I work mostly at home which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself.

PAT VERLANDER: (laughing) Oh.

SCULLY: This place really is immaculate, Pat. I, uh, I wouldn't mind sending a thank-you note to the previous owners.

PAT VERLANDER: Th-that's sweet. Um... Good.

(PAT VERLANDER runs nervously out the door. As soon as she is out of view, SCULLY shrugs MULDER's arm off her shoulders, raises her hands slightly and gives him a warning look. MULDER nods. They hear voices outside.)

MAN: (outside) Hurry up! Come on... Come on...

(MULDER and SCULLY go back out the door. At the van, 10 or so neighbors are handing items down off the truck and carrying them into the house.)

MAN: Okay, move it, people. Come on.

(MULDER and SCULLY encounter WIN SHROEDER just outside on his way in with a chair on his head. They talk through the bars on the seat back.)

WIN SHROEDER: Rob and Laura Petrie.

MULDER: Yep.

SCULLY: "Pee-trie."

WIN SHROEDER: Win Shroeder, next-door neighbor. Welcome home.

MULDER: Hi, Win. Nice to meet you.

WIN SHROEDER: Now, don't you folks worry. We'll have you moved in before 6:00. (to another neighbor over his shoulder) Time?!

GORDY: 5:19.

WIN SHROEDER: (pushing past MULDER and SCULLY and entering the house) Uh... pardon me, neighbor.

(The other neighbors quickly pass with boxes and items of furniture. They all smile and nod at MULDER and SCULLY as they pass.)

MULDER: Thank you. Thanks. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.

(At the truck, SCULLY sees BIG MIKE, a rather large sweet-faced man, picking up a box marked "china." SCULLY, nervous, runs to him and tries to get him to put the box down.)

SCULLY: Excuse me! I'll get that. It's okay.

BIG MIKE: No. No, don't be silly. It's heavy. I got it.

(He hoists the box to his shoulder where it promptly rolls off and falls to the ground with the shatter of breaking glass. BIG MIKE is mortified.)

BIG MIKE: Oh, no. I'm... I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry.

(A woman, CAMI SHROEDER, comes over quickly.)

CAMI SHROEDER: (soothing) Mike. Mike, Mike, Mike, it's okay. It's okay, Mike. Go help Gordy.

BIG MIKE: Send me any bills. I'm... I'm sorry.

(As BIG MIKE goes to help someone else, CAMI SHROEDER helps SCULLY carry the box to the house.)

CAMI SHROEDER: I'm Cami Shroeder, by the way. Win's wife.

SCULLY: Nice to meet you. I'm Laura.

(MULDER is standing at the back of the truck where the MOVER is pulling out a portable basketball goal.)

MOVER: Yeah. Where's this go?

MULDER: Uh, you can put that in the driveway.

WIN SHROEDER: (running up) Whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on. Let's... let's talk. Um... A b-ball fan, huh? Shooting hoops-- that's, um, that's not good. That's going to stand out in your front yard over there.

MULDER: Stand out, Win?

WIN SHROEDER: Well, as in, uh... not be aesthetically pleasing... to the eye. But, hey, you know, maybe you can get special dispensation from Mr. Gogolak, president of our Homeowner's Association. I'd take it up with him but in the meantime, um... let's keep that in the garage. (chuckles nervously)

MULDER: (unsure what else to say) Just... put it in the garage.

WIN SHROEDER: Okay. Let's finish getting you folks moved in. Let's go, people. Let's move! Move!

(Later, time on MULDER'S Omega watch face is 5:59 pm. Date on the watch is the 7th. Hmm. Moving truck pulls away. MULDER stands in the doorway, arm around SCULLY and they wave at the smiling departing neighbors. As soon as the door is closed, SCULLY walks into the living room.)

MULDER: Oh, yeah. Nothing weird going on around here. (following SCULLY) Hey... ooh, wait a minute. You didn't let me carry you over the threshold.

(SCULLY takes off her coat and faces MULDER.)

SCULLY: You ready?

MULDER: Let's get it on, honey.

SCULLY: (smiles) All right, then.

(She hands him a pair of latex gloves and goes to the box that BIG MIKE dropped and opens it. Sound of glass rattling. She pulls out a piece of broken lab equipment and sighs.)

SCULLY: Thanks to our friendly neighbors there will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement.

(MULDER is down on the floor pulling up a corner of the carpeting.)

MULDER: Not that it makes much difference. This place is so clean you could build computer chips.

(SCULLY takes out a small video camera and turns it on. She begins walking through the first floor of the house, taping and narrating as she goes.)

SCULLY: Okay. 6:01 p.m., February 24. Agents Scully and Mulder in the former home of David and Nancy Kline who disappeared without a trace last July. The Klines were the third such couple to disappear since this neighborhood was built in 1991. All were apparently stable professional people with no history of violence, domestic discord or mental illness and it took a family member or employee to realize that they were gone including their cars and a few personal items. What local police found in each case was nothing-- just impeccably-manicured homes and a community of neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared.

MULDER: That's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly.

SCULLY: The local police departments were at a dead end so they turned to the FBI. AD Skinner, in assigning us this case thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be if we went undercover posing as prospective home buyers as this planned community would seem to hide a dark, possibly murderous conspiracy of silence.

(MULDER comes very close into the video frame.)

MULDER: (seductively) You want to make that honeymoon video now?

(SCULLY turns the camera off. MULDER sits on the kitchen counter and pulls his gloves off.)

SCULLY: Rob and Laura Petrie?

MULDER: "Pee-trie."

SCULLY: Mulder, if we ever go undercover again I get to choose the names, okay?

MULDER: Fine.

SCULLY: It just tells me that you're not taking this seriously.

MULDER: I'm taking it seriously. I just don't understand why we're on it. It's our first catch back on the X-Files. This isn't an X-File.

SCULLY: Sure it is. It's unexplained. What do you want, aliens? Tractor beams?

MULDER: Wow. Admit it: you just want to play house.

(Doorbell rings. SCULLY gives him a look and starts for the door.)

MULDER: (demanding) Woman, get back in here and make me a sandwich!

(SCULLY stops, smiles slightly and snaps off her gloves and throws them at his head and continues on to the door.)

MULDER: Did I not make myself clear?

(SCULLY answers the door with a big smile. It is BIG MIKE holding a hastily filled box of china.)

SCULLY: Hi. Well, you didn't need to do that.

BIG MIKE: Oh, please. I have more dishes than I need. I just usually use one and then... wash it. (SCULLY smiles) Uh... I'm... uh, Mike Raskub, by the way.

SCULLY: (shaking his hand) Hi.

BIG MIKE: Big Mike, for obvious reasons. I just live the next street over.

(SCULLY notices that he is wearing a caduceus necklace.)

SCULLY: Oh. That's a caduceus. Are you a doctor, Mike?

BIG MIKE: No, a vet. Veterinarian. If you folks are thinking about getting a dog or any pet I'd be happy to check it out for you, no charge. Just, uh... you're not allowed to have over 16 pounds of pet. That's one of the CC&Rs.

SCULLY: Mighty nice of you, Mike. I, uh ... gosh, with all this hospitality, I can't believe the Klines ever left. (BIG MIKE looks very uncomfortable.) That, uh... that was their name, wasn't it? The, uh, the Klines?

BIG MIKE: I have to go.

(He hands her the box of china, then turns and leaves quickly. SCULLY closes the door and goes back to where MULDER is scraping something off the top of one of the ceiling fan blades. She sets the china on the floor.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: The name ... is Rob.

SCULLY: What you got there?

(MULDER puts the scraping into a plastic evidence bag and shows it to SCULLY. It is dark brown, about an inch wide.)

MULDER: Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot. That look like blood to you?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. (they look up at the fan) How'd it get way up there?



SCENE 3
GOGOLAK RESIDENCE
7:49 PM

(GENE GOGOLAK's house. Several of the neighbors are sitting around the dining table. The host GENE GOGOLAK, is a distinguished older looking man. Dinner is almost over. They are drinking coffee.)

PAT VERLANDER: I, uh... didn't really learn much about them. He just said he works at home, which tells me she's got money.

CAMI SHROEDER: Well... seemed nice. Cute couple.

BIG MIKE: Mmm, very cute. Uh, they're a nice couple.

WIN SHROEDER: What do you think, Gene?

GENE GOGOLAK: Ladies, my compliments to the chef.

PAT VERLANDER: (blushing, looking pleased) Cami? Sissy?

(PAT VERLANDER, CAMI SHROEDER, and the other woman collect the plates and leave the room.)

GENE GOGOLAK: These Petries, are they going to play ball?

WIN SHROEDER: "Pee-tries." Uh, so far, so good. I'm keeping my eye on them.

BIG MIKE: (nervous) Um... Mr. Gogolak... (takes a breath) Don't you think that, uh... maybe this time it would be better if we told them?

WIN SHROEDER: (warning) Mike... you and I have been through this before. We... we don't know yet if we can trust them.

BIG MIKE: It's just that... There are so many... so many rules. I think that maybe they would be able to keep up with them better if they knew what happened if they don't. It's the neighborly thing to do. I really think we should do this.

GENE GOGOLAK: (looking at him steadily) Son... Godspeed.

BIG MIKE: (relieved) Thank you. Um... can I, uh, use your...?

GENE GOGOLAK: Second door to the left.

(BIG MIKE gets up and heads for the bathroom.)

GENE GOGOLAK: (calling after him) There's Glade under the sink. Gordy, how about you go make sure he finds it.

(GORDY, nods and goes after BIG MIKE. WIN SHROEDER and GENE GOGOLAK are alone in the dining room.)

WIN SHROEDER: Gene? I can talk him out of this.

GENE GOGOLAK: Win. (Closed captioning said: When?) The boy's a weak link and a strong chain can't survive with a weak link.

(WIN SHROEDER is not pleased, but reluctantly accepts what GENE GOGOLAK has said.)



SCENE 4

(Later that evening. Light in the front yard is on. BIG MIKE is alone in his house watching a documentary on some primitive tribe. They are heavily painted and wear masks and are chanting and dancing around a fire.)

DOCUMENTARY NARRATOR: ... is instinctive and necessary for survival. Failure to conform within the tribal structure can often prove lethal. When group elders suspect such an outcast within their midst tribal members gather in a circle to perform a ritual chant in the belief this will expose the unwitting conduit of evil. The chanters eventually settle on the so-called misfit and he or she ... [Closed captioning continues: ..."is punished severely, sometimes with death."]

(BIG MIKE hears a sound outside, and looks out to see that the light in the front yard is out.)

BIG MIKE: (jumping up and running to get a new bulb) Oh, no.

(Outside, new bulb in hand, he runs to the lamp. The old bulb is shattered. As he goes frantically to unscrew it, he cuts himself.)

BIG MIKE: Agh!

(Behind him, there is movement under the ground. Desperately, BIG MIKE ignores the pain in his hand and manages to get the old bulb out and the new one in.)

BIG MIKE: Come on. Come on. Come on. Ah, yes.

(He sighs in relief and shakes some blood off of his wounded hand. We hear heavy footsteps. Behind him, we see the large dark slimy figure coming close. BIG MIKE turns around in horror.)

BIG MIKE: No... No... No, I fixed it! I fixed it!

(Mike screams, and we see LOTS of blood splatter onto his doormat, Welcome to Mike's Place. Eww.)



SCENE 5

(Next morning, WIN SHROEDER is using a garden hose to spray the blood off of BIG MIKE's porch. He looks sad. MULDER and SCULLY come up to him with the box of china.

MULDER: Morning.

WIN SHROEDER: Oh! Oh, Rob, Laura. ("accidentally?" sprays their legs with the hose) I'm so sorry. So, good morning. So how was your first night? Peaceful?

MULDER: (looking fondly at SCULLY) Oh, it was wonderful. We just spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats. Isn't that right, Honeybunch?

SCULLY: (forced smile) That's right, Poopyhead. Win, are we in the right place? I thought this was Big Mike's house.

WIN SHROEDER: Yeah... Yeah. I'm just helping out. Mike had to leave town on business.

SCULLY: What kind of business? I thought he was a veterinarian.

WIN SHROEDER: (smiles, pause) Veterinarian business, I guess. I just know he's gone weeks at a time.

MULDER: (indicating the box of dishes) I'll just leave this here then.

WIN SHROEDER: (stopping him) Let me take those. Just... tidier-looking than leaving them on the front porch.

MULDER: Be more aesthetically pleasing, huh?

WIN SHROEDER: Exactly. Say, would you two like to join Cami and me for dinner this evening? ABOUT 6:00? We eat early.

SCULLY: That sounds great. Thanks.

WIN SHROEDER: Great.

(MULDER puts his arm around SCULLY's shoulders and they start to leave. MULDER turns back.)

MULDER: Oh, Win uh, you mentioned, uh... that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop? Who was that again? Mr. Gogolak, was it?

(WIN SHROEDER forces a smile.)



SCENE 6

(GENE GOGOLAK's house. There are lots of statues and tribal looking decorations around. GENE GOGOLAK is looking through the large rule book for The Falls at Arcadia. MULDER and SCULLY sit on the couch very close together. MULDER has his arm wrapped around her shoulders and his other hand on her arm. Very cuddly.)

GENE GOGOLAK: All right, then, let's see. Basketball hoop and backboard. Portable. Nope, I'm sorry. It's not allowed.

MULDER: You're kidding?

GENE GOGOLAK: I'm afraid not. Rules are rules. It may not sound like anything-- a simple basketball hoop-- but from there, it's just a few short steps to spinning daisy reflectors and a bass boat in the driveway.

MULDER: In other words, anarchy.

GENE GOGOLAK: It may sound tough but ours is a system that works. (he reverently places the book on a stand - like for a Bible or Atlas) That's why The Falls is one of the top-ranked planned communities in all of California. Most of our homeowners have been here since day one.

(SCULLY pats MULDER's hand affectionately, then looks like she realized what she did and pulls her hand back embarassed. Very cute.)

MULDER: I love the decor here, Mr. Gogolak. Is it, um... Occidental?

GENE GOGOLAK: Well, it's, uh, Nepalese and Tibetan, mostly. I go there twice a year on business.

MULDER: Oh.

GENE GOGOLAK: I run Pier 9 Imports. I can get you a great deal on rattan furniture if you're interested. Indoor only. Outdoor use is prohibited by our ... (pats the book) ... CC&Rs.

(MULDER and SCULLY nod.)



SCENE 7
SCROEDER RESIDENCE
6:37 PM

(SHROEDER's house. MULDER and SCULLY are having dinner with the SHROEDERs. White wine and tuna casserole. A small yappy dog is begging at the table. Definitely under the 16 pounds of pet limit.)

WIN SHROEDER: Uh-uh, Scruffy. Go on, now. Sweetheart? Did you use the dolphin-safe tuna this time?

CAMI SHROEDER: Dolphin-safe all the way, Honey.

WIN SHROEDER: We always use the dolphin-safe.

MULDER: (eating) You've got to love those dolphins ... although they're pretty tasty, too.

(After a beat of shocked silence, SCULLY laughs nervously.)

WIN SHROEDER: So... Where'd you two meet?

(SCULLY is about to say something, probably what they had agreed on would be the cover story, but MULDER speaks first.)

MULDER: Actually, it was at a UFO conference.

WIN SHROEDER: Flying saucers? Interesting. Wouldn't have thought you folks would have been into that.

MULDER: (putting his arm around SCULLY) Well, it's not me so much as Laura. She's quite the New-Ager. I mean, she's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings, what have you. I mean, God bless her she's a sucker for all that stuff.

CAMI SHROEDER: Well, I wouldn't have guessed that, would you?

WIN SHROEDER: Mm-mm.

SCULLY: (fake smile) No kidding.

MULDER: Yeah. You know, Win, uh, when you, uh... when you told me this morning that Big Mike was out of town on business ... I don't think that's true.

WIN SHROEDER: You don't?

MULDER: Mmm. No, 'cause we called his office, didn't we, Honey?

SCULLY: We did.

MULDER: Yeah.

(WIN SHROEDER clears throat uncomfortably.)

MULDER: We're thinking about getting a dog so we wanted to call him and ask him his advice, whatever, and see if maybe his office had a forwarding number and they said, you know...

SCULLY: That he wasn't there. They didn't know where he was.

MULDER: Yeah.

(Pause.)

SCULLY: Do you know where he is, Win?

(CAMI SHROEDER looks at her husband.)

WIN SHROEDER: (uncomfortable laugh) Really couldn't tell you.

MULDER: Mmm. It's got to be something really freaky-deaky, hunh? I mean, for him to lie about it like that? Maybe he's got some wild secret life going on.

(Looks at SCULLY and they share a small laugh. CAMI SHROEDER looks very uncomfortable.)

MULDER: But every community has its dark underbelly don't you think?

WIN SHROEDER: (defensively) We don't have any underbelly. As far as I'm concerned this community is the American Dream.

(MULDER nods.)

CAMI SHROEDER: Um... I'm sorry. I, um... realize that it's past time that I walk Scruffy.

SCULLY: Would you like company?

CAMI SHROEDER: Yeah.

(MULDER and WIN SHROEDER stand as the women get up. MULDER moves to embrace and kiss SCULLY but she quickly kisses the air a few inches away from his face and steps away. MULDER grins. The men sit back down and SCULLY and CAMI SHROEDER go outside with the dog. It is dark as they walk down the street.)

SCULLY: So is this the American dream? This place?

CAMI SHROEDER: (not sounding sure of herself) Oh, uh... nice neighborhood, you know... just a lot of people who want the best for their families.

SCULLY: So it's just not your dream. (CAMI SHROEDER shrugs) You know, Cami, I-I've noticed that you've, uh, walked us past Mike's house... twice. Are you worried about him?

CAMI SHROEDER: No... I don't really know what you mean.

(The dog hears something, gets loose and runs into a storm drain.)

CAMI SHROEDER: Scruffy! Scruffy, come here! Scruffy, no! Scruffy! Come out here! (barking) Scruffy! Scruffy, come out of there. (barking continues)

(SCULLY turns on her flashlight and kneels down beside CAMI SHROEDER to look in the drain.)

SCULLY: . Let me take a look.

CAMI SHROEDER: Do you see him?

SCULLY: Uh-uh.

(SCULLY sees BIG MIKE's caduceus necklace. Her arm is not long enough to get it. As she reaches for it, the dog comes running back out of the drain. CAMI SHROEDER picks up the trembling dog.)

CAMI SHROEDER: Oh, Scruffy, Scruffy, it's okay, it's okay. I got you. I got you. Oh...

SCULLY: (to dog) What you got there?

CAMI SHROEDER: Deep breath. That's a close one, huh? Yeah?

(The dog's muzzle has brown gunk on it. SCULLY takes out a handkerchief and wipes some of it off.)

SCULLY: Let me wipe that off. That's a good boy.

CAMI SHROEDER: Okay, let's get you home. Come on.

(As they walk back to the house, someone/thing raises the drain cover and watches them.)



SCENE 8

(Later that night. "Petrie" household. MULDER and SCULLY are in the bedroom. SCULLY is in plain white pajamas and robe. She is on the phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) All right, Lieutenant.

(MULDER, dressed all in black, shows her BIG MIKE's necklace which he has removed from the drain and placed in a plastic bag.)

MULDER: (whisper) Here. Caduceus.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you. (hangs up and looks at the necklace) Local PD came up blank on...

(She pauses as MULDER, having taken off his sweatshirt, tosses it across the room to a chair barely missing her head. We see a little of his chest, but then the gray t-shirt is pulled back down. Darn.)

SCULLY: Mike Raskub. No activity on his credit cards. No sighting of his '97 Mercury Villager.

(SCULLY goes into the bathroom while MULDER reads the screen on the laptop.)

MULDER: Yeah, there's no sign of him in his house. I didn't see him in the storm drain, either. I take it he's dead, Scully.

SCULLY: (from the bathroom) Laura.

(MULDER sarcastically mouths "Okay.")

SCULLY: (from the bathroom) Think it's Win Shroeder?

MULDER: (looking at the bagged handkerchief) Mmm, maybe Win cleaning up.

SCULLY: (from the bathroom) Cleaning up for who?

MULDER: I don't know.

SCULLY: (from the bathroom) Mulder, speaking of cleaning up whoever taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste?

(She sticks her arm out from the bathroom showing him the tube squeezed in the middle. MULDER ignores it.)

MULDER: Hey, what do we know about this stuff?

SCULLY: (from the bathroom) I'm driving down to San Diego tomorrow and have it analyzed.

MULDER: All right.

SCULLY: (From the bathroom) Third warning: (sound of toilet seat falling) Toilet seat. (toilet flushes)

(MULDER glances at the bathroom, then goes over to the bed and sprawls out on it.)

MULDER: Why kill Big Mike?

(SCULLY comes out of the bathroom. She has a terrycloth headband and her face is covered in a bright green mud mask. MULDER looks up and is startled by her appearance. Very funny.)

MULDER: Whoa!

SCULLY: What's missing here is intent. What would be the motive?

(She throws the sweatshirt at his head.)

MULDER: Compulsive neatness, or a lack thereof. Have you noticed how everybody around here is obsessed with the neighborhood rules and the CC&Rs? You know what? You fit in really well here.

SCULLY: (pointedly looking at him lying on the bed) And you don't.

MULDER: (adjusting the pillows to make himself more comfortable) Well, anyway, tomorrow I got a, uh, a surefire way of testing out my theory.

(He puts the bed beside him seductively and waggles his eyebrows at her. She raises her eyebrows at him.)

MULDER: (coaxing) Come on, Laura, you know... we're married now.

SCULLY: Scully, Mulder. Good night.

(MULDER gets up from the bed taking a pillow. He pauses next to her.)

MULDER: The thrill is gone.

(As he heads off to sleep wherever it is he's going to sleep, SCULLY sighs and goes to the bed.)



SCENE 9

(Next day. MULDER carries a pink plastic flamingo outside and stands it up in the front yard. He looks around confidently and pumps his fists.)

MULDER: Bring it on.

(He goes back inside and goes to the refrigerator and gets a carton of Tropicana orange juice and takes a drink right from the carton. He then goes to the window and sees that the flamingo has already been removed. He goes outside and over to the mailbox. He kicks it hard several times until it is leaning over. He opens it and pulls up the flag. Then as an afterthought he tosses some of the orange juice on it. Remember, that is Tropicana orange juice, official orange juice of the X-Files. He goes back inside and sits at a window to watch the mailbox. And drink Tropicana orange juice. Time on his Omega watch is 1:55. Date is the ninth. Hmmm. Should be Feruary 26th. Time passes. 4:55. He has now finished the carton of orange juice and really has to pee. He shifts around uncomfortably, then starts to make a wider opening in the carton, then looks over his shoulder, thinks better of it and goes to the bathroom. We hear a toilet flush, ... then he goes back to the window. The mailbox has been righted and cleaned. He goes outside. The flag is still up and he opens the box. Inside, there is a folded piece of paper which says "Be like the others... before it gets dark." He looks around and crumples the paper.)

10:37 PM

(Later that night, there is the sound of a basketball being bounced. WIN SHROEDER and CAMI SHROEDER come out of their house in their robes and stare in shock at MULDER who has set up his basketball goal and is shooting hoops.)

WIN SHROEDER: Stay here.

CAMI SHROEDER: (desperate) Stop him, Win.

WIN SHROEDER: Stay here!

CAMI SHROEDER: Stop him!

(WIN SHROEDER angrily marches over to MULDER.)

MULDER: Hey, Win. Want to play "horse"? (tosses the ball to him)

WIN SHROEDER: What the hell are you doing? (takes MULDER's basketball and throws it to the side)

MULDER: What am I doing?

(WIN SHROEDER grabs the goal and starts to tilt it over so he can roll it back into the garage.)

MULDER: (stepping on the goal to keep it upright) What are you doing?

WIN SHROEDER: Damn it, Rob, get off of it! Help me get this thing inside.

MULDER: Why? What's going to happen if we don't?

WIN SHROEDER: Fine. That's the way you want it?

[Closed captioning:]

MULDER: It's just a basketball hoop, Win. I don't understand why you're getting all bent out of shape.

WIN SHROEDER: The CC&Rs don't allow it. You know that.

MULDER: What's the worst thing that could happen? I get fined?]

(The ground moves slightly behind CAMI SHROEDER next door where she is nervously waiting outside.)

WIN SHROEDER: You were warned.

MULDER: Warned about what?

CAMI SHROEDER: (screaming) No! No! Please!

(Next door, a large figure is coming at CAMI SHROEDER. MULDER leaves WIN SHROEDER and runs over and sees the figure as it runs off.)

MULDER: Stop!

(MULDER loses sight of it. CAMI SHROEDER, still frightened, is sobbing.)

MULDER: Cami... you all right?

(WIN SHROEDER has joined them, and they look up at the yard light, which like BIG MIKE's was, is broken.)



SCENE 10

(Short time later. The basketball goal is dragged into the garage and the door is closed. SCULLY pulls the minivan into the driveway and carries a shopping bag into the house. [Anyone recognize the store?] She goes to the living room and pulls out the test results. From the upper floor, she hears a thump.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(There is another muffled bang and then the sound of footsteps.)

SCULLY: Mulder, is that you?

(SCULLY takes the poker from the fireplace stand behind her and holding it like a weapon goes upstairs to investigate. Outside, MULDER is looking around the yard. He trips as his foot breaks through the sod. He pulls the sod back revealing a large hole. Inside, SCULLY, now upstairs hears a sound downstairs. As she is coming back downstairs we see someone running past on the upper hallway. She glances up, but sees nothing. She hears another sound downstairs and slowly makes her way to the foot of the stairs and swings the poker at the approaching figure. MULDER ducks and grabs her arm just before she hits him.)

MULDER: Scull...!

(They both gasp in relief.)

SCULLY: Sorry, Mulder. Somebody was in the house.

MULDER: Tidying up. Whoever it was, they put away my basketball hoop. Somebody's looking out after us, Scully which may not be a bad thing.

(SCULLY follows him upstairs.)

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: I got a look at that thing that's been scaring everybody and I take it back. This is an X-File.

CUT TO:

(GENE GOGOLAK's house. He is looking at the broken bulb from the SCHROEDER's light. WIN SHROEDER is very upset.)

GENE GOGOLAK: How's Cami?

WIN SHROEDER: (not pleased) What did we do wrong, Gene? Was our welcome mat not to your liking? Did I coil my garden hose clockwise instead of counterclockwise?

GENE GOGOLAK: Hold the phone, now. Are you saying that I had something to do with this?

WIN SHROEDER: Who else? The exact same thing-- the thing you had me do to Mike. Who else would do that?

GENE GOGOLAK: Son, you'll want to take a deep breath... and rethink that theory. It's your next-door neighbor, Win. He's a rabble-rouser. He's trouble with a capital "T." And you and I both know it only takes one rotten apple to spoil the whole bunch.

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY in their front yard. While SCULLY holds the flashlight for him, MULDER pulls up a layer of sod and finds another hole with loose dirt.)

MULDER: Here we go. Yeah...I'm guessing there's one of these in every yard. I think this is how this thing travels-- where it lives.

SCULLY: (skeptical) In the ground. This huge creature you think you saw?

(They look at each other. SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, huge creatures aside do you care to hear what I think?

MULDER: (not quite sarcastic) Always.

(SCULLY smiles tightly and leads him back into the house to show him the test results she brought back.)

SCULLY: These are the lab results from the San Diego PD. First of all, the stuff that we found on the fan blade-- the dried blood and scalp hairs? It's neither. The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush and the same goes for the sample we found on the dog's muzzle. It's coffee grounds, eggshells and motor oil with about 50 other constituents with a little mercurochrome for color. In other words, Mulder, it's garbage. Which makes perfect sense because this entire neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill.

MULDER: A landfill?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere. It's just beneath the topsoil and that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas but... Mulder, I don't see how any of this has to do with the disappearances that we're investigating.

MULDER: It does. Somehow, it's one and the same. The Klines?

SCULLY: Yeah?

MULDER: What if they're still here

SCULLY: You mean buried in the yard? (MULDER nods.) Well, once we start a forensic excavation, our cover's blown.

(MULDER thinks.)



SCENE 11

(Next morning. As the other neighbors look on in horror, MULDER stands looking on as a backhoe begins ripping up the front yard. PAT VERLANDER runs up to him.)

PAT VERLANDER: (hysterical) What in God's name are you doing?! God...!

MULDER: Putting in a pool.

PAT VERLANDER: In the front yard?! Wh-wh-what are you, insane? Have you even looked at the CC&Rs? You-you can't just put in a swimming pool!

MULDER: (putting his finger to his lips) Ah... It's not a swimming pool. It's a reflecting pool. I checked the rules. (gets the book for reference) There's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool. It's very tranquil. You'd like it.

(PAT VERLANDER tries to speak, but sees GENE GOGOLAK with WIN SHROEDER watching from across the street. He nods to her and she runs back down the drive. MULDER waves to them.)

GENE GOGOLAK: (to WIN SHROEDER) Let him dig his own grave.

(Late that night. SCULLY comes out of the house and goes up to the edge of the very deep hole.)

SCULLY: (softly) Hey. Mulder.

(MULDER stands up from where he has been searching in the hole. He looks exhausted and like his back hurts.)

SCULLY: (gently) The Klines aren't down there. Maybe it's time you called it a night.

(MULDER looks up at the scoop of the backhoe. The tacky lawn ornament from the teaser is caught in the teeth of the scoop. He pulls it free and they look closely at it.)

MULDER: Tasteful, isn't it?

(There is a tag on it that says "Pier 9 Imports.")

MULDER: Gogolak. Hey, can you get an excavation team out here?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: We need to dig deeper.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To price some rattan furniture.

(MULDER goes across the street. SCULLY pulls out her cell phone and goes back into the house. Camera pans down into the hole and we see a dirty hand reaching up through a wet bubbling puddle of mud. Eww.)



SCENE 12

(SCULLY is in the bedroom. She dials her cell phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully. I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace.

(Outside we see large muddy feet walking into the house.)

SCULLY: (on phone) No, not tomorrow. Tonight.

(She hears a loud thud downstairs. Probably front door getting knocked down.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry. Can I call you back?

(She hangs up and reaches into her underwear drawer and pulls out her empty gun holster. She drops it back on the dresser.)

SCULLY: (under her breath, really worried) Jeez. [closed captioning: "Jesus."]

(She hears loud footsteps and we see the muddy feet walking up the stairs.)

SCULLY: (whisper) Oh, god.

(SCULLY slowly backs away from the closed bedroom door. A large figure comes up behind her. She screams, but it is muffled as a large dirty hand clamps over her mouth and her gun is held to her neck.)

BIG MIKE: It's come for you, Laura. You can't make a noise. Shh. Shh.

(He releases her and she turns quickly to see him. BIG MIKE looks bad. He is covered with filth and blood from several wounds. They whisper.)

SCULLY: Mike. Mike. What happened to you?

BIG MIKE: You have to get out of here.

SCULLY: Why?

(They hear a heavy thud downstairs. BIG MIKE begins pushing furniture in front of the bedroom door.)

SCULLY: What are you talking about? Who's downstairs?

BIG MIKE: Shh, shh, shh.

SCULLY: Mike... who did this to you?

BIG MIKE: The ubermenscher. It's our fault. The original homeowners-- we asked for it and now we can't stop it.

SCULLY: Stop what, Mike?

BIG MIKE: I tried to give it Shroeder. You know, tit-for-tat. Just like Shroeder did for me.

SCULLY: (calming tone) Mike, listen, settle down. Okay. Just give me my gun. I'm a federal agent...

BIG MIKE: The ubermenscher wants you, Laura. Your husband-- he's broken way too many rules. I've been hiding in the sewer. I tried to warn him.

(Something starts trying to break down the bedroom door. BIG MIKE pushes SCULLY behind him.)

SCULLY: Mike, just give me the gun. Give me...

(BIG MIKE pushes SCULLY into the closet, locks it and pulls the dresser in front of it. He turns and points the gun at the bedroom door. Something really big breaks in the bedroom door. SCULLY hears several gunshots then sounds of a violent fight and BIG MIKE screaming. Nasty stuff flys through the slats in the closet door. Eww.)

CUT TO:

(GENE GOGOLAK's house. MULDER handcuffs him.)

GENE GOGOLAK: FBI? What did I do?

MULDER: (pushes him into a chair) Let's start with the Klines. You're responsible for them being in little pieces in my front yard. You gave them that lawn ornament. The guy with the axe?

GENE GOGOLAK: Whirligig.

MULDER: Yeah, whirligig. It's tacky enough to break your rules and your CCRs-- tacky enough to mark the Klines for death.

GENE GOGOLAK: And won't that sound good in a court of law? When the judge asks you who killed the Klines what exactly are you going to tell him?

MULDER: (considers for a moment, looks around, then picks up a black statuette) A tulpa. It's a Tibetan thought-form. It's a living, breathing creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability-- an ability I think you picked up on your whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East. Why'd you do it? I mean, is it so damn important for everybody to have the same color mailbox?

GENE GOGOLAK: It's important that people fit in.

MULDER: But you didn't know exactly what you were getting into, did you? I mean, you can summon its existence, but ... you can give it life, but you can't control it. The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way.

GENE GOGOLAK: Son, my lawyers are going to make you sound so stupid that not only will I never see the inside of a jail cell but you'll be signing all your paychecks straight to me.

(MULDER leads GENE GOGOLAK out of the house and across the street. MULDER sees that the front door on his house is broken down. Not good. He handcuffs GENE GOGOLAK to the mailbox and runs into the house. WIN SHROEDER comes out of his house.)

WIN SHROEDER: Gene?

GENE GOGOLAK: Win. You've got two FBI agents living next door to you. Cheer up. It's not for long.

(MULDER enters the house. He sees really big dirty footprints leading upstairs.

MULDER: Scully? Scully?

(As he gets closer to the bedroom, the carnage gets worse. He's really worried. He looks around at the broken furniture and pieces of filth and worse spread out everywhere. Eww.)

MULDER: Scully?

(SCULLY pounds on the closet door.)

SCULLY: (in the closet) Mulder?

MULDER: Scully?

SCULLY: (in the closet, relieved) Mulder?

MULDER: Scully, hang on.

(MULDER pushes the dresser partially out of the way and begins helping her break the slats in the closet door. Outside, GENE GOGOLAK, still cuffed to the mailbox begins to look nervous and tries to get free.)

GENE GOGOLAK: Come here. Help me with this. Win, come here. Win...

(WIN SHROEDER hesitates. CAMI SHROEDER comes up.)

CAMI SHROEDER: (taking his arm) Win, Win, Win. No. No. He deserves what he gets.

(With a last look at GENE GOGOLAK, the SHROEDERs turn and walk back to their house. Inside, MULDER is still ripping away at the closet door.)

SCULLY: (in the closet) Mulder, it was here.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: "It attacked Big Mike. Where is he? Is he alive?"]

(They hear screaming outside.)

SCULLY: (in the closet) Mulder!

(Leaving SCULLY to finish getting herself out of the closet, MULDER runs back downstairs and outside. The big brown slimy thing is beating the ... daylights  out of GENE GOGOLAK. When it finishes with him, it turns and starts walking toward MULDER. MULDER backs away, staring at it in horror. Just as it reaches him, GENE GOGOLAK, lying bloody on the ground, breathes his last, and the big brown slimy thing crumbles into dirt. MULDER pokes in the remains of the monster with his toe. Looks like really nasty mud. Eww. SCULLY runs out onto the front porch.)



SCENE 13

(Day. Under the voiceover, MULDER and SCULLY, now dressed in their normal casual wear, come out of the house. MULDER tries to make the mailbox stand up straight, then he and SCULLY get in the minivan. Followed by the moving truck they pull out of the driveway and drive out of The Falls at Arcadia.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Several residents of the falls have now come forward to blame the deaths in the neighborhood on Home Owner Association President Gene Gogolak. These same residents deny Agent Mulder's allegations that they were in some sense all responsible for the demise of Gogolak himself claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him. It would seem the code of silence that hid the sins of this community has not only survived but-- in its creator-- claimed a final victim. Meanwhile, the Falls at Arcadia has been named one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running.

SCENE 1
FREIGHTER T'IEN KOU
PACIFI OCEAN
9:17 PM

(In cargo area of a ship. Two Asian crewmen, WOO and FONG, enter, speaking Cantonese. Holding a flashlight, WOO leads a nervous FONG up to one of the crates.)

WOO: (in Cantonese) Come on Fong. Don't be scared. Okay, here it is. I saw them load it in Hong Kong.

FONG: (in Cantonese) Tell me what you think is inside.

WOO: (in Cantonese) Yesterday I put my face close to the box. The thing inside tried to bite me.

FONG: (in Cantonese, not sure) Maybe it's a tiger.

(WOO carefully opens a hatch in the door of the crate and shines his light inside. Two glowing red eyes look back at him and we hear heavy breathing.)

WOO: (in Cantonese) Come on, Fong. Take a look. (FONG joins him at the window) With eyes like that, how can it be a tiger?

(Suddenly, the creature in the crate leaps snarling at the window. WOO and FONG jump back, FONG falling to the floor. They stare at the crate which is shaking violently with the force of the growling creature's struggles. After a few moments, the crate suddenly stills. WOO cautiously creeps up and kicks the crate a couple of times. No response.)

WOO: (in Cantonese) I think we killed it.

(WOO takes out a ring of keys and unlocks the crate. They carefully open the crate and look inside. Their expressions turn from that of curiosity to that of horror. Cut to )

(Day. The T'ein Kou freighter is docked in San Pedro, California. A police car pulls up to the docks. Cut to inside the hold. YEE, the freighter's captain is leading the police down to the crate.)

YEE: This hold was secured in Hong Kong. I don't know how this happened. It makes no sense. We found the cage still locked. Two of my men are missing.

(As YEE and the officers walk around the crate, they see a man, DR. IAN DETWEILER, mid-thirties, kneeling beside it.)

DETWEILER: (angry) Who's in charge here? You?

YEE: Who are you?

DETWEILER: My name is Detweiler. I'm the owner of this cargo. I was to be notified immediately of its arrival. There's an animal in here, damn it. It needs care.

(He looks pointedly at blood seeping out from the bottom of the crate. KEE unlocks and opens the crate. He and DETWEILER look inside. They stare in horror at the mutilated bodies of FONG and WOO.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
7:10 PM

(X-Files office. MULDER is pinning pictures of the two dead crewmen from the teaser to his bulletin board. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Aren't you going home?

MULDER: (not turning around) I am home. I'm just feathering the nest.

SCULLY: What you got?

MULDER: Two merchant marines found dead this morning in San Pedro  in the hold of their cargo ship.

SCULLY: You mind if I ask the cause of death?

MULDER: (casually, trying to peak her interest, very cute) On the crime report it says multiple bite wounds.

SCULLY: From what?

MULDER: The Hong Kong manifest has the cargo listed as a dog.

SCULLY: A dog? A "dog" dog?

MULDER: Yo quiero Taco Bell. That alone is not what drew me to this case. (turns and holds the file out to her) The two men were found inside the container. It was locked from the outside.

SCULLY: (looking through the file) What happened to the dog?

MULDER: (sitting close to her) Dog gone. Dog gone (proudly) Doggone.

SCULLY: Yeah, I got it. Did anybody, um, examine the victims, Mulder?

(Mulder nods, shrugs, smiles, and glances at the file in her hands.)

SCULLY: Look, bite wounds are rarely lethal in themselves. I mean, they are not the cause of death. They lead to it through the loss of blood, but, uh... it makes you wonder how accurate this report is.

MULDER: Local PD wrote it up. Department of Fish and Wildlife is on the case. I got an outside source says it was a dog.

SCULLY: Mulder, I don't have to tell you how absolutely and completely wrong that seems. I mean, they were found dead in a locked cage, right?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Two grown men?

MULDER: Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: (stares at him) You're not going to tell me that a dog did this.

MULDER: A bad dog.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(He crosses back to his desk as she sighs and looks back down at the file.)



SCENE 3
BELLFLOWER, CALIFORNIA
9:27 PM

(Suburban house. A large dog, golden retriever, is outside barking at something behind the fence. JAKE CONROY, a young man in a dark uniform comes out of his house to calm the dog.)

JAKE CONROY: Shh. Quiet. Jo-Jo, come on. Shh. Shh. Shh. That's enough now. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's okay.

(He pets her head and sees the backlit outline of another dog against the fence.)

JAKE CONROY: (yelling at the strange dog) Hey, get out of here. Go on, git! Come on, inside. Come on. Come on. Inside. Inside. Inside, Jo-Jo.

(He gets JO-JO inside and crosses over the dog at the fence.)

JAKE CONROY: Get out of here. Go on home. Go home.

(He looks over the fence. The dog has suddenly disappeared. He looks up and down the deserted street, then goes back inside the house.)

JAKE CONROY: Jo-Jo? Here, girl. (heading for the bedroom) You better not be on the bed. (sees JO-JO lying under a table) There you are. What are you doing, girl? You nut. Big ol' lazy bones. Jo-Jo, what are you doing...?

(He reaches down and touches her. He looks at his hand now covered in blood. The dog is dead. He hears a low growling and turns to see a wolf-like dog staring at him and baring it's teeth.)

JAKE CONROY: (terrified) Stay away. Go on.

(The dog's eyes glow red, the growling increases. Suddenly, it leaps at JAKE CONROY who begins screaming. Cut to )



SCENE 4
SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA
7:42 AM

MULDER: Officer Jeffrey Cahn?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Yeah?

MULDER: (showing badge) I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. This is my partner, Dana Scully. I think the LA field office would have contacted you that we were coming down today.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Oh, yeah. I hope you don't mind - I had to look around the ship with my men. We were pretty thorough.

SCULLY: (looking in the crate) What did you find?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Nothing conclusive, really, but I can tell you the dog's not likely still on the ship.

MULDER: How did you determine that?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: You ever owned a dog, sir?

MULDER: Yeah.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Had to clean up after it?

(MULDER smiles, raises his hands in agreement, then claps them together and goes to look at the crate.)

SCULLY: I don't suppose you can tell us what kind of dog this is.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: I'm not really sure. The man it was shipped to's name is Detweiler. Dr. Ian Detweiler. Calls himself a "cryptozoologist."

MULDER: (interested) Cryptozoologist?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: They deal with animals thought to be extinct.

MULDER: Animals that aren't supposed to exist like Sasquatch and the Ogopogo and the Abominable Snowman and - - -

SCULLY: (interrupting) Don't mind him. He'll go on forever. Did you have a chance to talk to this Dr. Detweiler?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: About five minutes ago.

(DETWEILER enters the hold.)

DETWEILER: Officer Cahn, any progress?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Agents, this is Dr. Detweiler.

DETWEILER: Are you from the FBI?

MULDER: Yes.

DETWEILER: Who should I be speaking to about the theft of this animal?

MULDER: Theft? What do you mean theft?

DETWEILER: This is a very valuable animal that's disappeared. A rare breed and arguably a priceless specimen.

SCULLY: A breed of what?

DETWEILER: Wanshang Dhole. It's a canid.

MULDER: That's an Asian dog. Supposed to have been extinct for the last 150 years.

DETWEILER: (impressed) Yes. That's right, actually.

SCULLY: And you have one of these?

DETWEILER: I was on the expedition that caught it.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Be that as it may-- we now have an unquarantined animal loose.

MULDER: Loose? Sounds a little more than loose. It seems to have killed two people.

DETWEILER: No. No. Let me assure you this is not a predatory animal. Chinese folklore has imbued it with mythic qualities. But it doesn't even hunt-- it scavenges.

(COP calls from the top of the stairs.)

COP: Where's Officer Cahn? Hey, Jeff, I just got a report on the radio. Some kind of vicious dog attack in Bellflower.



SCENE 5
BELLFLOWER
9:32 AM

(JAKE CONROY's house. Crime scene. MULDER carefully walks across the yard to the fence, avoiding the piles of dog poo. He looks over the fence just as JAKE CONROY did earlier. SCULLY walks over to him. She is carrying an umbrella.)

MULDER: (indicating the dog poo) Watch your step.

SCULLY: Jake Conroy, age 30. He was employed as a customs agent by the Federal Government. The bite marks match those of the victims on the Chinese freighter. In this case, it bit off the man's hand. There's some talk in the house that he may be involved in the theft of the animal and that it turned on him.

MULDER: Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.

SCULLY: Well, it does make sense. I mean, a victim and his dog are attacked inside of a house with all the doors shut. It couldn't have happened unless the dog was being kept inside.

MULDER: If all the doors were shut, how did it get out?

SCULLY: Well, then what?

MULDER: I think we're speaking in too common terms about an animal we're calling a dog but which displays none of the behavior of man's best friend.

SCULLY: You mean covering up crime scenes?

MULDER: (smiles) You get a biscuit, Scully.

SCULLY: So, you're talking about a dog that has human intelligence. (MULDER looks innocent.) Well, even if there were such an animal where would we even begin to look for one?

MULDER: With a human that thinks like an animal.



SCENE 6

(MULDER and SCULLY drive up to BERQUIST KENNELS and park in the driveway. Sound of dogs barking. They approach a young woman digging postholes for a fence near the driveway.)

MULDER: Karin? Karin Berquist?

STACY MUIR: No. Stacy Muir. Just putting up this fence for her. She's been having some coyote problems. You two looking for Karin about boarding?

MULDER: No, it's actually more of a behavior problem.

SCULLY: (glancing up at MULDER) Yeah, he doesn't listen and he chews on the furniture.

(STACY MUIR chuckles.)

MULDER: (smiling and showing his badge) Just... can you tell her the FBI's here to see her?

STACY MUIR: Right this way.

(STACY MUIR leads them into a very dimly lit office. There are lots of books and artifacts on the walls and the many tables. All the blinds are closed.)

STACY MUIR: Karin will be out in a moment, all right?

(STACY MUIR leaves and closes the door behind her. MULDER and SCULLY are left in the near darkness.)

SCULLY: You sure this woman's not an authority on bats?

MULDER: Karin Berquist knows more about canine behaviorisms than anybody on the planet. She's lived with wild canids and wolves in the wilderness on five different continents. (opens the blinds on one of the windows)

SCULLY: How is it that you know so much about her but you don't know what she looks like?

MULDER: I never actually met her.

SCULLY: But you assume that she's going to help us?

MULDER: No, actually, it's not an assumption. She is the one who told me about his case.

SCULLY: (curious) Oh, so you two are chummy?

MULDER: Well, I've read her books.

SCULLY: (reading some of the titles) Ah. The Wolf Inside... Dogs Don't Lie... Better Than Human... Better Than Human?

MULDER: She's not a real people person.

(SCULLY crosses to a desk, turns on the lamp and aims it at the "I Want to Believe" poster on the wall. It is identical to the one in MULDER's office that burned.)

SCULLY: Well, she seems to have made a connection to you.

(She and MULDER look at each other. The door opens and a group of dogs enter followed by KARIN BERQUIST. She is mid-thirties, dressed all in black and avoids eye contact.)

KARIN BERQUIST: (to the dogs) All right... Settle down. Settle.

(The dogs all sit on the furniture. KARIN BERQUIST crosses to the window and closes the blinds that they had opened.)

MULDER: Karin, I'm Fox. Fox Mulder. This is my partner, Dana Scully. It's nice to finally meet you. (shakes her hand)

KARIN BERQUIST: I wish I'd known. I don't get many visitors. Stacy tells me you have a question about behaviorism?

MULDER: Yeah, it's about the animal I'm tracking. The one you mentioned in your e-mail - about its intelligence.

KARIN BERQUIST: Canids' intelligence is far superior to ours if that's what you want to know.

SCULLY: Intelligence enough to murder?

KARIN BERQUIST: Murder takes no intelligence. It's a human behaviorism.

MULDER: What about hunting?

KARIN BERQUIST: Coyotes use elaborate trickeries to draw out their prey. Many canids do... alone or in packs.

SCULLY: What about a Dhole?

KARIN BERQUIST: If you mean the Wanshang Dhole, it's extinct. Is there any other reason you came here?

(She looks up at MULDER- SCULLY watches them intently.)

MULDER: No. Thank you, Karin.

KARIN BERQUIST: (to the dogs) Come on.

(The dogs follow her out of the room and she closes the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder... She's a friend of yours?

MULDER: We met on-line.

SCULLY: On-line...

MULDER: Two professionals exchanging information.



SCENE 7

(Night. Police truck pulls up to a dark alley.)

OFFICER FIEDLER: (on radio) This is Fiedler. I'm at an alley just south of Cooper in Signal Hill. Looks like something's been scavenging. I'm going to check it out.

DISPATCHER: Copy that.

(He gets out of his truck, gets a long stick out of the back, and heads into the alley. Using the stick, he roots through some garbage and finds a severed hand, then looks up to see a dog run past the end of the alley. He goes into the alley and on into a warehouse. He goes into the basement. Dark, spooky hallway. He hears a sudden sound, and turns quickly and sees a shape at the end of the dark hall.)

OFFICER FIEDLER: Hey! Hello, sir. I'm with US Fish and Wildlife. Maybe you've seen a dog I'm looking for.

(The human figure silently walks toward him.)

OFFICER FEIDLER: Sir? Can you hear me?

(The human figure kneels down and slowly changes shape. It is now a dog. It begins snarling at OFFICER FIEDLER, then leaps at his throat. OFFICER FIEDLER screams.)



SCENE 8
8:34 AM

(Warehouse, later. Crime scene. MULDER and SCULLY enter and are met by OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN who is extremely upset.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: You want to catch a killer? You arrest that crypto son of a bitch who shipped that dog over here.

SCULLY: Is it the same dog?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: That's Frank Fiedler over there. He's a friend of mine. Damn good at his job. You think this kind of thing happens here every day?

MULDER: No, I'm sure it doesn't. We're just trying to catch this animal just like you though, sir.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Oh, you can catch it. I want to kill it.

(He walks away from them. SCULLY sees KARIN BERQUIST, dressed in dark clothes head to toe, enter the warehouse.)

SCULLY: (quietly to MULDER) I don't think wolfwoman is here to speak to me about this. I'll take a look at the body.

(SCULLY leaves MULDER and goes to look at FIEDLER's body. MULDER almost reaches for her, then sighs and greets KARIN BERQUIST.)

MULDER: I didn't expect you.

KARIN BERQUIST: "Dog eats dogcatcher." Story's all over the news this morning. It's sort of uplifting.

MULDER: (not amused) Mm-hmm.

KARIN BERQUIST: I'm joking.

MULDER: Mm-hmm.

KARIN BERQUIST: Sorry.

MULDER: That's okay.

KARIN BERQUIST: I thought you might use some help.

MULDER: You said that a dog or a canid only hunts what it needs but I've got four bodies with bite marks on it from an animal that seems to kill for no other reason.

KARIN BERQUIST: Who are the victims?

MULDER: There's two men on the ship that it came in on, a customs agent, and now an officer from Fish and Wildlife. In fact, all these men could have come in contact with the animal before the attacks.

KARIN BERQUIST: Classic dominant-alpha territorial behavior.

MULDER: No. This animal seems to have ranged many miles to make its attacks. In each case it seems to have outsmarted or at least tricked its victims.

KARIN BERQUIST: Unlike we homo sapiens a canid's motives are simple and direct. It would be an extraordinary case to find one who kills for sport. Likely, we may never know. I'm sure someone will kill it first.

(They look over to where SCULLY is kneeling at the body with DETWEILER.)

MULDER: This guy over here? He claims to have caught it once. Maybe he can catch it again. He's Dr. Ian Detweiler. Do you know him?

KARIN BERQUIST: No, but I dislike him already.

DETWEILER: I've been over the area. If that was my animal there's absolutely no evidence of it-- no prints, nothing whatsoever I can find.

MULDER: But it's still on the loose.

KARIN BERQUIST: How did you say you caught it originally?

(KARIN BERQUIST and DETWEILER stare at each other.)

MULDER: Oh, this is Karin Berquist.

DETWEILER: We tranquilized it after tracking it for two weeks.

KARIN BERQUIST: You admire it, don't you?

DETWEILER: I admire its ability to survive.

KARIN BERQUIST: Think I'll look around, too.

MULDER: Mm-hmm.

(She goes to another part of the room. DETWEILER watches her walk away.)

DETWEILER: Now, that's one strange bird.

(MULDER nods.)

(Outside, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN is talking on his radio.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (over radio) No, I'm leaving my dart gun in the car. I'm going to live rounds from here on out. I don't care what the regulations say. I shouldn't be asked to risk my life and neither should anyone else.

DISPATCHER: No one's asking you to risk your life, Cahn.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Fiedler's lying dead. You realize that?

(He hears a noise. Camera is panning around him and the truck as if something is stalking him.)

DISPATCHER: Cahn, you still there?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Look, we need more men out here. How more many people have to go down before you guys listen? Look, I don't have a photo of this animal. No one's even seen it. Let's get more men out here so we can catch it and kill it. If you want 

(Hearing another noise, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN turns quickly to find DETWEILER standing right behind him, glaring.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: You scared me.

DETWEILER: You kill that dog, and I'll kill you.

(DETWEILER walks away.)



SCENE 9

(KARIN BERQUIST's office. She is sitting at her computer. MULDER sits on her right and SCULLY stands behind them, looking over their shoulders. There is an image of a dog's paw print on the screen.)

KARIN BERQUIST: This man Detweiler said he could find no evidence at the scene but with very little effort I was able to find several tracks on the floor of the building where the man was attacked.

SCULLY: Did they tell you anything?

KARIN BERQUIST: That this is a large, rangy animal with primitive, even pre-evolutionary aspects. It isn't perfectly visible, but with the computer I can enhance the prints so that you can see it. A fifth toe pad on the right paw. Canids only have four toes.

MULDER: Uh, he's got a vestigial toe pad on his front paws. Right there.

(MULDER places his hand over hers on the mouse and moves the pointer over another part of the screen. SCULLY stares at their joined hands. After a beat, MULDER moves his hand back to his chin. Everyone is a little tense.)

KARIN BERQUIST: The dewclaw, serving no purpose now. Although some believe it was once a prehensile thumb.

SCULLY: And that's what you think the print indicates?

KARIN BERQUIST: I am told this animal went in and out of closed buildings.

SCULLY: Just yesterday you dismissed the possibility outright, that a dog or a... a canid, as you call it, would behave like this.

KARIN BERQUIST: I dismissed the idea of murder.

SCULLY: But you'll accept the idea that it behaves in every other way like Jack the Ripper.

KARIN BERQUIST: (backing down) I'm just going by the facts. In Chinese myth the Dhole can be evil, capable of opening doors, stealing wives and disappearing into thin air. Maybe there is some basis in reality for this trickster myth.

SCULLY: (looking directly at her, then at MULDER) Oh, I'm... fairly certain there is.

(Scully leaves the room. Mulder looks at the monitor.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY is sitting in the car. MULDER gets in beside her and gets out the key. He pauses and looks at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Everything okay, Scully?

SCULLY: How well do you know this woman, Mulder?

MULDER: How well do you know anybody you meet on the Internet? She likes to talk.

SCULLY: Well, I question her motives.

MULDER: You're suggesting that this case was a way to get me out here, to meet me?

(SCULLY doesn't answer. MULDER smiles.)

MULDER: I'm flattered, but, no. I don't know this woman. I'd go out on a limb and say there's no way in hell she has anything to do with those four people being dead.

SCULLY: She's enamored of you, Mulder. Don't underestimate a woman. They can be tricksters, too.

(They share a look.)



SCENE 10
6:21 PM

(RILEY ANIMAL CLINIC. ANGIE, owner of DUKE the St. Bernard, is talking to the veterinary assistant, PEGGY, in the reception area.)

ANGIE: So Dr. Riley wanted me to give Duke three pills a day. Is the one bottle going to be enough?

PEGGY: Oh, we can get you a refill.

ANGIE: Okay.

(DETWEILER enters the vet and DUKE begins barking wildly and trying to attack him.)

ANGIE: Duke Duke  enough!

DETWEILER: Can't you control your dog?

ANGIE: I'm sorry. He gets this way with strangers sometimes.

DR JAMES RILEY: Let's take him outside.

ANGIE: Duke, come on.

DR JAMES RILEY: Excuse me. You got him? Good luck.

(ANGIE and DUKE leave. DR JAMES RILEY returns to DETWEILER.)

DR JAMES RILEY: Sorry about that. It's usually a well-behaved dog.

DETWEILER: I'm Dr. Detweiler. I called about the animal tranquilizer.

DR JAMES RILEY: The Telezol. I don't have much occasion to dispense it. If I have any, it's very little.

DETWEILER: Well, I'll take whatever you've got.

(DR JAMES RILEY gets some boxes of medicine off of a shelf.)

DR JAMES RILEY: I have Etorphine. Can you use that?

DETWEILER: Yeah.

DR JAMES RILEY: Can I ask what these tranqs are for?

DETWEILER: An animal escaped from a pier in San Pedro.

DR JAMES RILEY: (concerned) Not that dog that's been attacking people?

DETWEILER: If you don't mind, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

DR JAMES RILEY: Uh, this dog you're looking for-- you're not looking around here?

DETWEILER: I'm afraid we are.

(DR JAMES RILEY watches as DETWEILER leaves. Later, he is closing up the clinic.)

DR JAMES RILEY: (calling to the front of the building) Good night, Peggy.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: PEGGY: Good night.]

DR JAMES RILEY: Uh, be sure to relock that front door for me, would you? And I'll relock the back.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: PEGGY: Sure.]

(DR JAMES RILEY walks through the kennels talking to the dogs.)

DR JAMES RILEY: Good night, Sparky. Bye, Dino.

(As he locks the back door and turns off the light, all the dogs in the kennels begin barking.)

DR JAMES RILEY: Hey, Buck. What's wrong, Buck? What's wrong, Buck?

(He turns and sees the red-eyed wolf-like dog snarling at him. As the dog runs to attack him, DR JAMES RILEY runs to the door to the office and gets the door slammed closed and locked just in time.)

(Later, police cars arrive at the vet clinic. OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN leads the team.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Come on!

(They run inside and find DR JAMES RILEY.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Where is it?

DR JAMES RILEY: He's trapped in a kennel behind that door.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: How'd it get in there?

DR JAMES RILEY: Uh, it must have come around back.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Lowell and Shoen, go around back. (looks through the frosted window in the door) All right, I'm going to open the door. Doc, you're going to have to move back. I'm going to have to shoot him. (opens the door quickly and sees the shape of a large dog) See him!

(OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN fires four shots.)

DR JAMES RILEY: You hit him?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: I think so. He's down.

(Close up of the dog shows that it is the St. Bernard, DUKE. DR JAMES RILEY goes over to the wounded dog.)

DR JAMES RILEY: Duke... It's the wrong dog.

(Later, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN meets MULDER and SCULLY as they arrive. It's raining.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Came out for nothing.

MULDER: How's that?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: Took out somebody's pet.

MULDER: What kind of pet?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: St. Bernard. It was dark. I just saw something moving.

(Inside the vet, DR JAMES RILEY is just finishing surgery on DUKE.)

DR RILEY: Okay, Duke... All done, pal. You're going to be all right. Now we got find out how you got back in here, huh?

(Close up on the dog's face. SCULLY enters the building and finds a picture of KARIN BERQUIST with DR JAMES RILEY. Signature on the photo says "To my good friend Jame RileyStay well, Karin" She hears DR JAMES RILEY screaming and goes to investigate, gun drawn.)

SCULLY: I'm a federal agent. I'm armed. If you can hear me, don't move. Just stay where you are and tell me if you're okay.

(She finds the bloody body of DR JAMES RILEY on the floor next to the table where DUKE is still lying. She hears footsteps.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Come take a look at this.

(MULDER enters. SCULLY is kneeling on the floor beside the body.)

SCULLY: I'll call the paramedics.

(She and MULDER leave the room. DUKE morphs into the wolf-like dog and gets off the table.)



SCENE 11

(KARIN BERQUIST is sitting in her dark office with her dogs. She is looking at her computer monitor. SCULLY enters alone.)

KARIN BERQUIST: Where's Fox?

SCULLY: Continuing his investigation.

(SCULLY walks to a chair near Karin and looks at the dog lying there. It immediately vacates the chair, and she sits, nicely setting the mood for the rest of the scene, heh heh.)

KARIN BERQUIST: You're not working together?

SCULLY: No. This is my investigation.

KARIN BERQUIST: Of...?

SCULLY: You.

KARIN BERQUIST: I have no idea what you mean.

SCULLY: I thought at first that they were eccentricities or affectations-- the dark, the clothes-- but it's photosensitivity. Your sleeves cover up skin lesions. It's why you're here amongst the humans instead of out in the field. Systemic lupus erythematosus.

KARIN BERQUIST: Lupus... From the Latin for "wolf." Ironic, isn't it?

SCULLY: Ironic or perverse?

KARIN BERQUIST: I've ignored the symptoms for years. I've always felt more like a wolf than a person.

SCULLY: But not with Mulder. With Mulder, you found somebody you could communicate with.... someone who challenged you... But that wasn't enough. You needed to lure him out here.

KARIN BERQUIST: I lack your feminine wiles.

SCULLY: (looks away for a moment) You don't believe it, do you-- not for a minute-- that there's an animal out there killing?

KARIN BERQUIST: I don't believe that this man, Dr. Detweiler, ever caught it. I lived in Asia. I know about the Wanshang Dhole and if it survived for over a century it was because it was more cunning than man, more cunning than this man Detweiler ever dreamed of.

SCULLY: More cunning than you?

(KARIN BERQUIST looks startled.)

SCULLY: (warning) I'm watching you.

KARIN BERQUIST: You watch... But you don't see.



SCENE 12

(At the vet, MULDER is scraping up bloody goo and going through drawers. He finds receipt for boxes of the pills that DR JAMES RILEY gave to DETWEILER. He picks up his phone and dials.)

(CUT TO: OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN's car parked outside the warehouse.)

DISPATCHER: Officer Cahn, we have an emergency phone call we'd like to patch through to you. Officer Cahn, are you there? Officer Cahn, please respond. Officer Cahn? Please respond.

(OFFICER JEFFREY Cahn runs up and picks up the radio.)

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) This is Jeffrey Cahn. Go ahead.

DISPATCHER: We have an FBI agent holding for you. I'm going to patch him through now.

MULDER: (on phone) Officer Cahn?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) Agent Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, I'm back at the animal clinic. You know Detweiler had been here.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) Dr. Detweiler was there?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. He signed for something. It looks like, uh... Eet... Etorfeen, Etorphine?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) Tranquilizers-- ampules.

MULDER: (on phone) Are you anywhere near here at all?

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) Not far. Why?

MULDER: (on phone) You have access to a lab. There's something I'd like you to check for me.

OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN: (on radio) I'll be there in 15 minutes.

(OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN gets into his truck and gets out his keys. He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the wolf-like dog in the backseat growling at him, eyes glowing red. He screams at the dog jumps at him. Exterior shot shows the truck rocking and we hear him yelling.)



SCENE 13
LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL
TORRANCE , CALIFORNIA

(Next morning. MULDER enters the hospital and goes to OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN's room. He is unconscious. DETWEILER is sitting beside the bed.)

MULDER: What are you doing here?

DETWEILER: I'd heard what had happened. I didn't know how bad he would be. I thought I might get a description of the animal.

MULDER: How did you learn about the attack?

DETWEILER: I'd been in contact with Officer Cahn. I learned through his office.

MULDER: No, you didn't. No, you hadn't. Officer Cahn didn't want to have anything to do with you.

DETWEILER: He was going to kill it.

MULDER: Does that frighten you? (pulls him up)

DETWEILER: (defensive) Please, sir. This is ridiculous.

MULDER: You aren't hunting this animal. You know very well it can't be caught.

DETWEILER: Then how did I bring it here?

MULDER: That's what no one can figure out except for Karin Berquist. She knows what was in that cage and she knows it must be killed and that's the thought she can't bear because she doesn't want this thing to be extinct anymore than you do.

DETWEILER: You're not making any sense.

MULDER: No, I think I am. You went to China looking for that animal and you may have tracked it as you claim but the rest is far from the truth. You found the Wanshang Dhole, but you never caught it. It caught you. You may not have known what was happening to you at first but you're well aware now-- that when night comes, you stop being yourself.

DETWEILER: That's insane.

MULDER: No, you become the trickster-- a shape-shifting man who becomes an animal.

DETWEILER: (starting to leave) I've heard enough.

MULDER: (stopping him) No. You killed because you could. You may have resisted it at first. You may have hated what you'd become. Eventually it took you over. That's where the tranquilizer came in. I found traces of Etorphine and animal blood at the clinic. You injected yourself with the tranquilizer hoping to stop the killings... But they didn't and they haven't and they won't.

(DETWEILER leaves. As he walks down the hall, he is approached by KARIN BERQUIST.)

KARIN BERQUIST: I protected you as long as I could. I won't any longer.

(MULDER comes into the hall and sees them. They all make eye contact. DETWEILER leaves.)



SCENE 14

(KARIN BERQUIST is sitting at her computer. Dogs pant contentedly as MULDER enters her office.)

KARIN BERQUIST: I can usually get a sense of a person right away from the dogs. Dogs are the best judges of character I know.

(MULDER scratches a dogs head affectionately. After the dog vacates the chair, MULDER sits across from KARIN BERQUIST, and sighs.)

MULDER: I'm sensing something myself here. I'm thinking maybe I've been misled, that you haven't been totally honest with me about this case.

KARIN BERQUIST: I've been honest with you, though perhaps not myself. I was looking forward to meeting you. I wouldn't admit how much.

MULDER: But you might also have admitted what you knew about this animal-- that it wasn't an animal at all.

KARIN BERQUIST: I heard the reports and called you out if only so you could disprove them. What I knew was it couldn't be a dog responsible for those killings.

MULDER: It's Detweiler, isn't it?

KARIN BERQUIST: Yes.

MULDER: So you knew that and didn't say.

KARIN BERQUIST: I only realized it when I saw him. My failure was in thinking I was protecting the animal that by deceiving you, it might be captured alive. He's got to be put down, Fox. It's the only way to stop this.

MULDER: I've got Scully on him, tailing him watching his every move.

KARIN BERQUIST: He'll elude her easily.

MULDER: So, where's he going to go?

KARIN BERQUIST: To the man he only wounded-- to the hospital, to finish the kill.

(MULDER picks up her phone and dials.)

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, it's me. You got to get to the hospital.  You got to make sure Cahn is protected.  Yeah, he's in danger.

(While MULDER talks to SCULLY, KARIN BERQUIST looks sadly at the "I Want to Believe" poster on her wall.)



SCENE 15

(Hospital corridor. MULDER enters and finds SCULLY sitting on a couch reading a magazine. She gets up and faces him as he approaches.)

SCULLY: (not pleased) Now tell me why you pulled me away from the suspect and chained me to this chair 'cause I haven't seen hide nor hair of Detweiler since I've been here.

MULDER: (sitting on the couch) That's aptly put... but it's not yet dark. You should take a load off. We might be here all night.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: It's Detweiler... but it's not Detweiler. It's something that he becomes.

SCULLY: (warning) Mulder...

MULDER: Through some blood curse, this man undergoes some kind of nocturnal transformation. He becomes the same shape-shifting trickster as that mythical dog.

SCULLY: So, what is he going to do? Walk in here, skitter across the linoleum and pee in the corners?

MULDER: It's about territoriality. He's going to come back here tonight to make sure his dominance isn't challenged. He's going to put down the threat he failed to eliminate when he attacked Cahn. Karin Berquist confirmed it.

SCULLY: Mulder, the only thing Karin Berquist is interested in is you.

(MULDER chuckles dismissively.)

SCULLY: You're kidding yourself if you think that she hasn't manipulated this entire situation for her own purposes.

MULDER: He'll come here tonight, Scully. You'll see.

(MULDER picks up her magazine to read it. SCULLY smoothly takes it back and sits beside him and begins reading. He sighs and reaches into a pocket - probably for some sunflower seeds.)

CUT TO:

BERQUIST KENNELS.
2:02 AM

(KARIN BERQUIST is settling dogs in the outdoor pens for the night. She hears a noise and senses something near by.)

(Cut back to hospital corridor. MULDER is reading SCULLY's magazine. SCULLY sits beside him, head back and snoring softly. He checks his watch, then stands and gently brushes her face with the magazine.)

MULDER: Okay. He's not coming.

(SCULLY sighs, waking up slowly.)

SCULLY: Well, you've got no argument from me.

MULDER: (disappointed) He's not coming here tonight. Karin knew that. She lied to me.

(Cut back to KARIN BERQUIST's office. She goes upstairs and reluctantly loads a dart into a tranquilizer gun. Looking out the window, she sees the dog run across the yard. Her phone rings and her answering machine picks up. She takes the phone off the hook.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Karin, it's Fox Mulder. If you can hear me, I know what you're doing. If you can hear me, lock your doors. I'm on my way. (hangs up)

(Downstairs, the dog has entered the house. It goes upstairs. She hears a growl and sees the wolf-like snarling at her. She aims the gun, then slowly sets the gun on the table and faces the dog.)

KARIN BERQUIST: (softly coaxing) Come on, dog. Come on.

(With a final snarl the dog launches himself at her throat. Outdoor shot shows them both come crashing through the second floor window and falling to the ground. Dogs bark wildly.)

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive and find DETWEILER's body.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Yeah.... It's Detweiler.

(They then see KARIN BERQUIST's body. SCULLY looks up at MULDER sympathetically. He shakes his head slightly.)



SCENE 16
X-FILES OFFICE

(MULDER sits with his head in his hands. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: You going home?

MULDER: (looking exhausted) Yeah, pretty soon.

SCULLY: You think this is your fault.

MULDER: (sighs) I think that I... believed her very quickly. I think maybe that was my fault, yeah.

(SCULLY sits on the corner of his desk.)

SCULLY: Why wouldn't you believe her?

MULDER: I barely knew her.

SCULLY: (gently) Well, she had a lot of secrets, that's for sure. I think that Karin Berquist lived by her instincts. She sized people up pretty quickly and I think she figured you out to a "T." (MULDER looks up at her.) I think she saw in you a kindred spirit, Mulder. She may not have been able to express that to you. Maybe what she did was the highest form of compliment.

(MULDER looks at her and sighs.)

SCULLY: You going to be okay?

MULDER: (smiles) Uh, yeah.

SCULLY: Oh. This came for you.

(She hands him a long mailing tube.)

MULDER: Thank you.

(SCULLY leaves the office. MULDER looks at the return address. It is from BERQUIST KENNELS. 917 Creekview Rd. Topanga, CA 90290. SCULLY gets her jacket and he watches her leave. He opens the tube and removes a poster. He looks at it, then pins it to the wall. He sits in his chair and looks up at it. It is the "I Want to Believe" poster from KARIN BERQUIST's office. )

[THE END]
                           TREVOR



SCENE 1
JASPER COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI

(A prison farm in Southern California, oops, Mississippi. A pickup truck pulls into the compound with plywood. High winds blow dust and sand around as prisoners frantically nail boards over windows in preparation for a tornado. Armed guards watch over them. Two of the prisoners, WHALEY, a large belligerent African -American man, and PINKER RAWLS, small, wiry and tough looking, work together. WHALEY holds the board as PINKER RAWLS nails.)

GUARD: Last wall... Pour it on!

WHALEY: (thinking this is all a waste of time) Man, this little piece of wood ain't gonna hold no twister! We need to dig a hole, you know what I'm saying?

GUARD: (warning) Whaley!

WHALEY: A big hole. The man ought to be givin' us shovels. This whole damn place is going to blow away. Why even bother? Yo, boy, back me up, here!

PINKER RAWLS: Shut up and hold it still.

WHALEY: I know you ain't talkin' to me! You a big man, huh? Is that right? Charley potatoes. Big-ass criminal. You a bad man? (no response) You a bitch, that's all you are. You ain't got no money. You ain't got nothing. I'll hold it still.

(WHALEY begins shaking the plywood forcefully, laughing. PINKER RAWLS stares at him, sucking on a nail to make it easier to drive.)

WHALEY: (laughing) Is that still enough for ya?! Huh?!

(WHALEY continues laughing and looks over at the GUARD to share the joke. Suddenly, he begins screaming as PINKER RAWLS hammers the nail into WHALEY's hand. GUARD aims his rifle at PINKER RAWLS.)

GUARD: Put down the hammer, Rawls! Rawls!

(Later, in the Captain's office. Under guard, PINKER RAWLS faces the Captain, RAYBERT FELLOWES. FELLOWES gazes out the window at the approaching storm, then turns back to PINKER RAWLS.)

FELLOWES: Messed up old Whaley, did he?

GUARD: Messed him up good.

FELLOWES: Now what'd you go and do that for?

PINKER RAWLS: Man pissed me off, Boss.

FELLOWES: Who the hell doesn't? (to the GUARDS) Box him.

(GUARD is surprised.)

PINKER RAWLS: (terrified) You can't put me in that box, Boss. The... the storm's coming.

FELLOWES: Should have thought of that before you messed up old Whaley.

PINKER RAWLS: (on the verge of hysteria) Well, to hell with Whaley. You can't put me in that box! Boss! You can't put me in there! You can't put me in that box! You can't do it! You're going to kill me, Boss! Boss!

(OTHER GUARDS drag RAWLS out of the room. The GUARD looks a little concerned.)

GUARD: You know they're saying tornado touchdowns all over the county.

FELLOWES: (unconcerned) I can't be responsible for Acts of God.

(Outside, the GUARDS lock a struggling RAWLS inside a tiny wooden shack about the size of an outhouse. The storm winds are getting worse.)

GUARD: Sorry, Rawls.

PINKER RAWLS: Let me out! Let me out!! Heeeelp!! Somebody!! Somebody help me, please!

(Camera shot of shack in the high winds and sound of PINKER RAWLS screaming.)

(Later, the storm is over. GUARDS and PRISONERS come outside to survey the damage. The GUARD goes over to where the shack stood. All that remains are the foundations.)

GUARD: Oh, hell.

(GUARD enters the office building and goes to the Captain's office.)

GUARD: Hello, sir?

(He knocks at the door, then unlocks it and opens the door. He looks in the office in horror. Opening the door knocked something to the floor.)

GUARD: Oh, my god...

(He sees the body of RAYBERT FELLOWES. It has been completely cut in half at the abdomen. Ewww.)

SCENE 2
HINDS COUNTY MORGUE
JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI

(MULDER and SCULLY in an autopsy bay. SCULLY in scrubs and mask pulls sheet off of the two halves of the body of RAYBERT FELLOWES. MULDER puts his hand over his mouth and turns away for a moment.)

SCULLY: Should we arrest David Copperfield?

MULDER: Yes, we should... but not for this. Now this is, uh, Raybert Fellowes superintendent of Road Farm Six, Mississippi Department of Corrections. One of his guards found him in his office. Not a drop of blood in the place.

(She touches the carbon residue left on one side of the bisected body and it crumbles.)

SCULLY: Well, maybe he was killed elsewhere.

MULDER: No, I don't think so. Whoever did it took 40 minutes to do it in the middle of a tornado. What do you make of that?

SCULLY: I don't know. It's, uh... it's not a simple bisection. There's a considerable amount of his abdomen missing. I mean, it almost looks like a burning but it's too localized. Maybe an industrial acid.

MULDER: (looking at the report) There's, um... no acid found in his office.

SCULLY: Oh. (long pause) Spontaneous human combustion.

MULDER: (grinning in disbelief) Scully...!

SCULLY: Well, isn't that where you're going with this?

MULDER: Dear Diary: Today my heart leapt when Agent Scully suggested spontaneous human combustion.

SCULLY: Mulder, there are one or two somewhat well-documented cases.

(MULDER says nothing, just sort of looks off to the side and nods thoughtfully.)

SCULLY: Mulder, shut up.

(MULDER has helpless, "What did I do?" look on his face. Very funny exchange.)

SCULLY: Okay. What do you make of this?

MULDER: I don't have a theory. But I know of someone who does.



SCENE 3

(Captain's office at the prison farm. MULDER and SCULLY are interviewing the GUARD. MULDER is looking around the room.)

GUARD: Hell, yes, Pinker Rawls who did it. Though you got me as to how.

SCULLY: And who is Pinker Rawls?

MULDER: An inmate.

GUARD: Mean son of a bitch.

MULDER: Rawls was the prisoner who supposedly died in the tornado that preceded superintendent Fellowes's murder.

SCULLY: So you're saying that a ghost did this?

GUARD: I'm not putting the word to it. That's up to y'all. All I know is that Rawls hated the Captain. Captain locked him in the box when the storm hit and Rawls didn't want to be locked in the box and when we found the box biggest piece was about yay big... (indicates something about 7 inches long)  three miles from here. Now, this whole place was locked and boarded up tight. No man got in here. That's all I'm saying.

(GUARD leaves the room.)

SCULLY: So we're looking for a dead man?

MULDER: (walking around the room, tapping on walls) I disagree. I think this Pinker Rawls is still very much alive. You know, they never found his body.

SCULLY: Okay. Well, at the risk of further ridicule, Mulder, what if this wasn't a murder? I mean as I understand it, current theory on spontaneous human combustion is that climatic conditions play a large part. So, possibly a tornado may fit the bill. We've got lightning, um, static electricity at a high potential.

MULDER: (still looking around the room) I can't argue with that. But I do think it's murder.

SCULLY: Well, then how did Rawls or whoever do this? How did he get in and out of a locked office and prop a body up against the inside of a door?

(MULDER, in searching the office comes to a section of the wall that strikes him as odd. He taps on the wall, it sounds hollow, then he easily breaks a large hole in the brittle substance.)

MULDER: (looking at the hole) Termites?

(Later, in a storage area of the prison farm they look through PINKER RAWLS's belongings.)

GUARD: This is all he had in his bunk area.

SCULLY: (reading his file) Wilson Pinker Rawls, age 34. Eight years into 30 for robbing a wire office in Bay Saint Louis. The $90,000 he stole was never recovered.

MULDER: Well, it's not in here. Hey. Look at this.

(MULDER holds up a long package of what look like very large condoms.)

MULDER: (in ET voice) Ouch.

SCULLY: (ignoring him) His record dates to 1978. Mostly small-time. History of violence throughout.

(She hands MULDER a picture of PINKER RAWLS and he compares it to a picture of RAWLS and a very  trashily dressed young blonde woman standing in front of a very modest house.)

MULDER: I wonder who she is.

(SCULLY looks at the picture.)



SCENE 4
MERIDIAN, MISSISSIPPI

(Southern Martha Stewart style house. Nice furniture, bows on the walls, everything in its place. The owner, JUNE, atttractive, well-dressed, mid thirties, sits beside a man, ROBERT WERTHER, 40ish. She pours coffee out of a silver urn into china cups.)

WERTHER: Thanks, Cutie. (chuckles) Hey, you broke out the good stuff.

JUNE: (smiling) Well, we're worth the good stuff.

WERTHER: Mmm.

JUNE: Hey, Robert?

WERTHER: Hmm?

JUNE: Can I show you something? I mean, just a little food for thought?

(She tries to show him a bridal magazine. "I DO, the Bridal Magazine - Dream Weddings: How to plan yours. No regrets: Choose the gown you'll love forever. How to have a champagne  nuts  " He is more interested in the TV.)

WERTHER: Wh... Oh. Wait, Sweetie. They're talking about the tornado.

NEWSCASTER: Take a look at this video just in. Hardest hit was a state prison farm outside the village of Stringer where two deaths are reported in the wake of the storm. A funnel cloud with winds topping 150 miles per hour tore through the isolated work camp passing within yards of a barracks filled with terrified inmates. Among the dead, Captain Raybert Fellowes, the farm's superintendent a 28-year veteran of the Department of Corrections. A second casualty was a prison inmate: Wilson P. Rawls, age 34, of Pascagoula. Prison authorities say...

(JUNE, who has been watching the TV nervously, suddenly drops her coffee cup. She gets up looking very upset.)

JUNE: Excuse me.

NEWSCASTER: ...whose job was to secure the prison...

WERTHER: You okay, June?

(JUNE quickly leaves the room. WERTHER watches her with concern.)

NEWSCASTER: ...from the oncoming storm. High winds apparently carried the man away. Though his body has not been found, Rawls is presumed dead. In other news 



SCENE 5
10:54 PM

(Late evening. A SECURITY GUARD's car pulls up in front of a darkened Val-U-Mart store. BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD shines his flashlight through the windows, sees something and quickly goes into the store. Inside, PINKER RAWLS is putting on clothing he has pulled off the shelves. BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD approaches him holding a gun.)

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: You got a gun pointed at you. Don't try to run.

PINKER RAWLS: (casual, continuing to dress) I ain't runnin'.

(PINKER RAWLS opens a bag of athletic socks.)

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: Oh... Hey! Hey, that's store property. Take those off.

PINKER RAWLS: Oh... There's something so nice about putting on a brand-new pair of socks. I don't know what it is.

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: I said, take those off, boy.

PINKER RAWLS: Mmm... Ooh! Oh... Oh, my. (takes a pair of sneakers and holds them against the sole of his foot) What you think? That's me, right? And room to grow in.

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: You got an attitude, I'll say that.

(PINKER RAWLS giggles.)

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: Get the hell up. Turn around. Hands behind the pole.

(He cuffs PINKER RAWLS's hands behind a building support pole. He pulls out his radio and steps a few yards away from him.)

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: (on radio) This is Bobby in security. I've detained an intruder at the Val-U-Mart on Nine Mile Road and Route 60.  I don't know how the hell he got in here Got him cuffed in the back.

(PINKER RAWLS grunts with slight effort, then moves away from the pole. Camera focuses on the handcuffs, still clasped, lying on the floor. BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD hears his car horn honk, then looks out the window in surprise as he sees PINKER RAWLS waving and driving his car away. )



SCENE 6

(Later, BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD leads MULDER and SCULLY down the aisle at the Val-U-Mart. They show him a picture of PINKER RAWLS.)

MULDER: Is that the guy?

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: Yeah, could be. I guess. It was pretty dark.

MULDER: How'd he get away?

(BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD looks at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Whoever he was.

BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD: You got me. The guy's like Houdini. Turned my back and he was gone. I had him right here.

MULDER: (looking at the pole) You had him handcuffed... here. Can I see your handcuffs?

(BOBBY THE SECURITY GUARD looks at SCULLY again. She shrugs, and he hands the cuffs to MULDER who takes them and taps them against the pole, then easily breaks them in several pieces.)

MULDER: We have a last known address for Pinker Rawls?



SCENE 7

(Later, BO's house, trailer? Decorated with hubcaps on the walls. Not Martha Stewart. PINKER RAWLS is frantically going through drawers and cabinets searching for something. BO, mid-thirties, sloppily dressed, enters the house.)

BO: Hey, hello? Rawls?

PINKER RAWLS: What's up?

BO: You're on the news, man. They're saying you got killed.

PINKER RAWLS: Where is she?

BO: June? She's gone. Long gone, man. She left me, like, four years ago. You mad 'cause her and me shacked up? I'm sorry, buddy.

PINKER RAWLS: Bo, I want what's mine.

BO: (nervous) I might have her address.

(BO casually goes to a desk drawer and looks at the gun inside.)

PINKER RAWLS: (knowingly, not looking at him) You got nothing in there but your nine.

(Bo pulls out the gun and aims it at PINKER RAWLS.)

BO: Get the hell out of my house.

PINKER RAWLS: (confidently approaching BO) Bo, you're going to shoot me? (taunting) Boo! Bleah! Are you gonna do something? Ha!

(BO shoots a bullet into PINKER RAWLS's chest. PINKER RAWLS advances menacingly on BO who cringes in terror. He fires seven more bullets, emptying the clip into PINKER RAWLS, who just keeps walking forward.)

BO: (screaming) No! No!



SCENE 8

(Outside BO's house, next day. MULDER and SCULLY arrive. The SECURITY GUARD's car is parked outside. MULDER is in rolled up shirt sleeves and dark sunglasses. They pull out their guns and begin cautiously looking around the yard.)

MULDER: This is Rawls's last known address. Security guard's car.

(SCULLY looks in the window and sees something.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(MULDER kicks in the front door and SCULLY swings into the door, gun ready. They walk in and find BO's remains. MULDER reaches out and lifts BO's head. The head has been hollowed out. Only the back of his skull remains.)

MULDER: (completely disgusted, letting go of the head) Ugh! (looks at his hand and wipes it on his pants) Ugh. Gesundheit.

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(MULDER groans sickly, looks away for a moment, then gets BO's wallet.)

SCULLY: Pistol in his hand, slide locked open, shell casings everywhere. I don't see any bullet holes anywhere, Mulder.

(MULDER retrieves BO's wallet and looks inside. He sighs.)

MULDER: Don't recognize him from his driver's license, do you?

SCULLY: Bo Merkle. This is his house.

MULDER: Yeah, but Rawls used to live here and he's come back looking for something.

SCULLY: $90,000. The wire office robbery eight years ago. The money hasn't been recovered.

MULDER: I don't think he spent that in prison.

SCULLY: I don't think Mr. Merkle did either, judging by the decor.

(MULDER pulls out the picture of PINKER RAWLS and the woman he got in the prison. They are standing in front of the same house.)

MULDER: Maybe she knows. That's this house, isn't it?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: (taking out her phone) I can run down the name.

MULDER: Yeah, I bet Rawls is looking for her.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI. There's been a murder here at 922 Washington Avenue in Jackson. I need crime scene support on-site as soon as possible. Thank you. Oh, and could you transfer me to the records division, please?

(As SCULLY talks on the phone, MULDER finds a door with several bullet holes in it. He takes out a knife and removes one of the bullets. It crumbles in his fingers.)

(Later, a crime scene team is on the site. MULDER looks at the remains of the bullets inside an evidence bag. SCULLY comes over to him.)

SCULLY: Got a name to go with the face. June Gurwitch. There's no current address, though and, uh, no record of her since 1996.

MULDER: Maybe she changed her name. Maybe she was afraid she'd end up like that.

(They look over to where BO's body is being removed from the house.)

SCULLY: The state police have put out an APB on Rawls.

MULDER: You might warn them not to shoot to kill. He seems to find that annoying.

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, even if those were bullets...

MULDER: They are. It's just that their composition has been changed just like the handcuffs and just like the prison wall.

SCULLY: Even if these were bullets, there is no way that they could pass through Rawls in the way that you're describing-not, not without leaving him sprawled dead on the ground for us to find.

MULDER: I think they just went right through him, - whsssht - like his wrist went through the handcuffs and like he walked right through that prison wall.

SCULLY: He walks through solid objects?

MULDER: Changing their composition fundamentally-- making steel brittle, turning lead bullets into powder.

SCULLY: And flesh into carbon.

MULDER: I don't know how else to explain what happened to that prison superintendent or to poor Mr. Merkle over there, who's got no face anymore.

SCULLY: But where's the science in all of this, Mulder? You're talking alchemy.

MULDER: (small smile) I'm not saying that it can't be explained scientifically. Maybe it's the tornado. You suggested it yourself. Unusual climatic conditions... high electrical potential...

SCULLY: I'm sorry I even brought it up.

MULDER: Okay, we both agree on who he's looking for?

SCULLY: June Gurwitch.

MULDER: And do we have any idea of how to find June Gurwitch?

SCULLY: She has a sister named Jackie, and I have the address.

(They get into the car.)



SCENE 9

(JUNE is in her house working on some floral basket thing. She answers the ringing phone.)

JUNE: (on phone) Hello.

JACKIE: (on phone) Hey, it's me. Is this a good time?

JUNE: (on phone) No, Jackie, it is never a good time.

(JACKIE is in the kitchen of her modest home. She is dressed in a halter and tight pants. She is smoking and very upset. There are children's toys lying around.)

JACKIE: (on phone) Look, the Jackson City police just called me Yeah. They're looking for you.

JUNE: (on phone) What'd you tell them?

JACKIE: (on phone) Nothing but they brought up Pinker and they wanted to know what he might want with you.

JUNE: (on phone) Pinker's dead. I heard it on the news today.

JACKIE: (on phone) Well, maybe you'd better call him... just in case he's not.

(Sound of a door opening in June's house.)

WERTHER: (off camera) June?

JUNE: (on phone) I got to go.

JACKIE: (on phone) June?

(She hangs up the phone and takes a drag off her cigarette. Sudden sound of a door slamming open. JACKIE ducks down behind a counter and pulls a large kitchen knife out of a drawer. She slowly looks around the house and goes into the hall and turns on a light. PINKER RAWLS steps in front of her. He is wearing different clothes.)

PINKER RAWLS: (calmly) Hey, Jackie.

(JACKIE runs away from him into another room and slams the door and locks it.)

PINKER RAWLS: That's not very friendly, Jackie.

(JACKIE frantically pushes furniture in front of the door and begins fumbling at the window. Outside the door, PINKER RAWLS has stripped.)

PINKER RAWLS: Jackie...

(JACKIE gasps as she turns and sees a naked PINKER RAWLS standing in the room.)

PINKER RAWLS: Tell me where she is.

JUNE: (breathlessly, brandishing the knife) I'm not telling you anything.

(At the sound of a car approaching, PINKER RAWLS goes to the window and sees a car pull up. He turns to jackie.

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY, guns and flashlights in hand, kicking in the front door and entering the house.)

SCULLY: Jackie Gurwitch? FBI!

(MULDER and SCULLY silently walk through the house separately, searching. They meet again in the hall. On the door to the room where JACKIE ran, they see the words "I WANT WHAT'S MINE" burned into the wood. MULDER kicks in the now brittle door and they find JACKIE sitting despondently on the bed.)

MULDER: Where'd he go?

JACKIE: (weakly, shrugging) He left.

(Later, house is now a crime scene. SCULLY comes over to MULDER near the car.)

SCULLY: Her son's spending the night at a friend's house and she's going to meet them there. She said that she didn't tell Rawls where her sister was. (hard for her to say) Mulder, she said that he walked right through the wall.

MULDER: Bo Merkle's car is parked down the street. That's how he got here. I don't know how he left.

SCULLY: Maybe he left on foot or he stole another car.

MULDER: Why would he leave without getting the information he wanted?

SCULLY: Well, maybe he's still in the neighborhood. I think the, uh, local PD can search but we have to get going.

MULDER: (getting in the car with her) Where to?

SCULLY: To Meridian. That's where June Gurwitch lives... or June Burdett as she's now called.

(Camera does close up on their trunk. Inside shot of the trunk shows PINKER RAWLS hiding.)



SCENE 10
6:12 AM

(MULDER and SCULLY arrive at JUNE's house. White picket fence. Lariat bumper sticker and Mississippi plates. 249 BAR. They go up to the house. SCULLY knocks at the screen door. WERTHER answers the door. SCULLY shows her badge.)

WERTHER: Yes?

SCULLY: (showing badge) Agents Scully and Mulder with the FBI. We are looking for June Gurwitch, also known as June Burdett.

WERTHER: "also known as..." (calling into the house) June. (to SCULLY) Look, what's this all about?

SCULLY: An escaped convict by the name of Wilson Pinker Rawls-- we believe that he may be pursuing Ms. Gurwitch with the intention of harming her.

WERTHER: "Gurwitch"? I don't understand.

MULDER: June?

(WERTHER turns to see JUNE standing in the doorway in her bathrobe. She looks tired and resigned.)

JUNE: Pinker's alive, isn't he?

(SCULLY nods. WERTHER stares at JUNE in surprise.)

(Later, JUNE has dressed and they are all sitting in the living room.)

JUNE: Jackie? She and her son...?

SCULLY: They're fine.

MULDER: Who is Rawls to you?

JUNE: A mistake. The biggest one of many. We lived together. (looks up at WERTHER who is standing in the doorway, arms crossed) Are you sure you know who you're looking for? I remember one time this guy cuts Pinker off on the highway. I mean, just cut him off-you know, kind of thing that happens to everybody every day. He followed this guy for 62 miles right over the state line-- 62 miles-me pleading with him the whole way to stop. Follows the guy up to his house. The guy gets out of his car, smiling. He doesn't know what's coming to him. Pinker pulls a picket off a white picket fence and cracks that guy's skull open with it. He's not going to stop.

MULDER: What does Rawls want? The money? $90,000 from the Bay Saint Louis robbery?

JUNE: I didn't even know about that till they came to the door to arrest him, okay? I mean, Pinker was already in prison before I found that money.

(WERTHER shifts uncomfortably. First he's heard of this.)

JUNE: By accident.

SCULLY: So you took it.

JUNE: Eventually, yeah. I thought about it for about a week or two.

MULDER: And where's the money now?

JUNE: Put a down payment on this place. Bought a couple of sofas... chintz curtains... PC for Robert.

(WERTHER angrily walks away.)

JUNE: (to MULDER) I just wanted another chance.

(Later, they come out of the house. JUNE is carrying a suitcase. State troopers are waiting. MULDER unlocks the trunk.)

ROBERT WERTHER: Look, I have a job. I've got responsibilities. I can't just disappear like this.

SCULLY: It's best you both stay under 24-hour guard until Rawls is apprehended. It's for your protection.

ROBERT WERTHER: No, it's for her protection. Let's be clear here. This guy Rawls or whoever, he's not looking for me. She took his money.

JUNE: Robert, I'm sorry...

WERTHER: Excuse me. I've got my own place. I promise to stay the hell away from here, okay? How about it?

(SCULLY and MULDER look at each other.)

WERTHER: Look, I just want to get out of here, okay? I didn't break any laws.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY and shakes his head in an "I give up" look. WERTHER walks to his own car.)

SCULLY: Don't discuss this with anyone, Mr. Werther.

ROBERT WERTHER: I'm forgetting it ever happened.

(With another accusing look at JUNE, he leaves. MULDER takes JUNE's suitcase and puts it into the trunk and closes it. He looks at the trunk lid which is now cracked. He touches the metal. It is brittle. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

MULDER: (to JUNE) Give me your keys.

(MULDER takes the house keys and hands her over to the State Troopers.)

MULDER: Get her out of here. I want a guard on her at all times.

(MULDER and SCULLY begin walking to the house, pulling out their guns.)

SCULLY: Rawls was in the trunk?

MULDER: Yeah. And we took him right where he wanted to go.

(Inside the house, PINKER RAWLS, naked again, is looking through drawers. He turns at the sound of a key in the door. We see MULDER and SCULLY enter. MULDER walks cautiously through the house.)

SCULLY: (from another room) Mulder?

(MULDER joins SCULLY. They look at the words "I WANT WHAT'S MINE" burned into the wall. The last word is slightly cut off where the "E" enters a mirror hanging on the wall.)

MULDER: You think he's trying to tell us something?

(Later, MULDER, wearing latex gloves, is tracing the words on the wall. He thoughtfully fingers the edge of the glass in the mirror where the word cuts into the frame.)

MULDER: Scully, look at this. I'm assuming Rawls wrote this with his finger just like the other one. Look here.

SCULLY: He stopped at the mirror.

MULDER: Or the mirror stopped him. What makes an object solid, Scully? I mean, what, what prevents one solid object from passing through another solid object, usually?

SCULLY: Electrostatic repulsion. Individual electrons repelling one another like magnets.

MULDER: Electrons. What if Rawls's ability somehow has to do electricity? What would preclude it or contain it?

SCULLY: Resistance against electrical current. A good insulator like rubber, like glass.

MULDER: Exactly. Rawls couldn't pass through this.

SCULLY: Say... say that your theory is correct- that he can walk through walls. Why go through all this effort over an old robbery score? It's $90,000-- he could get that anywhere, right?

MULDER: (considering) It's not about the money. It's never been about the money.

SCULLY: Yet he turned this place upside down which means he was looking for something. And I think it has to do with this. (showing him a bill) It's a lien on unpaid hospital bills dating back to 1992 and the patient name is June Gurwitch. And this is an IC D-9 number-- a hospital diagnostic code. This particular one means...

MULDER: Pregnancy.

SCULLY: Right. Specifically, c-section.

MULDER: This is seven years ago. That's just a few months after Rawls was sent to a prison farm.

SCULLY: Uh-huh. "I want what's mine." This man is looking for his child, Mulder.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY.)



SCENE 11

(Hotel room. JUNE and TROOPER COLLINS are listening to the TV. JUNE is nervous.)

NEWSCASTER: ...and will return in time to take part in meetings at the UN. a statewide manhunt is underway at this point as escaped convict Wilson Pinker Rawls-- a man previously thought to be a victim of Tuesday's storm-- continues to elude police. He is to be considered armed and extremely dangerous.

JUNE: I'd like to call my sister.

TROOPER COLLINS: Sorry, ma'am. No calls.

(JUNE gets her purse and lights a cigarette.)

TROOPER COLLINS: This is a non-smoking room, ma'am.

(JUNE angrily pinches the cigarette out with her fingers and flings it away. Overhead we see a man's hand and face coming silently through the ceiling.)



SCENE 12

(MULDER and SCULLY and crime scene team are investigating the hotel room. Close up of TROOPER COLLINS' severed arm, which is still holding a gun, then of MULDER stepping over it.)

ANOTHER TROOPER: Looks like Collins put up a fight. Guess it wasn't enough. I can't tell you what happened here-- how Rawls got in-- but he took the woman with him.

MULDER: Where are they headed?

ANOTHER TROOPER: They stole a station wagon. Last seen headed south.

(MULDER and SCULLY step to a corner of the room and speak privately.)

SCULLY: He has to intend for June to lead him to his child.

MULDER: Yeah, we got to get there first.

SCULLY: Yeah, but where? We don't have a name or an address. I mean, June may not either, for that matter. If the child was  was adopted... I think our best bet is to go through state records but it's going to take some time.

MULDER: (to the TROOPER) I'm going to need some equipment. Special issue.



SCENE 13

(PINKER RAWLS and JUNE are sitting in an old station wagon on a deserted road. Country music is playing on the radio. PINKER RAWLS sits with his eyes closed.)

JUNE: Pinker, I apologize. Look, I'm really scared right now, okay? Talk to me. Please... please say something. Anything. (no response) Look, I'm sorry about the money-- your money. I shouldn't have taken it. It was wrong. I was wrong. Pinker, I can pay you back.

PINKER RAWLS: (turns off the radio) What was it? What'd you have?

(She doesn't answer.)

PINKER RAWLS: You dumb bitch. You don't even know what I'm talking about. What'd you have? Was it a boy or a girl?

JUNE: (quietly, resigned) A boy... a boy.

PINKER RAWLS: A boy  a boy... a boy. (pause) What's his name? You know his name, don't you?

JUNE: Trevor Andrew.

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor what?

JUNE: Trevor Andrew.

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor Andrew  Rawls. You never were going to tell me. I'd have gone to my grave never knowing. But years later, a million-to-one shot, I hear on the Farm from a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy. You know what that means? That means God wanted me to know. He fixed it so I'd hear... and then he fixed it so I'd have passage. And I'm here. God's will.

JUNE: (afraid, crying quietly) What do you want with the boy?

PINKER RAWLS: He's my son. Now you're going to take me to him.



SCENE 14

(Hotel room. MULDER and SCULLY are on their respective cell phones talking to separate offices.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, can you also check her alias, please? It's Burdett, B-u-r-d-e-t-t. 

MULDER: (on phone) It was a live birth-- that's all you can tell me? Yeah, can you check on that, please?

TROOPER: (holding out box to MULDER) This what you were looking for?

MULDER: Yes. Thank you.

(MULDER opens the box and looks at one of the large rubber bullets inside.)

SCULLY: (on phone) All right, thank you very much. (she hangs up and turns to MULDER) No match on Burdett or Gurwitch.

MULDER: (showing her bullets) Riot slugs-- rubber. (into phone) Uh-huh.  Yeah.  No.  Thank you. (hangs up) It's a boy. That's all I got.

SCULLY: Sealed files?

MULDER: No official files. No adoption records, no records of foster care in Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, nothing.

SCULLY: Well, maybe she didn't go through official channels. Maybe the kid's with a friend or a relative somewhere.

(MULDER and SCULLY stare at each other in realization.)



SCENE 15

(JACKIE's house. TREVOR, a seven year old boy is playing with toy cars in the living room.)

TREVOR: Vroom, vroom, blam!

JACKIE: Come on, Trevor, put your...

TREVOR: Blam!

JACKIE: Trevor, put your toys away. Dinner's almost ready. Trevor?

(The phone rings.)

TREVOR: (jumping up) I'll get it.

JACKIE: No. Go wash your hands. I'll get it.

(JACKIE is cooking chicken noodle soup. She hears knocking at the door and lets the machine pick up the phone as she goes to the door and sees JUNE.)

MULDER: (on answering machine) Jackie, this is Agent Mulder

(JACKIE opens the door in relief.)

JACKIE: June.

JUNE: I'm so sorry.

(PINKER RAWLS enters behind JUNE.)

PINKER RAWLS: You could have saved me a trip. Where is he? My boy, where is he?

(PINKER RAWLS pushes JUNE into the house and closes the door. He sees TREVOR come out of the bathroom and sit at the kitchen table. PINKER RAWLS stares at him in awe.)

PINKER RAWLS: (to JACKIE) Right. I appreciate all you've done. Taking care of him. You're a good mother. Better than some, I could say.

(He looks accusingly at June, then crosses cautiously over to TREVOR at the table.)

PINKER RAWLS: (gentle) Something smells good in here. What are you going to have?

TREVOR: Hi, Aunt June.

JUNE: Hey, baby.

PINKER RAWLS: You shut up!

(PINKER RAWLS grabs JUNE roughly and shoves her into the pantry and locks it. TREVOR looks on in fear.)

JUNE: No! No!

PINKER RAWLS: (to JACKIE) Now you... you sit him back down, and you feed him his supper. (calming, to TREVOR) It's all right. It's going to be all right. D-d-don't be upset. I ain't mad at you, buddy.

JACKIE: It's okay, Trevor, Mama's here, okay?

PINKER RAWLS: Come on, I'm not going to hurt you. It's okay, buddy. Why don't you come over here. We'll have a man-to-man. Just have uh, a nice talk, you and me.

(JACKIE goes into the kitchen and looks down at the boiling soup.)

PINKER RAWLS: Uh... you're Trevor, right? Trevor Andrew. That's your name. My name is Pinker. But you can call me Pinky.

(TREVOR is scared. PINKER RAWLS is nervous, trying to put him at ease.)

PINKER RAWLS: Any-anyway, uh... You and me, we're going to take a trip.

JACKIE: Pinker.

PINKER RAWLS: (tense) Shut up, please. (to TREVOR, gentle) You got some stuff you want to pack up? Some toys and stuff? Trevor...? Jackie?

JACKIE: Trevor, go. Go and pack some stuff, okay?

TREVOR: (going to his room) Okay.

PINKER RAWLS: He's a good boy.

(JACKIE picks the glass, Visionware pot off the stove and flings the boiling soup at PINKER RAWLS. It passes right through his body. She then flings the glass pot at him and he grunts in pain as it bounces off his head.)

JACKIE: (screaming) Trevor, run!

( As TREVOR runs out the door, JACKIE keeps hitting PINKER RAWLS with the pot. He grabs her leg and pulls her to him. Her scream is cut off suddenly as he brings his fist down on her. JUNE, in the pantry is hearing everything.)

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor! Trevor...!

(PINKER RAWLS runs outside, searching.)

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor...! Trevor? Hey, buddy.

(TREVOR is hiding behind a tree.)

PINKER RAWLS: Hey, buddy. Hey, Trevor.

(PINKER RAWLS begins pursuing TREVOR through the yard.)

PINKER RAWLS: Hey, buddy!

(MULDER, holding a shotgun, and SCULLY arrive. MULDER grabs TREVOR and pushes him to SCULLY who begins running him back to their car.)

MULDER: Get him out of here, Scully.

(MULDER aims his shotgun at PINKER RAWLS.)

MULDER: Don't make me shoot you. Don't make me shoot you.

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor!

(He starts to run, but MULDER fires. The four rubber bullets impact, and PINKER RAWLS reacts in pain. He runs to a wall of the house and as he passes through the wall, his clothing falls to the ground. Very cool. MULDER enters the house, looking around for PINKER RAWLS. He kneels down and checks JACKIE's pulse. She is still alive.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY and TREVOR running through the yard. They get to MULDER and SCULLY's car. SCULLY drops her keys, then picks them up and unlocks the door.)

SCULLY: Okay... Everything's going to be all right. We're going to get you to a safe place.

(SCULLY looks at TREVOR who is staring into the yard. SCULLY turns and sees a naked PINKER RAWLS slowly approaching them. SCULLY reaches her hand out to TREVOR who takes it, trustingly. SCULLY and PINKER RAWLS stare at each other. SCULLY sees a glass telephone booth close by. She takes a deep breath then turns and runs to the booth with TREVOR.)

SCULLY: Let's go. Run. Run. Run. Get inside. Get inside. Get inside. Get inside.

(They get inside the booth, and SCULLY slams the door shut just as PINKER RAWLS catches up and begins banging on the glass. She wedges her gun in the door handles.)

PINKER RAWLS: (yelling) Give me my son! Trevor! Give me my son! Trevor! (yelling) Give me my son, now!

(PINKER RAWLS picks up a rock and breaks a hole in the glass.)

SCULLY: No!

(PINKER RAWLS is yelling in frustration.)

PINKER RAWLS: Trevor!

(He looks at TREVOR who is terrified. SCULLY holds him tightly, leaning over him. PINKER RAWLS drops the rock and walks away sadly into the road. Suddenly, a car driven by JUNE whips around and hits PINKER RAWLS. The engine and hood of the car passes through him, but he splatters on the windshield. Ewww. SCULLY shields TREVOR from seeing it. She then leads him out of the booth to MULDER. She and MULDER look at each other, then she leads TREVOR back into the house while MULDER walks over to the car. He reaches in and turns off the ignition.)

JUNE: (still shaking) I had to do it. He would have hurt Trevor. He would... God only knows what he was thinking.

(She looks up at MULDER.)

JUNE: What did he want?

MULDER: Maybe another chance.

(JUNE puts her head down on the steering wheel and begins crying.)

[THE END]

                                    MILAGRO



SCENE 1

(Interior of an apartment that looks very similar to MULDER's. A man, PHILLIP PADGETT, is sitting in a chair at the only other piece of furniture in the room - a desk with a typewriter on it. He is slightly built, dark-haired and has a goatee and mustache. The underscoring music (which is awesome, thank you Mark Snow!) - is a musical, repetitive heartbeat theme. The page in the typewriter is blank. A cigarette smolders in the ashtray. Several note cards are taped to the wall across from him. One of them reads "K.N. murders his own best intentions." PHILLIP PADGETT stares at his typewriter. Subsequent shots show him changing position and pacing the room. At one point he drinks a glass of water then holds the empty glass against the wall to listen in on his neighbor. Writer's block seems to have set in. The sun sets and the room goes dim. He lights another cigarette. He turns off the light, lights another cigarette, then goes into the bathroom and throws the cigarette butt into the toilet. Staring into the mirror, he puts his hand inside his shirt. Wet, squishy sounds. Blood begins to flow, then, silently, he pulls out his hand which is now holding his still beating heart.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(PHILLIP PADGETT goes down some stairs to a basement incinerator. He prepares to empty his wastebasket into the incinerator. In the flames, he sees a burning heart. Short time later, elevator doors open and we see that we are in MULDER's apartment building. SCULLY enters the elevator, joining PHILLIP PADGETT. He stares at her as she presses the "4" button. She glances at him. As they ascend, PHILLIP PADGETT watches her. The camera does a close up on SCULLY's mouth and eyes. Too close - everyone feels uncomfortable with the situation. They reach 4th floor. SCULLY gets off and goes to MULDER's door and knocks. She looks over at PHILLIP PADGETT who pulls out his keys and enters the apartment next door. MULDER finally opens the door. He is wearing a white T-shirt and brushing his teeth.)

MULDER: Mmm, sorry about that. Come on in.

(SCULLY enters and sits on the couch.)

SCULLY: I, uh... I rode up on the elevator with someone. Someone from next door, I think.

(MULDER sits beside her and swallows the toothpaste with a gulp of coffee. Yuck.)

MULDER: Hmm... Young guy?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: New neighbor. Why?

SCULLY: You met him?

MULDER: Uh, briefly, yeah. He's a writer.

SCULLY: What does he write?

MULDER: He didn't say. SCULLY: These are, uh... these are my autopsy reports from the second victim.

(SCULLY shows him some graphic autopsy pictures. Next door, we see PHILLIP PADGETT standing on a chair next to the heating vent near the ceiling. He puts his ear to the vent and listens to MULDER and SCULLY's conversation.)

SCULLY: As you can see the heart was removed in the same manner as the previous victim. No incisions, no scope marks, no cutting of any kind.

MULDER: No indication of how the killer did it?

SCULLY: No. There's no prints, no DNA material, no hair and fiber.

(Camera shot of MULDER shows the heating vent above and behind his head.)

MULDER: And yet, you still refuse to believe my theory-- that what this is psychic surgery?

SCULLY: Mulder, psychic surgery is some man dipping his hand in a bucket of chicken guts and pretending to remove tumors from the sick and gullible.

MULDER: Or  it's a grossly misunderstood area of alternative medicine.

SCULLY: Well, medicine, as you're referring to it is about keeping people alive.

MULDER: Well, absent another theory how else do we account for the impossible extraction of this man's heart?

SCULLY: I don't know. I have no idea.

MULDER: I mean, we have no evidence-- no MO to speak of. This could be the perfect crime.

SCULLY: Well, a crime is only as perfect as the man or the mind that commits it. Even if it were perfect-- even if he made not one mistake-- there's still his motive. You find his motive and you find the murderer.

(Later, PHILLIP PADGETT is lying in bed smoking a cigarette. He suddenly gets up and goes to his typewriter.

CUT TO: Car parked on Lover's Lane. A girl, MAGGIE, and a guy, KEVIN, are sitting in a parked car.)

MAGGIE: That's why I didn't want to come here, Kevin.

KEVIN: I'm not even doing anything.

MAGGIE: You're thinking about it.

KEVIN: There's a console between us. I mean, how much can I do? You make it sound like I'm an attacker.

MAGGIE: Well, we talked about this.

KEVIN: I told you I loved you.

MAGGIE: Oh, Kevin...

(Exterior shot of the car show them talking. A hooded figure comes out of the bushes and watches them as they kiss for a moment, then MAGGIE pulls away.)

MAGGIE: There you go again.

KEVIN: What?

MAGGIE: That thing that you do. You know what I am talking about.

KEVIN: But that's the way I kiss, Maggie.

MAGGIE: Well, I get the message.

KEVIN: Where are you going?

MAGGIE: No. I can't talk to you.

KEVIN: Maggie...

(MAGGIE gets out of the car and walks away. KEVIN sighs, sits for a moment, thinking. He then gets out and runs after her.)

KEVIN: Maggie! Maggie!

(MAGGIE hears him calling and runs farther away.)

KEVIN: Maggie!

(KEVIN looks around. He sees a figure coming toward him. Music has the heartbeat theme.)

KEVIN: Maggie, come on.

(KEVIN realizes it not MAGGIE. The HOODED MAN chases KEVIN as he runs away. We hear KEVIN grunt as he's knocked to the ground, then hear him screaming "No!" We hear wet, squishy sounds and KEVIN screams louder in pain. Camera then pans over to show KEVIN lying on his back with his chest bloody screaming in horror at his still beating heart which is now held in the hand of the HOODED MAN.)

CUT TO:

(PHILLIP PADGETT in his apartment typing: " beating heart." He pulls the sheet out of the typewriter.)



SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
7:07 AM

(SCULLY, wearing a skirt, enters the X-Files office and answers the ringing phone. She doesn't see the white envelope on the floor near the door and steps on it as she crosses the room.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, glad I caught you. We got a third victim-- 16-year- old kid out on lover's lane.

(MULDER is on Lover's Lane looking down at the body of KEVIN still lying where he was killed.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Are you sure?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. I'm sure many a person's had their heart broken out here, but not quite like this. I was hoping you'd be here to explain it in medical terms to the local PD.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm not sure that I could. Did anybody see anybody?

MULDER: (on phone) No, nothing. I mean, it's like there's nowhere to start on this case. Nothing to ask nothing to say.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, there's got to be something, Mulder...

(SCULLY sees the envelope and picks it up.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Something about his victims-- why he chooses them, a pattern.

MULDER: (on phone) So far, there's absolutely nothing, Scully. It appears to be just a series of random attacks.

SCULLY: (on phone) An envelope's been slipped under your door.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah? From who?

SCULLY: (on phone) It's unmarked.

(She rips open the envelope and takes out a small flat object on a chain.)

SCULLY: (on phone) It's some kind of a pendant. Like a charm.

(There is a burning heart imprinted on it. The camera goes into slow motion as SCULLY is frozen gazing at the charm. As PHILLIP PADGETT speaks in voiceover, she appears to become more and more aroused. The camera slowly pans around her. Very surreal and erotic.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) Her prompt mind ran through the golconda of possibilities-- was this trinket from the killer? Was there a message contained in its equivocal symbolism? Was he a religious fanatic who had, in fervid haste licked the envelope, leaving the telltale DNA that would begin his unraveling? She had a condign certainty the killer was a male... and now, as she held the cold metal at her fingertips she imagined him doing the same trying to picture his face.

(CUT TO: Sound of keyboard clicking. Camera pans around PHILLIP PADGETT as he types.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) It would be a plain face, an average face... A face people would be prone to trust. She knew this inherently, being naturally trusting herself. But the image she conjured up was no better than the useless sketch composites that littered her files. Preconsciously, she knew this wasn't her strength as an investigator. She was a marshall of cold facts, quick to organize, connect, shuffle, reorder and synthesize their relative hard values into discreet categories. Imprecision would only invite sexist criticism that she was soft, malleable not up to her male counterparts.

(CUT TO: SCULLY still listening to MULDER in slow motion. She pushes her hair behind her ear and strokes her cheek.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) Even now, as she pushed an errant strand of titian hair behind her ear she worried her partner would know instinctively what she could only guess. To be thought of as simply a beautiful woman was bridling, unthinkable. But she was beautiful... fatally, stunningly prepossessing. Yet the compensatory respect she commanded only deepened the yearnings of her heart... to let it open, to let someone in.



SCENE 4

(X-Files office. SCULLY shows MULDER the charm.)

SCULLY: It's called a "milagro." That's the Spanish word for "miracle." It's worn as a lucky charm.

MULDER: It came here for me?

SCULLY: It was dropped off at reception by a man in his late 20s, early 30s... average looking, average build. They weren't able to get a good ID. There are no fingerprints and no DNA from his saliva.

MULDER: (flipping it in the air and catching it) I don't think it's the killer, Scully.

SCULLY: Did you see that it's a burning heart?

MULDER: (sitting at the desk) I see it has a burning heart. But we're dealing with a killer that leaves absolutely no clues. Why would he do something as heavy-handed as this?

SCULLY: Well, maybe it has something to do with his next victim. Maybe he's taunting you.

MULDER: Maybe it's not me at all. Maybe he sent it to you. Maybe it's a secret admirer.

(SCULLY sighs and takes the charm back from him.)

SCULLY: I think I'll check it out.

MULDER: Actually, let me. You've got a 9:00 a.m. with the DC medical examiner. He's going to let you autopsy the latest victim.

(Long pause while SCULLY looks at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Thank you for making my schedule but I think I'm going to have to be late for that appointment.

(MULDER, surprised, watches her go, "What did I do?" expression on his face.)



SCENE 5

(SCULLY enters a Catholic church and goes straight to a painting of Christ holding a burning heart. A man standing behind a column watches her. It is PHILLIP PADGETT. He walks over and looks at the painting with her. SCULLY stares at him, obviously uncomfortable.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: I often come here to look at this painting. It's called "My Divine Heart" after the miracle of Saint Margaret Mary. Do you know the story... The revelation of the Sacred Heart? Christ came to Margaret Mary his heart so inflamed with love that it was no longer able to contain its burning flames of charity. Margaret Mary... so filled with divine love herself, asked the Lord to take her heart... and so he did placing it alongside his until it burned with the flames of his passion. Then he restored it to Margaret Mary sealing her wound with the touch of his blessed hand.

SCULLY: Why are you telling me this?

PHILLIP PADGETT: You came here specifically to see this painting, didn't you?

SCULLY: Yes. How did you know that?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I saw you enter. The way you knew right where it was.

SCULLY: I know you. You live next to somebody I work with. Why are you following me?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I'm not. I'd only imagined that you'd come here today.

SCULLY: You imagined it.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Yes.

SCULLY: Yeah.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I'm a writer. That's what I do-- imagine how people behave. I have to admit I've noticed you. I do that... Notice people. I saw that you wear a gold cross around your neck so I was taking a chance with the painting-- explaining something you may have already known. I saw Georgetown parking permits on your car dating from 1993 and a government-exempt sticker that lets you park anywhere you like. You don't live in this area but as a federal employee, you have reason to frequent it. You're fit, with muscular calves so you must exercise or run. There's a popular running route right nearby that you might use at lunch or after work. You'd have noticed this church in passing and though parking is always a problem in this part of town your special privileges would make it easy to visit  not as a place of worship but because you have an appreciation for architecture and the arts... and while the grandeur is what you'd take away from your visit  this painting's religious symbolism would have left a subconscious impression jogged by the gift you received this morning.

(Apparently, he is correct about everything. SCULLY stares at him.)

SCULLY: That was from you?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I have to admit to a secret attraction.

(SCULLY, looks away rolling her eyes, not wanting to deal with this.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: I'm sorry I didn't include a note explaining that but you didn't know me then.

SCULLY: Yeah, and I don't know you now and I don't care to.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I see this is making you uncomfortable and I'm sorry. It's just that I'm taken with you. That never happens to me. We're alike that way.

(SCULLY stares at him, tears in her eyes. She slowly turns and leaves the church.)



SCENE 6

(Short time later, SCULLY enters autopsy bay. MULDER and MEs are waiting for her. MULDER speaks to her privately.)

MULDER: (gentle rebuke) Hey, you weren't joking about being late. I was about to start slicing and dicing, myself.

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

(MULDER sighs.)

MULDER: Where were you?

SCULLY: I was doing some research and learning that I owe you an apology.

MULDER: For what?

SCULLY: The Milagro charm-- you were right about its insignificance.

MULDER: No, I think I was wrong. I think it's very significant. I think it may be a communication from the killer. Most of my research shows that most credible practitioners of psychic surgery believe themselves to be imbued with the Holy Spirit-- that their hands become the miracle tools of God.

SCULLY: (holding up the charm) Mulder, this... is nothing more than a tool used by a lovelorn Romeo who just happens to be your next-door neighbor.

MULDER: Who, the writer?

SCULLY: Yes-- my secret admirer who claims to know the mysteries of my heart.

MULDER: You're kidding.

SCULLY: No, I wish I were. He cornered me today and told me my life story. It was kind of frightening, actually.

MULDER: Is  he our killer?

SCULLY: No. "Frightening" as in too much information and intimate detail. What kills you is his audacity. MULDER: Did you get his name?

SCULLY: (challenging) No, but that shouldn't be too hard to find out, should it?

(MULDER nods, not quite sure what to say.)



SCENE 7

(Lobby of MULDER's building. MULDER finds PHILLIP PADGETT's mailbox. He looks around and, seeing no one, pulls out his lockpick and opens the postman's master lock. He pulls out PHILLIP PADGETT's mail, takes out the phone bill then shuts the box again. Eastern Telephonics - Payment Center, Washington, DC 20032 - Phillip Padgett - 2630 Hegel Place Apt. No. 44 - Alexandria, VA 23242. He picks a paper up off the floor walks over to the elevator. PHILLIP PADGETT enters the lobby. MULDER tucks the envelope inside the folded paper and tucks it under his arm. The elevator arrives, a woman gets off and both men get on. MULDER pushes the 4 button and they face each other in that uncomfortable elevator way. PHILLIP PADGETT stares at the folded paper under MULDER's arm.)

MULDER: I'm sorry I forgot your name.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Padgett.

MULDER: (as if remembering) Padgett.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Phillip Padgett.

(PHILLIP PADGETT is staring at MULDER, openly hostile. Major alpha male tension.)

MULDER: You're a writer. Anything I'd know?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I don't think so.

(The elevator opens and they go to their respective doors.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: You're an FBI agent. Working on anything interesting?

MULDER: A murder case.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Anything I'd know?

MULDER: Possibly.

(They each enter their apartments. Later, PHILLIP PADGETT is typing.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) The overture in the church had urged the beautiful agent's partner into an act of Hegelian self-justification. Expeditiously violating the fourth amendment against mail theft, he prepared to impudently infract the first.

(PHILLIP PADGETT glances up at the heating vent. At the same time MULDER, standing on a chair, has his ear to the vent in his apartment.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) But if she'd predictably aroused her sly partner's suspicions Special Agent Dana Scully had herself become... simply aroused.

(CUT TO: SCULLY finishing up the autopsy. Under the narration she pulls off the bloody scrubs covering her black suit. She takes out the charm again and looks at it.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) All morning the stranger's unsolicited compliments had played on the dampened strings of her instrument until the middle "C" of consciousness was struck square and resonant. She was flattered. His words had presented her a pretty picture of herself quite unlike the practiced mask of uprightness that mirrored back to her from the medical examiners and the investigators and all the lawmen who dared no such utterances.

(SCULLY glances over her shoulder as someone passes by then returns her gaze to the charm. As the narration continues, we see the camera pan past two coffee cups on the bedside table then to a dark-haired man and a red-haired woman lying on a bed kissing. He runs his hand up her leg and under her skirt, then up to her chest. As SCULLY watches him, one arm resting over her head, the dark-haired, mustachioed man slowly unbuttons her blouse and pushes it to the side exposing her black lace bra, then he leans down and they kiss passionately.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) She felt an involuntary flush and rebuked herself for the girlish indulgence. But the images came perforce and she let them play-- let them flood in like savory-- or more a sugary confection-- from her adolescence when her senses were new and ungoverned by fear and self-denial. 'Ache,' 'pang,' 'prick,' 'twinge'-- how ironic the Victorian vocabulary of behavioral pathology now so perfectly described the palpations of her own desire. The stranger had looked her in the eye and knew her more completely than she knew herself. She felt wild, feral, guilty as a criminal. Had the stranger unleashed in her what was already there or only helped her discover a landscape she, by necessity, blinded herself to? What would her partner think of her?

(Back in reality, PHILLIP PADGETT is still typing. Next door, MULDER, listening to the typewriter, opens PADGETT's phone bill. Under the long distance charges it says "No calls placed.")

MULDER: Mr. Popularity.

(MULDER looks up at the vent again, then sighs and leans back onto the couch rubbing his face tiredly. He looks down at the newspaper - "DC MUSE - Opening night at the Theatre!" He picks it up and begins reading it. Out in the hall, SCULLY gets off the elevator and goes to MULDER's door. She hears PHILLIP PADGETT typing next door. We see him type "compulsion was overwhelming " He looks up at the knock at his door. He opens it for SCULLY. Throughout the scene she is very uncomfortable.)

SCULLY: Hi. I, um... I was going next door and I thought that I'd return this.

(SCULLY holds out the milagro charm.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Why?

SCULLY: Because I can't return the gesture. (pause) I can't.

PHILLIP PADGETT: You're curious about me.

(SCULLY looks around at the sparsely furnished apartment.)

SCULLY: You don't have any furniture.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I have what I need. I write at my desk. I sleep in my bed.

SCULLY: You don't eat?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I live in my head.

SCULLY: Writing your books?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Yes.

SCULLY: Anything I'd know?

PHILLIP PADGETT: No. They're all failures...

(SCULLY gives a weak smile.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Except the one I'm working on now. I think I'm getting it right.

SCULLY: Why now, all of a sudden?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Best not to question it. (pause) See? You are curious about me.

SCULLY: Well, you lead a curious life.

PHILLIP PADGETT: It's not so different from yours I imagine-- lonely.

SCULLY: (looks away) Loneliness is a choice.

PHILLIP PADGETT: So, how about a cup of coffee?

(Next door MULDER looks at a circled ad in the personals of the newspaper. "To Maggie with love on Valentines Day 2/14/99 Kevin." He brings in a stack of other newspapers and begins looking through them. In the other apartment, SCULLY looks at the last words on the page in the typewriter: "How will it end?" PHILLIP PADGETT carries in two mismatched mugs of coffee and hands one to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: (quietly) My life's not so lonely, Mister, um...

PHILLIP PADGETT: Padgett.

SCULLY: It's actually anything but.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Mmm.

SCULLY: How is it you think you know me so well, Mr. Padgett?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I'm writing about you.

SCULLY: Right. (realizes he is serious) Since when?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Since I first noticed you. You live in my old neighborhood.

SCULLY: And you moved into this building by coincidence?

PHILLIP PADGETT: No.

SCULLY: You moved here because of me?

PHILLIP PADGETT: There wasn't anything available in your building and it's not like you spent a lot of time at home. I-I should've said something but I just couldn't get it all down fast enough. To really write someone, I have to be in their head. I have to know them more completely than they know themselves.

SCULLY: (looking at the thick manuscript) This is all about me?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Well, you're an important part.

SCULLY: May I read it?

PHILLIP PADGETT: It's not finished. I can't tell you how helpful it is having you here-- being able to talk with you like this. Would you sit and stay a minute?

SCULLY: You don't have anywhere to sit.

(PHILLIP PADGETT leads her into the bedroom and sets his cup down on the bedside table and messes with the lamp. It doesn't come on.)

SCULLY: (reluctantly) I'm due next door.

PHILLIP PADGETT: (plugging the lamp in) You haven't finished your coffee.

SCULLY: I'm very uncomfortable with this.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Why? You're armed, aren't you?

(As PHILLIP PADGETT turns on the bedside light, the bulb burns out.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Imagine that. (pushes the curtain away from the window to let a little light in) I'll get a bulb.

(As he goes to get a bulb, SCULLY looks out the window at the red brick wall of the next building. PHILLIP PADGETT enters with a new bulb.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: A view only a writer can appreciate.

SCULLY: If you know me so well then why am I standing here when my instincts tell me to go?

PHILLIP PADGETT: (changing the bulb) Motive is never easy. Sometimes it occurs to one only later. (the light is now on) Please. Sit.

(He puts the shade back on the lamp and they sit together on the foot of the bed. Behind them, the bulb burns out again.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Imagine that.

(They sit. SCULLY stares straight ahead. PHILLIP PADGETT stares at her. The front door crashes open and MULDER bursts into the room, gun drawn. He is surprised to see them in the bedroom.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

MULDER: Scully.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: You all right?

SCULLY: (pointed) Yes.

(MULDER goes back into the other room and begins looking through the manuscript. A few pages flutter to the floor. He looks intently at one of the pages.)

SCULLY: Mulder... what are you doing?

(MULDER hands the page to SCULLY then grabs PHILLIP PADGETT and handcuffs him.)

MULDER: Putting this man under arrest.

(SCULLY sees the words on the page: "his fantasy come to life" " and felt his warm, beating heart.")



SCENE 8

(Prison interrogation room. MULDER is questioning PHILLIP PADGETT. MULDER shows him one of the newspapers with the circled personal ad.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Yes, I've seen this paper.

MULDER: Yeah, it's how you found your victims-- in the personals. They all took out personal ads.

PHILLIP PADGETT: They were lovers.

MULDER: And you targeted them.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I only write about them.

MULDER: No, you targeted...

(SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: (softly, warning) Mulder. Not without his lawyer.

(He gives her a look.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: I don't need a lawyer. I'm telling the truth.

MULDER: Then this is your confession?

(MULDER tosses the bagged manuscript to PHILLIP PADGETT.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: No, that's my novel.

MULDER: It's all in there-- every detail, every murder, all laid out. How'd you do it, Mr. Padgett?

PHILLIP PADGETT: If I sit long enough, it just comes to me.

MULDER: The murders.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I only knew what was in my mind and wished to express it clearly.

MULDER: How about "the stranger"? Is that you? How about Ken Naciamento?

PHILLIP PADGETT: The self-proclaimed Brazilian psychic surgeon?

MULDER: Is that your accomplice?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I guess you could say that. He's a central character.

MULDER: Did you direct him to do it?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Jungians would say it's the characters who choose the writer, not the other way around. So I guess you could argue he directed me.

MULDER: (glancing at SCULLY) Which is the truth?

PHILLIP PADGETT: By their nature words are imprecise and layered with meaning. The signs of things, not the things themselves. It's difficult to say who's in charge.

(MULDER starts to step angrily toward PHILLIP PADGETT, but SCULLY places her hand on his arm.)

SCULLY: (softly) Mulder.

(MULDER backs off. PHILLIP PADGETT sadly looks at SCULLY's hand as she releases MULDER's arm.)

MULDER: Why, Mr. Padgett? Maybe that's a question you can answer.

PHILLIP PADGETT: That's the one question I can't.

(MULDER picks up the manuscript and goes to the door.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: Agent Mulder, my book... did you like it?

MULDER: Maybe if it were fiction.

(SCULLY follows MULDER out into the hall.)

SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?

MULDER: To find his accomplice, the Brazilian psychic surgeon.

SCULLY: (holding up a folder) I did that. That's what I've been doing. Dr. Ken Naciamento, Sao Paulo, Brazil, emigrated here in 1996.

MULDER: Where is he now?

SCULLY: He's dead.

MULDER: He can't be.

SCULLY: Two years dead, Mulder. I'm having them fax me a certificate of death.

MULDER: Padgett couldn't have done this alone.

SCULLY: Well, maybe he didn't do it at all.

MULDER: Scully, it's all on the page. How else would he know it?

SCULLY: Maybe he imagined it, like he said. Like Shakespeare or Freud or- or Jung. I mean, maybe, maybe he has some gift and he has a clear window into human nature.

MULDER: No one can predict human behavior. No one can tell you what another person's going to do.

SCULLY: Well, isn't that what you do, Mulder, as a behavioral profiler? You  you imagine the killer's mind so well that you know what they're going to do next.

MULDER: If he imagines it, it's a priori-- before the fact. I think that's pretty clear from what he wrote about you.

(SCULLY stares at him.)

MULDER: You know you're in here, don't you?

SCULLY: (uncomfortably) I read a chapter. What does he say?

MULDER: (quietly) Well, let's just say it ends with you doing the naked pretzel with "the stranger" on a bed in an unfurnished fourth floor apartment. (pause) I'm assuming that's a priori, too?

SCULLY: (short laugh, not looking at him) I think you know me better than that, Mulder.

MULDER: Mmmm. (after another pause) Well, you might want to finish it.

(He hands her the manuscript and leaves.)

(Later, SCULLY sits at a desk in one of the prison offices reading the manuscript. The door opens and a VERY LARGE GUARD shows her a writing tablet.)

VERY LARGE GUARD: Prisoner's written something I think you should see.

SCULLY: What is it?

VERY LARGE GUARD: He says it's a statement. I think he's putting somebody on.

(He leaves. SCULLY reads the tablet.)

SCULLY: (reading, voiceover) Grief squeezed at her eggshell heart like it might break into a thousand pieces its contents running like broken promises into the hollow places his love used to fill.

(Under SCULLY's narration, we see the girl from the car, MAGGIE, standing alone in the darkness beside KEVIN's flower covered grave. She cries softly. She looks up and sees the HOODED MAN approaching her.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) How could she know this pain would end? That love, unlike matter or energy, was in endless supply in the universe... A germ which grows from nothingness which cannot be eradicated even from the darkest of hearts. If she had known this-- and who could say she would believe it?-- She would not have chanced to remain at his sad grave until such an hour so that she might not have to learn the second truth before the first: that to have love was to carry a vessel that could be lost or stolen or worse, spilled blood-red on the ground. And that love was not immutable and could become hate as day becomes night as life becomes death.

(MAGGIE runs and the HOODED MAN follows her and knocks her to the ground. She screams.)

MAGGIE: Don't!

(MAGGIE screams as the HOODED MAN, KEN NACIAMENTO, gritting his teeth, pulls out her heart and holds it over her. SCULLY looks up from the tablet, very upset. She quickly gathers up the papers.)



SCENE 9

(Next day. Cemetery is now a crime scene. MULDER walks over to the car where SCULLY is on her cell phone. As he approaches, she hangs up.)

SCULLY: She's a no-show at home or anywhere else she might go.

MULDER: No signs of a possible struggle at the grave site but the area's been so trammeled by the funeral that collecting evidence is going to be virtually impossible. I think this is a big jerk off.

SCULLY: Maybe his statement's to prove that he's telling the truth-- that he truly just imagined it, Mulder.

MULDER: The only thing that he imagined was us out here...

(MULDER sees a hooded man get out of a pickup truck filled with old flowers from the gravesites.)

MULDER: ...looking like idiots.

(MULDER pulls out his gun while running toward the man. SCULLY runs after him. MULDER leaps on top of the man knocking him to the ground with a very impressive flying tackle.)

MULDER: Hands where I can see 'em! Don't move until I tell you! I'm a federal agent.

(The hood is pulled back revealing a young clean-shaven guy, the CEMETERY WORKER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, that's not him.

CEMETERY WORKER: What'd I do?

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: (still holding his gun on the CEMETERY WORKER) The truck. Check the truck, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, he works here.

(MULDER leaves his captive and climbs into the back of the truck. He pushes aside a layer of wilted flowers revealing the body of MAGGIE.)



SCENE 10
POLICE STATION MULDER and SCULLY are walking to PHILLIP PADGETT's cell.)

SCULLY: How did you know, Mulder, that the body was in the truck?

MULDER: (putting a finger to his forehead, Karnac-style) I imagined it.

SCULLY: It's still no evidence that Padgett directed the killer.

MULDER: What do you need, a signed work order? Of course he directed him.

SCULLY: Mulder, you are making critical assumptions without any facts. What about time of death? What...?

(MULDER grabs SCULLY's shoulders and turns them 180 degrees.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: You're about to argue my usual side, aren't you?

SCULLY: Mulder, why couldn't he have imagined it? Why couldn't he just be in the killer's head?

MULDER: You read his book. You read what he wrote about you. Are you trying to tell me that he got inside your head? That what I read is true?

SCULLY: (looking away) Mulder, of course not.

MULDER: I don't know how they communicate. This is the only way I can think to catch him.

(PHILLIP PADGETT's cell. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

MULDER: (apologetically, handing over the plastic wrapped manuscript) Mr. Padgett... you can go. We apologize for our mistake. You're free to finish your book.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Thank you.

(PHILLIP PADGETT exits the cell, then turns back to MULDER and SCULLY.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: I made a mistake myself.

MULDER: What's that, Mr. Padgett?

PHILLIP PADGETT: In my book, I'd written that Agent Scully falls in love but that's obviously impossible. (looking at MULDER) Agent Scully is already in love.

(He leaves. MULDER watches SCULLY watch him go.)



SCENE 11

(PHILLIP PADGETT enters his apartment. Heartbeat music again. He sits at his desk, takes off his shoes, and pulls out the last page of the manuscript and prepares to put it in the typewriter. He looks up and sees the HOODED MAN, KEN NACIAMENTO standing in the doorway.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: What are you doing here?

(PHILLIP PADGETT stares at KEN NACIAMENTO. KEN NACIAMENTO speaks with a South American accent. Like PHILLIP PADGETT, he has a goatee and mustache.)

KEN NACIAMENTO: You seem surprised to see me.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Yes. Completely.

KEN NACIAMENTO: Why? I'm your character.

PHILLIP PADGETT: What do you want?

KEN NACIAMENTO: I'm here to help you finish.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I-I can't figure out your motive.

KEN NACIAMENTO: You imagine me so perfectly in every way. So perfectly that you bring me to life. Why did you choose me?

PHILLIP PADGETT: I needed a perfect crime. And she's a doctor. She'd be horrified by what you do.

KEN NACIAMENTO: *I'm* horrified. I just want to know why I do it.

PHILLIP PADGETT: So I could meet her.

KEN NACIAMENTO: That's not a reason. It's an excuse.

(Next door, MULDER adjusts a camera in the vent near the ceiling. SCULLY is sitting on the couch watching the closed circuit monitor they have set up on the coffee table. She sees PHILLIP PADGETT sitting alone at his desk.)

MULDER: Anything?

SCULLY: No. He's just sitting there. Staring.

(Next door, KEN NACIAMENTO looks at a section of the manuscript.)

KEN NACIAMENTO: Now what is this?

PHILLIP PADGETT: A big mistake. I misjudged her character-- her interest in me.

KEN NACIAMENTO: Now we're on to something.

PHILLIP PADGETT: She's only trying to get his attention but doesn't know it.

KEN NACIAMENTO: The old unconscious at work.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I wanted to love her.

KEN NACIAMENTO: No wonder you can't finish this book, Padgett. Why do I want their hearts?

PHILLIP PADGETT: You tell me. Why do you do it?

KEN NACIAMENTO: I'm your character. You tell me. My reason is your reason.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I want to feel love.

KEN NACIAMENTO: No. No. You had it right up to there. You were a tool of the truth. And when it finally arrives-- when I arrive-- you don't want to see it.

PHILLIP PADGETT: But what is the truth?

KEN NACIAMENTO: Man imagines that he, too, can open up his heart and expose the burning passion-- the flames of charity-- like the creator himself but this is not in his power.

PHILLIP PADGETT: But I have love in my heart.

KEN NACIAMENTO: Yes, as a thief has riches, a usurer money. You have it... but man's only power, only true power is to destroy it.

PHILLIP PADGETT: Then what's the end of my story?

KEN NACIAMENTO: There can only be one true ending if it is to be perfect.

PHILLIP PADGETT: She dies?

KEN NACIAMENTO: See? It almost writes itself.

(Next door. Later. SCULLY has taken off her boots and is leaning back on the couch with her eyes closed. She hears the typewriter start up and she leans forward to look at the monitor. MULDER comes in from the kitchen carrying a glass of water and sits beside her.)

MULDER: What's he up to now?

SCULLY: He just started typing again.

(SCULLY holds the headphones up to her ear and MULDER takes a sip of water. They watch in the monitor as PHILLIP PADGETT pulls the paper out of the typewriter. He picks up the entire manuscript and walks out of frame.)

MULDER: Now what? (climbs up to the camera and adjusts it to another view of the room) Anything?

(The camera shows that the room is empty. They hear the door slam. They look at each other, then MULDER runs out the door in time to see the elevator doors closing. He runs for the stairs. In the basement, PHILLIP PADGETT carries his manuscript over to the blazing incinerator. MULDER, gun drawn, enters the basement.)

MULDER: Padgett! Freeze. Step away from the incinerator.

(Upstairs in MULDER's apartment, SCULLY finishes zipping up her boot and goes to the door. As she opens it, the hooded man grabs her and pushes her back into the room.)

(In the basement, MULDER comes over to PHILLIP PADGETT.)

MULDER: What do you think you're doing?

PHILLIP PADGETT: Destroying my book.

MULDER: Destroying evidence, you mean. Let me see what you wrote.

PHILLIP PADGETT: I'll tell you. He kills her.

(Up in MULDER's apartment, KEN NACIAMENTO has SCULLY pinned to the floor. She begins crying out in agony as he tries to work his fingers into her chest. Blood begins to stain her white blouse. She frantically tries to get her gun out of the holster.)

(In the basement, MULDER is looking at the manuscript.)

MULDER: You came down here to give these instructions to your accomplice?

PHILLIP PADGETT: No, he told me how it ends.

MULDER: When?

PHILLIP PADGETT: In my apartment.

MULDER: You were alone up there.

(MULDER looks up as he hears a gunshot. Upstairs SCULLY is firing her gun point blank into KEN NACIAMENTO's chest. The bullets have no effect. MULDER turns and runs up the stairs. SCULLY runs out of bullets. KEN NACIAMENTO begins digging deeper into SCULLY's chest. She screams louder. PHILLIP PADGETT throws the manuscript into the flames of the incinerator and it begins to burn. MULDER, gun drawn, runs down the hall and bursts into his apartment. He is wearing the "panic face" as he goes over to where SCULLY lies alone on the floor. Her chest is covered in blood. He kneels beside her. She wakes, terrified. MULDER grips her tightly until she realizes it is him. She reaches up around his neck and clings to him, desperately clawing at his shoulders. MULDER holds her close. As she begins sobbing into his neck, he also looks like he is about to cry also.)

(In the basement. As PHILLIP PADGETT narrates, we see the camera pan down from the burning manuscript to his body lying on the floor. He is dead, his still beating heart in his hand.)

PHILLIP PADGETT: (voiceover) A story can have only one true ending. Even as the stranger felt compelled to commit his final words to paper he did it knowing they must never be read. To see the sum of his work was to see inside his own emptiness the heart of a destroyer not a creator. And yet, reflected back upon him at last he could see his own ending. And in this final act of destruction a chance to give what he could not receive.

[THE END]

                                THE UNNATURAL



SCENE 1
ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO
JULY 2, 1947

(Nighttime. Over a small hill, we see a white glow, as if a UFO has crashed. The camera pans over the hill showing a bright light illuminating  a baseball game between a white team, the Southwest All Stars, and a black team, the Grays. The field is also lit by the headlights of the 1940's cars parked nearby. The Grays are at bat. The pitcher for the white team has very thick glasses and is not very good. Everyone is having a good time.)

UMPIRE: Play ball!

(The pitcher makes some weird eye and tongue movements which may or may not be a signal, then throws the ball. The UMPIRE, BATTER, and CATCHER all duck as the ball hits and gets stuck in a large cactus behind them. It is not the first ball to hit the cactus.)

UMPIRE: Ball four! Take your base!

(The batter goes to first base as another player digs the ball out of the cactus.)

WHITE COACH: (calling encouragement to the pitcher) That's it, Moose! You're getting close now! Bring it, son!

(PINEY, another white player #3 [who looks suspiciously similar to a certain large nosed FBI agent we all know and love] is less than impressed with the myopic pitcher, MOOSE.)

PINEY: Moose couldn't find the plate if you nailed it to his ass.

WHITE COACH: Shut your pie hole, Piney. Kid's got to learn. Come straight over the top, Moose. Straight over the top. Come on!

(The CATCHER sees the next batter come up. He takes off his mask and calls a warning to the outfielders.)

CATCHER: Ah, damn. Exley's up. Back up! Exley's up! Back up!

(The Gray batter, #12 - EXLEY comes up to the plate. His smile is open and friendly.)

JOSH EXLEY: You sure your boy got the right prescription in those spectacles?

CATCHER: Ah, don't worry, Ex. See, I told him to throw it right at your big, nappy, home-run-hitting head. So you can bet a hundred clams that ball's going anywhere but there.

(JOSH EXLEY grins at him again. The pitcher, MOOSE, throws the ball and JOSH EXLEY hits it hard. It soars up, but falls out of bounds.)

UMPIRE: Foul! Foul ball! Foul! Foul ball!

(PINEY runs into the darkness after the ball. He looks around, but it's too dark to see more than a few feet. Suddenly, the ball rolls toward him stopping at his feet. He finds this most odd. He looks around again, but sees nothing. He then takes the ball and runs back to the field. Game resumes. Next pitch sinks into the cactus.)

UMPIRE: Ball!

WHITE COACH: Moose! Straight over the top.

(The WHITE COACH, PINEY, and the other team members all make pitching motions calling encouragement. Very funny.)

PINEY: Over the top. Yes.

CATCHER: Hey, Ex. I heard the Yankees have been calling you.

JOSH EXLEY: I'm fine playing here in the Cactus league. It's nice and quiet.

(Next pitch bounces off the cactus.)

UMPIRE: Ball! (throwing the ball back to the pitcher) Leave the cactus alone, son!

CATCHER: Gee, I don't know, Ex. The Yanks could use those 60 home runs a year. Well, now that, uh, Jackie Robinson's up there in the Bigs people are saying you're going to be next. The first black Negro man of color in the American League. Shoot, Ex, you'll be famous, man.

JOSH EXLEY: I don't want to be no famous man. Just want to be a man.

(Now all the members of the Grays are also calling encouragement to the white pitcher.)

GRAYS: Over the top! Over the top! Over the top, man!

(After an acknowledging glance to them as if to say sarcastically, "Thanks a lot," MOOSE pitches again. This time, JOSH EXLEY hits it and it flies way out past the outfield. JOSH EXLEY smiles as he watches the ball disappear against the star-studded black sky.)

UMPIRE: Home run! Home run!

(The Grays, some of whom are DURANT - 14, PETERS - 8, cheer.)

JOSH EXLEY: Sixty-one.

(The Grays lift JOSH EXLEY onto their shoulders. There is mass celebration. JOSH EXLEY looks over to the darkness beyond the cars. Something isn't right.)

GRAYS: I told you he could do it. I told you he could do it. Sixty-one.

(A group of horsemen ride up. They are all wearing the sheets and concealing hoods of the Ku Klux Klan and carrying rifles. The celebration stops and both teams step forward to face the riders. Very tense.)

WHITE COACH: What do you boys want? We're just playing a baseball game, here.

KKK RIDER: We got no beef with you, sir. It's that black Babe Ruth hiding behind you. Josh Exley. That's all we come for.

BLACK COACH: Well, you can't have him.

KKK RIDER: We heard the Yankees want to let a Nigger play ball so we just figure we're going to play with him a little bit some first. Now, all you Niggers and Nigger-lovers! You can go home! It's Ex we want.

(Suddenly, a baseball hits the KKK RIDER on the head, knocking him to the ground. MOOSE, the myopic pitcher gets ready to throw another ball.)

WHITE COACH: That's what I'm talking about Moose-- straight over the top. Come on, straight over the top with it.

(WHITE COACH tosses him another ball. MOOSE knocks two more KKK RIDERS to the ground.)

WHITE COACH: Come on, get the guns. Get the guns.

(They pick up the guns of the fallen KKK RIDERS and face the remaining riders.)

BLACK COACH: You boys ain't so tough without your shotguns, are you, fellows?

(A WHITE PLAYER kneels down next to the first KKK RIDER knocked off the horse.)

WHITE PLAYER: You ain't nothing but a coward. Hiding behind your mama's bedsheet. Let's see your face.

(He pulls the hood away and stares in shock.)

WHITE PLAYER: Holy mother of...

(He backs away. The KKK RIDER is a gray alien. All the other players back away also.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS

(Basement corridor for the X-Files office. There is baseball game on a small TV which is sitting on a cleaning cart in the hall. Vin Scully is announcing for the LA team.)

VIN SCULLY: It's a gorgeous day for baseball here in the City of Angels and I'm told it is a gorgeous day all over our republic today-- from Bangor to Bellflower, from Amarillo to Anchorage the sun is shining and it's a perfect day to play baseball... That ball is ripped... and it's going, going, gone...

JANITOR: Morning.

(SCULLY, carrying a heavy load of large files, comes down the stairs, acknowledges the JANITOR at the TV and [for lack of a better word -sorry SCULLY] waddles into the office and drops the large books onto MULDER's desk. MULDER looks up at her over the top of the record book he is reading. She goes over to the back wall, steps up on the boxes there and gazes wistfully out the window.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it is such a gorgeous day outside. Have you ever entertained the idea of trying to find life on this planet?

MULDER: (still looking at the record book) I have seen the life on this planet, Scully and that is exactly why I am looking elsewhere.

(SCULLY opens a paper bag she is carrying and removes a paper-wrapped frozen dessert. This gets MULDER's attention.)

MULDER: Did you bring enough ice cream to share with the rest of the class?

SCULLY: (smugly, beginning to eat) It's not ice cream. It's a nonfat tofutti rice dreamsicle.

MULDER: (returning to his book) Ugh. Bet the air in my mouth tastes better than that. You sure know how to live it up, Scully.

SCULLY: (stepping down and continuing to eat) Oh, you're Mr. Live-it-up. Mulder, you're really Mr. Squeeze-every-last-drop-out-of-this-sweet-life aren't you? On this precious Saturday you've got us grabbing life by the testes stealing reference books from the FBI library in order to go through New Mexico newspaper obituaries for the years 1940 to 1949 and for what joyful purpose?

MULDER: Looking for anomalies, Scully. Do you know how many so-called "flying disc" reports there were in New Mexico in the 1940s?

SCULLY: I don't care. Mulder, this is a needle in a haystack. These poor souls have been dead for 50 years. Let them rest in peace. Let sleeping dogs lie.

MULDER: No, I won't sit idly by as you hurl cliches at me. Preparation is the father of inspiration.

SCULLY: Necessity is the mother of invention.

MULDER: The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.

SCULLY: (taking another bite) Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die.

MULDER: I scream, you scream, we all scream for nonfat tofutti rice dreamsicles.

(MULDER sets the book down and lunges for SCULLY. He grabs her arm and takes a bite of the dreamsicle. The cone breaks and pieces of the dessert splatter down on the book.)

SCULLY: No-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! (delightful laugh) Mulder!

(She looks closely at the dairy-product-smeared page.)

SCULLY: (accusing) Mulder!? You cheat. I can't believe that you've been reading about baseball this whole time.

MULDER: Reading the box scores, Scully. You'd like it. It's like the Pythagorean Theorem for jocks. It distills all the chaos and action of any game in the history of all baseball games into one tiny, perfect, rectangular sequence of numbers. I can look at this box and I can recreate exactly what happened on some sunny summer day back in 1947. It's like the numbers talk to me, they comfort me. They tell me that even though lots of things can change some things do remain the same. It's...

SCULLY: (interrupting) Boring. Mulder, can I ask you a personal question?

MULDER: Of course not.

SCULLY: Did your mother ever tell you to go outside and play? Mulder?

(MULDER is looking intently at a picture in the book. He wipes away the ice cream. It is a picture of two white men and one black man in a baseball jersey. They are standing in front of an old bus with "Roswell Grays" on the side. One of the white men is the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER. Headline is "Local Roswell police officer Arthur Dales chats with Diamond Star Josh Exley.")

MULDER: (to himself) Is that Arthur... Dales...

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: (fake) Ah... Choo!

(As MULDER pretends to sneeze, he rips the page out of the book. SCULLY stares at him in disbelief.)

SCULLY: You just defaced property of the U.S. Government.

(Carrying the torn page, MULDER gets his leather jacket and runs out of the office. SCULLY watches him go. If anything, she has a slight smile.)

SCULLY: You rebel.



SCENE 3
WASHINGTON, DC

(MULDER is walking down the hall of a dilapidated old apartment building which we have seen before in an episode in late fifth season that involved Travelers, flashbacks, crab-things crawling down people's throats, and wedding rings. Sorry, this transcriber has blocked out that episode. He steps over an unconscious drunk and knocks at one of the doors. An OLD MAN answers, opening door a crack.)

OLD MAN: What in hell took you so long?

MULDER: I'm-I'm sorry, sir, I'm-I'm looking for Arthur Dales.

ARTHUR DALES: I'm Arthur Dales.

MULDER: No, you're not.

ARTHUR DALES: Don't be a wiseass, son.

MULDER: No, I-I'm sorry, sir, I know Arthur Dales and you're not Arthur Dales.

ARTHUR DALES: Arthur Dales is my brother. My name also happens to be Arthur Dales. It's the same name, different guy. The other Arthur, he moved to Florida the lucky bastard. Now, our parents weren't exactly big in the imagination department when it came to names. If it would help you wrapping your little head around this stupefying mystery, Agent Mulder we had a sister named Arthur, too and a goldfish.

MULDER: How do you know my name?

ARTHUR DALES: My brother told me all about you. He said you were the biggest jackass in the Bureau since he retired. Yeah, we're big fans. Sometimes we'd stay awake hours at night just talking about you. Just fascinating. Now, unless you're hiding some Chinese food let's call it a day.

(ARTHUR DALES shuts the door in MULDER's face. MULDER waits a moment, then unfolds the paper he took from the office and speaks through the door.)

MULDER: Mr. Dales, I have a, uh... I have a photo here of your brother. Maybe it's you. It's from many years ago and you're, you're standing in Roswell, New Mexico.

ARTHUR DALES: (from inside) Roswell. That's me. I was a cop once in Roswell.

MULDER: Okay, and you're standing with Negro League legend Josh Exley who disappeared without a trace during a season in which he reportedly hit 60 home runs.

ARTHUR DALES: Sixty-one.

MULDER: 61 home runs in 1948.

ARTHUR DALES: Forty-seven.

MULDER: '47, whatever. I don't really care about the baseball, so much, sir. What I care about is this man in the picture with you. I believe to be an alien bounty hunter.

ARTHUR DALES: (opening the door a crack) Of course you don't care about the baseball, Mr. Mulder. You only bothered my brother about the important things like government conspiracies and alien bounty hunters and the truth with a capital "T."

MULDER: Wait a minute. I like baseball.

ARTHUR DALES: You like baseball, huh?

MULDER: Yeah.

ARTHUR DALES: How many home runs did Mickey Mantle hit?

MULDER: (thinks) A hundred and sixty-three.

(Disappointed, ARTHUR DALES begins to close the door. MULDER pushes it back open.)

MULDER: Righty. 373 lefty. 536 total.

(ARTHUR DALES nods, impressed. And opens the door all the way. Later, MULDER is sitting on the couch in ARTHUR DALES' cluttered apartment. ARTHUR DALES is looking through drawers and boxes.)

ARTHUR DALES: What you fail to understand in your joyless myopia is that baseball is the key to life-- the Rosetta Stone, if you will. If you just understood baseball better all your other questions your, your... the, uh... the aliens, the conspiracies they would all, in their way be answered by the baseball gods.

MULDER: Yes, sir, that may be true. I'm thinking that your experience in Roswell could be germane to a conspiracy between men in our government and these shape-shifting alien beings.

ARTHUR DALES: Oh, don't bore me, son. My brother Arthur started the X-Files with the Federal Bureau of Obfuscation before you were born. He was working for the FBI hunting for aliens when you were watching My Best Friend's Martians. You say "shape-shifting." Agent Mulder, do you believe that love can make a man shape-shift?

MULDER: (soft laugh) I guess... women change men all the time.

ARTHUR DALES: I'm not talking about women. I'm talking about love. Passion. Like the passion you have for proving extra-terrestrial life. Do you believe that that passion can change your very nature? Can make you shape-shift from a man into something other than a man?

MULDER: What exactly has your brother told you about me?

(ARTHUR DALES doesn't answer, keeps searching.)

MULDER: Mr. Dales, if you and your brother have really known about this bounty hunter and plans for colonization for the last 50 years why the hell wouldn't you have told anybody?

ARTHUR DALES: Nobody'd believe me.

MULDER: I would have believed you.

ARTHUR DALES: You weren't... ripe.

MULDER: (standing) Not ripe? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: I have been ripe for years. I am way past ripe. I'm so ripe I'm rotten. This cuts to the very heart of the mystery of what I've been doing with my life for the past ten years.

ARTHUR DALES: Oh, the heart of the mystery, the heart of the mystery. Ah, there you are.

(ARTHUR DALES has found and holds up a model of a kneeling baseball player. It is a child's toy bank.)

ARTHUR DALES: Mr. Mulder-- maybe you'd better start paying a little less attention to the heart of the mystery and a little more attention to the mystery of the heart. You got a dime?

MULDER: What is this?

ARTHUR DALES: This little fellow goes by the name of Pete Rosebud. If you keep pumping coffee money into him he'll tell you a story about baseball and aliens and bounty hunters.

MULDER: (putting a dime in the toy) You're making me feel like a child.

ARTHUR DALES: Perfect. That's exactly the right place to start from, then, isn't it? Now, the first thing you got to know about baseball is... it keeps you forever young.

(Camera is close on ARTHUR DALES profile. Scene fades to )



SCENE 4
ROSWELL MUNICIPAL BALLPARK
JUNE 29, 1947

( profile of YOUNG ARTHUR DALES standing in front of a 1940's Roswell police car next to a baseball field. He is looking at a flyer: "Keep Baseball Pure - Keep Baseball White - $500 Reward For Killing Josh Exley." There is a picture of JOSH EXLEY at the bottom. ARTHUR DALES looks up and sees several black Grays team members walking past. He spots JOSH EXLEY.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Mr. Exley? Mr. Exley, my name's Arthur Dales. I'm an employee of the Roswell police department.

JOSH EXLEY: Have I broken a law, sir?

(Another player, BUCK JOHNSON, passes them.)

BUCK JOHNSON: You stole  second base in the third inning. I'm a witness. (to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES) Officer, I seen Ex steal... at least 50 bases this year.

(The players begin boarding their bus.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: No, sir, you haven't broken any laws. Not that I'm aware of. Um, I've been assigned by my superiors to protect you against certain parties.

BUCK JOHNSON: I'm the one need protection from certain parties. Ex here, he in bed by 8:00 every night.

JOSH EXLEY: I appreciate your concern, sir but I can protect myself.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Mr. Exley, I'm not a big sports hero like yourself, sir and I really don't have an opinion on Negroes or Jews or Communists or even Canadians and vegetarians, for that matter but I cannot stomach the murder of a man of any persuasion or any color being flaunted and solicited in my town. (shows him the flyer) Not on my watch. So you can be safe with me in a cell down at the precinct or you can be safe with me here on the bus. Seeing as how this is still America you're free to choose, sir.

(Later, night. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES is riding on the team bus. He is reading something softly [perhaps a play?] in French. He tries reading it with different inflections.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Vous etes sans coeur. Vous etes sans coeur, Mademoiselle. Vous etes sans coeur... Coeur... [TRANSLATION: You have no heart, Mademoiselle.]

(BUCK JOHNSON comes forward and leans over YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' shoulder.)

BUCK JOHNSON: Hey, Officer Dales you're a decent man, ain't you?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I try to be.

BUCK JOHNSON: Well, the fellas feel like the umps would treat us better if you got us eight more uniforms like these to play in. (indicates the police uniform)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (laughs) Yeah, you could change your name from the Roswell grays to the Roswell Black and Blues.

(The joke seems not to have gone over well. Long nervous pause where all the black team members gather threateningly around YOUNG ARTHUR DALES, then they all start laughing and someone slaps a hat on YOUNG ARTHUR DALES.. Later, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES wakes up. He is now wearing BUCK JOHNSON's outfit [- not the baseball uniform.] He seems surprised by this fact. He gets up and walks to the back of the bus perhaps looking for his uniform. The men are all asleep. He watches JOSH EXLEY sleep. The reflection in the window is that of a gray alien. Startled, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES touches JOSH EXLEY's shoulder. JOSH EXLEY wakes and looks up at YOUNG ARTHUR DALES.)

JOSH EXLEY: What's the matter, Arthur? You look like you ain't never seen a black man before.



SCENE 5

(ARTHUR DALES' apartment, present day. MULDER gets a bottle of mustard out of a refrigerator that contains only beer, liquor, and condiments.)

MULDER: I've got to give it to you, Arthur. Calling a Negro league team from Roswell the Grays is pretty clever. E.T. steal home. E.T. steal home.

(MULDER squeezes the mustard onto the two hotdogs ARTHUR DALES is holding, then takes one of them.)

ARTHUR DALES: I didn't make that up.

MULDER: You seriously want me to believe that Josh Exley maybe one of the greatest ballplayers of all times, was an alien?

ARTHUR DALES: They're all aliens, Agent Mulder-- all the great ones.

MULDER: (not believing) Babe Ruth was an alien?

ARTHUR DALES: Yeah.

MULDER: (eating the hotdog) Joe DiMaggio?

ARTHUR DALES: Sure.

MULDER: Willie Mays?

ARTHUR DALES: Well, obviously.

MULDER: Mantle? Koufax? Gibson?

ARTHUR DALES: Bob or Kirk?

(MULDER doesn't know how to answer that one.)

ARTHUR DALES: See, none of the great ones fit in-- not in this world, not in any other world.

(There is a knock at the door.)

ARTHUR DALES: They're all aliens, Mulder until they step between the white chalk lines-- until they step on the outfield grass.

(ARTHUR DALES opens the door for a very cute young boy in overalls, POORBOY, carrying what looks like a liquor bottle in a paper bag.)

ARTHUR DALES: Like clockwork. Poor boy with my medicine. Give the kid a tip, will ya?

MULDER: (reaching into his pocket) So I assume you're speaking metaphorically?

ARTHUR DALES: Speaking metaphorically is for young men like you, Agent MacGyver. I don't have time for that. I only have time to speak the truth.

(MULDER, holding the hotdog in his mouth, hands POORBOY a dollar.)

POORBOY: (not impressed) You're a regular Rockefeller, ain't you?

(POORBOY runs down the hall, jumps over the drunk still lying in the hallway, and toward the camera then .)



SCENE 6
ROSWELL MUNICIPAL BALLPARK
JUNE 30, 1947

( POORBOY runs past the camera on his way into the ballpark. He meets up with a little black boy the same age and they walk through the stands arms on each other's shoulders.)

POORBOY: If Ex hits a couple of dingers, that'll be 60. That ties The Babe.

BOY: Aw, that ball's worth nothing. Ex ain't a major leaguer, so the record don't count.

POORBOY: Does, too.

BOY: Does not.

POORBOY: It does, too.

BOY: It does not.

POORBOY: Does, too.

BOY: Does not.

POORBOY: Does...

BOY: Not.

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES, having gotten his uniform back, is in the Gray's dugout. A mitt falls from the top of the dugout, then POORBOY leans over the edge, laughing. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES hands the mitt back and pushes him back up into the stands. The Grays all come out of the dugout and put one foot on the bench. The guy on the end takes a wad of chewing tobacco out of a pouch and passes to the next guy. JOSH EXLEY takes a wad then passes it to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES looks at the wad, then puts his foot up just like the others and takes a wad and puts it in his mouth. He holds it for a moment, his face getting more and more disgusted until finally he falls forward retching and spitting the tobacco out. BUCK JOHNSON, standing next to JOSH EXLEY, glances down then smiles.)

BUCK JOHNSON: Perfect day for a ball game.

(JOSH EXLEY chuckles. Later, he is on the field waiting for his turn at bat. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES looks around and sees two white men sitting in the stands. As he watches, the two men nod at each other then simultaneously stand and pull out two black objects. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES runs to JOSH EXLEY and pushes him to the ground shielding his body. He looks back up to the stands and sees the two men spraying the men in front of them with the water guns. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES stands and apologetically brushes off JOSH EXLEY's shirt.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: There, uh... there was a bee on you.

JOSH EXLEY: Must have been a real big one.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Could have ripped your head off.

JOSH EXLEY: Hey, Arthur... thanks.

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES goes back to the dugout. BUCK JOHNSON salutes him and he and the rest of the team laugh.)

BUCK JOHNSON: Officer Arthur Dales making the world safe for baseball and Negroes.

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES takes the laughter good-naturedly.)

UMPIRE: Play ball.

(This game is between the Grays and another black team. The pitcher throws the ball and it hits JOSH EXLEY in the head. He falls to the ground.)

JOSH EXLEY: Ow!

UMPIRE: Time! Time!

(His team members surround him.)

BLACK COACH: Do you know your name, son? Josh, do you know where you are?

(JOSH EXLEY begins muttering rapidly in an incomprehensible language.)

BUCK JOHNSON: Josh, man, wake up.

BLACK COACH: Do you know where you're from?

JOSH EXLEY: (opening his eyes, still disoriented) Macon... Macon, Georgia?

(The others pull him to his feet and he is able to walk off the field. The crowd cheers and applauds. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES looks down at the glove that someone had used to cushion JOSH EXLEY's head. It has a thick green fluid that is slowly burning through the leather. He reaches down to pick it up, and almost gets burned. He picks it up carefully and looks at it.)

(CUT TO: Unknown police department. The phone rings.)

OFFICER: (on phone) Macon police department. Can I help you?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone in an police station) Yeah, my name's Arthur Dales. I'm with the Roswell Police Department. I'm doing a background check on a gentlemen I believe is from your area. His name is Josh Exley.

OFFICER: (on phone) You want information on a Josh Exley?

(The OFFICER hands the phone over to a MAN at the next desk. We cannot see his face. As he talks to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES, the OFFICER spit shines his own badge.)

MAN: (on phone, thick Southern accent) Yeah, the name rings a bell. Yeah, I got a Josh Exley. A six-year-old colored boy disappeared oh, maybe five years ago. Now do you got a read on this Josh Exley's whereabouts?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) Six years old?

(A LAB TECHNICIAN, TED, comes over to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' desk.)

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: You wanted to see me about running some chemical tests, Arthur?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Yeah. Hold on. (into phone) That would make him 11 now? No, that can't be the one.

(He hands the acid marred mitt to TED the LAB TECHNICIAN who looks at it with disgust.)

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: I love my job. (he leaves)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) And is that all you have? Are you certain?

MAN: (on phone) Certain as the sunrise. I'm sorry, son.

(The MAN sits. It is the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: (on phone) Did you say where you were calling from?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) Roswell... Roswell, New Mexico.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: (on phone) Roswell.

(CUT TO: Back at the ball field. JOSH EXLEY is sitting in the dugout. A mitt falls from the roof, then POORBOY leans over the edge again.)

JOSH EXLEY: Hey, morning, Poorboy.

POORBOY: Morning, Ex. How's the melon?

JOSH EXLEY: My melon's fine. That boy throws like a lady.

POORBOY: I hear the Yankee scouts are here today. Going to hit numero 60?

JOSH EXLEY: Ain't no scouts here today.

POORBOY: Sure there are. Look. Right over there.

(They look into the stands and see three men in suits watching the game.)

JOSH EXLEY: I'll be damned.

(Later, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES sits in the stands with POORBOY and his friend.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Hey, kids. So how's it going?

POORBOY: (disappointed) Ex is stinking up the diamond.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Oh, yeah?

POORBOY: Yeah.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Well, anybody can have a bad day.

POORBOY: Yeah, but the Yankee scouts are in attendance today. I don't think they'll relish the idea of him being in the majors after such a piss-poor outing as this.

(JOSH EXLEY lets another ball go by.)

UMPIRE: Strike two!

(The Yankee scouts get up and leave. JOSH EXLEY watches them go, then turns back to the plate.)

UMPIRE: Two balls, two strikes now.

(The pitch is thrown, and JOSH EXLEY slams it. The ball crashes into the scoreboard knocking the numbers off. The crowd cheers.)



SCENE 7

(Night on the bus. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES walks over to JOSH EXLEY's seat.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (quietly) Ex... Why did you tank that game today?

JOSH EXLEY: I won that game today.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: You tanked the game today. You want me to tell you why? Because your name's not Josh Exley. Josh Exley is a six-year-old kid who disappeared from Macon, Georgia about the same time that you showed up in Roswell.

JOSH EXLEY: I ain't never been to Macon.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: When you got beaned, you said you were from Macon.

JOSH EXLEY: Well, I also spoke tongues like I did when I was a little boy in church. (mumbles unknown language)

JOSH EXLEY: I was joking, Arthur. Relax.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I'm relaxed. You're hiding something. That's why you don't dare get into the major leagues 'cause the sports writers and everybody would be digging around and they'd find out what it is, right? So you tanked the game in front of those scouts today. Disappointing those kids-- disappointing your teammates-disappointing your race...

JOSH EXLEY: Look here, don't go talking about my race. You don't know nothing about my race.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I know that liars come in all colors. You got a secret, and famous or not I'm going to find out what it is.

JOSH EXLEY: While you're out chasing secrets you make sure you're chasing the right ones.

(Later, the bus is parked outside a motel - The Cozy Cactus. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES is asleep in a room. He wakes when he hears a crash and grunt from the next room. He flips on the light, checks his gun, and peeps into the next room through the keyhole of the connecting door. He sees a figure moving around the room.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (to himself) Ex?

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES carefully sets his gun on the table. He gets out his pocketknife and opens the connecting door and enters. The figure is practice swinging a baseball bat. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES turns on the light and stares at the figure. It turns. It is a gray alien wearing underwear and a baseball cap. They stare at each other, then YOUNG ARTHUR DALES gives a high-pitched VERY girly scream. The GRAY ALIEN screams back. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES holds up the tiny pocketknife blade. They both scream, then YOUNG ARTHUR DALES faints. The GRAY ALIEN looks down at YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' body, sets down the bat and sighs.)



SCENE 8

(Hotel room. The GRAY ALIEN has YOUNG ARTHUR DALES in a chair and is trying to revive him, gently slapping his face. )

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (waking briefly, then sees the GRAY ALIEN and faints again) Oh...

(The GRAY ALIEN sighs, and holds a glass of water to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES mouth. He wakes again.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (taking a sip) Thank you. (gags on the water when he looks up again)

GRAY ALIEN: (JOSH EXLEY's voice) This is ridiculous. You're supposed to be a big, bad policeman.

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES gasps in panic.)

GRAY ALIEN: Now, hold up, Arthur. Now, before you go fainting again, listen to me. It's me, Arthur. It's Ex.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: This is an interesting dream. Wake up. (slapping himself) Come on, Artie.

JOSH EXLEY AS GRAY ALIEN: Man, you ain't dreaming. This is what I really look like. This is the real me.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Ex? It's really you under there, Ex?

(In wonder, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES begins touching the alien face, poking around the lip and nose. JOSH EXLEY AS GRAY ALIEN puts up with it for a moment, then reaches over and sticks his finger up YOUNG ARTHUR DALES's nose.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Ow!

JOSH EXLEY AS GRAY ALIEN: I'm not "under" anything, Arthur and I'm trying not to be insulted by your reaction to my true face. Look, would it be easier if I looked like this?

(He morphs into a SEXY BLONDE WOMAN and climbs onto his lap.)

JOSH EXLEY AS SEXY BLONDE WOMAN: (still with JOSH EXLEY's voice) Would this be easier for you to handle?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Mmm... No. Somehow, that's even weirder.

(The door opens and another teammate enters.)

TEAMMATE: Bus leaves in five...

(Sees SEXY BLONDE WOMAN in YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' lap.)

TEAMMATE: Ooh.

(Later, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES is speaking very quietly to JOSH EXLEY on the bus.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: So why did you, uh, leave your family in, uh... in Georgia?

JOSH EXLEY: My people guard their privacy zealously.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I can understand that.

JOSH EXLEY: They don't like for us to intermingle with your people. Their philosophy is we stick to ourselves; you stick to yourselves-- everybody's happy.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: So what happened?

JOSH EXLEY: (smiles) Well, you know what happened.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: You fell in love with an earth woman.

(JOSH EXLEY laughs. Near the front of the bus, some team members are singing a spiritual.)

JOSH EXLEY: No. I saw a baseball game.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Oh.

JOSH EXLEY: See, there's something you got to understand about my race. We don't have a word for laughter. We don't laugh. I don't know if you noticed in between all that fainting you was doing but we have very tiny mouths, so no smiling even.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Wow.

JOSH EXLEY: I tell you, when I saw that baseball game being played this laughter just... it just rose up out of me. You know, the sound the ball makes when it hits the bat?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (smiling) Yeah.

JOSH EXLEY: It was like music to me. You know, the smell of the grass, 11 men-- first unnecessary thing I ever done in my life and I fell in love. I didn't know the unnecessary could feel so good. You know, the game was meaningless but it seemed to mean everything to me. It was useless, but perfect.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Yeah, like, uh... like a rose.

JOSH EXLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, like a rose. See? You can get it, Arthur. You're a fan.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Uh-huh.

JOSH EXLEY: Tell you, from that moment on I just couldn't fix myself to go home.

BUCK JOHNSON: Come on up here, Ex? Let's hear that beautiful voice you got on you.

(JOSH EXLEY goes toward the front of the bus and sings along with his teammates. Slow spiritual.)

TEAM: We'll all be together in that land We'll all be together in that land Where I'm bound oh, lord We'll all be together in that land We'll all be to...

(Exterior shot of the team bus passing by the camera fading into )



SCENE 9

(  bus on a black and white TV commercial for "Gray Bus Lines. You CAN go home again " Present day - ARTHUR DALES' apartment. Empty pizza box and Chinese takeout containers. MULDER and ARTHUR DALES are sitting on the couch. ARTHUR DALES is drinking a beer.)

MULDER: Let me get this straight: a free-spirited alien fell in love with baseball and ran away from the other non-fun-having aliens and made himself black, because that would prevent him from getting to the majors where his unspeakable secret might be discovered by an intrusive press and public and you're also implying that...

ARTHUR DALES: You certainly have a knack for turning chicken salad into chicken spit.

MULDER: You're also implying that this baseball-playing alien has something to do with the famous Roswell UFO crash of July '47, aren't you?

ARTHUR DALES: You're just dying to connect the dots aren't you, son? Look, I give you some wood and I ask you for a cabinet. You build me a cathedral. I don't want a cathedral. I like where I live. I just want a place to put my TV. Understand my drift?

MULDER: (after a pause) Drift it is, sir.

ARTHUR DALES: Trust the tale, Agent MacGyver not the teller. That which fascinates us is by definition true. Speaking metaphorically, of course.

MULDER: Okay, so was Ex a man who was metaphorically an alien or an alien who was metaphorically a man or a something in between that was literally an alien-human hybrid?

(ARTHUR DALES frowns, then hands MULDER a pint of liquor.)

MULDER: It's official. I am a horse's ass.

(They both take a drink.)

ARTHUR DALES: What is it to be a human, Fox? Is it to have the chemistry of a man? In the universal scheme of things a dog's chemistry is nearly identical to that of a man. But is a dog like a man?

MULDER: Well, I have noticed over the course of time, a man and his dog will often start to look like one another.

ARTHUR DALES: Of course not. To be a man is to have the heart of a man. Integrity, decency, sympathy: these are the things that make a man a man and Ex had them all had them all, more than you or I.

(The TV is on Channel Six. There is a weather warning on the bottom of the screen. Someone is opening the trunk of a car with New York plates. It is  the scene from Colony - season 2 - a man opens a trunk, looks at his own dead body lying inside and morphs into the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER. He looks in the trunk, then as the picture goes from black and white to color 



SCENE 10

( the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER turns to see the team's bus arrive behind him. The door opens and the team begins to get off. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES and JOSH EXLEY both look over to where the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER is watching them.)



SCENE 11

(Police station. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' phone rings.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on the phone) Dales. (listens to someone frantically talking) Ted?

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: (on phone) Arthur, what the heck?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) Calm down. What is it?

(TED the LAB TECHNICIAN is in his lab looking at the mitt. He has lots of brightly colored fluids bubbling away in typical lab fashion, I suppose.)

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: (on phone) This goo on the glove you gave me-- is this a joke?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) Why?

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: (on phone) It's not like any chemical compound I've ever seen. It's from a life-form which doesn't seem to be carbon-based which, by the way, is impossible. This is way out of my league. I called to the FBI and the communicable disease center in Washington...

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (on phone) Washington? Oh, no Ted, you didn't? Nobody was supposed to know about this. Can you... can you get the glove back to me?

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: (on phone) Sure, soon as I finish up here.

(TED the LAB TECHNICIAN hangs up. JOSH EXLEY enters the lab.)

JOSH EXLEY: I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Josh.

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: Oh, I know who you are. (shaking his hand) Only the best damn ball player west of the Bronx.

JOSH EXLEY: Oh, thank you, sir. Arthur sent me down here to explain this substance. That's my mitt it ruined.

TED THE LAB TECHNICIAN: Where is this stuff from? Where did you get it?

JOSH EXLEY: Mars. (TED laughs) Actually, just to the left of Mars.

(He is not kidding. TED looks nervous. JOSH EXLEY violently sweeps the lab equipment to the floor.)

LAB TECHNICIAN: What do you think you're doing?!

(JOSH EXLEY grabs TED the LAB TECHNICIAN by the throat, lifts him off the ground, then throws him through the glass windowed door and down on the broken glass. He is dead. JOSH EXLEY morphs. He is actually the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER.)



SCENE 12

(JOSH EXLEY is alone on the baseball field running back and forth between a ball and a pair of mitts. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES runs onto the field and stops about twenty feet from him.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Ex? Ex, there's this fella down at the precinct who's willing to swear on his life that you killed a man this afternoon. Now, I'm not sure what's... what's going on here but I... I do know that you're no murderer. You're going to have to get out of town, Ex.

(JOSH EXLEY picks up a mitt and the ball. He points at the other mitt. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES hesitates a moment, then picks it up and they start throwing the ball to each other.)

JOSH EXLEY: Life ain't like baseball, is it?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: No. No, it's not.

JOSH EXLEY: I had a talk with my relative. A good talk. He made me understand reason, Arthur. Family's more important than any game. So... I got to go home.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: You still consider them to be your family?

JOSH EXLEY: Of course I do. Who you think my family is?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I don't know. Your team?

JOSH EXLEY: Don't get cornball on me, man. Next thing you'll be telling me is I owe it to all the little kids to break the home-run record, or I owe it to the black folks who think I'm one of them, to make it to the majors or I should just keep playing out of some meaningless human concept of pride or loyalty.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I don't know, Ex.

JOSH EXLEY: We don't think like that, man. We may be able to look like y'all, but we ain't y'all. You know the big thing that separates us from you?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: What's that?

JOSH EXLEY: We got rhythm.

(They both laugh, then grow serious at the sound of a siren in the distance.)

JOSH EXLEY: Hey... I better go.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Yeah.

JOSH EXLEY: Hey... you do me a favor? Will you tell people what I did on the field? Will you tell your kids how I played the game?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: You know I will, Ex.

JOSH EXLEY: Hey, man, uh... one more thing.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: What?

JOSH EXLEY: You got a pretty good arm on you, boy.

(They laugh again, then JOSH EXLEY runs off as the siren gets closer.)



SCENE 13

(Later that night, OFFICER CORANADO and others are talking to YOUNG ARTHUR DALES in the deserted park.)

OFFICER CORANADO: You may think you know the man, Dales but believe me, you do not know the man.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: You don't know what I know and you don't know what I don't know.

OFFICER CORONADO: This is no minor-league, Mexico cowboy cop crap. If I told you what was really going on you'd just stare at me in wild-eyed wonder and pee your pants like a baby. Now, tell me what I want to know. Where's Exley?

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: I told you, he told me he was going home.

(CUT TO: Home plate. Same scene as the teaser. Nighttime ball game between the black team and the white team. JOSH EXLEY steps up to the plate.)

JOSH EXLEY: You sure your boy got the right prescription in those spectacles?

(JOSH EXLEY hits the home run.)

UMPIRE: Home run!

(CUT TO: Ballpark)

OFFICER CORANADO: I got a witness puts him at the murder scene. Now, I know they have a tendency to look alike but unless he's got a guy running around town looks identical to him he is a murderer, you could be an accomplice and the two of you fast sliding down a giant razor blade into a big old glass of lemonade.

(CUT TO: Game. Crowd is cheering and laughing. Then KKK RIDERS arrive.)

(CUT TO: Ballpark)

OFFICER CORANADO: But, you hand him over... you can wear your big hat and that pretty badge as long as you want.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Are we finished?

OFFICER CORANADO: No, Mr. Dales... You're finished.

(He and the others leave. YOUNG ARTHUR DALES picks up a mitt left on the bench and sees a piece of paper that was hidden under it. It is a map with a home plate drawn over "Bottomless Lakes State Park."

(CUT TO: Game field. Everyone is backing away from the GRAY ALIEN KKK RIDER lying on the ground.)

BLACK COACH: God!

(Both teams and all spectators run away. JOSH EXLEY stands and waits for the GRAY ALIEN to revive. The GRAY ALIEN morphs into the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER.)

(CUT TO: YOUNG ARTHUR DALES driving fast.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (impatiently) Come on.

(CUT TO: Game field. The ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER stands and pffts open the Plam - icepick, stiletto thing.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: It's over.

JOSH EXLEY: I know.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: I warned you. You didn't listen. Now you die.

JOSH EXLEY: It's the right thing to do.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: What do you know of the right thing to do? You-- who would risk exposing the entire project for a game? A game!

JOSH EXLEY: (smiling sadly) I hit a home run tonight.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: A home run?

JOSH EXLEY: Number 61. I set a record.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER: Show me your true face so you can die with dignity. As your executioner I show you my true face before I kill you.

(The ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER morphs into a GRAY ALIEN.)

(CUT TO: YOUNG ARTHUR DALES driving, almost there.)

(CUT TO: Game field.)

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER AS GRAY ALIEN: Show me your true face or you will die without honor.

JOSH EXLEY: This is my true face.

ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER AS GRAY ALIEN: So be it.

(As JOSH EXLEY turns and presents the back of his neck to the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER, YOUNG ARTHUR DALES drives up. The ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER stabs the Plam into JOSH EXLEY's neck.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: (yelling and getting out of the car) No! Stop!

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES runs to where JOSH EXLEY has fallen. The ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER is gone.)

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: Ex?!

JOSH EXLEY: No... Let me be!

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES sobs as he reaches JOSH EXLEY and holds him. The ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER gets on his horse and rides away.)

JOSH EXLEY: (desperate) Don't. Get off me. Our blood is like acid to you people. Arthur, get away. Don't touch it.

YOUNG ARTHUR DALES: It's just blood, Ex. Look. It's just blood.

(YOUNG ARTHUR DALES shows JOSH EXLEY his fingers which are covered in red blood.)

JOSH EXLEY: (amazed) Wow.

(JOSH EXLEY laughs, then weakens and dies in YOUNG ARTHUR DALES' arms. Spiritual from the bus begins playing. Overhead shot of YOUNG ARTHUR DALES gazing up into the night sky and)



SCENE 14

(  scene shifts into present day ARTHUR DALES' apartment. Overhead shot of MULDER and ARTHUR DALES sitting on the couch. ARTHUR DALES looks up at the camera, arms held to his chest. Spiritual keeps playing.)



SCENE 15

(Night. MULDER is at a baseball field hitting balls fired from a pitching machine. He is wearing a baseball jersey - Gibson, #20, the Grays. SCULLY walks around the fence and watches him.)

SCULLY: So, uh... I get this message marked "urgent" on my answering service from one Fox Mantle telling me to come down to the park for a very special very early or very late birthday present. And, Mulder... I don't see any nicely wrapped presents lying around so, what gives?

MULDER: You've never hit a baseball, have you, Scully?

SCULLY: No, I guess I have, uh... found more necessary things to do with my time than ... (a foul ball hits the fence)  slap a piece of horsehide with a stick.

MULDER: Get over here, Scully.

(MULDER holds the bat out for her. SCULLY walks over and takes it. MULDER steps behind her and wraps his arms around her tightly, also holding the bat around her hands.)

SCULLY: (warily, not thrilled) This my birthday present, Mulder? You shouldn't have.

MULDER: This ain't cheap. I'm paying that kid ten bucks an hour to shag balls.

(Camera shows POORBOY smiling and standing beside the batting machine.)

MULDER: Hey, it's not a bad piece of ash, huh?

(SCULLY gives him a "Look.")

MULDER: The bat-talking about the bat. Now, don't strangle it. You just want to shake hands with it. "Hello, Mr. Bat. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance." "Oh, no, no, Ms. Scully. The pleasure's all mine."

( SCULLY laughs as their hands grip the bat.)

MULDER: Okay, now, we want to... we want to go hips before hands, okay? (holds his hand a few inches from her hip) We want to stride forward and turn. That's all we're thinking about. So, we go hips... before hands, all right?

(He gingerly touches her hip and with his hands and his own hips pressed against her, turns her the right way.)

SCULLY: Okay.

MULDER: One more time.

(He touches and turns her hips more confidently.)

MULDER: Hips... before hands, all right?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Hips before hands.

MULDER: (speaking right into her ear) Right. We're going to wait on the pitch. We're going to keep our eye on the ball. Then, we're just going to make contact. We're not going to think. We're just going to let it fly, Scully, okay?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

MULDER: Ready?

(MULDER tries to readjust their grips on the bat. Momentary hand struggle between them.)

SCULLY: I'm in the middle.

(She gets her hands back between his. They are both grinning - very cute.)

MULDER: All right, fire away, Poorboy.

(A ball comes to them and they hit it. It goes way foul.)

MULDER: Ooh! That's good. All right, what you may find is you concentrate on hitting that little ball... The rest of the world just fades away-- all your everyday, nagging concerns.

( Scully giggles. They hit the ball again.)

MULDER: The ticking of your biological clock.

(Another hit.)

MULDER: How you probably couldn't afford that nice, new suede coat on a G-Woman's salary.

(Another hit.)

MULDER: How you threw away a promising career in medicine... (intimately into her ear)  to hunt aliens with a crackpot, albeit brilliant, partner.

(He gets another "Look.")

MULDER: Getting into the heart of a global conspiracy. Your obscenely overdue triple-X bill. Oh, I... I'm sorry, Scully. Those last two problems are mine, not yours.

(Another hit.)

SCULLY: (with a big smile) Shut up, Mulder. I'm playing baseball.

(They continue to hit the balls. SCULLY laughs. As the balls fly up into the black, star-studded night sky, we see them turn into shooting stars.)

[THE END]



                                THREE OF A KIND



SCENE 1

(Scenes from "Unusual Suspects (5X01)")

CHRIS CARTER: Previously, on the X-Files...

SUSANNE MODESKI: My name is Susanne Modeski ... I was an organic chemist for the Advanced Weapons Facility ... I need to expose the US government's plot against its own people.

(Modeski kisses Byers.)

MODESKI: Tell the truth. Reach as many people as you can with it, that's your weapon.

(Modeski is pulled into a non-descript car by two Men in Black and Mr. X.)

BYERS: Susanne!

(The car drives off.)

(Cut to black.)

(Fade in on a picturesque suburban home, as a white family car pulls up in front of it and Byers steps out.)

BYERS: (vo) My name is John Fitzgerald Byers. I was named after our 35th president, and I keep having this beautiful dream. In my dream, the events of November 22nd, 1963, never happened. In it, my namesake was never assassinated. Other things are different, too, in my dream. My country is hopeful and innocent; young again. Young in spirit. My fellow citizens trust their elect officials, never once having been betrayed by them. My government is truly "of the people, by the people, for the people." All my hopes for my country, for myself ...all are fulfilled. I have everything a person could want: home and family ...and love. Everything that counts for anything in life ... I have it. But the dream ends the same way every time. I lose it all.

(As the voice-over progresses, he picks up the mail as he pushes through the fence gate and starts up the walkway. At the door, he is met by two twin girls (House number 1057). He enters the house with his daughters, passing through the foyer, into the kitchen, and, leaving the girls in the house, out onto the back patio where he greets his golden retriever. He continues, passing from the patio to the backyard lawn, where he crosses the grass to find Susanne Modeski under a tree. Susanne runs to him, hugging him and giving him a kiss. Pan around them until we are behind Byers, our view cut off by his coat, and as we pan around in front of him again, we see him standing in a desert, holding a gold ring. Track out to see him alone in the landscape.)

SCENE 2
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

(Fade in on a portion of the Las Vegas Strip, as we pan across to see a large sign reading "DEF-CON '99," which then changes to "WELCOME DEFENSE CONTRACTORS.")

(Inside a casino, we pan across the game floor to the front door of a private suite.)

(Inside the private suite, we see a pair of hands deftly shuffling and bridging a deck of cards. Crane up to see the face of the man doing the shuffling.)

SHUFFLING MAN: The game is Texas Hold 'Em, gentlemen.

(Pan around the table to a Glasses Man on the Shuffling Man's left.)

GLASSES MAN: Bring your wife?

(Pan around to the Glasses Man's left to see the Bald Man.)

BALD MAN: You think I'm sitting here, I'd bring my wife? Dumb ass brought his wife.

(Pan around to the Bald Man's left to see the Bearded Man.)

BEARDED MAN: 'Cause I'm the man; I say I'm playing poker, I play poker. Meanwhile, your wife is back in Plaino, boinking the mailman.

(The Bearded Man turns to his left to face an undercover Byers in bone-rimmed glasses.)

BEARDED MAN: Hey, what's your name again?

BYERS: Funston. Stewart Funston.

BALD MAN: You bring a little lady, Stewart?

BYERS: Not married.

GLASSES MAN: Smart man, (tosses in a chip) hundred.

BYERS: You's guys come to this every year? Def-con?

GLASSES MAN: Every year. (looks at his cards) Ah, fold.

BALD MAN: Wouldn't miss it.

BEARDED MAN: Yeah. (throws down cards) Out!

BYERS: So, you guys, uh, working on anything interesting these days?

BALD MAN: Same old black ops crapola. You know what it's like.

GLASSES MAN: Hey, we're doing some neat stuff with neutron bombardment. Yeah, you can cook somebody's brain in their skull, like hard-boiling an egg.

(Byers mouths the word "wow." The Glasses Man looks at the Shuffling Man who does not look pleased.)

GLASSES MAN: (defensively) It's neat stuff.

BALD MAN: Speaking of crapola ... (throws in cards) ... fold.

(Cut to the Glasses Man as a waiter, who we recognize as Frohike, approaches with a napkin and drink for the Shuffling Man. The Shuffling Man hands him a black chip.)

SHUFFLING MAN: Thank you.

FROHIKE: Oh ... a man of distinction.

(Frohike glances at Byers and the Shuffling Man catches Byers as he drops his eyes back to his cards.)

SHUFFLING MAN: So you in, Mr. Funston?

BYERS: Yeah. (he throws some chips into the pot)

SHUFFLING MAN: Looks like it's just (throws in chips) you and me.

(Byers adds more chips to the pot)

BYERS: Another 200.

SHUFFLING MAN: I'll see your 200 ... (more chips in the pot) ... and raise you one ... (plops more chips in the pot) ... thousand.

BALD MAN: Huh whoa!

BEARDED MAN: He's buying the pot stew.

BALD MAN: Three clubs showing ... could be a flush.

BYERS: One thousand. (adds his chips to the pot) And I raise you ... (more chips) ... one thousand.

GLASSES MAN: The stones he has ...

(Frohike coughs in an exaggerated fashion, the Shuffling Man pays attention but doesn't look at him)

SHUFFLING MAN: (pointing at Byers' DEF-CON badge) I see you work for Conglomerate. You guys make a great AE-135 unit.

(Behind Byers' head, we track in tight on his right ear to see a tiny receiver unit.)

LANGLY: (oc) Oh man ... don't freak ... don't ...

(Cut to another room somewhere in the hotel, where Langly sits at a computer with a headset on. There are two monitors in front of him, one which he uses to search for the information and one showing a camera's view of the card game from behind Byers' hand.)

LANGLY: ...freak. I'm on it. AE-135...mmmm...bingo. 442 J-stroke, A-135 air conditioning units for B-2 bombers. Talk air conditioners.

(Cut back to the private suite, on Byers.)

BYERS: Oh yeah, the AE-135 is a beauty. Keeps the B-2's frosty, can practically see your breath.

SHUFFLING MAN: How'd you get all the bugs out of it?

BYERS: Ah, you know, trade secrets.

SHUFFLING MAN: Oh, come on, Stewart. You're among friends. Seriously, how'd you get past the delamination thing?

(Cut back to Langly's room.)

LANGLY: Delamination ... searching.

(Cut back to the private suite.)

SHUFFLING MAN: Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I'll see your thousand ... (drops chips into the pot) ... and raise you ... (sweeps his hand over Byers' pile of chips) ... all you've got.

(Cut back to Langly's room.)

LANGLY: Systems tests, error rates ... nothing. Stall 'em. And fold.

((NEONOTE: Langly's t-shirt of the episode; Snoozonica) Cut back to the private suite.)

BYERS: You wanna know how we fixed the delamination problem? We subcontracted the whole damn thing to the Japanese, then triple-billed the government. Same thing we always do. (the other men at the table laugh except the Shuffling Man. Byers pushes his stack of chips into the pile and drops his cards to the table) Queen-high flush.

SHUFFLING MAN: (smiles and drops his cards) King-high. (Frohike drops his tray) Al, call security. Have them pick up Mr. "Funston" here. (points at Frohike) And his partner.

BYERS: Delamination ... you made that up?

SHUFFLING MAN: My advice to you, Stewart, or whatever your name really is, poker is not your game.

(Byers and Frohike are escorted from the private suite. The gorilla-sized security guard pushes Byers and Frohike back out to the game floor. Frohike is now dressed in a white undershirt and suspenders as they've taken his casino jacket.)

FROHIKE: Hey man, you wanna thunderdome, let's go.



SCENE 3

(Back to Langly's room, Byers and Frohike return.)

LANGLY: Three thousand dollars ... I told you to fold. It should have been me in there playing, why does Byers get to do the undercover?

FROHIKE: (flicking Langly's hair) 'Cause this ain't Woodstock.

BYERS: Did we at least get some usable prints off the drink glasses?

FROHIKE: What, are you kidding? We had to leave them all behind. How we gonna salvage this?

LANGLY: We're not. This convention's a bust. Five days and three grand invested and we got bupkiss to show for it.

BYERS: Who was that player, anyway? The guy who made us, he wasn't wearing a convention badge.

LANGLY: Nobody ever said his name.

BYERS: I think he's worth looking into.

(Suddenly, there are three knocks on the door. All three of them look up in surprise, then at each other. Frohike moves to the door and flicks off the lights, checking through the peep hole. Outside, two gangly-looking men, Jimmy and Timmy, stand by the door. Jimmy is wearing a t-shirt that reads "Government Patsy.")

JIMMY: CIA, open up.

(Frohike opens the door.)

FROHIKE: Hey, hey, hey. Jimmy and Timmy.

JIMMY: Hey. Where were you guys today?

BYERS: Around.

TIMMY: Oh yeah? Maybe snooping for some hot 411?

JIMMY: On the sneak tip?

LANGLY: Maybe...

TIMMY: Yeah, well maybe we were too.

JIMMY: And maybe we got some.

FROHIKE: Well maybe we did too.

JIMMY: (fronting for a moment, then gives up) Ah, we got bupkiss. Buncha tight lipped defense contractors.

FROHIKE: Yeah, well I'm gonna go way out on a limb here and say, it's the t-shirt.

LANGLY: Yeah, maybe both of you could wear one that says "I'm with stupid."

JIMMY: You just don't get it, man. This says that I'm on to them. This says that I comprehend the military industrial power dynamic. That's what this whole thing is about; wetworks, political assassination. That's their theme for this year.

BYERS: Where did you hear that?

JIMMY: Oh yeah, like I'm gonna reveal my sources. Suffice it to say, there's some big new stealth assassination technology that's supposed to be unveiled here. And I will be there, front row.

(Frohike makes a face at Jimmy like kids do on the schoolyard)

TIMMY: In the meantime, we're hitting the restaurant.

JIMMY: Yeah, all you can eat lobster buffet.

TIMMY: Free floor show ... plenty of boobage. You guys down?

(Langly nods and starts to leave)

BYERS: You go ahead.

(Langly leaves with Timmy and Jimmy.)

FROHIKE: I'll catch up.

(Frohike closes the door (Room number 1044). He and Byers retreat into the hotel room.)

FROHIKE: You're one hell of a sad-sack, Byers.

(Byers sits down at the computer desk)

BYERS: Lay off about the poker game.

FROHIKE: No, that's not what I'm talking about. (he sits down on the bed facing Byers and starts putting on his cool fingerless gloves) You're the one who pushes the hardest for us to come to these conventions, then you get all squirrelly once we get here. You're still looking for her, aren't you? Susanne Modeski.

BYERS: We met her at a convention.

FROHIKE: Ten years ago. In Baltimore. Now we both know what happened to her. Most likely, she's dead.

BYERS: No. She was a brilliant scientist, too important to the government.

FROHIKE: Buddy, either way, I know we're both hoping she's in a better place than Las Vegas. C'mon. All you can eat lobster.

(Byers smiles.)



SCENE 4

(On the game floor, Byers and Frohike head to the restaurant.)

BYERS: I almost won.

FROHIKE: Yeah, you and everyone else. (Stops at a slot machine - modest jackpot for Vegas; only $29,153.43) Whoa, Byers, check this out. I'm feeling lucky.

(Frohike drops a coin and pulls the level, but as the rollers spin, Byers attention is quickly drawn away by something else. Across the floor, he sees Susanne Modeski. (When the first roller stops, it's a BAR, but when we see it again, it's a space instead. What gives?))

BYERS: It can't be.

FROHIKE: What?

(Byers starts across the floor, searching through row after row of slot machines. Just ahead of him, we see Susanne walking obliviously across the game floor. Byers notices her and gives chase, running into an older man and knocking him over, going down as well. The man's cup full of coins is scattered all over the floor.)

BYERS: I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

(When Byers looks up, Susanne is nowhere to be found. Frohike catches up.)

FROHIKE: Byers ... what the hell's going on?



SCENE 5

(Dana Scully's apartment. The cellphone ringing next to her bed wakes her up. She turns on the light and answers.)

SCULLY: Yeah, Scully.

MULDER'S VOICE: (oc) Hey, Scully, it's me.

SCULLY: Mulder, what time is it?

MULDER'S VOICE: (oc) 2:34AM. (beat) Listen, Scully, I need you on the next flight to Las Vegas.

SCULLY: Las Vegas? Why?

MULDER'S VOICE: (oc) It's the Lone Gunmen. They're onto something big.

SCULLY: What, exactly?

(Back in the Lone Gunmen's hotel room, we see a computer screen, which we quickly realize is synthesizing Mulder's voice. The computer is being operated by none other than Byers.)

MULDER'S VOICE: It's really important. Trust me.

SCULLY: Yeah, I trust you, Mulder, it's the Three Stooges I'm not so sure about.

(Langly and Frohike exchange a look)

MULDER'S VOICE: Look, I can't talk over an unsecured line. Please just get here. It's an emergency.

(Back to Scully as she sighs and gives in)

SCULLY: Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

(She hangs up, cut back to The Lone Gunmen)

LANGLY: What if she calls him back?

BYERS: I trapped her cell number. If she calls him, it rings here.

FROHIKE: (laughs) She's gonna kick our ass. What do you need Scully for, anyway?

BYERS: We're up against agents of the government. We need our own government agent.

LANGLY: And that would be Mulder. Why do you want just Scully?

FROHIKE: (laughs and shakes his head) She's gonna kick our ass.

BYERS: (getting agitated) Mulder's too high profile. He's virtually a household name to the black ops who kidnapped Susanne in Baltimore.

LANGLY: Byers, I've hacked into the hotel computers, Susanne Modeski's not registered here. Are you sure you saw her; are you absolutely, positively sure?

BYERS: It was her. She's here. I've got to find her!

FROHIKE: You've gotta find some ice, you need a drink.

(Cut to the inside of an ice machine as Byers opens it and fills up a small bucket. About to head back to his hotel room, he hears the elevator bell ding and then sees the Shuffling Man pass going down the hallway. Byers follows him to a room, where he knocks and is answered by Susanne Modeski. (Hotel room 1066) Byers watches from his hiding place around the corner of the hallway as The Shuffling Man kisses her, then enters the room. Susanne closes the door with the "Do Not Disturb" sign hung from the handle. Byers looks surprised and concerned.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 6

(From the bottom of the ice bucket, we see Byers drop his face into the cold water.)

LANGLY: (oc) Byers is trying to kill himself.

(Across the room, Langly and Frohike sit at a computer terminal.)

FROHIKE: Stop trying to kill yourself, Byers, it's not deep enough. Come see what we got. Room 1066, registered to our mystery poker player, one Grant Ellis. New Mexico plates on his car.

LANGLY: Which come back listed "DoD motor pool." Signed out from...

BYERS: (reads the screen) Whitestone, New Mexico. (License plate number 5J493-DL4)

FROHIKE: The advanced army weapons facility. Where Susanne worked.

LANGLY: Ellis's credit cards get billed directly to the Administrative Offices. He's looking like he's some kind of shadow government "poobah."

BYERS: He brainwashed her.

(Langly and Frohike exchanges looks.)

BYERS: Well that's what they do there! The AH gas she developed. Call it psychological warfare, behavior modification, but it's all about mind control. And undoubtedly, the process has been refined in the last decade. She ran from them, refused to take part in their tests, their crimes against the American people, there's no way she would choose to be working for them now, working for that guy ... (he spits out the words with disgust) ... kissing him. Clearly he brainwashed her.

(Frohike and Langly exchange another look.)

FROHIKE: I know a way to find out.



SCENE 7

(In the hallway, Frohike, wearing a one-piece overall with the word "Maintenance" on the back and carrying a duffle bag over his shoulder, makes his way to room 1066. He is cut off by a maid before approaching the door.)

FROHIKE: Buenos dias.

(Frohike drops back and watches as the maid opens door 1066. He lifts up his glove to check the time on his watch and winces.)

(Cut to the game floor, near the private suite. Byers walks by wearing glasses, his hand to his temple. He spots something and crouches by a vase of flowers to look. He sees the security guard from earlier, Al, checking people going into a conference room. He shakes his head, returns to the lobby where Langly is waiting and takes off the glasses.)

BYERS: I can't get into the conference. The guard who threw me out is working the door.

LANGLY: Let me go.

(Byers picks up a section of Langly's hair with his fingers. Suddenly, Jimmy and two other guys, a Red-Headed Guy and a Bald Guy, sneak up behind Byers, Jimmy grabbing his shoulder.)

JIMMY: CIA, freeze.

(The three crack up laughing, Jimmy high-fiving one of the other guys.)

LANGLY: That just keeps getting funnier. Where's your girlfriend, Timmy?

JIMMY: Ah, out in the desert. There's this naked chick who'll teach you how to shoot machine guns. It costs 200 beans though, I told him he was a putz. (notices Byers) What's the matter, Byers? Your bestest dog die? What's up?

LANGLY: Trying to figure out how to get into the Saguaro Room.

RED-HEADED GUY: Good luck. That's the Holy Grail. Bug sweeps...

BALD GUY: Casino security outside, government security inside. There's no way any of us are getting in.

JIMMY: I can get in there. And I will, too. When the time is right.

LANGLY: Doo-doo, kaa-kaa, poo-poo.

JIMMY: Oh, go brush your hair, Michael Bolton. (His two buddies laugh) There's a hole in their security, I've got it all figured out. But there's nothing worth hearing in there until tomorrow, when they unveil their new assassination technology.

LANGLY: Again with the assassination technology.

BYERS: I need to get in there, Jimmy. I need to know what's happening in there today. If you can really get in there, prove it.



SCENE 8

(Inside of a ventalation shaft, Jimmy crawls through the thin duct. He flips open the slats of one of the vent gates to see inside the room where Grant Ellis is giving a presentation and starts video recording the conference with a small digital camera. We can vaguely make out what Ellis is saying.)

ELLIS: .... in combat can be established. Now, if you'll take a look at the kill ratio productivity chart we've provided for you and turn to ... page 22 there ... you'll see that we've experienced a marked ...

(Jimmy zooms in one Susanne Modeski seated at the conference table.)

JIMMY: Oooh, there's your fascist chickie, Byers.

ELLIS: ... first and second quarterly periods of the previous year. But, before we're tempted to pat ourselves on the back for this we have to remember these figures ...

(Looking down into the room, Jimmy suddenly recognizes someone seated at one of the tables.)

JIMMY: Timmy? (zooms in) Damn...

ELLIS: .... the current operations in Bagdad. These operations, originally budgeted for fiscal year '97, were ... if you'll refer to page 26, I believe ...

(Suddenly, Jimmy leans on a soft spot and causes the metal to make a small thud. Timmy turns his head to look as Jimmy quickly slides back out of the vent. He kicks open the vent gate he first came through, only to be suddenly pulled out of the shaft by two Men in Black.)

JIMMY: Oh, woah, woah! Hey, hold on! Hold on!

(The Men in Black hold Jimmy up against the wall as Timmy enters from the shadows.)

JIMMY: You're one of them ...

(Timmy takes the digital camera and hands it to one of the Men in Black.)

TIMMY: You really screwed things up, Jimmy.

(Timmy quickly checks Jimmy for a weapon.)

TIMMY: We had big plans for you.

JIMMY: Big plans?

(Timmy points to the words "Government Patsy" on Jimmy's t-shirt. Jimmy finally gets it.)

JIMMY: Political assassination. I was right. I was right about the whole thing!

TIMMY: Every good plan needs a patsy.

(Timmy nods to one of the Men in Black, who holds Jimmy's head to the side. Timmy then gives him an injection behind the ear with a metallic instrument.)



SCENE 9

(Back in the casino lobby, Byers and Langly approach Scully, who has just arrived and is handing her bags over to a bellhop.)

SCULLY: Could you, uh, take this up, please?

BELLHOP: Sure.

(Bellhop leaves as Byers and Langly arrive.)

BYERS: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Where's Agent Mulder, I've been trying to call him.

LANGLY: He's, uh, I think that his phone's messed up.

BYERS: He may be hard to reach for the next few hours, he suggested we work with you, bring you up to speed.

SCULLY: By all means, bring me up to speed.

(Byers is about to explain when four people pass by walking quickly, a female manager, a security guard and two paramedics.)

WALKIE-TALKIE VOICE: (oc)

FEMALE MANAGER: (to her radio) Subject's name is James Bellmont, over. (to other guards) This way.

LANGLY: Oh, man. Jimmy.

(Outside, the three guards, along with Byers, Langly and Scully, run to a bus that has stopped.)

BUS DRIVER: He just jumped; no warning, no nothing. He just, dived right out in front of me.

(Camera pans down to a very dead and very bloody Jimmy under the wheel, his glasses pushed down and covering his mouth.)

LANGLY: Oh, God, it is Jimmy.

BUS DRIVER: It's not my fault. He was just standing there, and then he just dives under the bus.

BYERS: This wasn't a suicide.

SCULLY: You know this man?

(Byers leaves.)

SCULLY: What's going on here?

(Langly doesn't answer. Scully lets out a big sigh.)



SCENE 10

(Back inside the hotel, the maid is finally leaving room 1066. After she is out of sight, Frohike emerges from the doorway of the room down the hall where he's been waiting and opens the door with a keycard hacking unit. Cut to the view from inside the duffle bag as Frohike pulls out a screwdriver and then a small digital camera. Cut to inside the vent as he pulls off the grate and begins to put the camera inside. He stops and put his camera down on the floor as our view is pulled back to show Frohike's face illuminated on another camera's viewscreen. He grabs the camera and pulls out the tape. Suddenly he hears someone opening the door and he quickly replaces the camera and then the grate. Just as Susanne Modeski enters the room, he heads into the bathroom. She passes the bathroom door and changes into a bathrobe before heading for the bathroom. Just as she is about to enter, three knocks eminate from the door. She leaves the bathroom door for the front door, checking through the peep hole to see who it is. Outside in the hallway, Byers stands by as Susanne opens the door.)

BYERS: Susanne, do you remember me?

MODESKI: John, what are you doing here?

BYERS: I'm here to save you.

MODESKI: From what?

BYERS: I don't think you are yourself. I think that, uh, you've been mistreated and confused, and, and, I'm afraid that your, your beliefs, your opinions, are no longer your own.

MODESKI: As in, I've been brainwashed? I don't know what to tell you. I haven't been.

BYERS: Your life may be in danger, Susanne. A friend of mine has just been killed. Murdered.

MODESKI: What?

BYERS: And that man that you're with...

MODESKI: My fiance?

(Byers looks stunned.)

MODESKI: I'm sorry John, I, I think you better go.

(Susanne starts to close the door, but Byers stops her.)

BYERS: No, wait. Wait. Ten years ago, I saw you thrown into a car. Kidnapped right in front of me. Did that not happen? Did I just dream all of that?

MODESKI: It happened. But things got better.

(Susanne takes Byers' hand off the door and closes it. She locks the door, then heads into the bathroom. As she runs a bath, we see the vent gate in the ceiling close back into place as Frohike makes his escape.)

(Outside in the hall, Byers is leaving when a bag falls from the ceiling and hits him in the head. He looks up to see an open vent gate with Frohike's head poking out.)

FROHIKE: Oops. Sorry, buddy.

(Frohike drops from the vent gate, lands, and pulls the tape out of his pocket to show it to Byers.)

FROHIKE: That Susanne's a popular girl.



SCENE 11
CLARK COUNTY MORGUE

SCULLY: You're absolutely sure you wanna be here for this?

LANGLY: Oh yeah. I'm cool. Let's just find out what killed him.

SCULLY: Okay.

(As Scully uncovers the body, Langly looks horrified. Scully clicks on the microphone above her and begins the autopsy.)

SCULLY: James Bellmont, age 29. Visual exam reveals injuries consistent with massive trauma. Multiple rib fractures with concomgent haemorrhaging, both internal and external. His spine is fractured and partially exposed.

LANGLY: What if "they" did something to him? You know, to make him pancake himself?

SCULLY: Who's "they?"

LANGLY: You know, "them."

(Scully nods with a yeah-right attitude.)

SCULLY: I'll begin with the Y-incision.

(Scully pulls the surgical mask over her nose and mouth, puts on a pair of goggles and proceeds to make the cuts of the Y-incision. As she penetrates the flesh, Langly looks around uncomfortably. When the incision is finished, she peels back the first flap of skin, at which point Langly looks away. While the camera view doesn't show much, the blood and exposed ribs reflect clearly in Scully's goggles. Langly's glasses reflect the same scene but not clearly as he can't stop shaking. As Scully proceeds, Langly looks more and more ready to vomit.)

SCULLY: Langly, will you go over there and pass me the striker saw please, it's right there on the counter.

(Langly picks up the saw, but finally loses it, dropping the saw and rushing out through the double doors to throw up in the next room.)

SCULLY: Are you okay, Langly?

(Scully leans down to pick up the saw, but as she stands back up, she notices a small needle-puncture wound behind Jimmy's right ear. Just as she is about to stand up, though, Timmy grabs her from behind, his hand over her mouth, and gives her the same injection he gave Jimmy earlier.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 12

(Back in Clark County Morgue, Langly is still suffering from nauseous trauma. He continues to throw up in the sink with the water running. He hears a thud in the autopsy room as Scully drops to the floor after receiving Timmy's injection.)

LANGLY: Scully?

(Langly stumbles back into the autopsy room to find Scully unconscious on the floor. He hurries to her and revives her.)

LANGLY: Scully. Wake up. Are you okay?

(He supports her back as she gets into a seated position.)

SCULLY: What happened?

LANGLY: I'm thinking that you got a little queasy and took a header. You know blood and guts can bother some people.

(She removes her mask and speaks slowly.)

SCULLY: Yeah, I guess.

LANGLY: You gonna be alright?

(She turns to look at him.)

SCULLY: Sure, cutie.

(Langly looks confused. Scully struggles back to her feet, swaying slightly. She grabs some of the sheet covering Jimmy's body as she stands and quickly covers the body with it pulling off her gloves.)

LANGLY: So ... you're done with Jimmy?

SCULLY: Done, done, done. (tries to push table) How do you roll this thing?

LANGLY: Uhhhm, Scully? What killed him?

SCULLY: My medical opinion? BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP! (claps hands loudly)

LANGLY: And that's all you found?

SCULLY: That's all I know.

(Scully tries to push the table again, but loses her footing and slips, falling to the floor again.)

LANGLY: Scully?



SCENE 13

(Back in the Lone Gunmen's hotel room, Frohike inserts the tape he took from the camera in Susanne's room and plays it.

BYERS: What'd you find out?

LANGLY: Autopsy was negatory. Jimmy squished himself.

FROHIKE: And where is the scrumptious Agent Scully?

LANGLY: She said she had something important to do. Man, she is seriously jetlagged. (looks at tape) You got product already?

FROHIKE: No, an earlier bird got the worm. (starts tape)

MODESKI ON TAPE: ...it's like they're keeping tabs on us, watching us.

ELLIS ON TAPE: Honey, you worry too much. The plan is still on schedule. Everything's falling into place. We've worked so long and so hard for this.

(As Ellis begins kissing Modeski, Byers stops the tape.)

BYERS: It's not her. They're making her do this somehow.

FROHIKE: Buddy, now, I know something about the fairer sex. Trust me, you can bring a horse to water, but you can't make her drink.

BYERS: She would not marry that man.

MODESKI: You don't know him like I do.

(Byers, Langly and Frohike turn to see Modeski standing in their open doorway.)

LANGLY: How'd you get in here?

(Modeski holds up the keycard hacking unit that Frohike used to break into her room.)

MODESKI: One of you left this in my room.

(Langly takes the unit and hands it to an embarrassed Frohike.)

MODESKI: Grant Ellis saved my life. He's saved the lives of thousands.

FROHIKE: (laughs) Hah.

MODESKI: I need to talk to you, John, I need to try and explain everything.

LANGLY: (to Frohike) C'mon, let's hit the slots.

FROHIKE: (to Byers) Watch your back. (to Modeski) Mata Hari.

(Langly and Frohike leave.)

MODESKI: You said something about a friend being murdered.

BYERS: Not that I can prove it. But I think he saw something he was not supposed to see at your conference. You may be in danger.

MODESKI: I am. Always. So is Grant. (turns away) I've thought about this moment so many times. All the things I would say to you if I ever saw you again. And then there you were, at my door, and I ... (turns back to Byers) They took me ten years ago. They did things to me. And it was like drowning every day; under water, struggling to breathe, and one day, a hand broke the surface, reached down and pulled me up. I wanted it to be you, John. It was Grant. He worked for them on The Project. I didn't trust him, not for years. Not until I realized that he was working against them in his own way; stalling them, sabotaging their tests. He reminded me of you.

(Cut to the game floor, Langly and Frohike gambling away on the slots.)

FROHIKE: They're just lucky I got a conscience.

LANGLY: How's that?

FROHIKE: If I unleashed my true kung-fu on this casino, I could break the bank within a week.

LANGLY: And find yourself buried under six feet of desert dirt.

(Timmy walks up from behind them.)

TIMMY: Hey guys.

FROHIKE: Hey Timmy. I'm sorry about Jimmy.

TIMMY: Hey, Langly, the guys are all up in my room for a round of Dungeons and Dragons in honor of Jimmy.

LANGLY: (puts his hand on his heart) Lord Manhammer will be in attendance.

(Timmy smiles and leaves.)

LANGLY: (to Frohike) I'm gonna go play a little D&D, uh, in memorium.

FROHIKE: That's touching, man.

(Frohike turns back to his slot machine as Langly leaves, but soon his attention is caught by a familiar laugh. He crosses the floor to find Scully surrounded by a hoard of men.)

FROHIKE: Scully?

SCULLY: Aw, hey. Long time, no see.

(The man to Scully's right leans in and whispers something into her ear.)

SCULLY: No, that's not nice. I like Hickey.

(Scully rubs Frohike's head, messing up his hair. A moment later, a pack of cigarettes is held out by one Agent Morris Fletcher, whom we all remember from the Dreamland/Dreamland II fiasco.)

FLETCHER: Cigarette?

(Scully leans in and seductively removes a cigarette from the pack with her lips.)

FROHIKE: You don't smoke.

SCULLY: But who's got a match?

(In less than a second, a dozen lighters pop in front of her.)

SCULLY: Well ... I just can't decide who lights my fire.

FROHIKE: That's it. (grabs cigarette from Scully's mouth) Alright, you dandies, back off. This is Special Agent Dana Scully of the FBI. If you so much as touch her, you may be committing a federal offense. (to Scully) Come on, come on.

(As Frohike pulls Scully away, Fletcher says his goodbyes.)

FLETCHER: We could have been stardust.

SCULLY: Maybe next time.

(Scully gives Fletcher one good slap on the ass before Frohike finally pulls her away.)



SCENE 14

(Inside a hotel room, the door opens to reveal Langly and Timmy.)

LANGLY: Hope you brought your wallet, my friend, just because this is a memorial ... (enters room and sees two Men in Black) ... game. What's this?

TIMMY: Oh, we have got a game for you.

(Grabs Langly firmly on the shoulder.)

LANGLY: Man ...

(Back in the Lone Gunmen's room, Modeski and Byers are looking at the tape.)

ELLIS ON TAPE: Trust me, this is gonna work.

(Modeski stops the tape.)

MODESKI: You didn't tape this?

BYERS: No.

MODESKI: Which means they surveilled us. They know our plans, they know everything.

BYERS: What is your plan?

MODESKI: To escape. This conference was our chance to slip out on the last day. Go public with our files, all our weapons research. We could finally make it happen this time. We'd gathered up enough proof. The public is ready to believe now more than ever. They know everything. They'll kill us, John; Grant and me both.

(Just then, the door opens and Frohike enters with a stumbling Scully.)

SCULLY: (laughing) Hi.

FROHIKE: Settle down, settle down. (sits Scully down on the bed)

SCULLY: (laughing and grinning) Okay, okay, okay, okay.

FROHIKE: I found Agent Scully-go-lightly holding court ... (Scully grabs Frohike's ass) ... bar!

BYERS: I've never seen her drunk before ...

MODESKI: (checks Scully's eyes) God, this can't be.

(As Susanne checks Scully's hair and head for a needle puncture, Scully, grinning from ear-to-ear, pretends to tickle her.)

SCULLY: Hi ...

(Modeski finds the needle puncture just behind the right ear.)

MODESKI: She's not drunk, look at this.

(Frohike and Byers get a closer look at the needle-puncture.)

MODESKI: That was made by an injector gun.

FROHIKE: Well, what the hell was she injected with?!

(Scully shrugs her shoulders and holds her hands out palms up in an "I don't know" gesture, still laughing like a loon.)

MODESKI: It's derivative of AH gas. AH, anoitic histamine, my latest creation. (Scully makes a face quietly, pursing her lips in an "oooo") I could have developed it years ago, but I held off. I wasn't about to let those bastards I work for get their hands on it. (Scully makes what kids would call a frowny face) Grant thought that if we secretly developed a small batch, and then destroyed the notes, that we would have the proof we needed to go public. We'd also have a weapon we could use against them.

BYERS: Who else has access to this anoitic histamine?

MODESKI: Grant and I are the only two people that ha ... (realizes the implications) ... that have the samples.

(Scully shrugs her shoulders again.)



SCENE 15

(Still in the Lone Gunmen's hotel room, Modeski fills a syringe with some chemical. Langly enters, returning from his encounter with Timmy and the Men in Black.)

MODESKI: This will counteract the anoitic effect.

SCULLY: (to Langly) Hi, cutie. (Susanne injects Scully) Oow ... just a little prick ... (passes out)

LANGLY: Bad trip?

MODESKI: Nah, she'll be fine. She just needs to sleep it off.

FROHIKE: I don't understand; why would the government want to turn Scully into a bimbo?

MODESKI: That's just a potential side-effect. Anoitic histamine impedes higher brain functions. It promotes suggestability.

BYERS: Mind control. Brainwashing.

FROHIKE: That explains Jimmy. They told him to commit suicide.

BYERS: And Scully. They made her forget her autopsy findings. But what is their larger purpose? What are they planning?

FROHIKE: Well, whatever it is, we better find out fast.

(Zoom in to a tight shot of Langly's right ear, where we see the tell-tale needle puncture.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16

(We see a hotel room door open to reveal Langly. His hair at first appears to have been *gasp* cut off! But we can soon see a ponytail running down his back and under his shirt, whew!)

TIMMY: Right on time.

(They are now seated across from each other at a table. Timmy hands Langly a handgun.)

TIMMY: This is your weapon. All you do is pull the trigger. You will enter the Saguaro Room at 10:05AM. This badge (hands Langly a badge) will give you access. Take a seat toward the back, and wait. At 10:15, a break will be called. Rise, approach the target, and fire three shots.

(Later, inside the Saguaro Room, we see Langly enter and take his seat.)

SPEAKER: This brings us to the notion of acceptable risk. Of course, risk is defined as exposure, during both utilization and post-project evaluation. Now in a secure proving-ground, i.e. a domestic engagement, we have had great success. Now off-shore utilizations can afford a more comprehensive definition of acceptable risk. Proper target appraisal can provide a risk-free trial environment. A combination of political instability and lack of efficient infrastructure can offer a, uh, target area of nearly zero risk potential.

(Langly slowly scans the room and settles his gaze on Susanne Modeski and Grant Ellis seated at the speakers table. After smiling tightly at something Ellis says, Modeski checks her watch. The time is 10:13. She looks impatient. Outside the Saguaro Room, Scully approaches the door.)

SAGUARO ROOM GUARD: Authorized attendees only.

(Shows him her badge.)

SCULLY: I'm an FBI agent.

SAGUARO ROOM GUARD: Authorized attendees.

(She snaps her badge closed. Cut to inside the Saguaro Room as Langly checks his watch and then Ellis checks his own.)

SPEAKER: Of course, risk management goes hand-in-hand with operational preparedness, and that happens to be our topic for the remainder of the session...

ELLIS: Al, I think this would be a good time to take a break, shall we?

SPEAKER: Oh, yeah. Let's take five everybody. Smoke 'em if ya got 'em.

(As everyone rises to leave for their break, Langly stands and casually walks toward the front of the room. Modeski, at the front of the room shaking hands with attendees, appears to be unaware of the approaching threat. As the action moves into slow motion, Langly pulls the gun from his jacket and aims at Modeski, firing three rounds, each hitting her chest. The last one splatters blood on his glasses.)

ELLIS: Oh my God.

(Langly simply replaces the gun in his jacket and walks out.)

MAN: Somebody help her...somebody...!

ELLIS: Susanne...

(Scully passes the Saguaro Room Guard into the room, followed by him as she approaches Modeski.)

SCULLY: Federal agent. (to Saguaro Room Guard) Call for help.

SAGUARO ROOM GUARD: Winston Warbler, we need an ambulance, a woman's been shot.

(Inside the Lone Gunmen's hotel room, Frohike and Byers suit up in paramedic uniforms.)

SAGUARO ROOM GUARD: (oc) She's bleeding, hurry.

FROHIKE: We're on our way.

(Frohike and Byers rush out of the room.)

(Back in the Saguaro Room, Ellis is crouched over Modeski.)

ELLIS: Who did this? Who did this!?

SCULLY: Shooter got away. (to Saguaro Room Guard) Detain this man, get him outta here.

(Frohike and Byers arrive in their paramedic guises as Ellis is taken away.)

FROHIKE: (quietly to Scully) Good work, party girl.

(Scully looks confused for a second. Frohike and Byers load Modeski onto the stretcher and wheel her out of the room as Timmy emerges from the crowd. After Frohike and Byers have taken Modeski out, Timmy crouches over the blood stain on the floor, touching it and smelling it. He then tastes it, implying that it is not blood at all.)



SCENE 17

(An elevator door opens to show Scully, Ellis and the Saguaro Room Guard inside.)

SCULLY: (to Saguaro Room Guard) I'll take him from here.

ELLIS: Wait a minute, where ... where ... where're you taking me?

(Inside Modeski and Ellis's hotel room, Byers unlocks and opens the door to find Scully and Ellis. Ellis enters the room and is shocked to find Modeski alive, still covered with three distinct bullet wounds.)

ELLIS: Susanne?

MODESKI: Can we have a moment, alone, please? I'll be fine.

(Scully, Byers and Frohike start out of the room.)

BYERS: We'll be right down the hall.

MODESKI: Okay.

(As Frohike passes Ellis, he holds up the black chip he gave him.)

FROHIKE: Thanks for the tip.

(Scully, Byers and Frohike leave the room.)

MODESKI: Big surprise, huh? Since you programmed my friend to kill me.

ELLIS: No, Susanne, it wasn't my idea.

MODESKI: You knew about it. You gave it to them. The AH. If I hadn't thought to check Langly, if I hadn't given him the antidote ... (opens shirt to reveal blood pouches) ... I don't understand. Why save me? Why save my life just to take it away?

ELLIS: You know why.

MODESKI: You were done with me. You had what you wanted.

ELLIS: "They" had what they wanted. The project was over. Honest to God, it wasn't my idea.

MODESKI: All those years you spent gaining my trust. You pretended that you loved me. What could they possibly give you for that? (she begins to yell and cry) What was it worth to you, Grant? What was your price? What did you get!

ELLIS: Life. They'd kill me.

(Suddenly, the door opens and closes, as Timmy enters the room.)

TIMMY: Hello. (points gun at Modeski)

ELLIS: I'm so sorry, Susanne.

(Timmy turns the gun on Ellis, firing two shots, killing him. He then turns the gun back on Modeski.)

(Inside the Lone Gunmen's hotel room, Langly sits at a desk with two computers, searching through files with Frohike and Byers standing on either side of him.)

BYERS: County death records first, then the state tax rolls, come on! Then the Clark County Morgue list that they misplaced the body.

LANGLY: Yeah, Voltaire comidant. Why don't you just zap me with the girly sting there and brainwash me again.

FROHIKE: (hands Byers injector gun) I say do it, then we can make him cut his hair.

(Suddenly, they are interrupted by a knocking at the door.)

BYERS: Can you answer that?

FROHIKE: Why me, she's your little chickadee.

(Frohike crosses the room to the door.)

BYERS: Hurry up, come on.

(Frohike unlocks the door and opens it to find just Modeski.)

FROHIKE: Come on in, Mata Hari.

(From behind the wall, Timmy appears with a gun, pushing Modeski into the room.)

TIMMY: CIA, freeze.

BYERS: Let her go.

TIMMY: Sure ... (cocks gun, points it into Modeski's back)

BYERS: No...

(Byers rushes Timmy, but Timmy pistol whips him, knocking him to the floor. Timmy then turns the gun on Frohike.)

TIMMY: You know the best thing about killing you three ... I won't have to dress like you anymore...

(Timmy is cut off as Byers uses the injector gun on his ankle, shooting him up with anoitic histamine. Timmy loses his balance and falls on Byers.)

BYERS: Oh, get him off me.

(Frohike and Langly hurry to get Timmy off of Byers.)

TIMMY: (delirious, to Langly) Hi, cutie ...

FROHIKE: (to Byers as he helps him up) What do ya wanna do with him?

(Byers just smiles. Cut to a television newscast, later that night in Scully's hotel room.)

REPORTER: Police confirm an arrest has been made, this man (picture of Timmy) Timothy Landau of Aldonaberta, New Mexico, has confessed to the murders of Grant Ellis and Susanne Modeski. Both victims were government employees attending a conference in Las Vegas.

SCULLY: (on her cellphone, shouting) Hello, Mulder? Can you hear me? I'm at the hotel. Where are you? What do you mean, "what hotel," Las Vegas. I'm in Las Vegas, aren't you? You called me. What do you mean you didn't call me? Oh man, I am gonna kick their asses.

(Outside the casino, Frohike and Langly are loading luggage into the trunk of a cab as byers talks with Modeski. (Cab number 4613).)

BYERS: Susanne Modeski is dead. Every computer in every county, state, federal office knows it. (hands her slip of paper) This is who you are now.

MODESKI: Come with me.

BYERS: (struggling with the choice) You'll be safer without me.

MODESKI: It doesn't make a difference. I told you, I'm going public.

BYERS: No, you're not. You've done more than enough. Leave it to us now, it's what we do.

(Modeski opens Byers' hand and places a small object in it, closing it again.)

MODESKI: It was meant for Grant. I want you to have it.

(In "Unusual Suspects" fashion, Modeski gives Byers a kiss.)

MODESKI: Someday.

(Modeski gets in the cab and closes the door as Byers opens his hand to see his gift. He holds it in the light to show us a gold ring. (The scene now echos the opening dream, Byers "alone" in the desert with the wedding ring.) The cab drives off, taking Modeski with it. The trio stands by for a moment.)

FROHIKE: So you wanna hit the slots?

(They turn and start to walk towards the casino.)

LANGLY: You know, Byers, growing old with us ain't so bad.

FROHIKE: Oh, shut up, Langly. You really want him to kill himself?

LANGLY: Got any quarters?

[THE END]




                                      FIELD TRIP



SCENE 1

(A mountain cabin. A young couple, WALLACE and ANGELA SCHIFF, enter and take off their boots. ANGELA is short, has medium length slightly curly red hair. She looks exhausted as she kicks off her hiking boots. WALLACE is tall, dark-haired.)

ANGELA: Ohh! I've got mosquito bites. I've got blisters. I hate those new boots.

WALLACE: Honey. Why are you so P.O.'d? I thought we had a good time.

ANGELA: You had a good time. You had a fine time tromping around and leaving me a half a mile behind. Look, for future reference, me running through the woods after you for an entire day is not my idea of a good time.

WALLACE: I'm sorry. I've got longer legs. I was excited, you know? The great outdoors, communing with nature.

(ANGELA rubs her temples.)

WALLACE: Your head hurt?

ANGELA: Yeah.

WALLACE: (little boy) You can hit me in the head with a rock if it'll make you feel better.

ANGELA: (smiling) Fine. Go get one. I'm taking a shower.

(They kiss, then ANGELA goes and gets into the shower. She pours some yellow shampoo from a travel size container and washes her hair [no lather?], then rinses it, obviously enjoying the feel of the water. She rubs her temples again as another headache comes over her, then she has a quick image of yellow slime running down the shower wall but then the slime is gone - only water from the shower. Then, she has sudden flash of herself underground, screaming, covered in yellow goo. Later, dressed in a white bathrobe, she is sitting on the edge of the bed. The headache seems to be worse. WALLACE, in T-shirt and boxers gets onto the bed beside her.)

WALLACE: You still mad at me?

ANGELA: No. I'm not mad.

WALLACE: Come here. (They lie facing each other on the bed, hands resting on each other's sides - very intimate.) So I guess we're never going hiking again. It's indoors forever from now on. Angie, honey, what's up?

ANGELA: Just hold me.

(The image of them lying there on the bed is slowly replaced by the image of two skeletons lying in the same position, only on a grassy field.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(X-Files office. Slide projector is flicked on, but the image of the two embracing skeletons in the field is projected onto a map of South Carolina. Hmmm. MULDER get his Carolinas mixed up? MULDER adjusts it so the image is against the blank wall.)

MULDER: Oh. Ugh. I don't know what they did with the screen for this thing. Now, this is Angela and Wallace Schiff. It's a young married couple last seen hiking in the vicinity of Brown Mountain, North Carolina. That's Angie on the right. I should add that this is the condition in which their bodies were found after being missing for only three days... in temperatures that never got above 70 degrees.

SCULLY: Which rules out decomposition. I'd say predation, but the... the bones would be scattered.

MULDER: (suggestively) Not to mention that these skeletons are not wearing any clothes.

SCULLY: (not to be baited) Right. Well, I'd say it looks like a double murder, possibly one with ritualistic overtones. The bodies may have been stripped then skeletonized, possibly by boiling or by the use of some kind of acid solution. Maybe the arrangement of the bodies has some meaning for the killer or killers. But at any rate, I'd term it "ritualistic."

MULDER: That's a pretty big operation you're describing. There was no evidence found at the scene-- no tire tracks, no footprints, nothing.

SCULLY: Well, what do you think this is?

MULDER: It's Brown Mountain, Scully. That doesn't ring a bell? (SCULLY shakes her head.) The Brown Mountain lights? It's a famous atmospheric phenomenon dating back nearly 700 years witnessed by thousands of people-- back to the Cherokee Indians. Strange multicolored lights are seen to dance above the peak of the mountain. There's been no geological explanation, no scientific credible explanation at all.

SCULLY: And what does that have to do with these two?

MULDER: (modestly) As I said, there's been no scientific credible explanation but there are those of us who believe these strange multicolored lights are really...

SCULLY: UFOs. Extraterrestrial visitors from beyond who apparently have nothing better to do than buzz one mountain over and over again for 700 years.

MULDER: (hurt) Sounds like crap when you say it. I'm just wondering if there's a connection, Scully. I mean, the conditions of these bodies are reminiscent of certain southwestern cattle mutilations. Those are cases where there's no physical evidence and they've long been associated with UFO activity.

SCULLY: Mulder, can't you just for once, just... for the novelty of it come up with the simplest explanation, the most logical one, instead of automatically jumping to UFOs or Bigfoot or...?

MULDER: Scully, in six years, how... how often have I been wrong? (SCULLY scoffs.) No, seriously. I mean, every time I bring you a case we go through this perfunctory dance. You tell me I'm not being scientifically rigorous and that I'm off my nut, and then in the end who turns out to be right like 98.9% of the time? I just think I've... earned the benefit of the doubt here.

(They look at each other, then MULDER crosses past her. SCULLY is speechless.)



SCENE 3
BOONE COUNTY MORGUE
ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

(The CORONER, 50ish man, opens two drawers in the morgue, each containing one of the skeletons.)

CORONER: We gave them adjoining suites. I was ready to send them on to Chapel Hill. Figured the state medical examiner should have a look at them.

MULDER: We appreciate you holding off.

SCULLY: The connective tissue is more or less intact.

CORONER: Unlike everything else. I'm not sure what to make of it considering the short time frame.

SCULLY: If you'll, um, pardon an obvious question are you sure that these are the right two bodies and not two others that have lain out for six months?

(The CORONER gets the dental records and shows them to SCULLY.)

CORONER: We triple-checked the dental records. Angela and Wallace Schiff-- no doubt about it.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at the photos of ANGELA and WALLACE SHIFF.)

MULDER: Hmm. And they were both found near Brown Mountain, right? Where exactly?

CORONER: Well, I could write you some directions.

(While the CORONER writes down the directions for MULDER, SCULLY finds a blob of yellow goo on one of the skeletons.)

SCULLY: Would you, uh, happen to know what this is?

CORONER: Well, the remains were found in a swampy area. It's some sort of organic material relating to that. It's bog sludge.

MULDER: I'm going to check out where the bodies were found. (Heads for the door, then realizes SCULLY is not following.) You coming?

SCULLY: (looking at the skeleton) No. You go ahead.

(MULDER sighs and leaves.)

(CUT TO: Later, MULDER drives the rented SUV up to a wilderness area that is definitely NOT the mountains of North Carolina! A gray squirrel runs away from a group of mushrooms. As he parks, the tires crush the mushrooms and they release a cloud of spores which MULDER walks through. MULDER looks around. He sees fresh overturned dirt. He kneels down and finds more of the same yellow goo that SCULLY found on the skeletons. He looks up and sees an outcropping of rocks nearby, then sees WALLACE SCHIFF ducking behind them.)

MULDER: Wallace Schiff?

(MULDER chases WALLACE. He sees him crawl into a small cave opening and follows. He shines his light into the cave opening.)

MULDER: Wallace Schiff?

(CUT TO: Back in the morgue, the CORONER brings SCULLY a file.)

CORONER: We got your gas spectrometer results. That stuff on the bones I said was bog sludge? It isn't.

SCULLY: (reading)Water, hydrochloric acid... Electrolytes, pepsins and trypsins. It's a digestive secretion.

CORONER: It's stomach juices pretty much-- Pretty damn close to it... Except for this.

SCULLY: Chitinase?

CORONER: It's a digestive enzyme as well but it's strictly plant, not animal.

(CUT TO: In the cave, MULDER has entered and is looking around. Strange green light. Lots of organic tendrils. Cave seems larger than it should be.)

MULDER: Hello!

(CUT TO: Back in the morgue, the CORONER and SCULLY are looking at old files with pictures of skeletons.)

CORONER: I told you, I'd seen this before. These are the two I remember anyway.

SCULLY: Both of these were discovered as skeletal remains.

CORONER: Right, but we saw nothing odd in that. Both were lost hikers found months or years later or whatever it says there.

(REPORT SAYS: "Victim found 2 miles southeast  Brown Mountain exit - Highway 5 ")

SCULLY: It says here that the bodies were found not far from where Angela and Wallace Schiff turned up.

(SCULLY pulls out her phone and dials.)

SCULLY: Oh, Mulder, answer your phone.

RECORDING: The cellular customer you are trying...

(She hangs up.)

SCULLY: Do me a favor. I want you to forward a sample of that secretion over to the FBI lab at Quantico. I want them to run a complete analysis.

CORONER: You got it.

SCULLY: And, uh, in the meantime, could I borrow your truck?

(CUT TO: In the cave, MULDER shines his flashlight around. He sees lots of slime, then finds a terrified WALLACE, hiding.)

WALLACE: Please... don't take me.

MULDER: Then, come out here. Step closer. I won't hurt you.

WALLACE: You're not one of them?

MULDER: One of who? Are you Wallace Schiff? Well, I hate to tell you this, Wallace, but you're supposed to be dead. They found your skeleton not 200 yards from here.

WALLACE: It's fake. They put it there.

MULDER: Who put it there?

WALLACE: You know who.

MULDER: The Brown Mountain lights.

WALLACE: They abducted us... me and my wife Angela. They took us on board their... oh, God.

MULDER: Wallace... Wallace? They found your wife Angela, too... lying right alongside your skeleton.

WALLACE: (on the edge of hysteria) No. Don't you get it? They-they faked our deaths! They have that kind of technology. Who the hell would look for us if they thought they'd already found our bodies? You see? They returned me, but Angela, she's still up there... being experimented on and I-I-I-I can't... I don't know what to... what do I do?!

(MULDER has no answer.)

(CUT TO: Outside the cave, SCULLY pulls up next to MULDER's vehicle and parks the CORONER's Dodge truck, Boone County, license # PX 2469. She gets out and begins walking to the cave.)

SCULLY: Mulder?!

(SCULLY sees one set of men's boot prints leading to the cave. She steps on another patch of the mushrooms releasing the spores. She glances down, but continues on.)

(CUT TO: In the cave, MULDER is still talking to WALLACE.)

MULDER: First things first-- we got to find a way out of here.

WALLACE: Right behind you.

(MULDER turns and sees that one of the previously solid walls now has a long tunnel back into the hillside.)

MULDER: What the hell's going on? That was solid rock a minute ago. Now there's nothing there.

WALLACE: Oh, God. It's them. They're affecting your head... maybe mine, too. What if I can't even tell what's real?

MULDER: Wallace, let's get out of here. Come on, Wallace.

WALLACE: They're out there, man.

(Outside the cave a loud rumbling is heard.)

WALLACE: It's them!

(The rumbling continues and a bright white light shines through the mouth of the cave. WALLACE runs deeper into the cave.)

MULDER: (whisper) Wallace!

(MULDER runs after WALLACE. The white light fades into SCULLY's small flashlight as she shines it into the cave.)

SCULLY: Mulder?! Mulder!

(She sees and hears nothing. She stands, looks at the footprints again, and walks back to the truck.)



SCENE 4

(In the cave, the deep engine rumbling and bright light continues. MULDER and WALLACE are hiding.)

WALLACE: Don't let them see you!

(The sound of the rumbling stops and the light is gone.)

MULDER: They're gone.

WALLACE: (holding a strange camping light) Yeah, for now. Thank God, they didn't find us.

MULDER: They should have. Maybe they came for something else.

WALLACE: Oh, my God! Oh, my God... Angie!

(ANGELA is lying on the floor of the cave, moaning. WALLACE embraces her.)

WALLACE: They brought her back.

(While MULDER talks to ANGELA, WALLACE fills a cup with water seeping out of the wall, but we see it dripping out as yellow goo.)

MULDER: Angie, can you talk to me? Do you remember what happened? Can you tell me?

ANGELA: It's all fuzzy and...

MULDER: You were with your husband. With Wallace.

ANGELA: There was a light. A bright light.

MULDER: Where was that light coming from? From the mountain?

ANGELA: (crying) Over Brown Mountain. There were strange lights dancing over the peak and... and they took me. And Wallace, too.

MULDER: And then what happened?

ANGELA: Oh, just... it all went black. And when I woke up, I didn't know where I was and I couldn't see Wallace anymore.

WALLACE: They returned me first.

(He gives her the cup of "water" and she drinks.)

MULDER: This... this place that they took you to can you describe it to me tell me what it looked like?

ANGELA: It was white. A white place. It was featureless. I was lying on a table and I couldn't get up. I mean, nothing was holding me down but I couldn't move.

MULDER: Were there men there?

ANGELA: Yes, there were men standing over me but I couldn't see their faces.

MULDER: Did they perform tests on you?

ANGELA: (crying) Yes. They did tests. Terrible... tests. What?

(MULDER pushes the hair back from the nape of her neck and sees a fresh scar.)

MULDER: You have a, uh... you have a scar back here on the back of your neck.

WALLACE: What? What scar?

MULDER: It's fresh.

WALLACE: What is that?

MULDER: It's an implant. I've seen this before.

ANGELA: (remembering, very upset) Yes. The drill-- I remember the drill. I couldn't see it at first. That was the worst part. But I could hear it spinning and it was coming out of the light... oh, what did they put in me?

WALLACE: Is there one in me?

MULDER: No, male abductees don't usually report this. And everything she says so far is textbook down to the last detail, except for one.

WALLACE: What?

MULDER: Two skeletons we found were identified as yours and Angie's? I don't understand that. It doesn't make sense to me.

WALLACE: Maybe they're like the cattle mutilations you hear about. Maybe they're somehow related. Maybe they're part of their tests.

MULDER: I had that thought but there's no precedent for it. It's in none of the literature.

WALLACE: Well, they didn't want anybody to find us. I guess they didn't want you to know the truth.

(MULDER looks up at WALLACE.)

MULDER: We got to get out of here right now.

WALLACE: Oh, no way.

ANGELA: They're out there. They're always watching.

WALLACE: If they find us, if we leave, they'll take us again.

MULDER: We're leaving now. Gather your things. Angie, I'll help you up.

ANGELA: They're coming. I can feel it.

(MULDER helps ANGELA up, then they hear the deep rumbling again. The light once again shines in the mouth of the tunnel. ANGELA panics and runs back into the tunnel.)

ANGELA: They're here!

WALLACE: Hide! They'll take you, too! We've got to hide!

MULDER: No!

WALLACE: No!

(WALLACE follows ANGELA. MULDER walks toward the glowing mouth of the cave. The light gets brighter and brighter, then forms into the number "42" which we then see is on MULDER's apartment door. We are now in )



SCENE 5

( MULDER's apartment building. SCULLY gets off the elevator and knocks at MULDER's door. He opens it cautiously.)

MULDER: Scully...

SCULLY: Mulder. Why the hell did you leave North Carolina without telling me?

MULDER: Long story.

SCULLY: You disappear and then I get a furtive call that you're back here in D.C.?

MULDER: I'm sorry. Does anybody know you're here?

SCULLY: No.

(MULDER opens the door wider and SCULLY steps in under his arm. He closes the door. WALLACE and ANGELA SCHIFF are sitting on the couch.)

MULDER: Scully, this is...

SCULLY: Angela... and Wallace Schiff. But, Mulder, it can't be.

MULDER: This is my partner, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, I I.D.'d their remains myself.

MULDER: Yeah, I think you were meant to.

ANGELA: Agent Scully, the aliens planted decoys so you would think we were dead.

SCULLY: The aliens?

(MULDER leads SCULLY to a chair, then kneels down in front of her.)

MULDER: Scully, I want you to... put aside your scientific bias for a moment. 'Cause what I'm about to tell you is going to change your life forever. Your life, my life the life of everybody on this planet.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: (proudly and in awe) I was out there... and I found it.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: The truth. This couple... they were abducted by a UFO-- the Brown Mountain lights.

ANGELA: They took me to a white place. There were men there. They put an implant in my neck.

MULDER: (to SCULLY very softly) Just like what happened to you.

SCULLY: Mulder, from what very little I understand about this case, this is not what happened to me.

MULDER: There's more.

(MULDER leads SCULLY into the dim bedroom. He leaves the light off and puts his arm around SCULLY's shoulder and gently guides her forward.)

MULDER: It doesn't like the light.

SCULLY: Who?

(A small GRAY ALIEN reaches around a bedpost and looks at MULDER and SCULLY. SCULLY is amazed.)

MULDER: (smiling) I abducted him. It's a gray. It speaks to me. We communicate telepathically. He told me everything.

SCULLY: I... I can hear him.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: (in rapture) Oh, my god.

(Later, SCULLY closes the bedroom door as they go back into the living room.)

SCULLY: I, uh... I don't know what to say, Mulder. Where to begin. I mean, you... you were right. All these years, you were right.

MULDER: (pleased) You think so?

SCULLY: You were right about the grays, about... about the abductions, about the UFOs... the lights, the Brown Mountain lights...

MULDER: What about the skeletons?

SCULLY: They were... they were fake. They were decoys.

MULDER: (thoughtful) You're buying that decoy theory? What about that organic substance we found on the skeletons? That goo you were so interested in?

SCULLY: It was nothing. It was bog sludge.

(MULDER puts his hand to his temple as his head begins to ache.)

MULDER: That, uh... doesn't sound like you, Scully. It, uh... God, I can't believe you're buying this.

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm admitting that I was wrong.

(MULDER is rubbing his temples.)

SCULLY: Are... are you all right?

(MULDER goes into the kitchen and rinses his face. He sees the water coming out of the faucet turn into a viscous yellow slime, then back to water. He shuts off the water, dries his face with a paper towel and goes back to the living room.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling?

MULDER: Uh, this doesn't make any sense.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: These two. Their story. Their skeletons. None of it.

(MULDER groans as he rubs his aching head again.)

SCULLY: Mulder, if I, of all people, can believe this then why can't you?

(As SCULLY speaks, MULDER sees a wash of yellow pass over her, then fade. He looks over at WALLACE and ANGELA and sees them dissolve into yellow goo. He looks around at his apartment. All the furniture is distorted. He looks back to SCULLY who is looking at him with concern. He sees her dissolve into yellow goo.

CUT TO: MULDER standing underground just as ANGELA was in the teaser. Yellow goo and plant tendrils are all over him. He is almost immobile, trance-like, a look of confusion on his face.)



SCENE 6

(Outside the cave, SCULLY and the CORONER are looking around.)

CORONER: Did you go inside the cave?

SCULLY: Yeah. I looked. It's empty. It's as if he just vanished.

CORONER: He's got to be around. We'll catch up to him. I know this area pretty well.

SCULLY: Doctor... It's more of that digestive material. (uses a latex glove to pick up more yellow goo from some overturned dirt) Looks like it's coming up from out of the ground.

(The CORONER sees that the men's boot tracks in the mud now go in both directions.)

CORONER: Agent Scully? I got tracks going in and out.

SCULLY: They were only going in before.

CORONER: Oh, I guess you missed him.

SCULLY: How? I mean, this, this cave's not much more than a hole in the rock.

CORONER: Agent Scully?

(SCULLY comes over to him. There is a skeleton sprawled out on the grass near the opening to the cave. SCULLY stares at it, shocked.)

(Later in the morgue. SCULLY is staring at the skeleton on the gurney. The CORONER enters with a packet.)

CORONER: The courier just arrived. They brought your partner's charts.

(SCULLY quickly opens the folder and removes MULDER's dental X-ray. She puts it on the wall and compares it with the X-ray of the skeleton. They match. Both have a crown on one of the back upper molars.)

CORONER: I'm sorry. I know it's difficult.

(SCULLY turns back to the skeleton trying to control her emotion. Beautifully.)

SCULLY: (voice breaking slightly) That, um... that digestive secretion that we keep finding-- could it, could it have done this to him?

CORONER: I'm not sure I follow.

SCULLY: (struggling, not quite crying) Well, it's... it's chemically similar to gastric juices, right? I mean, maybe he fell in it or... may... maybe it's a product of a... of a particular vegetation that grows in the area.

CORONER: That... all sounds plausible, I guess except for one thing. There's no sign of it on these remains.

(SCULLY looks back at MULDER's skeleton, then uses a cloth and wipes the one of the arm bones. Nothing comes off.)

SCULLY: It was... it was on the Schiffs.

CORONER: I just think we need to look for the simplest explanation. The most logical.

SCULLY: What is the most logical explanation?

CORONER: I'd say we're looking at a murder-- one with ritualistic overtones. I think his body was stripped and then skeletonized. Possibly by boiling or use of an acid solution. Don't worry, Agent. We'll take care of the arrangements.

SCULLY: (confused) What arrangement?

CORONER: We'll have the remains sent on to Washington.

(SCULLY stares at him.)



SCENE 7

(SKINNER's office. SKINNER is reading SCULLY's report.)

SKINNER: I appreciate the thoroughness of your report. (sighs) Especially given the circumstances. It might be best if you took some time off-- a short leave. (SCULLY does not respond.) Agent?

SCULLY: Sir? You're satisfied with my conclusions in this case?

SKINNER: Absolutely. I take it you're not.

SCULLY: Well... I was unable to determine a clear cause of death nor was I able to fully account for the condition of Agent Mulder's body.

SKINNER: You concluded he was a victim of a ritual killing.

SCULLY: (confused) No. I mean that was one possible scenario that I mentioned, but... in my mind it, it, it was the least plausible.

SKINNER: Not only is it plausible, it's, it's, uh... it's likely. Why are you questioning your own findings?

SCULLY: My role in the X-Files has always been to provide a... a rational scientific perspective to cases that would seem to defy explanation-- a counterpoint to Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: And you have done that. You have performed admirably.

SCULLY: Have I? How many X-Files has my scientific approach fully and satisfactorily explained?

SKINNER: Your reports have consistently made sense of his conclusions.

SCULLY: Sir, this one makes no sense at all.

SKINNER: Are you suggesting this is anything other than a murder?

SCULLY: That's what Agent Mulder would have thought.

SKINNER: You think he would have been right? Given Mulder's life work it's tempting to attribute his death to the paranormal, the unexplained, the unknown but that's simply not the case here.

(SCULLY wipes away some tears.)

SKINNER: You need to see this for what it is and given that, I promise you we'll get the bastard who did this.

(SCULLY stares at him.)



SCENE 8

(MULDER's apartment building. SCULLY gets off the elevator and slowly walks to MULDER's apartment. She knocks at the door. FROHIKE opens it. He is wearing a dress shirt with his leather jacket. SCULLY enters. The apartment is full of people, including the LONE GUNMEN and SKINNER. They all quietly watch SCULLY with sympathy as she passes them. SKINNER approaches her.)

SKINNER: (softly) I'm sorry.

(She stares for a moment at a black coffin in the bedroom with a white floral cross atop it. Three unknown people stand next to it. The LONE GUNMEN come up to her.)

BYERS: Agent Scully... How are you holding up?

SCULLY: I, uh... I still can't believe it.

LANGLY: (wearing a tuxedo T-shirt) Neither can we. I half expect Mulder to come knocking at that door. "Surprise."

FROHIKE: (holding a glass of wine) This will dull the pain.

SCULLY: No, thank you.

(FROHIKE drinks the wine in one gulp. BYERS pulls her aside.)

BYERS: Just so you know... we've launched our own investigation.

SCULLY: I was beginning to think that I was the only one who was a little suspicious.

FROHIKE: We'll find him. We'll find him, and we'll make him pay.

SCULLY: (confused) Find who?

FROHIKE: The son of a bitch who killed Mulder.

BYERS: I hope you're not offended but we, uh, managed to get ahold of your report. I must say, we were impressed by the thoroughness of it.

LANGLY: Especially given the circumstances.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

BYERS: We concur with your findings. Clearly, this was a ritualistic murder.

SCULLY: (getting angry) Those were not my findings. You guys believe that, too-- that Mulder was murdered?

LANGLY: It's the obvious answer.

SCULLY: No, it is not the obvious answer!

BYERS: We believe his body was stripped then skeletonized, possibly by boiling or the use of an acid solution.

FROHIKE: We'll make that monkey pay.

SCULLY: (furious) What the hell is wrong with everybody?! You guys, there are unanswered questions here! Am I the only one that's asking them?!

(GUNMEN look at each other.)

FROHIKE: I could use a drink. (he goes to get one)

SCULLY: You three, of all people! You should be all over this, not buying the party line. Look, something else is going on here. Am I the only one who thinks that?!

(SCULLY rubs her temple as a sudden headache hits.)

BYERS: Are you all right?

(Momentarily, she sees the room through a yellow haze. SKINNER walks over to her.)

SKINNER: I think you need to go home and get some rest. I'll call you a cab.

SCULLY: (accusing) What have you done with him?

SKINNER: Scully, you're emotionally distraught. You need to calm down and get some rest.

SCULLY: Where is Mulder? Where is he? What have you done with him?!

SKINNER: (grabbing her shoulders) Listen to me. He's gone. You need to accept that.

SCULLY: (hysterical, pushing SKINNER's hands away) Look, something else is going on here! Where is he?! Where's Mulder?!

(Everyone just stares at her. There is a knocking at the door. No one moves to answer it. FROHIKE drinks directly from the wine bottle. The knocking continues. In a continuous camera shot, SCULLY finally walks to the door and opens it. MULDER enters and passes her into the room which is now deserted. Everyone else is gone. MULDER turns and faces her. Room is now messy as normal.)

MULDER: Scully.

(She stares at him.)



SCENE 9

(MULDER is sitting on the couch. He is very calm and monotone. SCULLY glances into the bedroom where the coffin was.)

MULDER: We were in the cave when the light came. It was a blinding blue-white light. Then they took me. I was abducted. I found myself in some kind of medical bay. It was white, featureless. It was just as the Schiffs had described it.

SCULLY: Mulder, the Schiffs are dead.

MULDER: No, actually, they're not.

SCULLY: Mulder, their remains were discovered in a field. That's... that's what brought us to this case in the first place. I found your remains in that same field.

MULDER: Look at me. I'm here.

SCULLY: How did you get here?

MULDER: Aliens brought me back here.

SCULLY: From North Carolina direct to your apartment door? (MULDER thinks about it.) Mulder, you don't remember getting here, do you? Neither do I.

MULDER: It doesn't change what happened.

SCULLY: Mulder, why did you knock? This is your apartment. (MULDER thinks about it.) And you don't seem the least bit surprised to find me here. And what about the Schiffs? I mean, if they're alive, as you say, then... then where are they? Where'd they go? Mulder, five minutes ago... this room was filled with people attending your wake.

MULDER: Well, what can I say, Scully? I'm here. I'm real.

SCULLY: Mulder, this is not reality. This is a hallucination. It has to be. And either I am having it, or you are having it or we are having it together.

MULDER: Brought on by what?

SCULLY: Something that we found in that field, Mulder, because that's where it began. (realizing) Wild mushroom. Wild mushrooms, Mulder. They were growing there. I stepped on one, and it gave off spores. Several varieties of  of mushrooms are known for their hallucinogenic properties. If  if we inhaled it...

MULDER: Whatever happened to the most logical explanation?

SCULLY: This is it, Mulder. What if we're still there? If we're still in that cave in North Carolina-- that we're not here in this apartment right now?

MULDER: (rubbing his face) Whoa, Scully.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, bear with me. I think this is making sense. I think that Angela and Wallace Schiff were digested by that substance that I found all over that field. That they were dissolved and then expelled up out of the ground. What if that substance and this hallucinogen are - are from one and the same organism?

MULDER: A giant mushroom?

SCULLY: A giant fungal organism, Mulder. We already know that they exist. Biologists have found specimens that range dozens of acres that weigh hundreds of tons. And what if this one needs to feed on living tissue, Mulder? There is carnivorous plant life. There's  there's the Venus Flytrap and the pitcher plant. Mulder, what if this one puts off an hallucinogen...

MULDER: To lure its prey into the cave?

(MULDER experiences a sudden, painful headache.)

SCULLY: To make it complacent. To keep it still while it devours it.

(CUT QUICKLY TO: MULDER, underground, covered in yellow goo.)

(CUT TO: MULDER's apartment.)

SCULLY: What if we're still underground, Mulder? What if we're moving deeper into the cave? Or being moved? Mulder, what if we're being digested? Right now.

(Close up on MULDER's horrified face, then SCULLY dissolving into yellow goo again.)

CUT TO: Outside shot of ground above the cave, we see MULDER's hand, then MULDER pushing his way out of the ground. He is coughing and covered in mud. He reaches back into the hole and pulls an equally muddy SCULLY out. He rolls her onto her back, then they lie exhausted on the grass beside each other.



SCENE 10

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are in SKINNER's office. He is reading their report.)

SKINNER: The exact size of this organism has yet to be determined?

SCULLY: That's correct, sir. We know that the organism extends for at least ten acres. Though it's mostly subterranean so it may be far larger.

MULDER: We've contacted Fish and Wildlife. We've contacted the North Carolina State Health Department as well as the local FBI field office in Raleigh. And we've contacted a mycologist at the Smithsonian for good measure. We think we have our bases covered.

SCULLY: The lab results determined that the spores we were exposed to have a chemical structure similar to LSD. They also contain an alkaloid which induces a state of narcosis.

SKINNER: It's a rare day when the two of you sign off on the same report.

(MULDER looks thoughtful.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I'm just thinking... I'm not exactly clear on how we escaped.

SKINNER: What's not clear?

MULDER: (to SCULLY) Once you recognized that we were under a chemical influence then it simply kind of... broke its spell?

SCULLY: That's right.

MULDER: Scully, how could we simply will ourselves out of a chemical hallucination?

SCULLY: Well, the fact remains we did.

MULDER: Did we? Can you name me one drug that loses its effect once the user realizes it's in his system?

SKINNER: I assume the effects wore off to the point that you were both able to make your escape.

MULDER: Scully, how long were we underground? Hours? Half a day? How come our bodies don't show any effects of being burned by the digestive fluids? We were covered in hydrochloric acid. Yet look at our skin. Nothing.

(SCULLY looks at her hands.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, where are you going with this?

MULDER: Scully... we never escaped. We're still trapped underground.

SCULLY: Mulder, we did escape. I think you're suffering from post-traumatic stress.

MULDER: No, I'm not. This is not real. (to SKINNER) You, you're not real.

SCULLY: Mulder, I...

MULDER: I'll prove it, Scully.

(MULDER stands and pulls out his gun.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(MULDER shoots SKINNER three times in the chest. Yellow goo comes out of the wounds. SKINNER stares straight ahead. SCULLY watches as MULDER dissolves in yellow goo.)

CUT TO: MULDER and SCULLY still in the cave, covered in yellow goo and plant tendrils. Their lips are moving slightly as if in a trance. Sound of voices overhead. MULDER, still in a trance, reaches up, his hand breaks the surface of the ground. Outside the cave. SKINNER and several other suited agents are searching. They are all wearing gas masks. SKINNER sees MULDER's hand.)

SKINNER: Over here! Over here!

(They get to MULDER's hand and frantically dig him out. He is barely conscious. PULSE FINDING AGENT feels for a pulse.)

PULSE FINDING AGENT: He's alive.

SKINNER: Hurry up! Get him out! Get him out! Keep digging! She's down here! Pull her up. Get her out.

(They get SCULLY out too, and load her and MULDER onto ambulance gurneys. They are both covered in mud and yellow goo and show signs of some slight chemical burns on their face and hands.)

SCULLY: (weakly) Mushroom.

MUSHROOM FINDING AGENT: We found it. Just take it easy, Agent.

(The agents load both MULDER and SCULLY into the back of one ambulance, lock the beds down and close the doors, leaving them alone. MULDER weakly turns his head toward SCULLY and stretches his hand out to her. Without looking, she reaches for him and they grasp hands. She opens her eyes groggily and they watch each other as the ambulance drives away.)

[THE END]

                                        BIOGENESIS



SCENE 1

(Under SCULLY's voiceover, we see some stock footage of scenes of the Earth as viewed from space, the ocean, single celled organisms squirming around, then a dry desert landscape. Then plants, insects, a crocodile, picture of dinosaur, birds, more plants, early man, footage from the movie of the cavemen running over the snow, cave paintings, modern man, Apollo launch, lots of cars, DNA helix, interspersed here and there with deserts every time she mentions extinction.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) From Space, it seems an abstraction-- a magician's trick on a darkened stage. And from this distance one might never imagine that it is alive. It first appeared in the sea almost four billion years ago in the form of single-celled life. In an explosion of life spanning millions of years, nature's first multicellular organisms began to multiply... and then it stopped. 440 million years ago, a great mass extinction would kill off nearly every species on the planet leaving the vast oceans decimated and empty. Slowly, plants began to evolve, then insects, only to be wiped out in the second great mass extinction upon the Earth. The cycle repeated again and again. Reptiles emerging, independent of the sea only to be killed off. Then dinosaurs, struggling to life along with the first birds, fish, and flowering plants - their decimations Earth's fourth and fifth great extinctions. Only 100,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens appear-- man. From cave paintings to the bible to Columbus and Apollo 11, we have been a tireless force upon the earth and off cataloguing the natural world as it unfolds to us. Rising to a world population of over five billion people all descended from that original single cell, that first spark of life. But for all our knowledge, what no one can say for certain, is what or who ignited that original spark. Is there a plan, a purpose or a reason to our existence? Will we pass, as those before us, into oblivion, into the sixth extinction that scientists warn is already in progress?

(FADE TO: African coast. Men are shouting excitedly in Swahili. They kneel down at the water's edge and look at a broken metal fragment that is sticking up out of the sand. It has strange writing on it. Close up on fragment as the water washes over it.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Or will the mystery be revealed through a sign, a symbol, a revelation?

SCENE 2
IVORY COAST
WEST AFRICA

(Same scene as teaser. One of the men calls to DR. MERKMALLEN who is sitting under a canopy at his desk on the beach. They call him "Proffesor." DR. MERKMALLEN follows them back to the shore and looks at the fragment also. He appears quite interested and awed.)



SCENE 3
UNIVERSITE COTE D'IVOIRE
WEST AFRICA

(Later, DR. MERKMALLEN is alone in his office. Beautiful job by the set designer. The fragment is on his desk. He opens a cabinet and removes a leather wrapped object. He carries to the desk and unwraps it. It is a similar fragment. He holds the two pieces up and examines them like puzzle pieces. Suddenly, like magnets, they fuse together into one piece and then it flies out of his hands and across the room where it impales a book. DR. MERKMALLEN cautiously walks over and pulls out the book. It is a copy of the Bible. He carefully removes the fragment from the now torn book, gazes at it, then sets it down on the desk. It begins spinning there, faster and faster. Shocked, DR. MERKMALLEN puts his hand on it, stopping it from spinning, then quickly wraps it up in the leather and runs to the rotary phone.)

DR. MERKMALLEN: (on phone, urgently) Yes, get me the international operator, please. I need to place a call to the United States.

(Back at the desk, there is a close up on one of the verses right above the tear in the Bible: Genesis I:28 "And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.")



SCENE 4
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
THREE DAYS LATER

(Night. Plane lands.)



SCENE 5
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
WASHINGTON, DC

(Later, still night, DR. MERKMALLEN is walking through the campus {which is very similar to that of UCLA J]. He sees two female students.)

DR. MERKMALLEN: Excuse me, I'm looking for the Biology Department for a Professor Sandoz.

(They point him in the right direction. Inside the building, a MAN wearing a lab coat is in one of the labs which has lots of monkeys in cages. They are chittering quietly. He is watching through the window and waiting. DR. MERKMALLEN enters.)

DR. MERKMALLEN: Dr. Sandoz? (shakes his hand) Professor Sandoz, I'm Solomon Merkmallen.

MAN: Dr. Merkmallen. My God, I thought something had happened to you.

DR. MERKMALLEN: (surprised) Oh. Did you not get my message? We were delayed in Frankfurt.

MAN: Look, the important thing is you're here now, and you're safe.

DR. MERKMALLEN: Yes.

MAN: Uh... you brought me something-- this, uh... this discovery of yours.

DR. MERKMALLEN: Yes.

MAN: I'm quite anxious to see it.

DR. MERKMALLEN: I-I was concerned I might be relieved of it in customs. There was some trouble with the X-ray machine in Germany.

(They sit at the desk.)

MAN: What kind of trouble did you have?

DR. MERKMALLEN: I told you of its power.

MAN: (pause) Yes, of course.

DR. MERKMALLEN: My credentials were the only thing that prevented me from being further detained.

(As DR. MERKMALLEN pulls out the fragment and unwraps it, the monkeys begin to get louder and very upset.)

DR. MERKMALLEN: I can't explain how it is... but the two pieces have become one. I was hoping they'd match the piece that you've found so that you might see for yourself its magic.

MAN: (holding the fragment) Have you had any luck reading it?

DR. MERKMALLEN: (staring at the MAN) You're not Dr. Sandoz, are you?

(The MAN stands threateningly, and we hear sounds of a fight. Camera pans over to the monkeys in their cages. They are now screaming hysterically. Short time later, the MAN comes out into the stariway. The monkeys can still be heard screaming. He leaves the building. Back inside the office another man, DR. SANDOZ, enters the office. He sees the leather piece lying empty on the desk, then he goes around the cages and sees DR. MERKMALLEN lying dead, a pool of blood under his head. He backs away in panicked horror.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(SKINNER's office. MULDER and SCULLY are with him.)

SKINNER: A case like this I, of course, thought of your obvious interest-- Dr. Merkmallen's views and theories being what they were. I believe Agent Mulder is familiar with his work.

(MULDER hands the file to SCULLY. It has a picture of DR. MERKMALLEN. FBI file number 46742.)

SCULLY: (reading) Dr. Solomon Merkmallen, Professor of Biology, University of Ivory Coast.

SKINNER: He flew in yesterday from Africa. Two hours later, he was apparently murdered at American University. His body is missing but there was enough blood found on the floor to make a fair assumption. A couple of students also confirmed that they spoke to him when he asked them for directions to find a Dr. Steven Sandoz, also a Professor of Biology.

(There is also a picture of DR. SANDOZ.)

MULDER: Both men espouse a fringe theory called "Panspermia." It's the belief that life originated...

SCULLY:  elsewhere... in this universe.

SKINNER: You've heard of this?

SCULLY: Yeah. (glancing at MULDER) It's the idea that Mars or other planets were habitable long before Earth and that, uh, cosmic collisions on these planets blasted microbes into our solar system - some of which landed and flourished here.

SKINNER: You'd accept that as plausible?

SCULLY: Well, almost any scientist would... theoretically. I mean, it's just a theory. That's about it, though. You don't think this has anything to do with his death, do you?

SKINNER: Dr. Merkmallen found an artifact in his country. This is a rubbing of that artifact. (He hands SCULLY a pencil rubbing of the fragment) He claimed it contained a message- not only of his Mars theories but the very meaning of human existence.

SCULLY: (pointedly to MULDER) Much less plausible.

MULDER: Dr. Sandoz, the man he'd come to meet made a similar claim in a  (pointedly to SCULLY)  "science" ... journal. He said he'd found an artifact that was almost identical to that with similar writings on it.

SCULLY: And what was it supposed to say?

MULDER: Well, we'd have to ask Dr. Sandoz that.

SCULLY: Well, why don't we?

MULDER: We can't. He's missing.

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY get on the elevator. Doors close and they are alone. MULDER pushes the button for the basement, then looks carefully at the rubbing of the artifact. They stand close together.)

SCULLY: What are we doing, Mulder? This is a police matter at best.

MULDER: Skinner wants us on the case.

SCULLY: Are you going to try and convince me that you have no personal interest in this case?

MULDER: I am just a hired gun for the FBI.

SCULLY: Oh, come on.

MULDER: What if there's something to this?

SCULLY: Two men suggesting that we're all Martians. Now why would they possibly come into foul play?

MULDER: That's what we're being asked to figure out.

(Several other people get on the elevator. MULDER and SCULLY move out of the way. MULDER looks at the rubbing again. SCULLY continues talking, but MULDER can barely understand her. From his point of view, she is suddenly speaking through a distant dull cacophony of voices. He glances around at the other silent occupants of the elevator, then stares at SCULLY in confusion.)

SCULLY: (barely understood) I don't understand you, Mulder. You're willing to pursue any case involving aliens no matter how tenuous the connection. There has to be some limit to your interest... I mean, this endless pursuit of the truth, Mulder it just... it doesn't make any sense to me now.

(The other people get off the elevator and the cacophony fades. SCULLY realizes that MULDER is staring at her blankly. )

SCULLY: Mulder? Did you hear a word of what I just said?

MULDER: (softly) No.

SCULLY: No? (sadly) Well, maybe you didn't want to hear it.

MULDER: (confused) No... I couldn't hear it.

(MULDER hands her the rubbing and starts to head for his office.)

SCULLY: Mulder... look, after all you've done, after all you've uncovered-- a conspiracy of men doing human experiments, men who are all now dead-- you exposed their secrets. I mean, you've won. What more could you possibly hope to do or to find?

(MULDER looks at her with a small sad smile.)

MULDER: My sister.

(SCULLY follows him to the office.)



SCENE 7
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
11:42 AM

(DR. SANDOZ's lab. Someone is looking out the window as MULDER and SCULLY cross the campus. Lots of police. Full crime scene procedures are going on.. Pictures are taken of the scene and a large bloody bone? Pestle? Big white thing? is already bagged as evidence. The MAN who met with and killed DR. MERKMALLEN is standing near the monkey cages. MULDER stares at him as soon as they walk in the room.)

SCULLY: Guess I was right about this being a police matter. Detective?

DETECTIVE: Can I help you?

SCULLY: Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. What do you have here?

DETECTIVE: Probable weapon-- blood and hair on it. Looks like prints, too..

SCULLY: Any word on this Dr. Sandoz?

DETECTIVE: No, but we're being told the prints are very likely his.

SCULLY: Told by whom?

DETECTIVE: The man your partner's speaking with.

(MULDER has crossed over to the MAN, DR. BARNES.)

MULDER: Fox Mulder with the FBI.

DR. BARNES: I'm Dr. Barnes, head of the department. They've asked me to suspend classes and organize interviews with the faculty.

MULDER: Any ideas yourself about what happened here?

DR. BARNES: There's plenty of speculation.

MULDER: About the missing Dr. Sandoz?

DR. BARNES: Apart from his laughable ideas my colleague was capable of almost anything to advance his rather questionable reputation.

SCULLY: (joining them) Capable of murder?

DR. BARNES: Dr. Sandoz's notes are full of talk about an artifact coming over from West Africa but like the man who was bringing it that artifact has yet to be located.

SCULLY: Are you, uh, speaking of this?

(SCULLY hands DR. BARNES the rubbing. MULDER suddenly puts his hand to his head as once again he hears a cacophony of sound. He goes out of the room. SCULLY is concerned.)

SCULLY: (worried) Mulder?

DR. BARNES: Do you know Dr. Sandoz believes this writing was from aliens? These are trivial men. They have no patience for the scientific process. They're happy to read their names in the tabloids. Pseudo scientists. Beyond embarrassment.

(Out in the hall, MULDER is splashing water from the drinking fountain on his face. The cacophony has faded again. SCULLY joins him.)

SCULLY: What is it, Mulder?

MULDER: I don't know. It's, uh... a hollow noise. The same thing that happened to me at work in the elevator this morning.

(MULDER dries his face with a handkerchief. SCULLY puts her hand to his forehead.)

SCULLY: Do you have a fever?

MULDER: No. This is going to sound weird but I think it's that thing.

SCULLY: You're not kidding. (She looks at the rubbing.) It's just a piece of paper.



SCENE 8

(X-Files office. SCULLY and familiar face, CHUCK BURKS are looking at images of the rubbing on a very cool overhead projector.)

CHUCK BURKS: I recognize the ideography.

(MULDER enters.)

SCULLY: You're late.

MULDER: I'm sorry. I thought this was my office.

(MULDER and SCULLY both smile and MULDER shakes CHUCK BURKS' hand.)

CHUCK BURKS: Fox.

SCULLY: I called Chuck as I knew you would for authentication, and to get his professional opinion on how you say it's affecting you.

CHUCK BURKS: Fascinating, Mulder.

MULDER: You don't believe it, Chuck?

CHUCK BURKS: No, no. You know me. This is right up my twisted little alley. So, uh... what exactly are you experiencing?

MULDER: Noise. Aural dissonance. It comes and it goes.

SCULLY: Is it happening right now?

MULDER: No, but it was a few minutes ago.

CHUCK BURKS: And it's only affecting you, triggered by the rubbing. Wow. That blows me away.

MULDER: Why?

SCULLY: Because the rubbing is a fake and I'm not the first one to say so..

CHUCK BURKS: The writing is Cree-- phonetic Navaho-- but no literal interpretation makes any sense.

SCULLY: And the fact that it was found in Africa makes it all the mores suspicious as a fabrication.

MULDER: Suspicious of what?

CHUCK BURKS: Do you know what a Magic Square is?

MULDER: Yeah. It has to do with the occult.

CHUCK BURKS: Right. Very cool. They first appear in the ninth century in history but, uh... (changes the image on the projector to show a Magic Square)  as the story goes God himself instructed Adam in their use and then handed down the secret to all his saints and prophets and wise men as a way of trapping and storing potential power to the person whose name or numerical correlative exercises that power.

MULDER: That's what this thing is?

SCULLY: Well, that's what someone would have you believe this is.

MULDER: How do you know that?

SCULLY: As it turns out neither of us had to go very far to find out.

(SCULLY puts a magazine article up on the projector. It is by DR. BARNES. "Science Update - God Spelled Backward - Manufacturing Religious Artifacts for Fun and Profit.")

SCULLY: Barnes documented Sandoz's fakery once before. If he was blunt about his colleague when we met him, in here, he is downright brutal.

MULDER: Does he back any of that up?

SCULLY: Well, it's quite scholarly, actually.

CHUCK BURKS: Barnes has made something of a career exposing science and religious fraud. (puts up another article on DR. BARNES) Name your wonder of the world-- he's been there, debunked that.

MULDER: Yeah, but wouldn't it be in his great interest to hide something that he couldn't disprove with his scholarship?

SCULLY: Mulder, if it were real then why would an American Indian artifact be fused in rock on the west coast of the African continent?

MULDER: In 1996, a rock from Mars was found in Antarctica. How did it get there?

SCULLY: It was from outer space.

(MULDER throws his arms up triumphantly.)

CHUCK BURKS: Begs the question, doesn't it? Why produce a fraud with Navaho writing... in Africa?

(CHUCK BURKS puts the image of the rubbing of the artifact back on the overhead projector. MULDER once again is assaulted by the cacophony of sound. In pain, he puts his hands to his head.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Hey.

MULDER: Hmm.

SCULLY: Let's step outside. Step outside.

(SCULLY leads MULDER out into the hall among the file cabinets. The cacophony fades.)

SCULLY: You're in pain.

MULDER: No, no, it's going away.

SCULLY: Mulder, whatever is causing this I think it needs immediate attention. I'm going to schedule you an imagining scan.

MULDER: No, I'm okay. I really am.

SCULLY: Mulder, you're not okay. If nothing else, you should be at home in bed.

MULDER: I'm not going home to bed, Scully. I think I know what's causing this and I know what happened to those two professors and that artifact. I got a sense of it yesterday when I met that man Barnes.

SCULLY: You had a sense of it?

MULDER: Yes. This man Solomon Merkmallen is dead. Barnes knows it. He killed him-- killed him in that lab.

SCULLY: Well, I hope you're not going to suggest that we arrest him on that rather baseless assumption.

MULDER: No, I'm not... not until after I show you what he did with the body.

(They head back to the office.)



SCENE 9
SANDOZ RESIDENCE
SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

(The LANDLORD, an irritating little man with a very strange accent, lets MULDER and SCULLY into DR. SANDOZ's house.)

LANDLORD: I been all through the place. You know what you're looking for?

MULDER: We'll let you know if we find it.

LANDLORD: Ah...cops have been here, too, you know. They couldn't find nothing, either. (waves in disgust at the apartment) Feh.

SCULLY: We'll come get you to 

LANDLORD: (ignoring her) Yeah, yeah.

(LANDLORD leaves. Movie theme music. MULDER goes into the bedroom and finds a suitcase in one of the very organized closets. He looks at the old tags on the handle.)

MULDER: Whatever happened to Dr. Sandoz, he certainly liked to fly south for the winter-- a lot. Gallup, New Mexico. It's Navaho country.

SCULLY: Well, I think I know who he was going to see.

(SCULLY looks closely at a framed picture of DR. SANDOZ and a familiar old Native American man - ALBERT HOSTEEN.)

MULDER: That's Albert Hosteen.

SCULLY: Your World War II code-talker

MULDER: Maybe he was using him to read the symbols on the artifact.

SCULLY: Or write them. Mulder, you also said that we'd find a body. Care to make good on that prediction?

(SCULLY follows MULDER as he goes confidently into the kitchen. He puts his hand over his nose.)

MULDER: Scully, you packing any latex?

SCULLY: No. Why?

MULDER: Doesn't it smell like somebody forgot to take out the garbage?

(MULDER gets a dishtowel and opens the trash compactor. They both gasp at the smell. Flies buzz out. MULDER gingerly opens the black plastic bag inside the compactor exposing DR. MERKMALLEN's face and dismembered body. Flies are crawling over the remains. Very disgusting.)

SCULLY: Oh, God.



SCENE 10

(SKINNER's office. SKINNER is looking at a picture of DR. SANDOZ and at the rubbing. Throughout the scene, MULDER has his head bowed and a pained expression as he tries to concentrate on the conversation through the other noises that he is hearing.)

SKINNER: So you think Dr. Sandoz is innocent?

MULDER: He's afraid for his life because of what he knows and what he has..

SKINNER: (pushing over the rubbing) This?

MULDER: A genuine artifact-- one of several pieces of an unknown whole. Dr. Barnes has one now, too. That's why he killed Solomon Merkmallen.

SKINNER: The way his body was disposed of...

MULDER:  was to incriminate Sandoz, to make him look like the killer. It's also to hide something. Something that no one would think to look for. (losing focus) Scully, could you please tell... what your medical exam found in the lab report?

SCULLY: Parts of his body were missing-- his arms, his hands, uh, parts of his vital organs and his thyroid.

MULDER: All of which would retain telltale traces of radiation.

SKINNER: Radiation from what?

MULDER: The artifact.

SCULLY: On Agent Mulder's urging I ran tissue samples through what's called a charged particle directional spectrometer. There were traces of a kind of radiation called C.G.R.

MULDER: Cosmic Galactic Radiation. It's a kind of radiation that's found only outside our solar system.

SKINNER: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I don't know how to explain it but I feel that we can make an arrest.

MULDER: Oh, forget the arrest. We got to find these artifacts.

(MULDER hears the cacophony get louder and grabs his head in pain.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Is there someone else on this case, sir?

SKINNER: Excuse me?

MULDER: (accusing) There's someone else on this case-- you're not telling me.

SKINNER: What's the hell's he talking about?

MULDER: I hear it... in my head.

SCULLY: Mulder, let's go.

(SCULLY leads MULDER out into the hall, MULDER slamming the door behind them.. SKINNER opens the door a crack and eavesdrops on them. Bad Skinner.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you're losing it.

MULDER: No, I'm not. Listen to me-- he's not telling the truth. I'm hearing people. He's spying on us.

SCULLY: Mulder, you need to see a doctor.

MULDER: I need to find those artifacts.

SCULLY: I'll find the artifacts. You need to go home right now. Mulder...

(MULDER, nods quickly, then he and SCULLY leave. SKINNER closes the door all the way, then goes to a cabinet in his office. From the hidden video camera there, he removes a tape, then hands it across his desk to KRYCEK. KRYCEK takes the tape, smiles, and leaves through the other door. SKINNER looks really guilty.)



SCENE 11
SOUTHWESTERN GENERAL HOSPITAL
GALLUP, NEW MEXICO

(SCULLY watches as an unconscious ALBERT HOSTEEN is wheeled out of a hospital room by several orderlies. SCULLY finds another rubbing of the artifact on the bedside table and picks it up. On the back of the paper is a crudely handwritten copy of Genesis I:28. A NURSE enters the room.)

NURSE: Is there something you're looking for?

SCULLY: Yes, I was looking to speak to Mr. Hosteen.

NURSE: Mr. Hosteen cannot accept any visitors at this time.

SCULLY: Yes, I understand. I saw him wheeled out of here in an emergency.. Can you tell me what's wrong with him?

NURSE: I'm not allowed to give out that kind of information.

SCULLY: (showing her badge) I, um, I know him. He's helped me in the past. I'm sure that he wouldn't mind you telling me.

NURSE: Albert has cancer. He's suffering from its effects. He's dying.

(SCULLY, of course, empathizes with that.)



SCENE 12
AMERICAN UNIVERSITY
4:58 PM

(American University campus. DR. BARNES walks down the hall. Also, MULDER, wearing jeans, t-shirt and black pullover sweater, is walking through the crowded hall of the biology building. He goes into DR. BARNES office. He is looking for something. He checks the desk, then opens the file cabinet, then hears someone talking to DR. BARNES out in the hall and slowly closes the drawers again.)

STUDENT: (voice in the hall) Dr. Barnes?

(DR. BARNES enters his office and sets his briefcase on the desk, notices something amiss, then looks around the darkened office suspiciously. He enters the adjoining lab. We see that MULDER is hiding behind one of the monkey cages. Monkeys are chattering. MULDER suddenly winces in pain as the cacophony in his head increases in intensity. Sounds like DR. BARNES may be getting a phone call. Short time later, DR. BARNES leaves the lab and walks down the hall to a stairwell. MULDER follows him, still in pain and confusion, hearing voices, staring at the students passing him. He enters the stairwell after DR. BARNES, but only makes it up to the first landing before he collapses from the pain.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY waiting in the New Mexico hospital room. She is sleepy. Looks like she has been waiting a long time. The orderlies bring ALBERT HOSTEEN back to the room. He is in bad shape. She looks up and sees DR. SANDOZ at the door. He sees her and runs. She follows.)

SCULLY: Hey!

(He pushes a man out of his way. She follows him through several halls and loses him. She pauses, listening, and the camera moves close to her ear [like the Bionic Woman super-hearing moments for those readers old enough to remember]. She hears a ringing. It is the stairwell alarm. She runs into the stairwell and runs to the first landing and points her gun at DR. SANDOZ who is a few steps above her. He freezes and she lowers the gun.)

SCULLY: Okay... I need answers from you.

(CUT TO: MULDER still lying in his stairwell at the university. The cacophony is deafening, and he is in agony. Music is from 4th season ep Teliko. KRYCEK enters the stairwell and walks past MULDER who vaguely notices him. KRYCEK follows DR. BARNES out onto the roof of the building.)

DR. BARNES: Are you the man who called?

KRYCEK: Dr. Barnes...

DR. BARNES: Yes.

KRYCEK: Dr. Barnes you and I are... destined to be great friends.

(Krycek holds up the videotape he got from SKINNER.)

(CUT TO: ALBERT HOSTEEN's hospital room. DR. SANDOZ and SCULLY have entered. ALBERT is unconscious.)

DR. SANDOZ: Albert was the only translator who didn't dismiss me out of hand. When I showed him the original artifact he sensed immediately its power and importance. The trouble was, it was only one fragment-- not enough to read.

SCULLY: But then other pieces surfaced.

DR. SANDOZ: Dr. Merkmallen found two more in the tidal shallows. He sent me a rubbing. Suddenly, Albert was able to make a real translation.

SCULLY: (looking at the translation) A passage from the Bible on an artifact that you're saying is extraterrestrial. And, uh, how did the aliens get it?

DR. SANDOZ: They gave it to us. The text came from them. I can prove it.. It's written here. I'm sure of it.

(DR. SANDOZ pulls out another fragment of inscribed metal and sets it on the tray table.)

DR. SANDOZ: Albert was working to translate another section when his health turned.

SCULLY: And, uh, this was going to tell us what?

DR. SANDOZ: I don't know yet. Albert said it just seemed to be random letters.

(On its own, the fragment begins spinning on the table. SCULLY glances under the table, then slaps her hand down on the fragment stopping it from spinning. They stare at each other.)

(CUT TO: Phone ringing in MULDER's apartment. He is lying in a real bed, all tucked in. He is groggy. A WOMAN stands beside the bed. She answers the phone.)

WOMAN: (on phone) Hello?

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello? I'm sorry. I'm trying to reach Fox Mulder.

WOMAN: (on phone) Hold on, please.

(She hands the phone to MULDER.)

WOMAN: Fox?

MULDER: (on phone, sighs) Hello?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, where are you?

MULDER: (on phone) I'm here. I'm resting.

SCULLY: (on phone) Where? Who answered the phone?

MULDER: (on phone) I'm home. It's okay. Where are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm in New Mexico, with, uh, with Dr. Sandoz.

MULDER: (on phone) Does he have the artifact?

SCULLY: (on phone) (sighs) Mulder, this, uh, artifact if I'm to believe what I'm being told about it...

MULDER: (on phone) What?

SCULLY: (on phone) It has a passage on it from Genesis.

MULDER: (on phone) Scully, that artifact is extraterrestrial.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it can't be.

MULDER: (on phone) Did you know what that would mean?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, it would mean nothing, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) No, it would mean that our progenitors were alien, that our genesis was alien, that we're here because of them; that they put us here.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, that is science fiction. It doesn't hold a drop of water.

MULDER: (on phone) You're wrong. It holds everything. Don't you see? All the mysteries of science everything we can't understand or won't explain, every human behaviorism- cosmology, psychology, everything in the X-Files-- it all owes to them. It's from them.

SCULLY: (on phone, frustrated) Mulder, I will not accept that. It is just not possible.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, then, you go ahead and prove me wrong, Scully.

(MULDER hangs up and rolls over in the bed. The WOMAN is DIANA FOWLEY. DIANA takes the phone and walks into the living room, takes off her jacket, and makes another call.)

DIANA: (on phone) Yes, it's Diana Fowley calling for him. (pause) I received a call from Agent Mulder this evening. He was in a particular state of distress.  I don't know why, but I'm staying here until I find out.

(She sets the phone down and strips off her shirt as she begins walking back into the bedroom. Plain white bra.)

(CUT TO: Meeting room. Men sitting around a conference table. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN hangs up and continues listening to a man talking.)

MAN: ...final preparations for mass destruction on a scale that can only be imagined. There appears to be nothing we can do to prevent it. It becomes a question of managing the crisis. Otherwise, we are facing annihilation ourselves.



SCENE 13

(New Mexico desert. Under SCULLY's voiceover, we see bright lights that focus into several car headlights parked near a small Native American structure. There is also a fire. SCULLY and DR. SANDOZ follow as several men carry ALBERT HOSTEEN on a litter into the structure. SCULLY does not enter the building. Instead she stands outside, looking up at the star-studded desert night sky, then pulls aside the blanket over the door and looks inside where the men are preparing for a ritual.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) It began with an act of supreme violence-- a big bang expanding ever outward, cosmos born of matter and gas, matter and gas ten billion years ago. Whose idea was this? Who had the audacity for such invention? And the reason? Were we part of that plan ten billion years ago? Are we born only to die? To be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth before giving way to our generations? If there is a beginning, must there be an end? We burn like fires in our time only to be extinguished. To surrender to the elements' eternal reclaim. Matter and gas... will this all end one day? Life no longer passing to life, the Earth left barren like the stars above, like the cosmos. Will the hand that lit the flame let it burn down? Let it burn out? Could we, too, become extinct? Or if this fire of life living inside us is meant to go on, who decides? Who tends the flames? Can he reignite the spark even as it grows cold and weak?

(SCULLY looks inside again. DR. SANDOZ comes to her.)

DR. SANDOZ: The healing ceremony has begun if you want to go inside.

SCULLY: No, I, uh, I don't think that's right. I don't share in their faith.

DR. SANDOZ: The medical doctors say they've done everything they could.

SCULLY: I know. I think they have.

(SCULLY's cell phone rings. Wow. Service in the desert. Gotta love DC Cellular!))

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

SKINNER: (on phone) It's Skinner. Where are you?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm with Dr. Sandoz.

SKINNER: (on phone) Where?

SCULLY: (on phone) In Gallup, New Mexico. Where are you?

SKINNER: (on phone) A hospital in Georgetown. I'm calling with some bad news. Mulder's in serious condition here.

SCULLY: (on phone) What happened to him?

SKINNER: (on phone) Nobody knows, Agent Scully. You should do whatever you can to get here as soon as possible.

(SCULLY hangs up.)

SCULLY: I have to go. I have to leave.

DR. SANDOZ: Please, don't let anyone know where I am... until we know for sure.

(He looks down at the fragment in his hand and, as SCULLY leaves, he goes back into the structure.)



SCENE 14
GEORGETOWN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
WASHINGTON, DC

(Later, SKINNER is sitting in the hospital hallway. He looks up as SCULLY approaches.)

SCULLY: (worried) They just told me he's in the special psychiatric unit.

SKINNER: I told you on the phone...

SCULLY: No, you said that there was bad news. You didn't tell me what was wrong. (SKINNER doesn't say anything) Look, I'm sorry. It took me three flights to get here.

SKINNER: I don't know what to do, Dana. No one else does, either. I knew you'd want to be here to see him, to talk to the doctors.

(Long tense pause. SKINNER takes her hand.)

SCULLY: What? What is it?

(SCULLY and SKINNER enter a room where DIANA FOWLEY is standing in front of several monitors of patients in psychiatric cells. One of the patients is MULDER, pacing the small area. He is wearing a hospital gown.)

DIANA: Thank you for coming. He was asking for you last night.

(SCULLY glances at DIANA, then watches as MULDER paces. She is very upset. A DOCTOR enters.)

DOCTOR: You really shouldn't be in here.

SCULLY: What's wrong with him? This man right here, Fox Mulder?

(MULDER suddenly faces the camera and begins screaming SCULLY's name.)

DOCTOR: We don't know what's wrong with him and we don't know what to do for him. He's got extremely abnormal brain function but there is no signs of stroke. We're waiting to run more tests.

SCULLY: Waiting for what?

DOCTOR: He's extremely violent. With what we've given him he should be in a barbiturate coma but there's brain activity in areas we've never seen before.

SCULLY: I want to talk to him.

DOCTOR: No, he's a danger to anyone.

SCULLY: (confidently) Not to me.

DIANA: Can we speak in the hall?

SCULLY: (defensively) About what?

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

(SKINNER holds the door open. MULDER yells "SCULLY" clearly and directly to her through the camera. She stares at his image, then goes with SKINNER and DIANA into the hall. SKINNER stands behind SCULLY.)

DIANA: When did all this start?

SCULLY: When we took this case... when Skinner gave it to us.

DIANA: What kind of case is it?

SCULLY: Investigation into a murder.

DIANA: Of whom?

SKINNER: The case has nothing to do with what's happened to him.

DIANA: Agent Scully says it does. Now, you know my background my previous work on the X-Files. If I can help on this case...

SKINNER: The X-File here is a fraud. Scully has ample proof of that-- evidence authenticated by a scholar and authority.

(SCULLY turns and stares at SKINNER.)

SCULLY: I never sent you that report.

SKINNER: Anyway, the case is being resolved.

DIANA: Not as far as it affects Agent Mulder. If you know what's happening, why won't you tell me?

SCULLY: Why were you with him last night?

DIANA: He called me. I found him in a university stairwell. He could barely speak. He said I was the only one who'd believe him-- about an artifact.

(SCULLY stares at DIANA.)

SCULLY: You're a liar.

(SCULLY starts to leave. SKINNER grabs her hand.)

SKINNER: Scully!

SCULLY: You're both liars.

(SCULLY jerks her hand away and leaves. SKINNER turns and looks at DIANA.)



SCENE 15

(The Native American building in New Mexico. Navajo men are chanting over ALBERT HOSTEEN. DR. SANDOZ watches, then suddenly gets up and crosses outside.)

(CUT TO: X-Files office. SCULLY enters and begins frantically searching. She stares up at the newly installed? smoke detector. A hidden camera is inside it. It shows SCULLY climbing up furniture to get to it. Just as she is reaching for it, the phone rings. She answers.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello.

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone in the desert) Agent Scully, Dr. Sandoz. I'm sorry, I didn't know how else to reach you. There's something...

SCULLY: (on phone) Dr. Sandoz, I-I don't know if this is a secure line.

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone) Yes, all right, but I realized something. The letters Albert translated on the artifact... I know what they are.

SCULLY: (on phone) What they are?

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone) Yes. They're coordinates, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: For what?

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone) For genes. They're symbols for gene clusters-- the human genome.

(SCULLY, shocked, does not respond.)

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone) Are you there?

SCULLY: Yeah.

DR. SANDOZ: (on phone) I think it's all here. The map to our human genetic makeup every gene on every chromosome-- proof of what I've been saying. If only we could find more pieces.

(Horses nearby are restless. DR. SANDOZ looks around nervously.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Dr. Sandoz? Hello?

(Over the phone SCULLY hears a gunshot. She glances up at the smoke detector.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Dr. Sandoz?

(The phone clicks off. In the desert, we see KRYCEK standing over DR. SANDOZ's body. He picks up the metal fragment that DR. SANDOZ has dropped. Fade to )

( African coast.)



SCENE 16
IVORY COAST
36 HOURS LATER

(An AFRICAN MAN is speaking Swahili and showing the rubbing of the artifact to several other African men. They answer him and he turns to SCULLY. She is dressed in a very lovely long-skirted beige outfit.)

AFRICAN MAN: It's the same. I'll take you, but they are afraid.

(The men lead SCULLY down to the water's edge. The AFRICAN MAN takes her to a certain spot, then leaves her. She kneels down and brushes the sand away from a much larger metal plate with inscriptions on it. She looks around realizing something and slowly stands. An overhead shot shows that she is standing on top of a ship, the very top of which is just visible under the waves. The music swells.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                     THE SIXTH EXTINCTION


[FLASHBACKS TO BIOGENESIS - 6X22]

ANNOUNCER: Previously on the X-Files...

(DR. MERKMALLEN finds a piece of the metal artifact with mysterious writing on it buried on the Ivory Coast beach in Africa.)

SKINNER: (voice) Dr. Merkmallen found an artifact in his country. He claimed it contained a message.

(DR. MERKMALLEN talking to DR. BARNES.)

DR. MERKMALLEN: I told you of its power.

(DR. MERKMALLEN is studying the artifact in Africa, when it suddenly flies across the room embedding itself in the Bible.)

MULDER: Genuine artifact.

(MULDER is looking at the rubbing of the artifact with SCULLY and CHUCK BURKS. Also a shot of the actual artifact.)

MULDER: Dr. Barnes has one now, too. That's why he killed Solomon Merkmallen.

(MULDER holding his head in pain in the basement hallway. SCULLY is concerned.)

SCULLY: What is it, Mulder?

MULDER: Sounds weird, but I think it's that thing.

(SCULLY and DR. HARRIMAN are observing MULDER who is screaming in a padded cell.)

DR. HARRIMAN: He's got extremely abnormal brain function. There's brain activity in areas we've never seen before.

(SCULLY confronting SKINNER and DIANA FOWLEY in the hallway outside MULDER's room.)

DIANA FOWLEY: He said I was the only one who'd believe him.

SCULLY: You're a liar.

(SCULLY tracking down leads in New Mexico, looking at a Genesis translation of the artifact.)

SCULLY: The passage from the Bible on an artifact that you were saying is extraterrestrial?

(SCULLY on the beach in Africa in her lovely linen outfit with socks getting ready to look at the source of the artifact.)

MULDER: (voiceover) That would mean that our progenitors were alien, that our genesis was alien, that we're here because of them, that they put us here. And once you see all the mysteries of science, everything we can't understand or won't explain, everything in the X-Files, it all leads to them; it's from them.

(SCULLY puts her hand in the wet sand and uncovers part of the alien ship and stares at it in amazement.)



SCENE 1
IVORY COAST, WEST AFRICA

(Beach. Night. Scully is alone, working by lamplight in a tent, looking at the rubbing of the artifact which first affected MULDER. She is wearing linen pants and a white t-shirt. More on that later. Her hair is up, loosely falling around her face)

SCULLY: (voiceover) I came in search of something I did not believe existed. I've stayed on now, in spite of myself. In spite of everything I've ever held to be true. I will continue here as long as I can... as long as you are beset by the haunting illness which I saw consume your beautiful mind. What is this discovery I've made? How can I reconcile what I see with what I know? I feel this was meant not for me to find but for you ... to make sense of -- make the connections which can't be ignored... connections which, for me, deny all logic and reason. What is this source of power I hold in my hand -- this rubbing -- a simple impression taken from the surface of the craft? I watched this rubbing take its undeniable hold on you, saw you succumb to its spiraling effect.

(She takes off her glasses tiredly. A large locust-like bug lands on the rubbing. )

SCULLY: (voiceover) Now I must work to uncover what your illness prevents you from finding. In the source of every illness lies its cure.

(SCULLY gets up and turns down the lamp which seems to be attracting the bugs. As she does, she gasps as she sees the reflection of a PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN holding some sort of staff standing in the entrance to the tent, but when she turns he has disappeared. )

SCULLY: Who's there? Who's there?!

(There is no answer, only the sound of the surf. She turns the lamp back up, then picks up a very large machete and goes out to the beach to investigate. Very tight white T-shirt. The insects now cover her papers inside the tent. Finding no one outside, she goes back into the tent and is horrified at the sight of hundreds of the insects swarming around the tent. She starts to turn down the lamp, but then screams and waves her arms as they surround her. The lamp is knocked to the floor)

SCENE 2
GEORGETOWN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
WASHINGTON, DC

(MULDER is seen on a video monitor in a padded cell going in and out of a fetal position. DR. HARRIMAN and SKINNER watch him. Music is sad.)

DR. HARRIMAN: He's been quiet for the last 36 hours, but he doesn't sleep. There's activity in the temporal lobe we've just never seen. It won't allow his brain to rest or shut down, manifesting in episodes of aggression ... sometimes against himself.

SKINNER: You can't sedate him?

DR. HARRIMAN: Yes. We slow him down for short periods and put him in the neuro ward. It's the only way we're able to run tests. But over time... his brain is going to just die.

(SKINNER looks concerned.)

(Short time later. There is the sound of a door unlocking as DR. HARRIMAN and SKINNER enter MULDER's padded cell.)

SKINNER: (gently) Agent Mulder? (no response, SKINNER kneels down) Agent Mulder, can you hear me?

(MULDER stares at him. Two of MULDER's fingers on his right hand are bandaged.)

SKINNER: Do you know who I am? It's Skinner, Walter Skinner. (to DR. HARRIMAN) Can we get him out of here and get him some fresh air, at least?

(Without warning, MULDER suddenly lunges at SKINNER and grabs him by the throat and begins choking him against the wall. MULDER's face is stoic and impassive - almost calm. DR. tries to restrain MULDER.)

DR. HARRIMAN: Let him go! He can't breathe!

(MULDER pushes SKINNER to the floor, maintaining the choke-hold. DR. HARRIMAN runs out of the room and rings an alarm on the wall. MULDER still has Skinner pinned to the floor.

SKINNER: (barely able to speak, blood trickling down from his nose) Let go, Mulder. I don't want to hurt you.

(DR. HARRIMAN enters with two ORDERLIES. They pull MULDER off of SKINNER and push him up against the wall.)

ORDERLY: Come on, let him go.

DR. HARRIMAN: Stay there, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: No, it's all right. Just let me get up.

(SKINNER looks at MULDER who desperately stares back at him from where he is being held against the wall. SKINNER goes out alone into the hall and regains his composure. He cleans off his glasses with his tie. Behind him we hear MULDER screaming in his room as the ORDERLIES restrain him. The alarm continues ringing.)

DR. HARRIMAN: (angry, voice) Five milligrams of Haloperidol IM! I want him in five-point restraints!

ORDERLY: (voice) Yes, sir.

DR. HARRIMAN: (voice) Let's keep him locked down all night.

(While still listening to the alarm and the voices, SKINNER reaches into his breast pocket and finds a small square of fabric from MULDER's hospital gown. Crudely written in fresh blood are the words, "Help Me." He looks back at MULDER's room.)



SCENE 3
IVORY COAST, WEST AFRICA

(Two trucks full of several AFRICAN MEN pull up to SCULLY's tent site. They get out of the trucks and run toward the ocean and the buried craft. Still in one of the trucks, a man and a woman, the DRIVER and AMINA NGEBE speak to each other in an African dialect. He points at the tent. AMINA NGEBE, a very lovely, young African woman, gets out of the truck and goes into the tent. Insect massacre has taken place. Dead bugs are all over the tent, on the table, walls, everything. Go Scully. SCULLY still has wet hair, as if she has just finished bathing. SCULLY is packing and seems to be surprised to see someone.)

AMINA NGEBE: (looking around the tent) My God. What happened here?

(SCULLY stares at her suspiciously.)

AMINA NGEBE: They said you speak English.

SCULLY: What do you want?

AMINA NGEBE: I am sorry. You must wonder who I am. I am Amina Ngebe. I've come to see your discovery.

SCULLY: I asked that no one be told about it... nor that I'm here.

AMINA NGEBE: Yes. Well, uh, it is still a secret but a well-known one, I'm afraid. Dr. Merkmallen called it the African Internet, God rest him.

SCULLY: You knew Dr. Merkmallen?

AMINA NGEBE: I, too, am a professor of biology at the university but, uh, hardly one qualified to say what must have gone on here.

SCULLY: Well... I was working late last night by lamplight and, uh, I saw a man who vanished... and then they just swarmed.

AMINA NGEBE: (looking around the tent) You must not let the men know what happened to you last night-- the vanishing man, none of it.

SCULLY: Why?

AMINA NGEBE: They are animists, believing nature is vengeful. They'll take this as a sign to leave what you have found alone, a bad omen.

SCULLY: Caused by the ship out there?

AMINA NGEBE: Mmm. Caused by God... who will be much less helpful than those men if we are to continue this work.

(Outside, the men are working in the water to uncover more of the craft. One of the men begins screaming.)

MAN IN WATER: (subtitled): Help ... Help me!

(SCULLY and AMINA NGEBE come out of the tent at the sound of the commotion.)

MAN IN WATER: (subtitled): The water, it boils!

(He splashes around as if in great pain. The other men exit the water, followed by the MAN in pain. SCULLY and AMINA NGEBE run to the water's edge just as the MAN stumbles out of the water. He is covered in second and third degree burns.)

SCULLY: Let's get him in the truck! He's got to get to a hospital! Hospital!

(The other men lead the BURNED MAN to one of the trucks.)

SCULLY: Okay!

AMINA NGEBE: You see? Another warning.

(Disturbed, SCULLY runs after the wounded MAN.)



SCENE 4
GEORGETOWN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
11:32 PM

(SKINNER walks covertly through the hospital corridors. MULDER is now strapped down to a bed - hands and feet - in a typical hospital room. He lies still, but looks tense, his bare foot rigid. SKINNER enters quietly and closes the door.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder. (holding the scrap of fabric) I want to help you. I don't know what to do. I don't have much time.

(MULDER taps the bed with his bound right hand impatiently.)

SKINNER: Can you write?

(At MULDER's affirmative glance, SKINNER takes a pen and places it in MULDER's hand and holds out his own hand. MULDER slowly and deliberately writes the letters "K-R ..." He continues writing, but we don't see the rest.)



SCENE 5

(Night. SCULLY's tent on the beach in Africa. She is lying on her cot staring at the roof. AMINA NGEBE sleeps in the cot beside her.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) I feel you slipping away from me with every minute I fail here. What are the elusive meanings I cannot see that are hidden here? If I could understand it, know how it affected you, learn how to use its power to save you.

(There is the sound and lights of a vehicle pulling up and stopping. SCULLY gets up and goes outside with her machete in hand. She slowly approaches the truck. Another DRIVER is sitting behind the wheel.)

SCULLY: What is it?

(The African DRIVER gets out and speaks in his native language to her.)

SCULLY: Look, I'm sorry. I don't speak your language.

(He speaks again, indicating the ocean with his flashlight, then walks away a few yards towards the site of the craft.)

DR. BARNES: Perhaps you need an interpreter.

(SCULLY turns sharply and sees DR. BARNES [from Biogenesis] staring at her. He looks a little less than sane. This is the man they suspect killed DR. MERKMALLEN. She raises the machete defensively.)

SCULLY: Stay away from me!

DR. BARNES: Are you going to hack me up in front of my driver? Word is you're under suspicion already.

SCULLY: You're the murderer here.

AMINA NGEBE: (coming out of the tent) Murderer of who?

SCULLY: Dr. Merkmallen!

DR. BARNES: I murdered no one but I won't be sent away from here. I know what we've got. This craft that's come ashore? Its extraterrestrial origins?

SCULLY: You don't even believe in that.

DR. BARNES: Nor do you. But here we are.

SCULLY: (breathes heavily) I'm here only to help my partner.

DR. BARNES: Then let me help you... to read it. I've spent my life looking for what's out there ... the answer to what theologians have pondered for millennia... the key to everything... to life itself. I've already been threatened by men in Washington about what I know. How long would your secret keep if you were to send me away?

(At the water's edge, DR. BARNES' DRIVER calls to them, beckoning them to the shore. DR. BARNES, AMINA NGEBE and SCULLY run towards the shore as DR. BARNES yells to his DRIVER in the man's native tongue.)

SCULLY: (to DR. BARNES) What is it?

(Under the glare of the DRIVER's flashlight we see the water has turned red.)

AMINA NGEBE: It is a sea of blood.

(Indeed, the water around the craft is blood-red, visible even in the darkness. SCULLY looks out over the water, concerned.)



SCENE 6
G STREET
WASHINGTON, DC
6:06 AM

(Hallway of an average middle-lower class Washington, DC apartment building. SKINNER looks at his hand where MULDER has written "KRITSCHGAU," knocks at a door, #6, and a man, MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU from the beginning of season 5, opens the door, leaving it still chained. He is unshaven and dishevelled.)

SKINNER: Michael Kritschgau.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: It's 6:00 in the morning.

SKINNER: I don't know if you remember me. My name's Skinner. I'm here to talk to you about Fox Mulder.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Yeah, I'm listening.

SKINNER: He's in serious condition, Mr. Kritschgau; he has to talk to you.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I got nothing to say to the man.

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU starts to close the door but SKINNER holds the door open.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: You know, I had a job... with a government pension coming and two years ago, Fox Mulder asked me to do him a favor -- blow the whistle on Uncle Sam's UFO propaganda mill. And all it got me was this swanky address.

SKINNER: Look, he doesn't have much time.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Hey, I'm not a doctor. What is it you think I can do for him?

SKINNER: All I know is that he asked for you.

(Later, SKINNER and MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU enter MULDER's hospital room. MULDER is still in restraints and apparently comatose, eyes wide open. Monitors register MULDER's brain activity.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Can he even recognize me?

SKINNER: To be honest, I don't know.

(SKINNER crosses to MULDER's bedside.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

(The monitor registers some brain activity, but there is no physical response.)

SKINNER: His brain is on constant redline. They've got him on Haloperidol just to keep him on the monitors.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Haloperidol?

SKINNER: He becomes violently agitated. He just won't speak or sleep even when he's medicated. There's activity in part of his brain they've never seen before.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Was his...

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU stops speaking as the monitor attached to MULDER's brain registers some more activity.)

SKINNER: Was his what?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I started to ask you a question about his prior mental state but he anticipated it. Second time. Agent Mulder?

(The monitor registers activity again.)

SKINNER: He claimed to be hearing voices.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I might know why Agent Mulder asked for me. Doesn't mean I can do anything for him.

SKINNER: What just happened?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I think he responded to a question that ... I didn't ask.

(Later, SKINNER and MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU pick the lock of a door and wheel MULDER into a deserted lab type of room in the hospital. There is an IV attached to the wheelchair, and MULDER seems non-responsive.)

SKINNER: I don't know how long we can keep him out of that unit. We can be held responsible.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: You asked me to come down here. You better be prepared to accept the responsibility, Mr. Skinner.

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU goes to a cabinet and readies a syringe.)

SKINNER: You're going to inject him?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: No. You are. With a thousand milligrams of Phenytoin.

SKINNER: I'm not injecting him with anything, not now and not till after I've talked to his doctor.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: He's being given the wrong treatment.

SKINNER: You're not a doctor.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: No, but I've seen his condition. Who do you want to trust?

SKINNER: Seen it where?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: In a study. There's something like E.S.P. called "remote viewing."

SKINNER: Whose study?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: The company's-- the CIA, Mr. Skinner. Extreme subjects would go into arrest their minds working harder than their bodies could sustain. They became, in effect, all brain. Phenytoin was the only thing that could slow the electrical impulses to a normal rate.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder knew about this. That's why he asked for you.

(KRITSCHGAU nods. SKINNER slowly takes the proffered syringe which is REALLY full, and injects it into MULDER's IV line. Immediately, MULDER's expression relaxes and he becomes more aware.)

MULDER: (gritting his teeth, in a raspy voice) They're coming.



SCENE 7

(Hospital corridor. AGENT DIANA FOWLEY and the ICU NURSE are walking rapidly toward MULDER's room.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Who last saw him?

ICU NURSE: I'm looking here.

DIANA FOWLEY: I come here and find a patient missing, and nobody knew?

ICU NURSE: I just came on. Sorry. Fox Mulder, right? He's restrained, it says; and he's not in his bed?

DIANA FOWLEY: No. How many times can I say it?

(The two women enter the room and see MULDER lying peacefully on the bed, SKINNER standing next to him.)

ICU NURSE: (slightly over DIANA) He's right here.

DIANA FOWLEY: (irritated) He wasn't here when I came in.

SKINNER: No, we just found him down the hall. I just got him back into bed.

ICU NURSE: Who are you?

SKINNER: I'm his boss, ... (turns to DIANA FOWLEY) ... and hers.

ICU NURSE: Well, I don't know how he could have gotten up by himself or pulled all this stuff out.

SKINNER: Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor making a report on this.

ICU NURSE: He's got to remain in this bed.

SKINNER: I'll stay with him. Agent Fowley, why don't you see if you can help her?

(DIANA FOWLEY glares at SKINNER.)

SKINNER: That's an order, Agent Fowley.

(Angrily, DIANA FOWLEY follows the ICU NURSE out of the room. MULDER licks his lips weakly, then looks up at SKINNER. His voice is hoarse.)

MULDER: She knows.

SKINNER: You can read her mind?

MULDER: Yeah. We got to act fast.

SKINNER: The doctor's on his way.

MULDER: No doctors. Get me Scully.

SKINNER: I don't know where she is.

MULDER: Look... I know you've been compromised. I know Krycek is threatening your life... Blackmailing you. You don't think I can trust you but it's not you that I need.

SKINNER: Then who?

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU is entering the room as MULDER speaks.)

MULDER: Him. Kritschgau. Ask him to prove it.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Prove what?

MULDER: What's causing this.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: It's a brain abnormality. It's how you're able to read minds.

MULDER: What's causing this is alien. That's why my doctors can't help me.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I don't believe in aliens, Agent Mulder. I think you know that.

MULDER: I do. That's why I need you.



SCENE 8

(Beach. Day. SCULLY is piecing together the rubbings from the craft into a large jigsaw puzzle on the floor of the tent.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) The work here is painstaking-- a slow and tedious piecing together. It appears to be a craft, its skin covered in the intricate symbols you and I both saw but which I now understand are part of a complex communication. Dr. Barnes has broken some of the symbols into letters using an ancient Navajo alphabet and, though it has helped to uncover some of what's here it has also made for greater confusion. On the top surface of the craft I'm finding words describing human genetics. (On graph paper she translates the names of the four basic nucleotides - CYTOSINE, GUANINE, ADEMINE, THYMINE. [CarriK: I think that either Scully or the Aliens spelled one of those wrong. Adenine is how I learned it.{DrWeesh who has a Degree in Medical Science agrees with CarriK!}]) Efforts to read the bottom of the craft have been harder. Our workers were scared away by phenomena I admit I can't explain-- a sea of blood, a swarm of insects. But what little we have found has been staggering-- passages from the Christian Bible, from pagan religions, from Ancient Sumeria... science and mysticism conjoined. But more than words, they are somehow imbued with power. I've ignored warnings to quit this work, remaining committed to finding answers, afraid only that our secret here won't last and that I might be too late.

(Outside, DR. BARNES begins walking slowly toward the tent carrying a bag. AMINA NGEBE arrives, glances at DR. BARNES, and hurriedly enters the tent with some papers.)

AMINA NGEBE: I have something to show you...more pieces of the puzzle. I couldn't believe it. I thought I was making it up in my head, that it could not be true.

SCULLY: What?

AMINA NGEBE: What this is. What the symbols spell out is a passage from the Koran. Qeyaamah. "The day of final judgment." (amazed) On a spacecraft? Teachings of the ancient prophet Mohammed?

SCULLY: I found more, too.

(SCULLY leads AMINA NGEBE over to the section of rubbings she has been piecing together.)

SCULLY: 24 panels... One for each human chromosome. [CarriK: Yes, 24 chromosomes is correct. 22 pairs plus the two sex chromosomes. They get special treatment. Go to http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/resource/info.html for more info on the subject. Thanks Sis 80K and CathyS.] A map of their makeup-- maybe a map of our entire genetic makeup... (she sighs in amazement) A complete human genome. I mean, it's like... it's the most beautiful... intricate work of art.

AMINA NGEBE: (agreeing) It is the Word of God.

DR. BARNES: (entering the tent with a burlap sack in his hand) You're wrong. There is no God. (he puts the bag under a table.) What's out there on the water... is only what we call "God"... What we call "creation"-- the spark that ignited the fire that cooked the old primordial soup... made animate from inanimate... made us.

AMINA NGEBE: (clinically) I believe he is mad from the sun.

DR. BARNES: Mad? I'm perfectly sane... because today I understand everything, beginning and end, alpha and omega, everything in between. It's all been written. But the word is "extraterrestrial."

SCULLY: You're sick, Dr. Barnes. You need to get off your feet, lie down.

(DR. BARNES picks up SCULLY's machete and holds it threateningly.)

DR. BARNES: You think you're going to take the credit? This is my discovery.

SCULLY: I'm only here to help my friend.

DR. BARNES: You can't help him. You're wasting your time reading it.

SCULLY: It has power.

DR. BARNES: It IS power... the ultimate power. Your friend just got too close.

(He crosses to a corner of the tent by the opening and sits.)

DR. BARNES: No one leaves here before me.

(SCULLY and AMINA NGEBE watch him nervously.)



SCENE 9

(MULDER's hospital room. SKINNER and MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU have set up three small video monitors facing away from MULDER but within his reach. Several different pictures, including that of a flying saucer, flash in random sequence on each of them.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: We developed this to test remote-viewing capabilities. It works much like a card trick. You tap the monitor where the saucer image appears when it appears or when you think it does. Okay?

MULDER: (half-hearted attempt at making a joke) Who ya gonna call?

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU gives a signal and MULDER begins tapping the monitors in succession. Only a few times does he hit the correct monitor when the flying saucer appears.)

MULDER: Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: (disappointed) All right, Agent Mulder, fine. You're at about five percent accuracy.

SKINNER: I'm assuming that's low.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Yeah. At the CIA a high degree of ability was 20%. 25% was extraordinary.

MULDER: But I see them in my head.

SKINNER: You saw his ability earlier. It was you who pointed it out.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Well, our tests showed that some people have psychic abilities, sure. I mean, E.S.P., clairvoyance, remote viewing, but it was never attributed to aliens.

MULDER: You don't want to believe. You're not looking hard enough.

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU reaches to turn off the monitors, but SKINNER stops him.)

SKINNER: One more time, faster.

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU reluctantly starts the test again, this time increasing the speed of the images. MULDER begins tapping rapidly, with perfect accuracy.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: He's ahead of the images. He's anticipating.



SCENE 10

(SCULLY's tent in Africa. Night. SCULLY and AMINA NGEBE lie awake on the cots. DR. BARNES, still holding the machete, sits guard in the corner. Suddenly, everything in the tent shakes, as if a low-level earthquake has hit nearby. Glasses on the table clink. DR. BARNES looks in amazement at the burlap bag he brought in with him. It is moving from within. He pulls out several live squirming fish.)

DR. BARNES: They've come back! They were dead! They've come back to life! The ship-- it brought them back to life!

(DR. BARNES turns just in time to see SCULLY hit him over the head with a chair. Go Scully! She and AMINA NGEBE run to the truck. AMINA NGEBE starts the engine and they quickly drive away.)

SCULLY: We have to get to the police.

AMINA NGEBE: That is where I'm going. This is the road to Abidjan.

(Ahead in the middle of the road, SCULLY sees the PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN.)

SCULLY: Stop!

(Sound of tires squealing as AMINA NGEBE slams on the brakes. When SCULLY looks again, the PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN is no longer there.)

SCULLY: That was him. That was the man I saw in the tent... in the road.

(SCULLY turns to look at the empty road behind them then turns back to AMINA NGEBE, but in the woman's seat, she sees the PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN staring at her.)

PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN: Some truths are not for you.

(He reaches out and touches her forehead. She sits frozen, immobile. Suddenly, the PRIMITIVE AFRICAN MAN is once again AMINA NGEBE. She is touching SCULLY's forehead. SCULLY stares at her.)

AMINA NGEBE: Are you all right?

(SCULLY gasps.)

SCULLY: Oh, God. What are you doing?

AMINA NGEBE: You were cold. I was just feeling to see if you were still alive.

SCULLY: What happened to you?

AMINA NGEBE: To me?

SCULLY: You slammed on the brakes. There was a man.

AMINA NGEBE: That's right-- in the road.

SCULLY: No. He was right there-- sitting right where you are in your seat.

AMINA NGEBE: The men were right. This is a bad sign. A sign to give up.

(AMINA NGEBE starts the engine and begins driving again.)

SCULLY: Turn us around.

AMINA NGEBE: Not back to the beach.

SCULLY: No ... I'm going home.



SCENE 11

(MULDER's hospital room. MULDER stares into space. SKINNER is in the room.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder. (takes MULDER's face in his hand) Agent Mulder, I don't know if you can hear me but we're going to try to get you out of here.

(SKINNER begins unfastening the restraints.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: (entering quickly) A.M. nurse is on in five minutes. We got to move.

SKINNER: I don't think he's in any shape.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: (preparing a syringe) I'm going to hit him pretty hard. Maybe we can get him on his feet. (SKINNER grabs the bottle of Phenytoin from KRITSCHGAU'S hand) What are you doing?

SKINNER: I know what you're doing.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: (defensively) I'm trying to help him.

SKINNER: No, this isn't about him -- it's about you, it's about revenge against the government for trying to destroy your life.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I was destroyed to protect what Mulder knew all along. Now he's the proof-- he's the X-File.

SKINNER: We can't just keep shooting him full of drugs. It's gone too far!

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: How far should it go?! How far would Mulder go?!

(SKINNER considers, looks at MULDER, then hands the drug back to the other man. Monitors beep. Just as MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU gives MULDER the injection, DIANA FOWLEY, followed by a doctor and a nurse bangs into the room. Monitors beep faster.)

DR. HARRIMAN: Hey! What's going on here?

DIANA FOWLEY: (to MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU) Let me see your hands. Hands!

(MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU holds up his now empty hands.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Step away.

SKINNER: Agent Fowley, what the hell do you think you're doing?

DIANA FOWLEY: What am I doing? What are you doing, sir, with this? (holds up the used syringe that was still on the bed - she turns back to MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU) I want you to face the wall. Do you hear me? Face the wall.

SKINNER: Let me explain.

DR. HARRIMAN: What was this man given? What was in this syringe?

DIANA FOWLEY: (reading) Phenytoin.

SKINNER: Let me tell you what it does.

DR. HARRIMAN: How much did you give him? What dosage was this?

SKINNER: Let me tell you why we did it.

(Just then, the medical equipment attached to MULDER begins beeping rapidly and MULDER begins convulsing. The hospital staff, SKINNER and DIANA FOWLEY move to hold him down. )

DR. HARRIMAN: He's going into seizure. Watch his head. Mr. Mulder? Hold him. Hold him.



SCENE 12

(Beach. Africa. Day. DR. BARNES' DRIVER is looking for DR. BARNES in the tent.)

DR. BARNES' DRIVER: Dr. Barnes... (speaks in his native language) ...Dr. Barnes. Dr. Barnes?

(DR. BARNES' DRIVER turns to see DR. BARNES standing behind him with the machete.)

DR. BARNES: I'm so sorry.

(DR. BARNES' DRIVER screams as DR. BARNES slams the machete into his neck, killing him instantly. Lots of blood. DR. BARNES then drags the dead man into a corner of the tent. )



SCENE 13

(MULDER's hospital room. He is still restrained. DIANA FOWLEY is standing beside his bed.)

DIANA FOWLEY: I know what's happened to you. I know what you're suffering from. I've been sitting back and watching. I know you know. I know you know about me... That my loyalties aren't just to you... but to a man you've grown to despise. You have your reasons but, as you look inside me now you know that I have mine. (touches his cheek.) Fox... Fox, I love you. I've loved you for so long. You know that, too. And I won't let you die... to prove what you are, to prove what's inside you. There's no need to prove it. It's been known for so long. Now we can be together. (She kisses his forehead and turns and leaves.)

(Throughout her monologue, MULDER has remained as if comatose, but as she leaves and the door closes behind her, his eyes follow her as if he is thoughtfully considering what she told him.)



SCENE 14
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
9:25 AM

(Plane lands. Cut to FBI Building. People get out of the way as SCULLY, still in her African outfit, looking quite rumpled and travel weary and probably not smelling her best, yet marching with the purpose that only she can have when her partner is in jeopardy, gets off the elevator and enters SKINNER's office without even knocking.)

SCULLY: Where is he? Is he still in the hospital?

SKINNER: Where have you been?

SCULLY: Is he still at Georgetown Memorial?

SKINNER: You can't get to him.

SCULLY: Do you know where he is or don't you?!

SKINNER: He's in the neuro-psych ward but it's no good, Agent Scully.

(SCULLY starts to leave.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully!

SCULLY: I have been on a plane for 22 hours. I have to see him.

SKINNER: Then I think you should know what you're going to see if you can even get on the ward. There's been some trouble.

SCULLY: What kind of trouble?

SKINNER: I got this man, Kritschgau, involved.

SCULLY: Kritschgau?

SKINNER: It's a long story, but it ended badly. They've got Mulder under security now around the clock. I take full responsibility.

SCULLY: Responsibility for what?

SKINNER: He can't even communicate, Agent Scully. They won't treat him because they don't know what's wrong with him! They said he was dying. I had to do something.

SCULLY: He's not dying.

SKINNER: I'm afraid it's true.

SCULLY: (calm and deliberate) He's not dying. He is more alive than he has ever been. He's more alive than his body can withstand and what's causing it may be extraterrestrial in origin.

SKINNER: I know. But there's nothing to be done about it.

(SCULLY starts to leave again.)

SKINNER: They're going to deny you access.

SCULLY: Maybe as his partner... but not as his doctor.

(She turns and leaves the office.)



SCENE 15

(Africa. Night. Remains of a fire are outside. Another earthquake like rattling. DR. BARNES is clearing away papers. He looks to where the dead body of his DRIVER had been lying, but the body is gone leaving only a pool of blood on the floor. He looks around nervously.)

DR. BARNES: (awed) He's alive! He's come back to life! Holy Mother of God!

(DR. BARNES picks up the lamp and goes out onto the beach.)

DR. BARNES: Hello?

(DR. BARNES sees a trail of footprints leading to the shore, smiles and begins running on top of them, toward the ship. He gasps as he turns and sees his now-resurrected DRIVER standing behind him, his eyes pure white and blood all over his shirt. DR. BARNES screams as the DRIVER cuts him down with the machete. He falls dead into the surf. )



SCENE 16

(MULDER's hospital room. MULDER is staring straight ahead, unseeing. Through the babble of voices that we are hearing in his head, one voice comes through clearly, though as if from a distance. MULDER weakly turns his head in the direction of the voice.)

SCULLY (voice): Please. I need to see him. I'm begging you, please. Thank you.

(We see her standing in the doorway to his room talking with DR. HARRIMAN and two SECURITY GUARDS. They let her pass and close the door as she approaches MULDER's bed.)

SCULLY: (gently) Mulder, it's me. I know that you can hear me. If you can just give me some sign. (No response.) I want you to know where I've been... what I found. I think that, if you know, that you could find a way to hold on. (whisper) I need you to hold on. I found a key... the key... to every question that has ever been asked. It's a puzzle... (her voice begins to break) ... but the pieces are there for us to put together and I know that they can save you if you can just hold on. (She is almost crying as she pleads with him, gripping his hand tightly, staring into his blank face.) Mulder... please. Hold on.



SCENE 17

(Africa. Morning. AMINA NGEBE arrives with several police officers. They find DR. BARNES' dead body on the beach. AMINA NGEBE looks into the ocean. The craft that was buried in the sand now appears to be gone.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]


                                  THE SIXTH EXTINCTION II: AMOR FATI 



[SCENES FROM PREVIOUS EPISODES...]

ANNOUNCER: Previously on The X-Files ...

(SCULLY is looking at the ship buried in the beach in Africa and at the images from its hull and then in the tent translating the words.)

SCULLY: It appears to be a craft; its skin covered with the intricate symbols you and I both saw. They are somehow imbued with power.

(MULDER attacks SKINNER in the hospital.)

DR. HARRIMAN: There's activity in the temporal lobe we've just never seen. His brain is going to just die.

(MULDER lying in the hospital bed talking to MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU and SKINNER.)

MULDER: What's causing this?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: It's a temporal lobe abnormality. That's how you're able to read minds.

MULDER: What's causing this is alien.

(SKINNER talking to MULDER who is lying in the hospital bed.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder I want to help you.

(SKINNER and MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU injecting MULDER.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: You asked me to come down here.

SKINNER: You're going to inject him?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: He's being given the wrong treatment.

SKINNER: You're not a doctor.

(MULDER talking to SKINNER, with shots of KRYCEK, armed, with the really long haired wig and SKINNER suffering from the effects of the nanobots from S.R. 819.)

MULDER: Look, I know you've been compromised. I know Krycek is threatening your life.

(DIANA FOWLEY at MULDER's bedside.)

DIANA FOWLEY: I know you know about me-- that my loyalties aren't just to you.

(SCULLY in SKINNER's office and MULDER tapping the computer monitors from the last ep.)

SCULLY: He's not dying. He is more alive than he's ever been and what's causing it may be extraterrestrial.

(SCULLY at MULDER's bedside rubbing his hand and crying.)

SCULLY: Please, Mulder. Hold on.



SCENE 1

(Unknown beach. Lots of rocks and seagulls. Very dreamlike quality to the light. MULDER, barefoot and dressed in jeans and a blue-grey T-shirt, is sitting on a rock watching a young couple teach their TODDLER son to walk. The MOTHER holds the TODDLER's hands in the air as she helps him stumble toward the eager FATHER.)

DR. HARRIMAN: (voice heard over the beach scene) We've exhausted all medical and scientific evidence. By that I mean nothing we can find -- no disease, no hint of disease, only symptoms. The brute fact is he's experiencing so much activity in his temporal lobe that it is effectively destroying his brain.

(CUT TO: MULDER's hospital room. MULDER is lying still, staring sightlessly. DR. HARRIMAN is talking to TEENA MULDER.)

TEENA MULDER: (upset) Enough. There's only so much bluntness a mother can take.

DR. HARRIMAN: I'm sorry. I just...

TEENA MULDER: All you do is sedate him. You're turning him... into a zombie.

(TEENA MULDER strokes MULDER's face tenderly.)

TEENA MULDER: I know you can hear me, Fox. Can you give me a sign?

MULDER: (voice, not physically spoken, matter-of-factly) I can hear you, Mom.

TEENA MULDER: (voice) Fox.

MULDER: (voice, not understanding what is going on) Mom, I can hear you. I'm here.

TEENA MULDER: (voice) I love you, my darling boy.

(Seeing and hearing no response, TEENA MULDER sadly walks away. We hear MULDER's voice getting more and more desperate as she leaves, but his body does not react.)

MULDER: (voice) Mom, where you going? Mom! Mom! Come back, Mom! Mom! (he is yelling) Mom!! ( anguished screaming now) Mom!!!

(Room grows dim around MULDER's still body, then lightens as time passes and we see CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN standing at the window. The following conversation takes place entirely within their heads. No physical speaking.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (voice) "When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes." (he turns to MULDER) Ah, but your mummy will still love you. All a mother wants is to shield her boy from pain and danger. Safe in the world as he was once in the womb. But maybe we think a father demands more than mere survival. Maybe we're afraid a father demands worldly adulation, success, heroism... (he leans close to MULDER's face) I know you can hear me.

(MULDER moves his eyes to look at CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN.)

MULDER: (voice) I could always hear you. Even when my mind is jammed with a thousand voices I can hear you like a snake hissing underneath. How the hell did you get in here?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN fills a syringe from a bottle.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (voice) How does anything I do surprise you now? Aren't you expecting me to sprout vampire fangs?

MULDER: (voice) You've come to kill me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (voice) It would be better than living like a zombie, wouldn't it?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN delivers the injection into MULDER's temple. MULDER gasps and grimaces in pain. Something major and painful happens in his head. The rest of the scene they speak to each other normally.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm giving you a choice.

MULDER: What choice?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Life or death. Your account is squared -- with me, with God, with the IRS, with the FBI. Rise out of your bed and come with me.

MULDER: I'm dying, you idiot. If I could get up, I'd kick your ass.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (not impressed) Don't be so dramatic. Only part of you is dying. The part that played the hero. You've suffered enough - for the X-Files, for your partner, for the world. You're not Christ. You're not Prince Hamlet. You're not even Ralph Nader. You can walk out of this hospital and the world will forget you. Arise.

(As CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN lifts his hands, MULDER sits up in bed.)

MULDER: Wh... wh... what the hell are you doing to me?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm showing you how to take the road not taken. Take my hand.

MULDER: Why should I take your hand?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You can't read my mind?

MULDER: (relief) No... I can't. All the voices are gone.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Take my hand, Fox. You have to take the first step.

(Flash of TODDLER on the beach stumbling on his own from his MOTHER to the FATHER's hands. Cut back to MULDER's hospital room.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Take my hand. I am your father.

SCENE 2

(X-Files office. Morning. SCULLY is sitting at MULDER's desk asleep, glasses off, her head resting on her arm. Her laptop displays images from the hull of the ship in Africa. Someone enters. She wakes suddenly at the sound of his voice.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Sleep is a luxury, Agent Scully. A self-indulgence we have no time for. Nor does Agent Mulder.

(SCULLY closes the laptop defensively.)

SCULLY: How did you get in here?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Getting in is easy. It's what you do once you're inside that's key.

SCULLY: What's that supposed to mean?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: You are the only one with access to Mulder. I need you to use it wisely.

SCULLY: Like you? Almost killing him by shooting him full of Phenytoin for a few moments of lucidity.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: It's what Agent Mulder wanted. He knows what's wrong. What he wants now is to prove it. It's why he asked for me, not you.

SCULLY: I don't believe that.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Two years ago your partner was infected with a virus he claimed was alien. A virus reactivated in him by exposure to a source of energy also alien. Agent Mulder is living proof of what he tried so long to substantiate: the existence of alien life.

SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, it's killing him. And we have to get it out of him.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: (leaning close, threatening) You destroy this and I'll destroy you.

(The phone on the desk begins ringing. SCULLY and MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU stare at each other for a moment, then MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU leaves the office. SCULLY answers the phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) Agent Scully, you need to go to the hospital.

SCULLY: (on phone) Why? What happened?

SKINNER: (on phone) Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.



SCENE 3

(SCULLY bursts into MULDER's hospital room. SKINNER and another man, AGENT FLAGLER, are standing next to the empty bed.)

SCULLY: There were guards posted here. A man who's gravely ill doesn't just get up and disappear.

SKINNER: I know. I know.

SCULLY: How did this happen?

SKINNER: His mother checked him out.

SCULLY: His mother?

SKINNER: That's what they're saying.

SCULLY: Has anybody spoken with her?

SKINNER: I'm leaving that up to you. It's better I not be involved any further in this case.

(SKINNER starts to walk towards the door.)

SCULLY: Sir, this isn't just a case. This is Agent Mulder we're speaking about.

(He stops to speak to her.)

SKINNER: And I am trying to help him by staying out of this from now on.

SCULLY: Sir!

SKINNER: I'm in a compromised position. The less I know about Agent Mulder's whereabouts and yours the better.

(SKINNER leaves.)



SCENE 4

(The Dream Beach. MULDER, still sitting on the rock, shields his eyes from the glare of the sun. A BOY, about 8 years old, wearing a blue shirt and jean shorts, walks up to where MULDER is sitting. He speaks with CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's voice.)

BOY IN CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN'S VOICE: The child is father to the man.

(Cut to MULDER shielding his eyes from ...)



SCENE 5

( ... the headlights from oncoming traffic. Car. Rainy night. MULDER, still in his hospital gown and with his arms handcuffed in front of him wakes to find himself in a car driven by the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You've been asleep quite a while. I expect it'll be some time before your sleep patterns return to normal. Would you like an explanation?

MULDER: I'm not sure.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: While you were lying unconscious in the hospital this afternoon my doctors worked on you.

MULDER: Why?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: At some point I realized that if the Syndicate didn't kill you the FBI would. If the FBI didn't kill you your own misguided heroism would. There's really no way out for you. There's no way for you to cheat death except by disappearing.

MULDER: A man can't just disappear.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Oh, we've made entire cultures disappear. Like me, now, you'll... you'll become a man without a name. But even while you miss your former identity, you'll... you'll learn to love life's simpler pleasures.

MULDER: (holding up his cuffed hands) Well, that'll be kind of tough with these on.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: When you no longer want to run, those will come off. How do you feel?

MULDER: I feel better than I did. (sighs) I've got to tell Scully. I've got to tell her.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: If you do have contact with her you'll put her in danger. You're entering a kind of, uh, witness protection program, for want of a better term.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN lights two cigarettes in his mouth.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Can I offer you a cigarette?

MULDER: I don't smoke.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Maybe now you do.



SCENE 6

(SCULLY's apartment!!! How we have missed it. Fridge in the right place. Nice windows. SCULLY walks in tiredly and drops her keys on the kitchen table. She opens the refrigerator, then is startled by a sound in the living room. She pulls out her gun and aims it at a shadowed figure near the door.)

SCULLY: Don't move. Who's there?

(It is the old Native American man from 6x22, Biogenesis, and from the Anasazi trilogy before that.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: I don't mean to frighten you. Albert Hosteen.

SCULLY: (lowering the gun) What are you doing here? How did you get here?

ALBERT HOSTEEN: I'm sorry to surprise you.

SCULLY: Surprise? That you're standing here. The last time I saw you was in New Mexico. They'd taken you from the hospital. Your... your doctors feared the worst.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: I was hoping to see your partner.

SCULLY: He's missing.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You must save him.

SCULLY: He's very ill.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You must find him before something happens not only for his sake-- for the sake of us all.

(SCULLY is confused.)



SCENE 7

(Day. Suburban street. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and MULDER pull up in front of a nice house.)

MULDER: Where are we?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Home. This is your new life.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN holds out a key. After a moment MULDER takes it.)

MULDER: I don't understand.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN gets out of the car, then leans back in the window.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (pointing to the keys still in the ignition) You can drive away right now. Drive back to Scully and your X-Files and imminent death and I wouldn't be surprised if you did but I think you should take a look around. I mean, why leave something behind until you... until you know what it is you're leaving?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN walks off down the street. MULDER looks up at the house.)



SCENE 8

(Hospital security. SCULLY and AGENT FLAGLER are looking at security video footage.)

AGENT FLAGLER: Mulder was taken out of the hospital at just before 2:00 a.m. His mother's signature's on the hospital documents. It's her handwriting, she checked him out a.m.a; against medical advice. It's all legitimate, until you go to surveillance. This is the camera in the hall outside Mulder's room.

(We see black paint sprayed on each of the camera lenses obscuring the view of the surveillance area.)

AGENT FLAGLER: Here's inside his room. And two other cameras on the ward. We're guesstimating there were at least three others involved. Check this out. Where's Waldo? She's talking to someone.

(In the tiny bit of one frame not covered with the black paint we see TEENA MULDER talking to a man who is smoking a cigarette.)

SCULLY: Yeah. I know who that is.



SCENE 9

(Suburban house. MULDER knocks as he lets himself in.)

MULDER: Hello? Anybody home?

(MULDER, still handcuffed and wearing his hospital gown enters the house. No one is there. He walks through the very nice kitchen and opens the refrigerator. Inside, next to the regular food, are lots of bags of Spitz brand sunflower seeds. MULDER smiles.)

DEEP THROAT: They can change your name but they can't change the things you love.

(MULDER turns and sees DEEP THROAT standing behind him.)

MULDER: It can't be.

(DEEP THROAT chuckles.)

MULDER: You're dead.

DEEP THROAT: (laughs heartily) No. No, just really relaxed.

MULDER: Scully... saw you get shot... on the bridge six years ago. Sure, you're... dead.

(They hug, MULDER, grinning, doing the best he can while handcuffed.)

DEEP THROAT: One, uh, well-placed bullet... (pulls up his shirt to show the long healed wound) A punctuation mark in a man's life and you get to start a whole new chapter. I'm fine, son. Aside from a little tennis elbow.

(MULDER, sits, trying to take it all in. He is extremely happy.)

MULDER: I felt responsible for your death.

DEEP THROAT: You can let that go. Clearly, I'm alive.

MULDER: I thought that you died for my quest.

DEEP THROAT: Yes, along with Scully's sister and the man you thought was your father and Duane Barry and even Scully's mysterious illness and on and on and on. You can let go of all that guilt. I'm here to tell you that you're not the hub of the universe, the cause of life and death. We-- you and I-- we're... merely puppets in a master plan. No more, no less. You've suffered enough. Now you should enjoy your life. Let me show you something. (pulls out his wallet and shows pictures) That's my wife and daughters, we live just down the street. I hope... you'll visit us for dinner.

(Later, MULDER is sitting in the house in a chair with his eyes closed. A glass ashtray next to him is filled with sunflower seed husks. Cut to ... )



SCENE 10

(Dream beach. MULDER walks up to where the BOY is building a structure in the sand. A wave comes up and ruins the structure.)

MULDER: Hello.

(The BOY looks up at him, tears in his eyes. MULDER pats him on the shoulder comfortingly.)

MULDER: Hey, buddy, that's okay. You can build it again. Just start again. Okay?

(The BOY nods hopefully as MULDER brushes the tears off of his face. CUT TO ...)



SCENE 11

(Suburban house. Bedroom. MULDER, still handcuffed, but wearing pajama bottoms is lying in bed, thinking. He gets out of bed at the sound of the bedroom door opening.)

MULDER: Who's there? Who are you?

(Silhouetted in the doorway is DIANA FOWLEY wearing a black negligee. She walks toward MULDER.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Hundreds of little joys-- to open a door and have a woman beckon you in, to have her make a fire and lay the table for you and when it's late, to feel her take you into her arms.

(She holds up a key, and unlocks his handcuffs, then runs her hands seductively up his bare chest, then they embrace and begin kissing passionately.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 12

ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Teena Mulder. I'm not in to take your call. Please leave your message.

(SCULLY is in the X-Files office.)

SCULLY: (on phone) This is Dana Scully.

(An OFFICE COURIER hands her a large envelope.)

SCULLY: (whisper as the COURIER leaves) Thank you. (back into the phone) As before, you can reach me at your son's office at the FBI. Thank you.

(SCULLY hangs up and opens the envelope. Inside is a large book. "Native American Beliefs and Practices." She stares at it, then looks back at the envelope which says it is inter-departmental correspondence, but there is no origin listed. There is writing on the cover of the book that perfectly matches the writing on one of the panels of the ship that she has displayed on her laptop. She opens the book. Chapter Three IS TITLED: "The Anasazi - An Entire Native American Indian Culture Vanishes Without a Trace - History as Myth and end of the world symbolism. Apocalypse and The Sixth Extinction." SCULLY stares at the book in awe.)

(In his office, SKINNER answers the phone. Another man is in the office with him walking around the room, but we cannot see his face.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Skinner.

SCULLY: (on phone, quietly) Sir, did you send me this book?

SKINNER (on phone) Excuse me?

SCULLY: (on phone) This book. It explains everything that I found in Africa... using the same symbols that I found on the ship.

SKINNER: (on phone) Agent Scully, I asked you not to involve me in this.

SCULLY: (on phone) It's all here, sir-- a foretelling of mass extinction; a myth about a man who can save us from it. That's why they took Mulder. They think that his illness is a gift-- protection against the coming plague.

(SKINNER nervously and abruptly hangs up phone.)

(Cut to SCULLY entering SKINNER's ASSISTANT's office. SKINNER's ASSISTANT gets up and tries to intercept a very determined SCULLY on her way into SKINNER's office.)

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: I'm sorry, Agent Scully. The Assistant Director has given me express orders not to let you in.

(SCULLY steps around her and opens the door in time to see a long-haired man run out the other door to SKINNER's office leaving SKINNER leaning over his desk in pain. SKINNER groans, and SCULLY runs to him.)

SCULLY: Sir... Are you hurt? Are you cut? (to SKINNER's ASSISTANT) Get on the phone.

(SCULLY runs out into the hall after the man who slides a small handheld computer into a pocket. He is wearing black leather gloves. The hallway is crowded, and SCULLY has trouble keeping up with him.)

SCULLY: Hey! Stop that man!

(The man pulls the fire alarm and gets lost in the crowd. SCULLY is not happy - does some little disgusted hand wave thing.)



SCENE 13

(Morning. Suburban house. MULDER walks barefoot down the driveway to get the newspaper. He's wearing the same t-shirt and jeans as in his dream beach scenes. DIANA FOWLEY, wearing a very casual gray sweater set comes out the door holding a mug of coffee. MULDER smiles at her shyly.)

MULDER: Morning.

DIANA FOWLEY: What's wrong, Fox?

MULDER: (not sure about the situation) There's nothing wrong. Perfect. It's all perfect. What the hell am I doing here?

DIANA FOWLEY: (smiling) You just need some coffee.

MULDER: No. I'm serious. I have commitments-- to the X-Files, to Scully, to my sister...

DIANA FOWLEY: (sighs) You think you know what that means... commitment. It's all just childish, Fox.

MULDER: (staring at her) "Childish"?

DIANA FOWLEY: Yes. You've been a child... with only the responsibility of a child to your own dreams and fantasies but you won't know the true joy of responsibility until you plant your feet in the world... and become a father.

MULDER: Wow... (sighs and laughs nervously) Diana, if... you lay all this on me after I sleep with you one time what's it going to be like tomorrow?

DIANA FOWLEY: You have to let go, Fox.

MULDER: Just like that? I'm just supposed to slip into domestic bliss even after I was dropped off here by a man I have every reason to believe left here to carry on his dirty work.

DIANA FOWLEY: (soothing) Hey ... he lives the next block over. We'll go visit after breakfast.



SCENE 14

(There is an insistent knock at a door. MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU's apartment. He opens it and SCULLY bursts in.)

SCULLY: You told someone, didn't you? You let the information out.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: A man attacked Skinner in his office.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: For what?

SCULLY: For what he knows about Mulder.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I haven't told anyone.

(SCULLY closes the door, then sees a laptop on his table. She lifts the screen and sees copies of the photos of the inscriptions on the ship in Africa.)

SCULLY: (amazed) What is this? These are mine. You've hacked into my files. What are you doing with these?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: I was having them analyzed.

SCULLY: By whom?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: National Institutes of Health.

SCULLY: What?

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: The material you have there-- encrypted data that describes advanced human genetics-- where did you get it?

SCULLY: This was not supposed to go public.

(With about four keystrokes, SCULLY somehow manages to permanently delete the all the files off of the laptop.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: Wherever you got it that data supports what's happened to Mulder. It proves what he's become-- biologically alien.

(They stare at each other.)

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: What are you hiding?

SCULLY: (depressed) It doesn't matter.

MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU: It matters to someone. Whoever it is it sounds like they're looking for Mulder, too.

(Files finish deleting and SCULLY leaves.)



SCENE 15

(Suburban street. MULDER and DIANA FOWLEY knock at a door. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN opens the door and smiles.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I wasn't expecting you so soon. I thought you'd take a few days to settle in.

DIANA FOWLEY: I think you need to allay his unhappiness with things he perceives as left undone.

MULDER: Yeah, including why you live in a bigger house than I do.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN chuckles.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I've got quite a few mouths to feed-- three grandkids... and, uh... your sister. She's been living here all along... living a life you'd forsaken.

(He indicates a woman, SAMANTHA MULDER and her three young daughters playing in the driveway. It looks like they are teaching the youngest to ride a tricycle. They are all laughing. SAMANTHA looks up and smiles when she sees MULDER staring happily at her. She runs up to him and they embrace.)

SAMANTHA: He said you were coming.



SCENE 16

(Unknown location within the Department of Defense. Some kind of medical room. MULDER is now ... well ... on the cross. He is lying on a large medical-type of table lit from below that is in the shape of a cross. His body is on one long leg of the cross, and his arms are stretched out to either side and held down by bars from the ceiling as are his feet. His head is in the middle. On his head is some kind of monitoring device with many probes attached to his skull. A crown of thorns. He seems completely peaceful, eyes closed, unaware of his surroundings. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and DIANA FOWLEY stand beside him.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: A father has high hopes for his son but he never dreams his boy's going to change the world. I'm so proud of this man-- the depth of his capacity for suffering.

DIANA FOWLEY: Like father, like son.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: They think what he has is killing him but, in actuality, he's never been more alive.

DIANA FOWLEY: Do you think he dreams?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm sure he dreams.

DIANA FOWLEY: About what, I wonder.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The dreams all men who are owned by the world have-- a simpler life... full of small pleasures. Extraordinary men are always most tempted by the most ordinary things. Dreams are all he has now.



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(FBI Building corridor. SCULLY comes up behind DIANA FOWLEY who is waiting for the elevator.)

SCULLY: Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley?

DIANA FOWLEY: I don't smoke.

SCULLY: Really? I could swear I smell cigarette smoke on you.

DIANA FOWLEY: Let's cut the crap, shall we?

SCULLY: Yes. Let's.

(The two women enter an empty office.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

DIANA FOWLEY: Maybe before you go around blaming everyone you can find for what's happened to Mulder you could think about what you could've done to prevent it.

SCULLY: I just want you to think. Think of Mulder when you met him. Think of the promise and the life in front of him. Think of him now. And then try and stand there in front of me, look me in the eye and tell me Mulder wouldn't bust his ass trying to save you.

(What SCULLY has said has affected DIANA FOWLEY - slightly.)

DIANA FOWLEY: (tightly) I'm thinking, Agent Scully. I'm always thinking.

(DIANA FOWLEY walks past SCULLY and leaves the office.)



SCENE 18

(DOD medical room. MULDER still comatose on his cross. PROJECT DOCTOR and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN are in the room. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN sitting on the empty arm of the cross. His sleeve is rolled up and the PROJECT DOCTOR is prepping his arm for a needle.)

PROJECT DOCTOR: It's a chance none of us ever expected... let alone hoped for. After all these years trying to develop a compatible alien-human hybrid and to have one ready-made.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: All these years... all the questioning why... why keep Mulder alive? When it was so simple to remove the threat that he posed?

PROJECT DOCTOR: There was no way you could have predicted this.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The fact remains, he's become our savior. He's immune to the coming viral apocalypse. He's the hero here.

PROJECT DOCTOR: He may not survive the procedure.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Then he suffers a hero's fate.

(Camera closes in on MULDER, then cut to ... )



SCENE 19

(Inside the suburban house. Urgent sound of a heartbeat throughout scene. MULDER, wearing a tuxedo, turns and sees DIANA FOWLEY standing in a wedding gown.)

MULDER: Diana?

(He goes to her and lifts up the veil, then turns at the sound of her voice behind him. DIANA FOWLEY is entering from the bedroom, very very pregnant and smiling.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Fox? It's time, honey.

(No longer in the tuxedo, but still processing the quick change, MULDER turns at the sound of children. Another door in the house opens and MULDER sees two boys with DIANA FOWLEY.

DIANA FOWLEY: Hey, how you doing?

(They laugh and run past him. He playfully makes a grab for one of them, then catches sight of himself in the mirror. He now looks like he is in his mid-fifties. When he turns again, he sees DIANA FOWLEY, still young, lying dead in a coffin. He walks slowly to the coffin and leans his head and arm against it, wedding ring clearly visible. A hand touches his shoulder and he looks up to see CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, not looking any older. CUT TO ... )



SCENE 20

(In the DOD medical room. MULDER is still comatose. DIANA FOWLEY is stroking his cheek. Doctors are making preparations. )

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Don't think of the man... Think of the sacrifice he's making for all of us... for the world.

DIANA FOWLEY: It would've been nice to give him a choice.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You don't think Mulder would've chosen this? To become the thing he sought for so long? To feel what it's like? He is what he sought.

DIANA FOWLEY: We'll never know.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (taking off his jacket) Besides, his task is almost complete. I'll carry the burden from here on in.

(DIANA FOWLEY strokes MULDER's cheek again.)



SCENE 21

(Suburban house. MULDER, now in his eighties, is sitting in a chair. He looks very tired. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, still no older is talking to him.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I know about the boy. The boy on the beach. The vision you go to in your mind. We all have such places... born of memory and desire.

OLD MULDER: I've seen him thousands of times. I've never seen what he wants me to see.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Close your eyes. He's ready to show you if you're ready to see.

(With a smile, OLD MULDER complies. Cut to ... )



SCENE 22

(The Dream Beach. 39-year-old MULDER in jeans and a T-shirt walks over to the BOY who has finished a HUGE sand UFO, just like the one SCULLY found in Africa.)

MULDER: Wow. What did you make?

BOY: An unidentified flying object.

(The BOY jumps down from the top of the ship and begins kicking it apart.)

MULDER: Hey! What are... what are you doing? Why are you destroying your spaceship?

BOY: (accusing) It's your spaceship. You're destroying it. (throws a handful of sand at MULDER) You were supposed to help me.

(MULDER is speechless, watching the BOY destroy the ship.)



SCENE 23

(SCULLY enters her apartment, exhausted. She is startled by the presence of ALBERT HOSTEEN.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You're running out of time.

SCULLY: Why do you come to me like this? Why? When I can't find him.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You don't look in the right place.

SCULLY: I don't think you're hearing me.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: You don't know where he is?

SCULLY: Even if I did I wouldn't know how to save him. This science makes no sense to me.

ALBERT HOSTEEN: Have you looked for him here?

(He points to her chest, right above her heart.)

SCULLY: Are you asking me to pray?

(He gently pulls her down into a kneeling position beside him.)

ALBERT HOSTEEN: There are more worlds than the one you can hold in your hand.

(She kneels with him in the dark apartment.)



SCENE 24

(In the DOD medical room. Lots of DOCTORS getting ready. MULDER is still comatose, and now has a tube down his throat. Now CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is lying on the free arm of the cross, his head next to MULDER's. They are both prepped for surgery on their heads which are inches apart. DIANA FOWLEY stands next to CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN wearing medical scrubs.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I hope you see the poetry in this, Diana.

DIANA FOWLEY: You're removing genetic material that may kill your son.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We're forcing the next step in evolution to save man. We're doing God's work, Diana. Without this immunity, everyone would die. This knowledge is God's blessing. I'll carry on for Mulder from here.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN smiles and squeezes DIANA FOWLEY's hand. She looks upset.)



SCENE 25

(In the DOD medical room. MULDER is still comatose. DOCTORS are about to begin. MULDER opens his eyes.)

DIANA FOWLEY: Your patient's come out-- Mulder's awake.

DOCTOR 1: I've got him topped off, but he won't stay under.

DOCTOR 2: I don't think we can take him any further.

DOCTOR 1: Is he feeling any pain?

DOCTOR 2: Flat on the monitor. Any flatter, he'd be circling the drain.

DOCTOR 1: Okay... Let's do this thing.

(DOCTOR 2 pushes MULDER's eyes closed again, but they drift back open and seem to focus lazily on DIANA FOWLEY. He is awake, but somewhere else. As one of the doctors starts up a medical saw and goes for MULDER's head, DIANA FOWLEY takes off her mask and uses her keycard to leave the room. Focus on MULDER's distant expression as the saw gets louder, then CUT TO ... )



SCENE 26

(Suburban house bedroom. MULDER, now VERY OLD, is lying in bed. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN sits in a chair beside him. Dim light filters in through the red drapes over the window.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Rest now.

VERY OLD MULDER: Can you open the blind? I'd like to take a look outside.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I wanted you to have peace.

(VERY OLD MULDER's breathing is labored. He looks around, wanting something.)

VERY OLD MULDER: Where's Samantha?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Your sister died five years ago.

(VERY OLD MULDER is sad. Breathing is hard.)

VERY OLD MULDER: Where... What about Deep Throat?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We've been over this. He's dead. Diana's dead... and Scully.

(MULDER gasps in anguish.)

VERY OLD MULDER: Scully's dead?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: She's dead.

(MULDER begins to cry.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It's time for you to let go. They're waiting for you... if you let go. Close your eyes, Fox.

(MULDER sighs heavily.)

MULDER: We're the last, you and I.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The end... and the beginning.

(MULDER sighs.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: There's nothing to be done. Nothing at all.

(MULDER closes his eyes. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN goes to the window and opens the drapes. Outside is Apocalypse Now. Everything is in flames and fire rains down from the sky. An alien ship flies overhead. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN stands framed in the window, smoking a cigarette and not looking at all upset. Fire fades to ... )



SCENE 27

( ... someone setting fire to files and folders in an apartment. He tosses a long-haired wig into the flames also. With everything burning, he picks up a laptop and goes to the door. We see MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU lying dead on the floor of his apartment, then KRYCEK leaving, laptop under his arm.)



SCENE 28

(SCULLY's apartment. SCULLY is lying alone, still fully clothed with keys in hand, in the same place where she and ALBERT HOSTEEN had knelt the night before. The sound of footsteps and an envelope slid under the door wakes her. She picks up the envelope and opens it. Inside is a keycard for a door in the Department of Defense. MSF 1225 L1. SCULLY opens the door and quickly leaves her apartment.)



SCENE 29

(DOD medical room. MULDER's eyes are open and sad. There is a pool of blood beneath his head and DOCTORS are probing around in his brain. CUT TO ... )

(SCULLY walking cautiously through halls of DOD. She uses the card in a lock. It turns green, then CUT TO ....)

( ... SCULLY walking into the bedroom of VERY OLD MULDER. He reaches out eagerly and holds SCULLY's arm in his hand. He is weak, but is beaming at her, happy she is there.)

VERY OLD MULDER: Oh, Scully! I knew you'd come. They told me you were dead.

(SCULLY has no sympathy for him.)

SCULLY: And you believed them. Traitor.

VERY OLD MULDER: (confused) What?

SCULLY: Deserter. Coward.

VERY OLD MULDER: (hurt) Scully, don't... I'm dying.

SCULLY: You're not supposed to die, Mulder-- not here.

VERY OLD MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Not in a comfortable bed with the devil outside.

VERY OLD MULDER: No, you don't understand. He's taking care of me.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, he's lulled you to sleep. He's made you trade your true mission for creature comforts.

VERY OLD MULDER: There was no mission. There were no aliens.

SCULLY: No aliens. Have you looked outside, Mulder?

VERY OLD MULDER: I can't. I'm... too tired.

SCULLY: No, Mulder, you must get up. You must get up and fight... especially you. This isn't your place. Get up, Mulder. Get up and fight the fight.

(She drops his hand, turns and leaves the bedroom leaving VERY OLD MULDER gasping her name and trying to sit up to see where she went.)

VERY OLD MULDER: Scully... Where's Scully? Scully? Scully!

(He cannot see her. CUT TO ... )

(Green door light. SCULLY entering the DOD medical room. It is deserted except for MULDER still lying with his arms outstretched. Almost all the medical devices and tubes and monitors have been removed except a chest monitor. All he has is a small sheet over his hips and a white gauze bandage on his head. SCULLY quietly steps up beside him and touches his head. She whispers quietly.)

SCULLY: Mulder. Mulder, you've got to wake up. I've got to get you out of here. Mulder, can you understand me?

(MULDER's eyelids flicker slightly and he cries out at an image of his old self screaming in the medical restraints.)

SCULLY: (beginning to cry) Mulder, you've got to get up. I don't know how much time we have. You've got to get up, Mulder.

(Another flash of himself screaming.)

SCULLY: (whispering, pleading) No one can do it but you, Mulder. Mulder, help me. Please, Mulder.

(A tear rolls down her cheek and falls on his eyelid, then down his cheek as she lets her face fall onto his shoulder. MULDER opens his eyes and clears his throat. His voice is raw.)

MULDER: (weakly) You... help... me.

(He wraps his arms around her as she tenderly supports his neck and head.)



SCENE 30
ONE WEEK LATER

(MULDER's apartment building. SCULLY, in some fabulous heels, walks down the hall and knocks at MULDER's door. They seem to have a new secret knock. He opens it wearing a half-buttoned shirt with a tie under the collar. His head is still bandaged and he is wearing a New York Yankees ball cap over the gauze. He is very happy to see her.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here? Actually, I was just getting dressed to come see you but I... I couldn't find a tie to go with my victory cap.

(SCULLY reaches up and takes the cap off of his head.)

SCULLY: Mulder, no work. You have to go back to bed.

(She starts to pull the tie away, but he grabs it back playfully.)

MULDER: Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner.

(MULDER chuckles at his joke, and SCULLY smiles.)

MULDER: Scully, I, um... I was coming down... to work to tell you that Albert Hosteen is dead. He died last night in New Mexico. He'd been in a coma for two weeks. There was... no way he could have been in your apartment.

SCULLY: (insistent) He was there-- we... we prayed together. Mulder, I don't believe that. I... I don't believe it. It's impossible.

MULDER: Is it any more impossible than what you saw in Africa or what you saw in me?

SCULLY: (about to cry) I don't know what to believe anymore. Mulder, I was so determined to find a cure to save you that I could deny what it was that I saw and now I don't even know... I don't know... I don't know what the truth is ... I don't know who to listen to. I don't know who to trust.

(Pause. She is now crying.)

SCULLY: Diana Fowley was found murdered this morning. I never trusted her... but she helped save your life just as much as I did. She gave me that book. It was her key that led me to you. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I know she was your friend.

(She puts her arms around his shoulders and they hold each other.)

MULDER: Scully, I was like you once-- I didn't know who to trust. Then I... I chose another path... another life, another fate, where I found my sister. The end of my world was unrecognizable and upside down. There was one thing that remained the same.

(He holds her face and gazes at her.)

MULDER: You... were my friend, and you told me the truth. Even when the world was falling apart, you were my constant... my touchstone.

SCULLY: And you are mine.

(They move their faces close together ... and SCULLY kisses him on the forehead. Not a peck. A very nice, sweet, long kiss. They pull slightly apart, still touching. SCULLY puts his ball cap back on his head and cups his face in her hands. They look at each other with every bit of trust, friendship, respect, love, and whatever else these two have for each other. Then she touches his lips gently with her fingers and leaves. MULDER stands in the doorway and closes his eyes.)



SCENE 31

(Beach. 39-year-old MULDER and the BOY are laughing as together they put the finishing touches on another huge sand UFO.)

[THE END]

                       HUNGRY


SCENE 1
COSTA MESA, CALIFORNIA
12:04 AM

(Outside the Lucky Boy fast food restaurant. Not a four star place. An older model car driven by HUNGRY GUY, mid-twenties surfer-dude, pulls up to the drive-thru speaker decorated with a REALLY scary looking plastic guy. (HUNGRY GUY turns down his radio.)

HUNGRY GUY: Hello? Hello! (the exterior lights are turned off) Hey! I'm sitting here, dude!

MALE VOICE: Sorry. We're closed.

HUNGRY GUY: Uh-uh. I was here before you turned off the light. Grandfather clause, man. I need a super patty, double with cheese...

MALE VOICE: The light was a mistake. We're closed. Sorry.

HUNGRY GUY: The light was on! How bad do you want this job? 'Cause I'll call the head office right now. Super patty. Double. With cheese. Supersize fries. Supersize Diet Sprite.

(No response. HUNGRY GUY honks the horn impatiently.)

MALE VOICE: Drive through, please.

(HUNGRY GUY revs the engine and pulls forward to the window. No one is visible inside the restaurant. He sits for about 10 seconds drumming his fingers to the heavy metal on the radio.)

HUNGRY GUY: What the hell is this? (yelling up to the closed window) Customer service, man. Stop spanking it and get my food.

(HUNGRY GUY hears loud chewing noises coming from inside the restaurant. HUNGRY GUY is a little concerned.)

HUNGRY GUY: Hey, in there. Guy?

(Sound of heavy breathing. HUNGRY GUY stands up in the seat of his car and leans in through the drive-thru window and looks around. Suddenly, he is jerked inside. We hear his screams and more slurping noises. One of the sandles jerked from his feet lands on the road as the car rolls out into the street, hits the curb on the opposite side and stops.)

SCENE 2
THREE DAYS LATER

(Day. Outside the Lucky Boy an old small import car pulls up. ROB ROBERTS, young ordinary looking man, gets out. He is wearing a uniform. He puts on a paper hat and speaks to himself.)

ROB ROBERTS: You... are your own man and you control everything you do.

(He enters the busy restaurant's kitchen area.)

ROB ROBERTS: Hey, yo, Derwood.

(DERWOOD SPINKS, late twenties, is opening a box.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Hey, Rob.

ROB ROBERTS: Hey, Mr. Rice.

(MR. RICE, the manager of the store is a pleasant looking man.)

MR. RICE: How's it going, Rob?

ROB ROBERTS: Have a good one, Lucy.

(LUCY, another worker, is on her way out.)

LUCY: You, too, Rob.

(ROB takes his place behind the register. Sound of a siren outside. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

ROB ROBERTS: Welcome to Lucky Boy. May I take your order?

MULDER: Yeah, we'll have it our way.

(MULDER and SCULLY both show their badges. Very cool. I love this show.)

SCULLY: FBI. Special Agents Scully and Mulder. We'd like a word with your manager, please.

MR. RICE: Well, that's me. How can I help you?

SCULLY: Sir, would you do us a favor and gather your employees, please?

LUCY: Well, what's going on?

MULDER: We're investigating a murder. A car was found in a reservoir ten miles from here. A body was found in the trunk of that car.

MR. RICE: What does that have to do with us?

SCULLY: Well, this was also found in the car. (holds up a blood-splattered button) It's a badge that's only given to employees. Is that correct?

MR. RICE: Yeah, "free fer" Fridays -- it's our promotion where you buy one superpatty and get one free. But look -- there's four Lucky Boys in Costa Mesa alone and something like 30 in Orange County.

SCULLY: Thirty-two.

MULDER: Yeah, long day. So let's make this quick. Does everybody have their button?

ROB ROBERTS: We only wear them on Fridays. For "free fer" Fridays.

MULDER: Yeah, but does everybody have their button?

(All employees hold up their button. Except ROB ROBERTS. MULDER nods at him, ROB pulls it out of his uniform pocket. MULDER spots someone button-less in the back of the crowd.)

MULDER: Hey, uh, you... back there, what's your name?

DERWOOD SPINKS: Derwood Spinks.

MULDER: Derwood. Do you have your button, Derwood?

DERWOOD SPINKS: Uh, no, I must have left it at home on account of we're supposed to only wear them on Fridays.

(The other employees look at him suspiciously.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Well, I sure as hell didn't leave it on no dead guy.

SCULLY: I don't believe that we said the victim was male.

MULDER: We're going to ask everybody to step outside right now while we take a quick look around the premises.

ROB ROBERTS: Who was the victim?

MULDER: His name was Donald Edward Pankow. Does that ring a bell?

ROB ROBERTS: No.

(MULDER stares at him.)

(The employees have gathered outside leaving MULDER and SCULLY alone in the restaurant. They all look at DERWOOD SPINKS.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: I'm going to get some cigarettes.

(He removes his paper hat and walks off.)

MR. RICE: I guess I'd better call the corporate headquarters and find out what they want us to do.

(RICE walks off and the other employees start to talk among themselves. ROB ROBERTS sneaks over to the restaurant's window and peeks in on MULDER and SCULLY inside.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, check it out. You know how they say you never want to see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurants?

SCULLY: Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy would make that list.

MULDER: My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others. Don't you think?

(ROB ROBERTS goes over to the drive-thru window, reaches in and turns on the speaker, then goes to the outdoor speaker to listen to MULDER and SCULLY's conversation.)

SCULLY: I guess. So what are you saying, Mulder? This place has been scrubbed from top to bottom to cover up evidence?

MULDER: Maybe. Maybe I'm thinking this was the crime scene.

SCULLY: You're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain very neatly removed from his skull right here in this kitchen?

MULDER: It had to happen somewhere.

SCULLY: But next to the shake machine, Mulder? I think that we should be checking out employee lockers and not entertaining the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here.

MULDER: I wouldn't exactly call it surgery. What if this man's brain was eaten?

(SCULLY gives him a look.)

MULDER: I-it's not sociologically unheard of. There are certain tribes in New Guinea that consider human brains a delicacy.

SCULLY: Yeah, but Mulder, we're in Orange County.

MULDER: Yeah, what's your point?

(Another look.)

MULDER: It's just that nothing about the way the body was dumped suggests a fetishistic killing. The brain wasn't removed intact. What if this man's brain was eaten right out of his skull?

SCULLY: (skeptically) Through an inch-and-a-half opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw?

MULDER: Well, maybe it was cut. Maybe it was punched. What look like tool marks to you look to me like something more organic. Like it was made by a... a tongue or a proboscis.

SCULLY: The proboscis of what?

MULDER: I don't know.

(MULDER looks underneath a counter and sees a smear of red.)

MULDER: Oh. Hello. Look at this. Does that look like blood to you?

(SCULLY crouches down next to him.)

SCULLY: Yes, it looks like it.

(MULDER sees another goopy substance under the counter.)

MULDER: What is that? Next to it. Is that, uh... oh, my... ugh. Is that brain? Is that brain matter there?

SCULLY: No, I'd say that's ground beef.

MULDER: Ground beef.

SCULLY: Yeah.



SCENE 3

(ROB ROBERTS comes home to his apartment. It is very nice, clean, and well kept. He takes off his uniform, hangs it over a chair, and goes into the bathroom and removes a bloody shirt from where it has been soaking in the tub. It is obviously ruined. He releases the water and places the shirt in a plastic bag. There is knocking at the door. He sets the bag down on the floor next to the white carpet in the living room. ROB looks through the door's peephole and we see MULDER framed in the hole's circle.)

MULDER: Rob Roberts? (voice) It's Agent Mulder.

(He opens the door.)

MULDER: Hello, again. Sorry to bother you at home.

ROB ROBERTS: No. No bother.

MULDER: (walking in) Can I come in?

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah, sure.

MULDER: Great, great.

ROB ROBERTS: Uh, what... what can I do for you?

MULDER: You live here alone?

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah, it's just me.

MULDER: Uh-huh. Mom or girlfriend?

ROB ROBERTS: What?

MULDER: Come on, man, who cleans up after you?

ROB ROBERTS: Neither. It's just me I-I live here alone.

MULDER: Well, bravo. You know, they say single guys are just bears who own furniture, (smiles) but... I mean, my place... Oh, but here... you can smell the Pine-Sol.

ROB ROBERTS: Thanks. Can I, can I get you anything?

MULDER: Yeah, a cheeseburger and a large order of fries. (smiles) Heh. It's a bad joke. I'm sorry. (pulls out notebook) Um... Mr. Rice, your manager? He told me that, uh... you stayed late on Friday? Is that right?

ROB ROBERTS: Oh, yeah, sure. Friday. The freezer had died on us. I stayed after to throw out the meat that was going bad.

MULDER: Yeah, did you volunteer to close?

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah.

MULDER: Yeah, okay. You volunteered.

(ROB sees a trickle of bloody water seeping out of the bag toward the white carpet.)

MULDER: (making a note) Volunteered... um... the, uh... the 35 pounds of ground chuck that Mr. Rice told you to throw away. What did you do with that?

ROB ROBERTS: I threw it out.

MULDER: Where?

ROB ROBERTS: In the dumpster behind the restaurant.

MULDER: Hmm. That's weird. Because that's what I figured you did, so I checked the dumpster and it was empty, which is weird because it only gets cleaned out on Thursday and you would have thrown away the meat on Friday so you'd expect the meat to be there, right?

ROB ROBERTS: Mm-hmm.

MULDER: I don't see how that's relevant to this murder case anyway. Let me see if there's anything else I wanted to ask you.

(MULDER checks his notes as ROB looks at the blood from the bag.)

MULDER: Blood. (ROB whips his head back to MULDER) You're, you're bleeding. (points to ROB's bleeding lip.)

ROB ROBERTS: I-I bit my lip.

MULDER: Mmm. I think that just about wraps it up for me here.

(They walk towards the door, ROB holds it open for MULDER.)

ROB ROBERTS: Oh, hey. I, uh... I hope you catch the guy, huh?

MULDER: Yeah. No, I already got a pretty good idea who it is. Thanks.

(ROB nervously shuts the door behind MULDER. Outside, the garbage truck lifts up and empties a can. ROB runs out down the stairs and flings the bloody bag into the truck. He sees blood on his fingers, sucks it off hungrily, then sees a maroon car sitting by the curb. A man who looks just like David Duchovny, STEVE KIZIAK, Duchovny's double, is sitting behind the wheel. ROB looks at him. KIZIAK rolls down his car window.)

STEVE KIZIAK: What do you want?

ROB ROBERTS: Uh... Nothing.

STEVE KIZIAK: So take a hike.

(Back in his apartment, watching the maroon car, ROB hears the phone rings. He lets the machine pick up.)

WOMAN'S VOICE: Uh, hi. This is a message for Rob Roberts. My name is Dr. Mindy Rinehart and I'm a licensed mental health counselor with the Lucky Boy Corporation's employee assistance program. I'm talking to all of the employees at your restaurant about the recent unpleasantness that occurred there. Rob, I'd love for you to come down to my office at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. As it is a requirement of your employer's insurance provider this meeting is mandatory. I'm in the Irvine Medical Park, Suite 308. Have a good evening.

(As the voice message records, ROB ROBERTS notices another bite on his lip, rolls his eyes and goes into his bathroom where he wipes the blood away with a piece of toilet paper. He then proceeds to remove his false teeth. Three small and VERY sharp teeth land in the sink. He doubles over as we hear his stomach growling. He looks at himself in the mirror. Next we see a videotape called "Get Motivated" being shoved into a VCR and Play being pushed. A MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER starts to talk on the tape as ROB rubs his stomach, walks over to a table and grabs a box of mint flavoured Slim-Chew Appetite Suppressant Gum. He eats a few and then empties the whole box into his mouth.)

MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: Self-discipline. Huh. That's the name of this game. That's the one thing that separates us from the animals-- provided you have it. But where do you get it? You can't go down to the local convenience store and buy self-discipline. You can't order it over the Internet. So... where does it come from? True story. I used to weigh 356 pounds.

(TV audience whistles. ROB walks over to the window, peeks through the blinds and sees STEVE KIZIAK sitting in his car smoking a cigarette. ROB then goes to sit down with the TV screen showing over his shoulder.)

MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: Do you believe that? Well, it's true. I lived to eat, ladies and gentlemen. My entire life revolved around eating because I was always hungry! My appetite was controlling me. Four-star restaurants, Denny's-- it didn't matter. And it didn't stop. It didn't stop till I took charge of my own life. It didn't stop until I put on the brakes and I said, "whoa...

ROB ROBERTS AND MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER: "...Ricardo, you are your own man and you control everything that you do."

(Night. Outside, STEVE KIZIAK is still sitting and smoking in his car. He tosses a butt out the window as he sees ROB coming up to him.)

STEVE KIZIAK: (to himself) Oh, brother. (to ROB) What?

(ROB growls, hisses, rolls his head, his shark-teeth pop out and he lunges for the car window. Cut to black.)



SCENE 4

(ROB's apartment. ROB is asleep on the couch. A foot is placed on his chest, waking him up.)

ROB ROBERTS: What?! ... Derwood... how did you get in here?

DERWOOD SPINKS: (He holds up some lock-picking tools) It's a little skill I picked up in Chino. I did a nickel for attempted murder. You didn't know I was an ex-con? (ROB shakes his head.) Yeah, nobody at work did. Not until this FBI murder investigation whipped everybody up into a froth.

(DERWOOD removes his foot from ROB's chest and ROB sits up.)

ROB ROBERTS: Derwood, what can I do for you?

DERWOOD SPINKS: You know I got fired last night? Stupid little pissant job where they make you wear a paper hat-- and they fired me. Plus, as far as that, uh, redheaded FBI Agent's concerned I'm the prime suspect in this murder. But that's no skin off my nose seeing as you did it.

(He holds up and shakes a bottle of prescription drugs.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Diet pills. Yours, right? See, I found them when I opened up on Saturday morning. I didn't give them back 'cause I figured, hey, free speed, right? But then there's this whole flap about a murder and I notice this.

(There is a spot of what looks like dried blood and a partial fingerprint on the cap of the bottle.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: That ain't ketchup, man.

ROB ROBERTS: (nervously) What-what do you want, Derwood?

DERWOOD SPINKS: I don't know. What do you got? (he starts to walk casually around the apartment) TV, VCR... Ah, it's all crappy off-brand stuff but you know, I'll take that and whatever money you got in the bank and you get this and I keep my mouth shut and, just maybe, you can blow town before the long arm of the law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads.

(Someone knocks at the door.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Maybe not. (whispers to ROB before he opens the door) Cup 'em.

(DERWOOD opens the door for the landlady, SYLVIA JASSY. She is an older, slightly overweight woman.)

SYLVIA JASSY: Hi. Rob? I hate to bother you, but, uh... last night in the front of the building there was a man in a parked car for hours. Did you happen to see him? It was a maroon car. He was pretty clean-cut, so I didn't call the police but he was still there when I went to bed.

ROB ROBERTS: Gee, Sylvia, I don't know what to tell you.

SYLVIA JASSY: He's gone now, but just, you know, keep your eyes out in case he comes back.

ROB ROBERTS: You got it.

SYLVIA JASSY: Thanks.

(She leaves and DERWOOD closes the door.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: So, I'll call you tonight and let you know where to drop off my new VCR. Oh, and don't try skipping town. (He shakes the bottle of pills and smiles.) You won't get too far.

(DERWOOD leaves. Soon after, ROB leaves and goes to his car. MULDER is parked behind him.)

MULDER: (casually, Columbo style) Hey, just the man I wanted to see. How are you this morning, Rob?

ROB ROBERTS: Fine.

MULDER: I'm glad I caught you. Oh, hey, I was just driving to your apartment and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here. He wasn't coming from your place by any chance, was he?

ROB ROBERTS: No, no. I haven't seen him.

MULDER: Good. I'd stay away from him. He's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.

ROB ROBERTS: You think he did it?

MULDER: Me? No. No, I should say that's the opinion of the Costa Mesa police. (he winks.) And my partner.

ROB ROBERTS: So he's-he's not your guy.

MULDER: No, I think we're looking for somebody who has a compulsion to kill... Who truly can't help himself. Oh, quick question: the, uh... the meat that you threw in the dumpster.

ROB ROBERTS: What about it?

MULDER: The dumpster had a padlock.

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah.

MULDER: Who would have the key?

ROB ROBERTS: We do, and the trucking company does.

(MULDER nods and starts back to his car.)

ROB ROBERTS: Hey-hey, wait. What-what's your point?

MULDER: (enigmatically) I'm just tying up some loose ends.



SCENE 5
IRVINE MEDICAL PARK

(DR. MINDY RINEHART's office. ROB enters hesitantly. She is a young pleasant blonde woman.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Good, you got my message, Rob, I appreciate you coming. This will be really informal. There you go. (She indicates a chair and ROB sits down.) I want to run through some things with you, but we don't stand on ceremony here so if there's anything that you want to talk about just go ahead and blurt it out okay, okay? It hasn't been a run-of-the-mill week so far, has it?

ROB ROBERTS: No.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: The police have been at the restaurant and the FBI. I'm sure this has been a very stressful time for you.

ROB ROBERTS: Pretty much.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: So we want to keep on top of any potential problems that these stresses might cause for you. So let's run through some standard questions together.

(ROB's stomach growls loudly.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob, have you been troubled recently by insomnia? (ROB shakes his head.) Bad dreams or nightmares?

(The stomach growling continues as ROB shakes his head again.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Have you felt emotionally numb? Do you ever see things that aren't there? Do you hear voices?

(ROB stares at her forehead in a trance, his heartbeat the only sound we can hear.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Tell me, Rob, do you feel ...

ROB ROBERTS: This... this murder... this murder that happened.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Yes?

ROB ROBERTS: What kind of a monster would do something like that?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: I don't believe in monsters. But I do believe in people and sometimes they do terrible things out of weakness or sickness or fear but I do truly believe that deep down inside even the worst of us wants to be good. Rob, is there anything that's troubling you that you'd like to talk about?

(He looks like he wants to wants to answer. Her phone rings. Irritated, she goes to answer it.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: I'm sorry. I though I put that on voice mail. (on phone) Mindy Rinehart. Yes, Agent Mulder, what can I do for you? No, I'm afraid I can't do that. I'm sorry, but it would violate patient confidentiality.

ROB ROBERTS: I, uh...

(ROB gets up and is leaving the room.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: (on phone) Excuse me, Agent. (to ROB) Rob?

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah. I have to go to work now.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Would you please call me later so that we could finish our talk?

(ROB leaves the room.)



SCENE 6

(Lucky Boy restaurant. ROB is working the grill. He has several hamburger patties on the grill. At one point he glances at them and they all look like little human brains. He closes his eyes to clear the image. DERWOOD SPINKS enters the restaurant.)

MR. RICE: You shouldn't be here, Derwood. We would have mailed you your last check.

DERWOOD SPINKS: Just give me my money, Rice.

(MR. RICE leaves to get the check, DERWOOD SPINKS comes over to ROB.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: How you doing, killer? You better have some money for me, too, huh?

(MR. RICE hands DERWOOD SPINKS his check.)

MR. RICE: There. Now, please leave.

DERWOOD SPINKS: With pleasure, pal. (he opens it and looks at the amount.) Boy, I ought to just make happy hour. (he starts to leave.) Uh, since this is farewell, when nobody was looking I used to dip my boys in the cole slaw.

(The staff and the customer at the counter groan as he takes a bite of the cole slaw.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Bon appetit.



SCENE 7
DERWOOD SPINKS' RESIDENCE

(ROB is looking through DERWOOD's house. He finds a bottle of pills, but it is a prescription in DERWOOD's name. He throws it to the ground in disgust. He then hears the sound of a motorcycle outside. ROB hides. DERWOOD enters and looks around at the disarray. He slowly picks up his baseball bat.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: If somebody's still in here, you're in a world of hurt!

(DERWOOD steps on the bottle of pills.)

DERWOOD SPINKS: Rob... (he pulls ROB's pills out of his pocket and rattles the bottle.) You looking for these? Deal's off, buddy. Remember that guy you iced? Pankow? I just heard he didn't have a brain in his head. You're one sick little freak, man. You got a lot of problems. If I were the FBI, I'd want you real bad. Public enemy number one and all that. Lots of reward money. So I'm going to turn you in myself... lucky boy.

(In the closet, ROB is hiding. As DERWOOD speaks, ROB pulls off his ears and removes his teeth and contact lenses. DERWOOD opens the closet door, sees ROB as he really is, and ROB attacks him with a flash tongue to the skull, splattering his white face in blood.)



SCENE 8

(DR. MINDY RINEHART's office. ROB ROBERTS knocks on her door. She smiles when she sees it's him.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob.

ROB ROBERTS: Hi. You said we should finish talking.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Come in.

(He walks in and they sit.)

ROB ROBERTS: I think I need help.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Tell me why you think that.

ROB ROBERTS: I have compulsions to eat. I get hungry and I try to put it off for as long as I can but then, finally, I just... I get so hungry that I can't help myself, and...

DR. MINDY RINEHART: You binge then purge? You eat too much and then cause yourself to vomit?

ROB ROBERTS: No. I just eat.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: But this makes you feel bad?

ROB ROBERTS: I guess it makes me feel like I'm not a good person.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob, there are so many different kinds of eating disorders. Men and women from every walk of life suffer from them but if there's one thing that they all have in common it's low self-esteem. (ROB rolls his eyes as she gets up. She comes back with a hand-held mirror.) And it's a shame because low self-esteem can be like a fun-house mirror. It reflects back a warped and ugly image of ourselves. What do you think Cindy Crawford would look like in a fun-house mirror?

ROB ROBERTS: Weird? Ugly?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: And how would the most handsome man in the world look? How would, say, Peter Jennings look in a fun-house mirror?

ROB ROBERTS: Ugly.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: And how do you look in this mirror? Do you think that looks like a bad person? An unworthy person? I'll tell you what I see. I see a nice smile... I see soulful brown eyes... I see good. Now, Rob, I want you to keep looking into this mirror until you see the same things that I do.

(As she walks away, ROB fixes his hair as he looks in the mirror and his hand brushes against one of his fake ears causing it to fall off. He hastily sticks it back on before she can see.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: There's a meeting that I'd like you to attend tonight. It's every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Now, you can talk to me anytime you want but these people are the best. They can really help you.

(She hands him a piece of paper which reads:

Overeaters Anonymous
817 Fairview Rd.
Costa Mesa

7PM
M - W - F)

ROB ROBERTS: I have to go.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: You always hurry away.

ROB ROBERTS: (indicating the paper) I appreciate it. And I want you to understand that I really am trying to do right.



SCENE 9

(As ROB enters his apartment building his stomach growls. He pops some pills in his mouth and swallows them as he begins walking up the stairs. SYLVIA JASSY is on her way down the stairs carrying a basket of laundry.)

SYLVIA JASSY: Hey, Rob, you didn't tell me you had a friend in the FBI.

ROB ROBERTS: What?

SYLVIA JASSY: He's upstairs. I told him all about that strange man in the maroon car and he said he'd look in to it.

(She walks down the rest of the stairs toward her apartment. ROB starts up the stairs and is stopped by the sight of MULDER at the top.)

MULDER: Afternoon, Rob.

(ROB turns to go back downstairs, but SCULLY is coming up. ROB is trapped.)

SCULLY: Sir, may we speak with you?

(MULDER, SCULLY, and ROB are now in ROB's apartment with ROB seated on the couch, SCULLY seated closest to him in a chair and MULDER perched on a table by the wall.)

SCULLY: Derwood Spinks has disappeared.

MULDER: His car is gone along with some personal belongings.

SCULLY: My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning. At that time, you told Agent Mulder that you hadn't seen Mr. Spinks. Is that correct?

ROB ROBERTS: (He nods.) I don't even know him that well. If he was going to leave town he wouldn't come tell me about it.

MULDER: Who said he left town?

ROB ROBERTS: I don't know. Isn't that what you think happened?

MULDER: No, no, no. Personally, I think he's dead. I can't speak for my partner but I think that whatever it was that killed Donald Pankow also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks.

ROB ROBERTS: What do you mean, "whatever it was"?

MULDER: I'll let you in on a little secret. (He gets up from the edge of the table he was seated on and crouches by ROB.) We've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now but Donald Pankow's brain was missing from his skull. My partner was able to find something that was previously undetected. It was the tip of what can only be described as a tiny shark's tooth embedded deep in the bone. I think we're looking for some kind of genetic freak-- a carnivorous predator as yet unidentified. A monster, if you will.

ROB ROBERTS: There's no such thing.

MULDER: Don't you believe it. This thing definitely qualifies. It has a biological imperative to eat. I think it even ate that ground chuck you threw away.

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah? Why?

MULDER: Because it can't kill with impunity and it knows it. It knows that the more it feeds on humans the closer it gets to getting caught but the hunger is always there. And it satisfies it any way it can.

(ROB laughs nervously.)

ROB ROBERTS: I'm sorry, but this is like good cop, insane cop.

(MULDER smiles.)

ROB ROBERTS: Why are you telling me all of this?

MULDER: I think you know why.

SCULLY: Thank you, Mr. Roberts. We'll contact you if we have any further questions.

MULDER: Watch out for that monster.

(As they leave, ROB looks at the info for the OA meeting that DR. MINDY RINEHART gave him.)



SCENE 10

(ROB enters an Overeaters Anonymous meeting of about 30 people. A woman is speaking at a podium at the front of the room.)

WOMAN AT OA: Devil's food with the white sugar frosting. It is, like, deliver me from evil.

(Others laugh. She sees ROB.)

WOMAN AT OA: Come on in. Come on. (ROB nods and takes a seat.) So I baked three dozen of these for my daughter's school fund-raiser and at 3:00 in the morning the night before there they are-- all three dozen of them, lined up and calling to me. Well, you know, in the past, there'd have been a good chance I'd have gone through every single last one of them. But this night...

(ROB's stomach starts to growl and as he bends over to try and calm it, a hand touches his hand on his knee. He looks up to see his landlady, SYLVIA, seated next to him.)

SYLVIA: (quietly) Small world, huh?

WOMAN AT OA: ...I laid in bed thinking about these meetings...

SYLVIA: Is this your first time at a meeting?

ROB: Yeah.

WOMAN AT OA: ...I got one six-ounce plain yogurt and ate it.

(Applause.)

WOMAN AT OA: Thank you. Does anybody else have anything they want to share?

SYLVIA: (to ROB) Do you feel up to introducing yourself? Everybody's really nice.

WOMAN AT OA: Anyone?

SYLVIA: Don't be scared; it helped me.

(ROB goes up to the podium. Applause.)

ROB ROBERTS: Uh, hi. My name is Robert Roberts. People call me Rob.

ALL: Hi, Rob.

(ROB's speech gradually grows in passion and intensity.)

ROB ROBERTS: I have an eating disorder. I'm definitely a meat-eater, not a vegetarian. I've always had these cravings my whole life and just... just recently, the last month or so they've just become too powerful to resist.

SYLVIA: Tell us about it.

ROB ROBERTS: I guess it's the taste I respond to the most-- salty and juicy. (A woman in the audience nods and smiles, a man behind her nods, licks his lips and rubs his stomach.) Kind of buttery. The texture of it inside of your mouth... You know, your teeth just sink into it like this juicy cloud, and it tastes so good you don't... You don't even want to swallow it. You just want to work it around your taste buds until your eyes roll right back into your head.

(He looks at the back of a man's bald head as he turns to talk to SYLVIA. The man's brain appears to throb in his head. ROB closes his eyes and swallows. Everyone is now staring at him.)

ROB ROBERTS: Anyway, it's a real problem.



SCENE 11

(Later, ROB and SYLVIA are coming up the steps of their building. They are both laughing.)

ROB ROBERTS: Wait a minute. Your ex-husband did what?

SYLVIA: He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car-- that I'd just mess up the springs. So I sat on the hood and I bounced.

(They laugh.)

SYLVIA: And I didn't stop until the police showed up. They sided with me.

(They both laugh some more.)

ROB ROBERTS: Hey, thank you, Sylvia.

SYLVIA: Good night, Rob.

ROB ROBERTS: Good night, Sylvia.

(SYLVIA closes her door and ROB starts toward his apartment, but then his stomach growls. He struggles, then goes reluctantly back to SYLVIA's door and knocks and removes his teeth.)

SYLVIA: (Inside the apartment) I'll be right there.



SCENE 12

(Next morning. Garbage truck arrives and picks up the garbage. SYLVIA's body falls into the truck as ROB watches. ROB, with a towel in his hand, picks up a baseball bat with D. SPINKS etched on it, goes out of his apartment, closes the door, then breaks in yelling and trashes the place.)

MAN: (voice) What the hell is going on?!

ROB ROBERTS: Oh, my God! Call the police!

WOMAN: (voice) Is everything okay?

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are investigating the "crime scene." MULDER looks at the baseball bat.)

MULDER: Mr. Derwood Spinks. Alive and well. (ROB nods. MULDER walks over and sits next to ROB on the couch.) I'm confused, Rob. Was he helping you redecorate?

ROB ROBERTS: I lied to you before.

SCULLY: About what?

ROB ROBERTS: Derwood was... was coming from my place the morning you saw him. He said if I spoke to you, he'd kill me.

SCULLY: What didn't he want you to tell us?

ROB ROBERTS: Last Friday night he hung out while I was cleaning out the freezer. He told me to go home. He said he'd finish up. I didn't know why the hell he was being so nice to me, but... when I got home I realized I had the key to the dumpster. And when I drove back... I saw him cleaning up all this blood.

MULDER: You must have been very scared.

ROB ROBERTS: I was. But you know, I should have... told the truth from the start.

(MULDER shows ROB a picture of the guy who was in the maroon car who looks just like david duchovny. The brochure says:

Steve Kiziak
Private Investigator
Surveillance A Specialty)

MULDER: Do you recognize this guy?

ROB ROBERTS: No.

MULDER: He's a private eye. Sylvia Jassy's ex-husband hired him to spy on her. But now this Steve Kiziak has gone missing.

SCULLY: He was last seen parked outside your apartment. You didn't notice him?

ROB ROBERTS: No, I didn't notice anything.

MULDER: Well, maybe we should check with Sylvia again.

ROB ROBERTS: I don't think she's home.

MULDER: Well, we'll track her down. (He gets up to leave with SCULLY. As he closes the door behind him, he says ...) Don't worry, Rob, it won't be long now.



SCENE 13

(ROB's apartment. ROB is frantically packing. DR. MINDY RINEHART enters the apartment.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Oh, my God. Rob, what happened?

ROB ROBERTS: It's a long story. What do you want?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: I, uh, I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd say hi.

ROB ROBERTS: Hi.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob, are you all right? Did you do this?

ROB ROBERTS: No. Derwood Spinks did this. You know, he's the one who... like I said, it's a long story.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Where are you going?

ROB ROBERTS: To a friend's house. I have to leave, actually. As in now.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Are you sure you're all right? You're not feeling...?

ROB ROBERTS: Yes, absolutely. I'm-I'm fine, you know?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: It's just that when you came to see me yesterday I sensed that there were things that you wanted to talk about but couldn't.

ROB ROBERTS: That was yesterday.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Well, can we talk about them now?

ROB ROBERTS: Look, let me stop you right there, okay? You don't have to worry about me anymore. As of... (looks at his watch) ... as of 10:38 a.m, I am no longer employed by the Lucky Boy Corporation. I quit.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob, I'm here as a friend.

ROB ROBERTS: Well, then consider me cured. I had a breakthrough last night.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Did you attend the OA. meeting?

ROB ROBERTS: Yeah.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: How did it go?

ROB ROBERTS: It was a complete and utter waste of my time.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: I'm sorry you felt that way.

ROB ROBERTS: So they're a bunch of fat people. So what? Maybe they've got what you would call a biological imperative to eat too much. Did you ever think of that? Did you? You know, maybe I've got a biological imperative, too. So why is that such a bad thing?! Like the world's going to end? That is biology. You can't fight biology. You can't.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Sounds like you're saying you're tired of feeling guilty.

ROB ROBERTS: Bingo. I am sick and tired of pretending that I'm something that I'm not.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: You killed that man, didn't you?

(ROB, on his way out, pauses and locks the door.)

ROB ROBERTS: What did you just say?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: That's why you feel so guilty, isn't it? Can you tell me why you did it?

ROB ROBERTS: Who have you been talking to?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: No one. I realized it after our last session.

ROB ROBERTS: You spoke to the FBI, didn't you?

DR. MINDY RINEHART: I haven't spoken to anyone and I won't without your permission but I am here to ask you to turn yourself in. I want you to get the help that you need.

(There is the sound of a siren blaring in distance. ROB rushes to the window and peers anxiously through the blinds.)

ROB ROBERTS: You don't know what the hell you're talking about.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Yes, I do, Rob.

ROB ROBERTS: No, you don't! You said... you don't believe in monsters, right? How about... now?

(ROB pulls off his wig. MINDY starts to back away from him.)

ROB ROBERTS: How about... now?

(He pulls off his fake ears and teeth.)

ROB ROBERTS: Do you believe in monsters?

(He hisses, bares his pointy teeth and grabs her by the throat. After a second, she touches his cheek with her hand.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: You poor man. What you must go through.

(MULDER and SCULLY burst in the door.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

MULDER: Step away, Rob. Step away.

SCULLY: Dr. Rinehart, step away from him.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Don't hurt him.

MULDER: Rob, we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfill. You just can't stop yourself, can you? Get on the floor. Rob, get on the floor.

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Rob... Be that good person I know you mean to be.

(ROB turns and charges MULDER. MULDER fires two rounds into his chest. ROB falls, gasping. MINDY screams and rushes to him, kneeling over him.)

DR. MINDY RINEHART: Why?

ROB ROBERTS: I can't be something I'm not.

(Screen shows DR. RINEHART, MULDER and SCULLY leaning over looking at him. The scene wavers as ROB loses consciousness then it fades to black.)

[THE END]

                                    MILLENNIUM


SCENE 1
TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA
DECEMBER 21, 1999

(Funeral parlor. After a service. A few mourners have stayed to talk to the grieving WIDOW.)

WOMAN: We're so sorry, Mrs. Crouch. If there's anything we can do for you, anything, you just let us know.

WIDOW: Thank you so much. It would have meant a lot to him. I'm sorry. Thank you. (embracing the woman) Thank you for coming.

(The mourners leave. A MAN, clean cut, about 50 comes over to the WIDOW.)

MAN: Mrs. Crouch? I'm sorry for your loss.

WIDOW: Thank you. Mr 

MAN: Johnson. I worked briefly with your husband. I was impressed by him. Very much so.

WIDOW: Thank you.

MAN: I'm sorry.

(The MAN leaves. The WIDOW looks at the coffin. The FUNERAL DIRECTOR locks the door and comes to stand next to the WIDOW.)

WIDOW: (to the coffin, sadly) Hell of a Christmas, Raymond.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR: He's at peace now. That's one small comfort to be drawn.

WIDOW: Didn't even leave a note.

(The WIDOW leaves. The FUNERAL DIRECTOR turns out the lights, closes the doors and leaves also. The MAN steps out from where he's been hiding behind another door. He goes to the coffin and opens it. Very dead guy inside the coffin. He removes his own jacket and shirt and drops them to the floor all while praying softly.)

MAN: I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life.

(He begins undressing the body in the coffin, having to struggle to get the sleeves off the man's stiff arms. He removes the man's FBI tie tack and holds it in his teeth as he removes the dead man's shirt.)

MAN: He that believeth in me... though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me...shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me... though he were dead yet shall he live...

(He now has the body down to an undershirt. He places a lighted cell phone in the dead man's hand.)

MAN:  whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. He that believeth in me... though he were dead yet shall he live.

(He closes the lid of the coffin and leaves.)

CUT TO:

DECEMBER 29, 1999

(Graveyard at night. Sound of thunder rumbling, rain falling. The MAN from the funeral parlor, now wearing the clothing he removed from the dead man, including the FBI tie tack, is sitting in his car watching one of the graves. He has a cell phone sitting on the seat beside him. It rings. Instead of answering it, he gets a shovel from the trunk and goes over to the grave. Sound of the ringing cell phone continues.)

SCENE 2
DECEMBER 30, 1999

(Graveyard. Area around the gravesite is a crime scene. SCULLY pulls up alone, gets out and shows her badge.)

YOUNG COP: Thank you, ma'am.

(SCULLY pulls the police tape up, ducks under it and starts to walk towards a grave. She is stopped by the FUNERAL DIRECTOR. He is slightly upset.)

FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Are you with the FBI, too?

SCULLY: Yes, sir.

FUNERAL DIRECTOR: Look. I know my job. The man was deceased.

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

FUNERAL DIRECTOR: I understand that he was one of your own -- but these rumours I'm hearing that I put a living human being into the ground... You people better get your facts straight real fast.

(SCULLY, with a resigned look on her face, goes over to the open grave. MULDER, wearing rubber-soled shoes is inside the grave looking at the now empty coffin. Conversation is friendly bantering.)

SCULLY: Mulder, have you been spreading rumours?

MULDER: Why? You hear any good ones lately?

SCULLY: Not particularly. So what do you have here?

MULDER: Merry Christmas, by the way, Scully.

SCULLY: Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too.

MULDER: Grave robbery with a twist. Check out the headliner, Scully.

(He lifts the lid and shows that the headliner in the coffin has been torn as if by fingernails.)

SCULLY: It looks like someone on the inside was trying to get out.

MULDER: Indeed it does. To answer your question -- no, I haven't been spreading any rumours. The local PD's been doing a pretty good job of that ever since they matched the fingerprints of the dead man to these. And to those up there on that headstone. There's a big juicy handprint on the back. (SCULLY looks. Head stone for Raymond Crouch. Indeed there is a hand print. MULDER climbs out of the grave.)

SCULLY: What about the person or persons who did the digging?

MULDER: Well, got one pile of dirt. I'm guessing one man with a shovel. Other than that last night's rain hasn't left us much to go on. Well, go ahead, Scully, naysay me. The body of an FBI agent gets disinterred only to climb out on its own and disappear into the Yuletide night.

SCULLY: (slight smile) See, you had me up until there.

MULDER: Did I?

SCULLY: I think it's what you said before. I think it's a grave robbery with a twist. You've got the fingerprints and the torn casket liner. Most likely it's rigged evidence that's been faked by whoever exhumed the body.

MULDER: Faked for what effect?

SCULLY: Publicity ... fear ... rumours ... I mean, I don't know what specific effect, but nonetheless it's ... (notices MULDER looking down at the ground) What?

(There is a faint red ring around the gravesite.)

MULDER: Looks like blood.



SCENE 3

(The MAN from the funeral parlor is driving a pickup truck on a rural highway. He is alone in the cab.)

MAN: And whosoever believeth and liveth in me shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though He be dead, yet shall he live and whosoever believeth and Liveth in me shall never die.

(There is a thumping sound. In the rear view mirror he sees a hand reaching up from the bed of the truck. He continues praying, a little more intensely now.)

MAN: I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though He be dead, yet shall he live and whosoever believeth and Liveth in me shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life.

(He passes a Georgia road sign, highway 121.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(SKINNER's office. SKINNER, SCULLY, MULDER and three other team members are sitting at SKINNER's conference table looking at files and photos. SCULLY opens a file with a picture of the man from the coffin.)

SCULLY: Special Agent Raymond Crouch, Age 56, married, no children. After a sterling 21-year career with the Bureau, he retired in 1993. And, then earlier this month, he was found in the garage of his Tallahassee home, service weapon in hand.

(She holds up a photo of the man slumped against the wall, gunshot to the chest.)

SKINNER: Definitely self-inflicted?

SCULLY: I read over the report and there's no indication otherwise.

SKINNER: How about a motive for the grave robberies?

MALE AGENT: We've gone through all the cases Crouch had a hand in. He doesn't seem to have made any enemies.

FEMALE AGENT: Same thing with his personal life. No large debts, no feuds with neighbors, never a bad word against him.

SKINNER: Nothing stands out?

MULDER: Should something stand out?

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, what's your take on this?

MULDER: Well, only that I don't think it was grave robbery per se. (Pause. He and SCULLY both look down. Here it comes.) It was necromancy.

(The other agents are uncomfortable.)

MULDER: The summoning of the dead. It's a form of magic dating back to primitive Shamanism with a long tradition in the Christian church. Through it, the dead are brought back to life for the purposes of divulging arcane knowledge or performing ritual tasks.

MALE AGENT: So, that's what this wacko thought he was doing? Raising the dead?

MULDER: No, that's what he was doing. (shows picture) This is a, uh... that's a magic circle drawn in goat's blood. The rain washed most of it away. The blood attracts the spirits of the undead while the circle focuses the necromancer's power while protecting him from the spirits that he's conjuring.

MALE AGENT: (not believing) Okay.

MULDER: He may also desire to wear the clothes of the dead man to create a bond between them. You would not want to be this man's dry cleaner.

SCULLY: Obviously, there are clear ritualistic elements to this crime. But the question is why were they directed at Raymond Crouch?

MULDER: That is the question.

SKINNER: Well, let's come up with an answer.

(The AGENTS get up and gather files and photos.)

SKINNER: Mulder, Scully, a word, please.

(The other three AGENTS leave the room.)

SKINNER: Necromancy aside ... this magic circle you mentioned -- what if it looked something like this?

(SKINNER hands them a picture of a snake eating its own tail. Same symbol tattooed on SCULLY's back in Never Again, season 4.)

MULDER: It's an ouroboros ... Possibly. Definitely a mystical symbol. The alchemists favored it. They believe that it represented all of existence.

SKINNER: I'm thinking more the Millennium Group. It was their symbol as well. Are you familiar with them?

SCULLY: Yes, somewhat. They were former FBI agents who offered consulting services to law enforcement. Somehow, they fell into disrepute.

SKINNER: They operated in extreme secrecy. Rumours abounded that they had their own agenda which was less than altruistic if not improper or illegal.

MULDER: And that it was, in fact, a cult based upon Judeo-Christian "Endtime" prophecies concerning the coming millennium. Was Raymond Crouch a member?

SKINNER: I can't seem to find out. Apparently the group dissolved several months ago. They left no paper trail -- nothing. However ... I do have three other grave desecrations all within the last six months. Long Island ... Northern California, Arizona. All three graves contained the bodies of former FBI agents. All three were recent suicides.

(SKINNER hands them three more pictures of open graves with red circles drawn in the dirt around them.)

MULDER: How long were you going to sit on this?

SKINNER: Owing to the Millennium Group's former ties with the Bureau this matter is  sensitive, to say the least. Investigate them. Keep a low profile.

MULDER: I think I know where to start.



SCENE 5
HARTWELL PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL
WOODBRIDGE, VIRGINA

(Entrance to a locked area of the hospital. MULDER and SCULLY are getting visitor passes from a guard.)

SCULLY: How well do you know this man?

MULDER: Only by reputation. He left, um, Vi-Cap before I got there. But he's been called the greatest criminal profiler that Quantico ever produced.

SCULLY: What's he doing here?

(As they enter the hallway, they pass an older, smiling, not sane man.)

MULDER: (to the man) Good morning. (smiles as the actor playing the OLD MAN says something. Then turns back to SCULLY as they walk down the hall) Apparently, he checked himself in for a 30 day observation. I gather the last few years haven't been very kind to him. If there's anybody that can tell us about the Millennium Group, it's him. He used to consult for them. Later, he fought to bring them down at the expense of his own career and reputation.

SCULLY: Single-minded.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Sounds like someone I know.

(They enter a room. A man, FRANK BLACK, is watching a football game.)

TV ANNOUNCER: ... 12 yard line and they are threatening ... pounding on the door of Boston College.

MULDER: Frank Black?

(FRANK BLACK turns and looks up at them. MULDER shows his badge.)

MULDER: Hi, my name is, uh, Fox Mulder. This is my partner, Dana Scully. It's a pleasure to meet you. Do you mind if we sit down?

TV ANNOUNCER: Higgins tries the middle and he gets ... nowhere. Running into the grey wall of Boston.

(FRANK BLACK looks back to the TV. Not waiting for response, MULDER and SCULLY sit. FRANK BLACK closes his eyes briefly and sighs.)

MULDER: Who's playing?

FRANK BLACK: Uh, it's Notre Dame and Boston College.

MULDER: Ah, the Fighting Irish and the Golden Eagles, huh?

FRANK BLACK: What can I do for you, agents?

(SCULLY looks at MULDER.)

MULDER: Well, we're working on a case that, uh, we feel that you might have some particular insight into -- the deaths of four FBI agents. Do you recognize these men?

(MULDER shows him photos of the four men. FRANK BLACK glances at them, then back to the TV.)

FRANK BLACK: I do.

(Pause.)

SCULLY: All four committed suicide in the last six months. All were exhumed from their graves in a ritual desecration. They were members of the Millennium Group. Is that correct?

(FRANK BLACK nods.)

SCULLY: Sir, we've been having a really difficult time gleaning any information whatsoever about the group ... about its membership, its practices ... I believe you can help us.

FRANK BLACK: No, thank you. I'm retired. I think you can tell by the circumstances that I'm trying to put my life back together. I can't get involved in this.

MULDER: We're not asking you to get involved. I'm just asking you to take a look at the case file.

FRANK BLACK: No, thank you.

MULDER: Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow is January 1, 2000. That's the significant date for these people. That doesn't leave us much time. Don't you want to see them stopped?

(FRANK BLACK, uncomfortable, ignores him, stares at the TV. Disappointed, MULDER gathers the pictures.)

MULDER: Well, Mr. Black, you are not what I was expecting.

FRANK BLACK: Agent Mulder...

MULDER: Yes.

FRANK BLACK: It's first and 18. Just let me watch this game in peace.

(MULDER looks up at the football game. The score is 7 to 7, 3rd and 10.)

MULDER: (not happy) It's third and ten. It's third and ten, Notre Dame.

FRANK BLACK: Happy New Year.

MULDER: (really not happy) Same to you.

(MULDER and SCULLY leave.)



SCENE 6
RURAL MARYLAND
11:21 PM

(The MAN from the funeral parlor and the graveyard is fixing a flat tire on his truck. A DEPUTY stops and walks over with a flashlight.)

DEPUTY: Evening.

MAN: Hi.

DEPUTY: Could I, uh, give you a hand?

MAN: Oh, no. I'm about done, but thanks. Guess I ran over a nail or something.

DEPUTY: (aiming the flashlight) Well, I can help you see, at least.

MAN: Yeah, I've been driving all night. Be good to get home.

DEPUTY: I hear you.

(The DEPUTY sniffs the air.)

DEPUTY: Man... Whew. What is that?

MAN: (looking around) Oh, yeah. I think a deer maybe must've died out there in the woods.

(The DEPUTY hears flies buzzing. He looks suspiciously at the bed of the truck.)

DEPUTY: Sir? What's in the truck?

MAN: Nothing.

DEPUTY: Mind if I take a look?

MAN: (still holding the tire iron) There's nothing in there, so...

DEPUTY: Drop that and take two steps back. Drop it.

(The MAN drops the tire iron. The DEPUTY walks toward the truck. Sound of flies buzzing gets louder. The MAN sprinkles a ring of white stuff around himself on the ground)

MAN: (quietly) He who believeth in me, though he be dead, yet shall he live and whosoever believeth and liveth in me shall never die. I am the resurrection and the life.

(The DEPUTY looks in the bed of the truck, sees the dead man from the teaser, then turns back to the MAN who is still praying.)

DEPUTY: Oh, Lord! Stand up there! Stand up! Let me see your hands.

MAN: I am the resurrection...

DEPUTY: What?

MAN: He who believeth in me, though...

DEPUTY: Speak up!

(The body rises out of the bed of the truck and attacks the DEPUTY. The DEPUTY screams. The MAN continues praying inside the circle.)



SCENE 7
DECEMBER 31, 1999
7:32 AM

(Next morning on the rural Maryland highway. Crime scene. The Rice County Sheriff DEPUTY's car is still parked on the scene. Lots of law enforcement. SCULLY walks over to where MULDER is looking at the ring of white stuff that the MAN sprinkled.)

SCULLY: Hey. (MULDER doesn't look up) I've got the men concentrating on the woods.

MULDER: Our necromancer was definitely here. (he rubs the white stuff between his gloved fingers, stands up and licks it) It's salt. Heavy magic.

SCULLY: Well, if you're going to tell me that he, uh, stopped by the side of the road to raise the dead, which I hope you're not, I've got two things to say to you. One is that his previous circles were made of blood, not salt, and two...

MULDER: And they were large enough to contain a body. This is just a protective circle. It's just big enough for one man to stand inside.

SCULLY: Protecting himself against what?

(They look down at a patch of bloody ground.)

MULDER: Whatever it was that did that.

SHERIFF: Agents! Over here!

(MULDER and SCULLY run over to where the SHERIFF has found something.)

SHERIFF: I saw a lump in the ground.

(It is the body of the DEPUTY.)

SHERIFF: My God...

MULDER: Bite marks. They look human.

SCULLY: More salt.

(The DEPUTY's mouth is sealed with two huge staples and is packed with salt. MULDER pulls a piece of paper out of the DEPUTY's mouth and unrolls and reads it. It is hand written in red.)

MULDER: (reading) "I am he that liveth and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen; And have the keys of hell and of death."

YOUNG COP WHO KNOWS THE BIBLE: Book of Revelation chapter one, verse 18.

MULDER: Go Fighting Irish.

(SCULLY looks at him.)



SCENE 8

(In the psychiatric hospital. MULDER drops the paper from the DEPUTY's mouth on a table in front of FRANK BLACK.)

MULDER: First and 18. It's not football, it's Revelations. You wanted to tell us something, Frank. Why don't you just come out and say it?

FRANK BLACK: I don't know what you're talking about. I told you, I cannot get involved in this.

MULDER: Right, so you'll occasionally drop the little arcane hint? A police officer was murdered, Frank. Why do you want to play around? Your denial's a sign that you obviously know something about that. You knew that we'd find this. What are you afraid of?

(SCULLY has entered.)

SCULLY: Losing your daughter. You're in a custody battle with the parents of your late wife. I just spoke with your doctor. That's why you're here.

FRANK BLACK: They claimed I was an unfit father, that I was obsessed with conspiracy, the end of the world, that my work meant more to me than my daughter, Jordan. The thing is ... they were right.

SCULLY: And so you retired.

FRANK BLACK: I will sell insurance. I'll do whatever it takes. I'll get well and I'll jump through whatever hoops they want, but I will not mention the Millennium Group again.

MULDER: But you obviously want to help. You ... dropped that clue on us. Look, Frank, nobody needs to know about this. We're just three people sitting around talking.

(Later, the three are sitting at the table looking at a file, #X-120898. Agent Raymond Crouch's picture is taken out of the file and added to a pile on the table.)

FRANK BLACK: The Book of Revelation describes the end of the physical world in a battle between heaven and hell ... Good against Evil. The Millennium Group believed that that time was upon us. These four represent a schism in the group. (FRANK indicates the pictures of the four dead men laid out on the table.) They believe that for the end time to come, as it must that man must take an active hand in bringing that about.

SCULLY: And to that end, they committed suicide.

FRANK BLACK: Yeah.

MULDER: With the express purpose of being brought back to life. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. These four men bring with them war, pestilence, famine and death.

FRANK BLACK: So that all the dead of the earth will arise -- Armageddon. It must begin with the dawn of the millennium ... or not at all. That's what they believe. The man you're looking for -- your necromancer -- he exhumed these men in accordance with their wishes.

MULDER: So is he a member of the Millennium Group as well?

FRANK BLACK: No, they sought him out. He believes he's doing God's work but he's mistaken.

SCULLY: Could you tell us a little bit more about this man?

FRANK BLACK: He's a white male, 45 to 50. He's a religious man, no police record ... no fulfilling relationship. You would pass him without giving him a glance.

MULDER: So this is the one event that'll give his life meaning.

FRANK BLACK: Yeah. He needs privacy for this. He'll live alone ... possibly in the house he grew up in. Most likely it's a large rural property away from prying eyes. He'll own a truck or a van. He needs it to transport the bodies. There'll be high fences, "No Trespassing" signs. It's a solitary existence. He's worked around death all his life in some capacity -- a funeral parlor or a cemetery. Death comforts him.

(As FRANK BLACK speaks we see the camera panning across exactly what he is describing - the MAN's house. A large chain-link fence surrounds the property. He is apparently a taxidermist working on a fox-like animal's eye. He is watching a news report on the missing DEPUTY.)

TV NEWS ANNOUNCER: A Rice County sheriff's deputy...

FRANK BLACK:  He took great care in burying the deputy and preparing the body despite the fact that he feared being caught. He stapled the lips, sealed the mouth shut. It was to prevent the man from coming back to life. He believes, that if disturbed the deputy will rise from the dead. It's too soon for that, which is why when he realizes that the deputy has been discovered he'll feel a need to take action. He'll return to the body the first chance he gets.

SCULLY: Rice County morgue.

FRANK BLACK: I think you'll catch him there.

MULDER: These four members of the Millennium Group ... the ones that "truly liveth who were dead." These are the ones we have to catch.

(SCULLY gives a look.)

NURSE: Mr. Black?

FRANK BLACK: Yeah?

NURSE: You've got a phone call. I think it might be your daughter.

FRANK BLACK: Thank you. (he smiles warmly) My daughter. Excuse me.

(FRANK BLACK leaves the room. SCULLY looks down for a moment, then she and MULDER share a look and go back to the hospital entrance.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you're telling me it's more important to track down four dead bodies than one live murderer.

MULDER: He's not our murderer, and those four dead bodies aren't dead and the millennium is  (looks at his watch)  14 hours away.

(The door buzzes for them as they exit the hall.)

SCULLY: Mulder, those people, even when they were alive mangled biblical prophecy to the extent that it's unrecognizable. The year 2000 is just their artificial deadline and besides, 2001 is actually the start of the new millennium.

MULDER: (slight smile) Nobody likes a math geek, Scully.

SCULLY: Anyway, I think that Frank's profile is sound.

MULDER: I do, too.

SCULLY: And I think with it we have our best chance of finding this necromancer, as you call him. So I am going down to the county morgue.

MULDER: I absolutely think you should.

SCULLY: And what are you going to do?

MULDER: Follow the profile. The deputy was killed on a road that connects from the north with no major highway. I'm thinking our necromancer lives nearby. I'm going to do a rundown on all single landowners in the area see where the bodies are buried, since we all ... Oh, Scully, will you do me a favor? Don't let anybody remove the staples from the deputy's mouth, okay? Please? Just humor me. Thanks.



SCENE 9
RICE COUNTY MORGUE
10:32 AM

(Morgue. The CORONER is removing the staples from the DEPUTY's mouth and speaking into a recorder.)

CORONER: Proceeding with the visual examination of the mouth.

(She pulls the DEPUTY's mouth open and salt slowly spills out. The phone rings. She is irritated at being interrupted.)

CORONER: Geez.

(The answering machine clicks on. The CORONER continues with her examination.)

CORONER: What appears to be salt is packed into the victim's mouth.

(Faintly, we hear SCULLY's voice leaving a message.)

CORONER: God only knows why. I'm removing it.

(She removes several spoonfuls of salt from the DEPUTY's mouth. The phone rings again. She goes into the office and listens to the answering machine.)

ANSWERING MACHINE: This is the Rice County morgue. No one can come to the phone.

SCULLY'S VOICE: This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI. Please do not autopsy the murder victim that was brought in earlier -- the sheriff's deputy. If you've already started, stop now. I'll be there shortly and I'll explain when I arrive.

(During the message we see movement through the window behind the CORONER. The machine beeps as the message ends. The CORONER turns and screams as the DEPUTY, now risen from the dead, attacks her. The phone is knocked off the hook.)

(Short time later. SCULLY enters the morgue cautiously. Three dead people waiting on tables. Busy morgue.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(She unholsters her gun and enters the office. The phone is dangling off the hook making that loud tone that phones make when you leave them off the hook for a couple of minutes. Blood and the CORONER's broken goggles are on the floor. SCULLY follows a trail of blood into an adjoining room. The CORONER is lying against the wall covered in blood and bite marks. She is hurt badly, gasping and choking. SCULLY goes to check her pulse, but then turns to see the MAN standing in the doorway. SCULLY aims her gun at him, but then turns to see the should-be-dead DEPUTY attacking her. She fires three shots into the DEPUTY's chest. The shots have no effect and he comes closer. Then her gun is knocked out of her hands and lands at the feet of the MAN who is still standing in the doorway. He looks down at the gun.)



SCENE 10

(Morgue. Later. EMTs and police are swarming around the place. They are loading the wounded CORONER onto an ambulance as SKINNER enters.)

SKINNER: Where is she?

SHERIFF: (pointing inside) On the right.

(SKINNER enters the morgue and lifts up the corner of a sheet covering a dead body on the floor. It is the DEPUTY, really dead now. SCULLY comes up behind him.)

SCULLY: Sir?

(SKINNER looks at the bite marks on SCULLY's neck. She doesn't appear to be hurt badly, but is very tired.)

SKINNER: How are you feeling?

SCULLY: All things considered...?

SKINNER: What the hell happened here? Who is that man?

SCULLY: The Sheriff's Deputy. The man we found this morning. He was dead and then, somehow, he wasn't. He attacked me.

SKINNER: You shot him?

SCULLY: Three rounds center-of-mass into his chest. No effect.

SKINNER: There's a gunshot wound to his head as well.

SCULLY: Yeah, this man, uh, Mulder calls a "necromancer," our suspect, he was here, too. He fired that shot with my gun. He saved me. I have no idea why. He got away but I was in no shape to follow. Look, sir, I can't even begin to offer an explanation for what happened but I have to say it is exactly what Mulder feared.

SKINNER: Yeah, which is why I would like to talk to him. Why isn't he answering his phone?

(SCULLY looks concerned.)



SCENE 11

(Rural area. MULDER arrives at the MAN's fenced in house. He crosses the name Mark Johnson off of a list on a sheet of paper. It was number 10 on the list, all the others above it crossed off, leaving the names Fred Keenan and Lee Montana as numbers 11 and 12. The other names we can see are Erik Haas, Shane Hammond and Gary Hashimoto. MULDER tries to make a call, but his cell phone registers No Service.)

MULDER: Welcome to the boondocks.

(MULDER gets out of the car and goes to the fence. He looks over at the trash cans, one marked with the name "Johnson." He opens the can and finds a large empty bag that once contained 50 pounds of "Kosher Salt." He takes a handful of salt from the bottom of the bag and puts it into his pocket. He looks at the lock on the fence, then climbs over the fence.)

CUT TO:

(The MAN is driving and singing to himself. He checks his watch.)

MAN: (singing) In the sweet by and by, we will meet on that beautiful shore.

CUT TO:

(MULDER picks the lock on the front door and enters the house. He looks around at all the stuffed wild animals then goes to the basement door. It is heavily barricaded with boards.)

(Outside, the MAN pulls up behind MULDER's car.)

(Inside, MULDER removes boards from the door, opens it and turns on his flashlight. He goes down into the basement, which has a dirt floor. Very creepy. Suddenly, a hand reaches up out of the dirt, then another and another until four zombie-like men have risen from the dirt. MULDER spins in a circle flashing his light on the men in shock. He turns and sees the MAN standing in the doorway at the top of the stairs. One of the dead men attack MULDER, sending him crashing against the bottom of the stairs. The MAN closes and blocks the door as MULDER runs upstairs.)

MULDER: (yelling) Open the door! Open the door! Open it! Let me out! Let me out!

(The MAN winces as he hears five gunshots fired in the basement.)



SCENE 12

9:17 PM

(At the psychiatric hospital. SCULLY, very worried, is talking to FRANK BLACK.)

FRANK BLACK: I haven't heard from him. He didn't go to the morgue with you?

SCULLY: No, he went looking for our suspect's home. No one's been able to contact him since. I've got task force agents canvassing the northwestern Maryland area but it's a large territory to cover and we're running out of time. Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder may have found what he's looking for. I need your help in finding him.

FRANK BLACK: Now, you respected my reasons in the past, Agent Scully. Please respect them now.

SCULLY: I'm not sure that I really understand your reasons, sir, and I'm starting to wonder what this is all about and how much you know about it. Mulder mentioned the four Millennium members who "liveth and were dead." Now, this morning in the morgue, I saw what he was talking about.

FRANK BLACK: You did?

SCULLY: One of them attacked me.

FRANK BLACK: I'm sorry.

SCULLY: Now, as crazy as this sounds, I have to ask. Do you believe that the Millennium Group is actually capable of bringing about the Endtime? Armageddon?

FRANK BLACK: I understand their beliefs. I've spent years trying to unravel them, make sense of them. Doesn't mean I believe them myself.

SCULLY: But what if it were true? Good and evil -- which would prevail?

FRANK BLACK: I'm sorry.

(Dejected, SCULLY leaves. FRANK BLACK looks up at the NURSE.)

FRANK BLACK: Octavia, I'm going to check myself out.

NURSE: You'd like a day pass?

FRANK BLACK: I won't be coming back.



SCENE 13

(Basement of the MAN's house. MULDER has his panic face on. He is standing inside a small circle of salt. His right arm is badly wounded. Sounds of growling are coming from all sides of the room.)

(Outside, the MAN is sitting against the side of he house. He hears footsteps and goes to see who it is.)

MAN: Who's there?

FRANK BLACK: It's me.

MAN: (amazed and delighted) You came.

FRANK BLACK: I almost didn't.

MAN: We'd given up on you. Thank God. Thank God. There's someone in the basement ... policeman. He killed one of the members. Shot him in the head. But you're here. Now we'll have four.

FRANK BLACK: I'm here.

(FRANK BLACK and the MAN enter the house.)

MAN: I can't tell you how happy I am. You were meant to be the fourth. I always knew that. I'd so hoped you'd come around.

FRANK BLACK: I didn't want to. The man in the basement? I told him how to find this place.

MAN: You ... why?

FRANK BLACK: I was trying to walk the straight and narrow. Leave the Millennium Group behind. But I know I can't do that anymore. Now that I know you've succeeded.

MAN: You didn't believe the dead would arise?

FRANK BLACK: No.

MAN: You see what the future holds, Frank. You know you can't run from it.

FRANK BLACK: No, I can't run.

MAN: You've paid so dearly. They've taken your daughter from you. Murdered your wife ... there's no justice in this world.

(The MAN removes a gun from a drawer and places it on the desk.)

MAN: But there will be in the next.

(The clock reads 10:13.)

MAN: The hour's near. Are you ready, Frank?

FRANK BLACK: (picking up the gun) I'm ready.

(FRANK checks the gun, it's full with 6 bullets.)

MAN: I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead...

FRANK BLACK:  yet shall he live. Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.

(FRANK BLACK surprises the MAN by shoving the gun against the MAN's chest.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY driving. It is dark and raining. Her phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

SKINNER: (on phone) This is Skinner. We back-checked Frank Black as you asked.

SCULLY: (on phone) And?

SKINNER: (on phone) He took no calls at Hartwell Psychiatric other than from his daughter, but the staff took messages including one from a Rice County number.

SCULLY: Rice County? That's where I am right now.

SKINNER: (on phone) We ran the phone records for Agent Crouch and the other desecration victims. All four received calls from this same number in weeks before their deaths.

SCULLY: I'm going to need an address.

CUT TO:

(Back at the MAN's house. FRANK BLACK is tying the MAN to the chair with duct tape.)

MAN: (desperate) Don't do this. I'm begging you, please. You know what the world is. Evil goes unpunished. The good suffer. There's no future here but uncertainty and pain. Let the judgment come! You're damning yourself, Frank!

(FRANK BLACK pulls the board away from the basement door and cautiously enters the basement.)

FRANK BLACK: Agent Mulder? Can you hear me? Agent Mulder?

MULDER: (scared) Yeah ... I'm down here. They're all around.

(FRANK BLACK lights a flare and throws it down showing MULDER still standing in his little circle and DEAD GUY #1, really dead now, shot in the head, on the ground in front of him. He lights another flare and tosses it down.)

MULDER: You armed?

FRANK BLACK: (taking out the gun) Oh, yeah.

MULDER: Shoot for the head. That seems to stop 'em. There's three more of 'em.

FRANK BLACK: Where?

MULDER: I don't know. They're hiding.

(FRANK BLACK comes down the stairs. He turns and sees DEAD GUY #2 running at him. He shoots it three times in the head and it falls, really dead. Another one hisses.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY driving. She glances down at a map.)

CUT TO:

(Basement. MULDER is sitting on the ground.)

FRANK BLACK: Mulder, can you get up?

MULDER: Yeah, I think so.

(MULDER starts to get up. MULDER sees another one attacking them.)

MULDER: Look out!

(Growling, the DEAD GUY #3 attacks FRANK BLACK pushing him to the floor and trying to bite him.)

(Outside, SCULLY has arrived. She gets out of her car and starts to pick the lock on the gate.)

(In the basement, MULDER shoots DEAD GUY #3 twice in the head. It falls off of FRANK BLACK, really dead.)

(Outside, SCULLY opens the gate.)

(In the basement, MULDER is helping FRANK BLACK sit up when the final dead guy breaks the wall and enters the room. MULDER fires at him, but the clip is empty. DEAD GUY #4 hisses and comes toward them, but SCULLY, who has come down the stairs shoots him three times in the head and he also falls really dead.)



SCENE 14

(Hospital waiting room. Dick Clark's Rocking New Year's Eve is on the television. FRANK BLACK is watching it.)

DICK CLARK: There's another shot of that millennium crystal ball all lit up. They're getting ready to bring in the New Year. Boy, are they packed in tonight. The body heat alone is keeping them warm. And look at them -- all the way up past 52nd street. That is that X-shaped thing I was talking about before. This is Times Square -- the crossroads of the world...

SCULLY: Mr. Black.

FRANK BLACK: Hi.

SCULLY: Mike Johnson's been taken for psychiatric evaluation. He'll be put under suicide watch just as you asked.

FRANK BLACK: Good.

SCULLY: (smiles) And, um...

FRANK BLACK: What?

SCULLY: There's someone here to see you.

(A little girl, JORDAN, FRANK BLACK's daughter runs in.)

JORDAN: Hi, Daddy!

FRANK BLACK: (embracing her) Hi, little one! Oh, I missed you, Sweetheart.

JORDAN: I missed you, too, Daddy.

(SCULLY watches them hug, then looks up as MULDER enters, smiling. His right arm is in a sling.)

FRANK BLACK: Let's get out of here.

(FRANK BLACK and MULDER shake left hands.)

MULDER: Frank, good luck with everything.

FRANK BLACK: Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. I guess this is it, huh?

(Clock on the TV reads 11:59:23.)

DICK CLARK: (on TV)  The ball is on its way...

SCULLY: You're not going to stay and watch?

FRANK BLACK: No, we just want to go home.

(FRANK BLACK and his daughter leave the room. MULDER and SCULLY are alone watching the TV.)

DICK CLARK: (on TV) What a millennium...

FRANK BLACK: Take care of yourselves.

DICK CLARK: (on TV)  30 seconds now, 30. Get ready for the loudest cheering you'll ever hear in your life. Hug your friends and loved ones tight. What the heck, whoever that person is next to you. No time like the present. Are you ready? Here we go. Ten, nine ... eight, seven, six ... five, four, three, two, one ... Happy New Year, 2000!

("Auld Lang Syne" is playing. Couples are kissing on the TV screen.)

TV MUSIC: Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne 

(MULDER looks at the kissing couples, then at SCULLY who is watching the TV. He looks at her lips. MULDER leans down toward her. She turns to him. They kiss. For about 7 seconds. Very sweet. They pull apart and look at each other and smile. Perfect.)

MULDER: The world didn't end.

SCULLY: No, it didn't.

(SCULLY gets a wistful, far-away expression.)

MULDER: Happy New Year, Scully.

SCULLY: Happy New Year, Mulder.

(MULDER puts his arm around SCULLY's shoulders and they walk out of the waiting room together.)

[THE END]
                                   RUSH


SCENE 1
PITTSFIELD, VIRGINIA
11:49 PM

(Night. A car pulls up and parks near a dark forested area. The bumper sticker says, "My son is an HONOR STUDENT at Adams High". TONY, a fresh-faced teenager, gets out nervously, passes a rusted No Trespassing sign and walks a few yards into the forest. He sees no one.)

TONY: Max. Max, you there?

(A flash of light as MAX, another teenager, lights a cigarette calmly. He is suddenly directly in front of TONY, and has his arm draped around his girlfriend, CHASTITY.)

MAX: You're late, kid. You get lost?

TONY: Sorry. Had to wait till my mom took off.

CHASTITY: It's way past his bedtime, Max. He's not cut out for this.

TONY: Cut out for what?

MAX: Oh, there's more here than just trees. Before you can find out what, I got to know that you're not going to tell anyone about this place.

TONY: I won't. I swear.

MAX: It's a vow, Tony. Don't make it if you're going to break it.

TONY: I won't break it, man. Not ever.

MAX: No matter what? (leans close to TONY's ear) Even if someone dies tonight?

(TONY looks even more nervous. The sound of a car approaching, they all look in the direction it's coming, TONY turns around, a siren blares and TONY sees a police car pull up. When he turns back to MAX and CHASTITY, they are gone. Surprised, he looks around.)

(DEPUTY FOSTER uses his flashlight to look at TONY's Virginia driver's license. Reed, Anthony, 4830 Bemis, Pittsfield, Virgina, 23226. They stand beside TONY's car.)

DEPUTY FOSTER: Anthony Reed. Got any outstanding warrants, Anthony?

TONY: No, of course not.

DEPUTY FOSTER: Well, I'm going to have to check it out for myself so put your hands on the vehicle.

TONY: Look, I was just taking a walk.

DEPUTY FOSTER: Uh-huh. Right past all those big "no trespassing" signs? Now, you just stand there for a minute.

TONY: Come on, man, I didn't do anything.

(DEPUTY FOSTER leaves TONY with his hands on the roof and heads back to his cruiser, out of TONY's sight.)

DEPUTY FOSTER: I wish I had a nickel for every time I had to drag you kids out of these woods. It would be a lot of nickels. (on radio) Deputy Foster to Dispatch...

(TONY sees a blur of light and color pass him, there is a loud thud. DEPUTY FOSTER grunts and his flashlight falls to the ground.)

WOMAN ON RADIO: Dispatch to Deputy Foster, can you repeat that request?

TONY: Sir?

WOMAN ON RADIO: Dispatch to Foster. I didn't quite copy your last transmission.

TONY: Officer?

WOMAN ON RADIO: Dispatch to Foster. Do you copy?

(TONY slowly walks around the car. He picks up the police flashlight, then drops it quickly. It is covered in blood which is now smeared on TONY's hands.)

WOMAN ON RADIO: Deputy Foster, this is Dispatch. Do you copy? Deputy Foster, sir, what's your 20?

(TONY looks inside the police car. DEPUTY FOSTER's head has been completely crushed in. Very bloody.)

SCENE 2
ST. JUDE'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
PITTSFIELD, VIRGINIA

(SCULLY gets off an elevator and walks up behind MULDER in the hall. He is dialing on his phone - probably her. She touches him on the back with a file folder to get his attention. He seems happy to see her and smiles as they walk down the hall.)

MULDER: Uh. There you are. Heavy traffic?

SCULLY: Slow going. Let's just say I had ample time to read the police report that you faxed me.

MULDER: Thoughtfully provided by the local authorities even though it doesn't begin to tell the whole story.

SCULLY: Sheriff's deputy is slain during a routine patrol. It's a tragic occurrence but I don't see the mystery here, Mulder.

MULDER: Except that the deputy was beaten to death by an invisible assailant.

SCULLY: Yes, but that's according to the young man who's accused of his murder.

MULDER: One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing wrongfully accused. He's an "A" student moved here a few months ago from Philadelphia. He's never been in trouble in his life.

(They enter the morgue. SCULLY puts on a pair of rubber gloves from a box on a cart next to the body.)

SCULLY: Mulder, tell me you've got more than SAT scores to show that this Tony Reed didn't commit this crime.

MULDER: Maybe. Take a look at the body.

(SCULLY flips back the sheet and looks at the smashed head of DEPUTY FOSTER. She looks back up at MULDER in disbelief.)

MULDER: The former Deputy Ronald Foster. As you can see, the report doesn't quite do it justice.

SCULLY: Oh, my God, it looks like he was hit with a sledgehammer.

MULDER: Police flashlight. One blow.

(SCULLY looks at him in disbelief again then examines the body.)

SCULLY: The damage to the maxillofacial bones and the cranium is consistent with a blunt-force trauma, but... I'd say that, uh, Tony eats his Wheaties.

MULDER: Check out the back of his head.

(SCULLY looks. She sees twisted glass and metal amid the bloody hair.)

SCULLY: Ugh. His eyeglasses.

MULDER: Penetrated to the back of his skull. Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard, let alone a high school sophomore.

SCULLY: Well, maybe if he was under the influence of PCP or some kind of stimulant.

MULDER: No, his tox screen came back negative.

SCULLY: Well, even so, I mean, stress and fear may have triggered an adrenaline response which is known to enable feats of near-superhuman strength.

(They turn to see SHERIFF HARDEN, fifites, enter the morgue. He is not a happy man.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: Agent Mulder? How long are you planning on being down here?

MULDER: Uh, Sheriff Harden, this is my partner, Agent Scully.

SHERIFF HARDEN: (ignoring SCULLY) How long you planning on being down here? I'd like Ron left in peace. I don't know what there is to see, anyway. We got the kid who did it.

SCULLY: Sheriff, we don't mean to second-guess you. We're just hoping to be of some assistance.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Well, I don't need it. I got the murder weapon with bloody fingerprints and once the state crime lab matches that up with Tony Reed, it's open and shut.

MULDER: Well, uh... we're done here. (casually to SCULLY) Right? But, Sheriff Harden, you won't mind if I talk to Tony Reed, do you? I mean, it won't hurt your case and if he did do it, you'll want to know why.

(SHERIFF HARDEN considers.)



SCENE 3
PITTSFIELD SHERIFF'S STATION

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY enter the police station. A PRETTY BLONDE YOUNG WOMAN bumps into MULDER as they pass. MULDER turns and she and MULDER smile at each other. It is CHASTITY, the girl from the forest, on her way out of the interrogation room. When he turns back to SCULLY, she must give him a look because he chuckles at her as they enter the interrogation room.)

MULDER: (defensively, laughing) What?

(She must let it pass. They enter the room. TONY is sitting at the table.)

MULDER: Well, Tony, this must be your lucky day for visitors. This is Agent Scully with the FBI ...

TONY: (interupts) I'm not talking anymore. Okay?

SCULLY: Well, that might make things worse and they seem pretty bad already. In your statement you say that Deputy Foster stopped you but you don't say why.

(She pushes a folder toward him.)

MULDER: Come on, you were cruising, right? I mean, a small town like this you're not exactly living La Vida Loca. I know-- I grew up in Dullsville, too, you know. Nothing to do but drive and park.

TONY: How long ago was that?

(MULDER takes the verbal hit.)

TONY: Look. Don't you think I know what you're doing? You're like the tenth cop who's come in here trying to relate to me till I confess.

SCULLY: If you didn't do it, it's all the more reason to clear it up.

TONY: Everything I know is in my statement.

MULDER: Okay, but bear with us 'cause we're old and stupid. (SCULLY appears to hide a smile by looking down.) How long was it between the time you heard the scream to the time you found Deputy Foster?

(TONY doesn't answer.)

SCULLY: Tony, you're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this.

TONY: Maybe ten... 15 seconds.

MULDER: Okay, but you didn't see anyone near the patrol car? You didn't hear anything? And you're still gonna stick with your story that you were the only one there. Is that right?

(Long pause. TONY is very uncomfortable.)

TONY: I want to go back to my cell.

(MULDER and SCULLY go out into the hall and speak quietly.)

SCULLY: 16 years old and his life is over unless he starts telling the truth.

MULDER: If you really think he's guilty, Scully, why don't you ask yourself this: why wouldn't he make up a more plausible cover story? Why didn't he say that, uh, a pickup full of hillbillies drove by and clobbered the Deputy and ran away?

SCULLY: I'm not saying he's guilty, Mulder. I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed did not commit murder but I think that he saw the person who did, and he may be covering up for him.

MULDER: I'm not sure there was a person to see. I think there was a force at work here.

SCULLY: What kind of force?

MULDER: I don't know-- some kind of territorial or spiritual entity, maybe. (SCULLY sighs) Poltergeists have long been associated with violent acts like this and they tend to manifest around young people. They seem to be drawn to the turmoil of adolescence.

SCULLY: (innocently, almost coy) Mulder. Rather than spirits... can we at least start with Tony's friends? (looks like she is playing with his tie) Please? Just... for me? I think there's one person in particular I'd like to talk to.

(MULDER looks meaningfully at the door where CHASTITY left, then back at SCULLY.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4

(CHASTITY, bored, is sitting in a school classroom. It is two minutes to noon. The class is taking a test. A male teacher, MR. BABBITT, is sitting at the head of the room.)

MR BABBITT: Let's wrap it up, people. Two minute warning.

(CHASTITY looks up at the clock. It clicks back one minute, then up to two minutes until noon again. MAX casually enters the classroom, smiles at CHASTITY, and goes up to MR BABBITT's desk.)

MR BABBITT: There goes half your grade, Max. You missed the midterm.

MAX: Not if I take it right now.

MR BABBITT: In one minute?

MAX: Oh, I've been studying.

MR BABBITT: (handing him the test) I don't care who your father is. You fail my test-- it sticks.

MAX: Well, I guess I'd better ace it, then, huh?

(MAX takes the paper, turns and smiles again at CHASTITY. She gives a little wave with her pencil.)

MR BABBITT: Take your seat, young man.

(MAX turns back to MR BABBITT and tosses the test paper back on the desk. All the questions have been penciled in.)

MAX: Piece of cake.

MR BABBITT: It is when you mark them at random.

MAX: Go ahead-- check it.

(MR BABBITT puts the transparent master over the marks on the paper. Every question is correct. He looks back up at MAX.)

MAX: Maybe I got more going on than people know.

(The bell rings. MR BABBITT is not pleased. The STUDENTS begin leaving the classroom. As CHASTITY leaves, she is stopped by MULDER and SCULLY who have been waiting in the hall.)

SCULLY: (showing her badge) Chastity Raines? I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.

CHASTITY: Yeah, I remember you.

(She begins walking to her locker. MULDER and SCULLY follow.)

MULDER: Chastity, what did you and Tony talk about this morning?

CHASTITY: He didn't kill that cop.

MULDER: How can you be so sure?

CHASTITY: Tony just doesn't have it in him.

SCULLY: Do you?

(CHASTITY looks back at them, then opens her locker and gets out a man's purple and yellow school jacket and puts it on.)

MULDER: Were you there when it happened?

CHASTITY: Look, I got to go.

SCULLY: Do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his life for this?

(CHASTITY pauses as she does up her jacket, looking at SCULLY and contemplating what she just said.)

MULDER: Chastity, if you know something now is the time to mention it.

(MAX comes over and stands possessively behind to CHASTITY.)

MAX: Unless they got a warrant, you don't have to say nothing.

MULDER: Wow, you must be her lawyer.

MAX: Let's go.

MULDER: Gee, butting in to our investigation. I wonder what your father, the sheriff, would think.

MAX: How do you know who my dad is?

(MULDER points at the name one of MAX's school folder. We also see that the date is 11/12/99.)

MULDER: You got the same last name.

MAX: Oh, you're good. We're done here. Come on, babe. (to SCULLY as he walks away with his arm around CHASTITY) You must have been a Betty, back in the day.

(MULDER and SCULLY watch them walk down the hall.)

SCULLY: A "Betty"?

MULDER: Back in the day.

(MULDER notices the back of the school jacket on CHASTITY as she walks down the hall - "Adams High Panthers" with the word "SUCKS" added at the bottom. SCULLY's phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully. (pause) What about the murder weapon?



SCENE 5
PITTSFIELD SHERIFF'S STATION
12:24 PM

(MULDER, SCULLY, and SHERIFF HARDEN are in front of an evidence locker.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: All I know is, we put the flashlight in here and now it's gone. It's like it just disappeared into thin air.

SCULLY: How many people have access to this room?

SHERIFF HARDEN: Only me and the dozen deputies under my command.

(MULDER finds a small strip of something on the floor. He picks it up and examines it.)

SCULLY: (glancing up at a video camera) What does the tape show?

SHERIFF HARDEN: That no unauthorized persons came in and no one went anywhere near this locker.

MULDER: (holding up the item he picked up) Was this here before?

SHERIFF HARDEN: I don't know.

SCULLY: Can we take a look at the surveillance tape?

(Later, they are watching the surveillance tape. A guard is sitting at a desk beside the locker.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: You can see that the flashlight was properly secured. It's not like we're running some kind of a half-assed operation here.

SCULLY: No one's saying that you are, Sheriff.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Here's when the state police showed up to take it to the crime lab. There's me going to get it. We open up the locker and it's gone. I maybe, uh, didn't give y'all the warmest welcome but if you have any ideas...

MULDER: (reaching for the remote) May I?

SHERIFF HARDEN: I watched it a dozen times.

SCULLY: Could there be a malfunction with the VCR?

(MULDER begins replaying the tape, slowly.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: I don't see how plus there's no gap in the time code. The murder weapon was the only hard evidence we had. Without it, we got no case. You know what I got to do now? I got to call Ron Foster's widow and tell her that I got to turn his killer loose.

(SHERIFF HARDEN sighs and leaves.)

MULDER: Scully, check this out.

SCULLY: What am I supposed to be seeing?

MULDER: (advancing the tape one frame at a time) Oh, here it comes. Now you see it... and one more frame... now you don't. What do you make of that, Scully? Take another look. Now it's here... Now it's not.

(On the tape, there is a blur on one frame, no blur in the next.)



SCENE 6
REED RESIDENCE
8:52 PM

(TONY and his Mom, MRS. REED, enter the modest house and TONY goes up to his room. MRS. REED comes in behind him. She has a heavy New England blue-collar accent.)

MRS. REED: Are you ready to be straight with me?

TONY: Leave me alone, Mom. Would you just leave me alone? I'm tired.

MRS. REED: This isn't like a bad report card, Anthony. A man is dead.

TONY: I told you, I didn't do it.

MRS. REED: It's just that what you say happened doesn't make sense. There's got to be more to it.

TONY: Well, there isn't. Okay?

MRS. REED: Are those kids involved in this? That boy Max?

TONY: No. Mom, they're the only friends I have here.

MRS. REED: Well, you're done seeing them.

TONY: You don't even know them.

MRS. REED: I do know them-- I was your age once. Tony... we came here to get a fresh start, get away from them bad schools... the wrong crowd. You are doing so well here.

TONY: How would you know? You're never around.

(TONY feels guilty.)

MRS. REED: You think it's my dream to work two jobs? I'm doing it for you, Tony.

TONY: I just want to get some sleep. That's all I want.

MRS. REED: You got a chance at a good life... a real future. We didn't come all this way so you could throw it away.

(She leaves him alone in his room. He lies down. There is a small ping sound like someone throwing rocks at his window. TONY looks out and sees MAX standing by a car at the curb. MAX smiles at him and indicates with his head that TONY should come down and join him.)

(Later, TONY is the passenger in the car driven by MAX down a rural road.)

MAX: Listen to that, man. This car's got guts. Sort of like you that way.

TONY: Who's car is this, Max?

MAX: Chastity told you to shut up, sit tight, and things would be fine. You did that-- it tells me a lot.

TONY: Everything's not fine. We're in a stolen car; a cop is dead.

MAX: Calm down, man. He'd been snooping around. He had to go.

TONY: What do you mean he had to go? What happened out there?

MAX: You got to learn not to ask so many questions.

(MAX pushes his foot down on the gas pedal, the speedometer now pushing 100.)

TONY: Slow the hell down, man. You're freaking me out!

MAX: (smiling) You ain't seen nothing yet.

(He starts to weave the car down the road.)

TONY: Max, look out!

(TONY looks over at MAX in the driver's seat ... MAX is gone. TONY grabs the wheel. As the car starts to crash into a tree, TONY puts his hands in front of his face defensively. The car crashes, the tree cutting the car practically in two. TONY is now standing a few feet from the wrecked car, his hands still in defense-mode and frozen in mid-air. He puts them down and stares at the car in disbelief. MAX startles him by stepping up behind him.)

MAX: I'm going to make you one of us... But I call the shots. Always remember that.



SCENE 7

(X-Files office. CHUCK BURKS, the paranormal lab guy, is sitting at MULDER's desk looking at images from the surveillance video on the computer. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

MULDER: Hey, Chuck.

SCULLY: Sorry to make you trek over here for what's probably a glitch.

MULDER: What'd you come up with?

(MULDER takes off his coat and hangs it over the back of the chair. CHUCK BURKS gets up and MULDER sits in front of the computer, SCULLY beside him.)

CHUCK BURKS: Nothing but eyestrain at first. Then I ran it through my imaging software. I'm here to tell you, it's not a glitch. It's what the camera saw.

MULDER: Buckle up, Scully. I believe Chuck is about to take us on a ride into the paranormal.

CHUCK BURKS: Well, yes and no. Initially, I was thinking spectral manifestation but, uh, with spirit activity you'd expect to see light streaks, auras, atmospheric disturbances, translucent figures. Whatever this is... it's not a ghost.

SCULLY: Especially since ghosts don't go around leaving synthetic polymers in their wake.

MULDER: That's what the gunk on the floor turned out to be.

CHUCK BURKS: Ah. I dig a mystery with layers.

MULDER: (smiling) Chuck, I get the feeling you don't know what the hell this is.

CHUCK BURKS: I cross-referenced the shape's silhouette against every organic and inorganic object in the Library of Congress database. The closest match was a Soviet Acula-class submarine.

SCULLY: I think we can rule that out.

CHUCK BURKS: And then there's this weirdness. My enhancement brought up this dark edge... around the anomaly.

MULDER: A shadow.

CHUCK BURKS: It would fit with the lighting in the room. The problem is, it can't be throwing a shadow unless...

MULDER: Unless it's a solid object.

SCULLY: Which is impossible because it only appears for a single frame.

CHUCK BURKS: One-thirtieth of a second. Now, maybe, uh, SCAG can give us a clearer picture.

SCULLY: Scag?

CHUCK BURKS: Spectrographic color attribute generator. I'm, uh, beta-testing it for JPL. It's still in the tweaking phase but the basic idea is I assign known color values onto the black-and-white image. Then SCAG assigns chromatic values throughout the frame in effect, making an educated guess at, uh...what all the colors might be. It still needs fine-tuning.

(MULDER leans forward with his finger pointing at the now colored image on the screen. Purple and yellow streaks.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: You recognize these colors, Scully?

CUT TO:



SCENE 8

(Big sign for Adam's High School Panthers in the school hallway. Like the back of the school's jackets, the colors are purple and yellow. As TONY walks through the halls, other STUDENTS turn and look at him. He goes over to CHASTITY. She speaks softly and sadly. She looks more tired than she has in previous scenes.)

CHASTITY: Hey, Tony.

TONY: Everyone's looking at me like I'm a criminal.

CHASTITY: I'm not. I heard you took a ride.

TONY: What was that? How did he do it?

CHASTITY: You'll find out.

TONY: Maybe you were right... About me not being cut out for this.

CHASTITY: It's a little late for second thoughts.

(MAX shows up and puts his arm around CHASTITY.)

MAX: (threatening) You trying to move in on my girl?

(TONY has no response. The bell rings.)

MAX: (grins) Saved by the bell.

(They go into MR BABBITT's classroom. Other STUDENTS are staring at TONY. MAX leans forward.)

MAX: Hey... you want to stare at someone, stare at me.

(Immediately, all the other STUDENTS turn away. MR BABBITT begins handing back test papers.)

MR BABBITT: Well, class... I've graded your midterms. Save for a few of you, the news is not good. Mr. Pembleton... What happened? (PEMBLETON looks despondent) Welcome back, Mr. Reed. Expect to make up the test tomorrow. Mr. Harden, you're here on time for a change.

(MAX's paper has a big, red "F" on it.)

MAX: What's this?

MR BABBITT: Self-explanatory, isn't it?

MAX: I got every answer right.

MR BABBITT: Not because you knew the material.

MAX: Are you saying I cheated? How?

MR BABBITT: I have no idea how, but you did, and I won't tolerate it.

(MAX gets up, tosses the test to the floor, and angrily walks out of the classroom.)

MR BABBITT: Back to business, people. Mr. Geider... Mr. Baker...

TONY: (whispering to CHASTITY) How do I tell Max that I want out?

CHASTITY: (whispering) I wish I could help you, Tony. I can't even help myself.

(Later in the lunchroom. TONY is picking at his food. MR BABBITT carries his tray down the aisle. Suddenly, MR BABBITT appears to trip over his own feet and sprawls out on the floor spilling the contents of his tray. STUDENTS laugh. MAX is standing at the end of the lunch room, arms folded, threatening expression.)

BOY: (laughing) Babbitt!

(Camera on MAX again as he crosses his arms, then MAX becomes a blur. MR BABBIT is now staring at his suddenly bloody hands. His face is also bloody, as if he has been severely beaten. STUDENTS recoil in horror. TONY looks over at MAX as he uncrosses his arms, never taking his eyes off MR BABBITT. MAX blurs again and a table slams into MR BABBITT's gut, then slides with him down the lunchroom and slams into the wall, shattering the plaster through MR BABBITT's body. MR BABBITT, still alive, looks up weakly at MAX.)

GIRL: Oh, my God!

(Camera on MAX blurs again and a lunchroom chair flies through the air toward the camera and MR BABBITT's head.)

CUT TO:

(LATER: SCULLY ducks under the police tape holding back numerous curious students and enters the lunch room past a COP.)

SCULLY: Excuse me, please. Thank you.

COP: (to curious students and reporters) Just stay back.

(SCULLY joins MULDER who is already in the room looking at the scene.)

MULDER: I'll show you my theory if you show me yours.

SCULLY: (looking at the squished MR BABBITT) Based on the eyewitness accounts of the students I spoke to, at this moment I'd have to say that I don't have one.

(The camera now shows MR BABBITT pinned to the wall by the table and the chair. Funny in a macabre sort of way.)

MULDER: What about for these globs of goo?

(MULDER shows her more pieces of burnt rubber as they start to walk away from MR BABBITT.)

SCULLY: The ones we found in the evidence room?

MULDER: Yep. I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there.

SCULLY: You think Max did this? Based on what?

MULDER: I spoke to a few students myself. Apparently, Max was angry at Mr. Babbitt because he failed him on his mid-term exam so he had motive.

SCULLY: Well, he may have had motive but he didn't have opportunity. There was nobody here who saw him even go near the victim.

MULDER: Maybe he didn't need to. I pulled his records. Rising attendance and discipline problems over the last few months, but look at his transcript. (shows folder) As his behavior was getting worse his grades were going through the roof. This kid has changed, Scully.

SCULLY: Well, Mulder, he's a teenager. Everything about him is changing. His body and his brain chemistry is in a state of unparalleled upheaval, plus there's peer pressure and substance abuse. Any one of these factors could alter his behavior radically.

MULDER: But what if it's given him a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal ability ... (SCULLY's eyebrow shoots up.) ... that allows him to exert force over a victim without ever laying a finger on him?

SCULLY: That's your theory?

MULDER: Yes, it is. Soon to be proven as soon as I get Max in for questioning.

DEPUTY: Agent, you needed to speak to Sheriff Harden?

MULDER: Yeah, I want to talk to him about his son.

DEPUTY: Uh, he's with him now. They're taking him to the emergency room. Max just collapsed in the parking lot.

CUT TO:

(School corridor. TONY stops CHASTITY who is walking down the hall.)

TONY: You hear about Max? You okay? Where are you going?

CHASTITY: (upset) Tony, the less you know, the better, all right?

(She continues walking down the hall.)



SCENE 9

(Rural road. TONY has followed CHASTITY to the area where he met her and MAX in the teaser. He sees her run into the forest. He follows, but loses sight of her. He finds and enters a cave. In the center of the cave a shaft of light shines into a bright circle. TONY cautiously puts his foot into the light. His whole body shimmers and he pulls his foot back and rubs his right arm as if he was punched. He hesitates a moment, then steps fully into the light. His whole body shimmers and blurs violently and impossibly fast.)



SCENE 10

(MAX's hospital room. SHERIFF HARDEN is standing by the bed. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

MAX: What? No candy? No flowers?

SHERIFF HARDEN: My deputy told me you were coming and why, so you can just turn right around. Whatever the hell happened at that school, my son didn't do it.

SCULLY: Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son a few questions if that's okay.

SHERIFF HARDEN: The boy's sick. The doctors can't even say what's wrong with him.

MULDER: Max could tell them. You know why you collapsed don't you, Max?

MAX: Yeah, too much teen spirit.

MULDER: You think? Smells like murder to me.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Who do you think you're talking to here?

MAX: Yeah, it's not like you got a damn thing on me.

MULDER: You got a problem with authority figures, don't you, Max?

MAX: If I wasted Babbitt, then how did I do it? Am I like Carrie or something? I used some kind of mental powers?

(MAX coughs weakly.)

MULDER: No, something else. You figured out a way to tap into something that gives you superhuman powers. It came in handy with Babbitt and Deputy Foster.

MAX: Man, you're whistling "Dixie."

SCULLY: (reading MAX's file) High temperature and heart rate, low blood sugar, electrolytes show acidosis. All of these symptoms are consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Withdrawal? From what?

MULDER: The rush. I think whatever it is that gives you the power to rearrange furniture and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also gives you quite a buzz.

MAX: Well, if I can do all that, then what's stopping me from doing it to you?

MULDER: I don't know. Maybe the effect's worn off. Maybe you need another fix.

MAX: Well, as soon as I blow out of here, I'll be sure to get one.

SCULLY: That's not going to happen any time soon. Your condition's getting worse and we're not going to be able to help you unless you can tell us what's going on.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Boy, is any of this true?

MAX: No.

SHERIFF HARDEN: You'd better pray I don't find out it is.

MULDER: Sir... Can we have a word outside?

(MULDER and SCULLY exit the room with SHERIFF HARDEN. MAX is in room 224.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: He's not a bad kid. He just needs discipline.

MULDER: If your son is in trouble I'm sure you'd want to know about it. With that in mind we'd like permission to search your house.

SHERIFF HARDEN: You're not getting it. I'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon and call my boy a murderer.

(SHERIFF HARDEN leaves)

SCULLY: There's some test results missing from Max's chart. I think we should track them down.

(SCULLY hands MAX's file to a NURSE as she and MULDER start down the hall.)

NURSE: (entering the room) Thank you.

(CHASTITY is in the hallway outside MAX's room. She watches MULDER and SCULLY walk away.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY are in an x-ray type of viewing room. SCULLY is putting up images of MAX's tests.)

SCULLY: Hot off the presses.

MULDER: Anything interesting?

SCULLY: This can't be right.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions... arthritis in his spine and major joints. Stress fractures, numerous muscle and... and ligament micro-tears.

MULDER: What would cause this?

SCULLY: In a teenager? I can't even imagine. This is the kind of thing that you'd see in someone who's crashed race cars or played pro football for 15 years. Whatever Max is doing, it's killing him.

MULDER: I think I'm starting to get it.

(SCULY stares at him.)

CUT TO:

(NURSES station. The NURSE sits at her desk. She hears a beeping. She looks up to one of the video monitors to see CHASTITY in MAX's room unhooking his IV and helping him get out. The NURSE gets up and goes into MAX's room. No one is there but MAX.)

NURSE: I thought I saw a young lady come in here.

MAX: I wish.

(The NURSE, still suspicious, walks out of the room. Behind her, CHASTITY pushes a wheelchair into MAX's room.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER tosses a large envelope onto a table.)

MULDER: Max Harden's personal effects.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER removes a sneaker from the envelope. The bottom of the sneaker looks like it has been burned off.)

MULDER: Oh... This is it. Those globs we found? This is where they came from. Speed, Scully. Somehow, Max Harden has found a way to move faster than the eye can see.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: That would explain how Babbitt was killed. It would also explain how a chair and a table appeared to move on their own with enough force to penetrate a wall. Force equals mass times acceleration, isn't that right?

SCULLY: Yes, Mulder, but it's impossible. The human body just isn't designed to move like that.

MULDER: Exactly. That is, that is why his is falling apart.

(The NURSE opens the door.)

NURSE: Agents, could you...?

(MULDER and SCULLY follow her to MAX's now empty room.)



SCENE 11

(Forest. MAX and CHASTITY have entered the forest. MAX is stumbling, CHASTITY trying to stop him.)

CHASTITY: Max, Max, please, don't do this. You can stop.

MAX: Sure, just like you can.

CHASTITY: I mean, hurting people. Haven't enough people been hurt? This is not why I got you out! Look, let's just leave here, okay? Let's just go away.

MAX: And do what?

CHASTITY: Find a place to get some help.

MAX: Help for what? This is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I can't go back to things standing still... and neither can you.

(He walks off and leaves her. TONY stumbles toward her.)

CHASTITY: Tony, what are you doing here? You went in that cave, didn't you? You shouldn't have done that.

TONY: It was such a rush... Moving fast like that.

CHASTITY: I didn't want this for you. How did you find it?

TONY: I followed you. I was worried about you.

CHASTITY: That's so sweet. I wish things were different than how they are.

TONY: Maybe they can be. With Max in the hospital, we could go to the cops.

CHASTITY: He's out.



SCENE 12

(To the sound of bells jingling, SHERIFF HARDEN enters his house. He goes upstairs into MAX's room and looks around. There is a poster of The Doors ["No One Here Gets Out Alive"] on the door. There is a stuffed figurine hanging from the ceiling with blood on its head, a road sign with a UFO on it on the wall and several burned out pairs of shoes in the closet. He finds the DEPUTY's flashlight in one of the drawers.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: Oh, my God.

(He hears the door bells jangling again and goes down to investigate. )

SHERIFF HARDEN: Hello?

(The door slams and there is the sound of more bells jangling. He walks into the livingroom cautiously.)

MAX: Boo!

(The SHERIFF spins around to see MAX in the foyer behind him holding the flashlight.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: You killed Ron Foster.

MAX: Yeah, I did.

SHERIFF HARDEN: Why?

MAX: I don't know. You want some great reason?

SHERIFF HARDEN: You little son of a bitch!

(He starts walking toward MAX and MAX blurs. Suddenly, SHERIFF HARDEN doubles over as if he has been hit in the stomach.)

SHERIFF HARDEN: Ow!

MAX: He thought he was really something-- always liked to push people around. Same as Babbitt. Same as you. I'm not afraid of you anymore.

(MAX raises the flashlight to whack the SHERIFF. Sound of bells jangling. TONY, having busted through the door, holds a gun to MAX's head and the flashlight in his other hand.)

TONY: I can't let you do this, Max.



SCENE 13

(Hospital. SHERIFF HARDEN is on a gurney being wheeled down a corridor. SCULLY follows. MULDER joins her and she stops.)

MULDER: Yo, Scully... How bad are his injuries?

SCULLY: Well, it's too soon to tell. He's unconscious and bleeding internally apparently from a blow to the abdomen.

MULDER: Yeah. Delivered with this: (holds up flashlight) Max's weapon of choice against cops.

SCULLY: Why would he leave it behind? You think he's doing it to taunt the police?

MULDER: No, I think somebody intervened. I think that's why the Sheriff is still alive and why his gun is missing.

SCULLY: But if he can do what you claimed then... then who could possibly intervene?

MULDER: It's someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does and someone who's finally standing up to him.

SCULLY: Tony. How do we find him?

MULDER: Well, I would guess the source where Max gets his power from.

SCULLY: The woods near where the deputy was killed. You know, Tony never came clean about what he was doing out there.

MULDER: Well, maybe that's why the deputy was killed. Maybe he got too close to the truth.



SCENE 14

(Rural road. CHASTITY is driving, TONY is the passenger.)

TONY: Chastity, we don't have to be doing this. I told you, I took care of things with Max.

CHASTITY: No, you didn't, and you shouldn't have tried.

TONY: He was gonna kill his father. I had to stop him.

CHASTITY: You stopped him because he let you. He was slowing down. Tony, you've slowed down, too. If we don't get back to the cave before Max does, we're history.

(They get to the site with the no trespassing signs and run into the woods. TONY stumbles and falls.)

CHASTITY: Hurry!

TONY: I'll catch up.

(CHASTITY runs on ahead. TONY follows more slowly and enters the cave. He sees CHASTITY lying crumpled on the floor near the pool of white light. He runs to her side.)

TONY: Chastity?

(There is a blur of light and color. TONY touches her gently.)

TONY: Are you okay?

MAX: You're late, kid.

TONY: What did you do to her?

MAX: Well, she took a swing at me. You believe that? You got it all turned around.

(There's a blurr and TONY is thrown against the far wall. He looks down at the gun holstered at his waist. MAX blurrs and the gun is gone, now in MAX's hand and pointed at TONY.)

MAX: Come on, man. Who do you think you're dealing with?

(MAX tosses the gun into the middle of the floor.)

MAX: All I ever wanted was for you to be my friend, Tony. You stuck a knife in my back. Now I'm going to mess you up.

(CHASTITY moves slightly, then there is a gunshot. MAX yells and freezes as a bullet fired by CHASTITY into his back explodes out of his chest and slowly travels through the air. Very Matrix. TONY is also frozen.)

CHASTITY: I'm sorry, Tony. I can't go back.

(She steps in front of the slowly travelling bullet. It finishes its path with the end of the gunshot sound and she and MAX fall to the ground dead. TONY unfreezes.)

(Outside, MULDER and SCULLY have parked their car and hear the gunshot. They run to the cave and look at what has happened. TONY holds the now dead CHASTITY.)

TONY: Chastity?



SCENE 15

(TONY's hospital room. MRS. REED sits beside the bed. TONY looks up and sees SCULLY in the doorway. SCULLY turns to MULDER who has just arrived.)

SCULLY: Did the USGS show up?

MULDER: Yeah. 18 geologists and three semis full of gear. They covered every inch of that cave.

SCULLY: And what did they come up with?

MULDER: Nothing. Well, bat guano and above-normal magnetic field readings but nothing that would cause a physiological effect.

SCULLY: What'd you expect them to find, Mulder?

MULDER: I don't know. A vortex, like the one in Oregon. Gravitational aberrations, unique chemical compositions, uh, relics that would indicate that the cave was a sacred site... something, anything. I don't know.

SCULLY: Well, you and I were both in there and nothing happened to us. We're still slowpoking around.

MULDER: What if we're too old? Well, you said that teenagers differ from adults chemically and physiologically. What if whatever is in that cave affects only them?

SCULLY: Well, that's doubtful. But no more so than any other theory. I mean, it's worth checking out.

MULDER: Yeah? Well, we can't. As of an hour ago, they pumped concrete into the cave. Sealed it for precautionary reasons. We'll never know. How's he doing?

SCULLY: Bruises and muscle strains, mostly. He'll recover... go back to being a normal kid.

(MULDER and SCULLY look into the room. The MOTHER leaves. We see the clock go from 2:59 to 2:58 to 3:00.)

[THE END]

                                   THE GOLDBERG VARIATION



SCENE 1
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
10:24 PM

(Several men are sitting in a private room playing a high-stakes poker game. One of them is JOE CUTRONA, well-dressed Mafia-type guy. The other men are also well dressed powerful "business men." Except one - HENRY WEEMS. JOE CUTRONA has cards: KK247. He lays down all but the kings.)

JOE CUTRONA: Three.

(DEALER gives him back two more kings and a 5.)

GREY-HAIRED PLAYER: Give me two.

(DEALER hands over cards.)

BALD PLAYER: Two.

(He gets his cards. HENRY WEEMS is a small, nervous, shy, soft-spoken man in his late thirties. He looks very out of place in this room. He's holding three 10s, a Queen and a Three.)

HENRY WEEMS: Can I have five cards, please?

DEALER: Five? What, are you serious? Four is the limit. Let's see your ace.

JOE CUTRONA: If Mr. Weems wants five... give him five.

(DEALER hands the cards over and takes his own.)

DEALER: Dealer takes two.

JOE CUTRONA: (betting) Four.

GREY-HAIRED PLAYER: (folding) Nah-uh.

(The BALD PLAYER also folds.)

HENRY WEEMS: How much is that?

DEALER: Four grand keeps you in. You and your five shiny new cards.

(GREY-HAIRED MAN chuckles.)

HENRY WEEMS: There's $4,000... and four more.

(The other men at the table are surprised. The DEALER slams his hand on the table as he folds.)

JOE CUTRONA: Let's make this interesting. I'm raising you 15 large.

(JOE CUTRONA puts a large stack of chips in the pot.)

HENRY WEEMS: I wouldn't do that. This is all I need.

JOE CUTRONA: You're going to need Depends after you see this hand.

(HENRY WEEMS puts his chips in the pot.)

HENRY WEEMS: Now we show each other our cards?

(Other men look concerned. DOMINIC, a very large dangerous-looking man who has been sitting in the corner, glances at JOE CUTRONA then walks over to stand near HENRY WEEMS.)

JOE CUTRONA: (laying down his cards) Four kings.

(HENRY WEEMS lays down the 8, 9, 10, Jack and Queen of clubs.)

HENRY WEEMS: That's a straight flush, right?

(The men at the table stare at the cards.)

HENRY WEEMS: Beginner's luck.

(HENRY WEEMS takes out a plastic grocery bag and begins filling it with the chips.)

JOE CUTRONA: What the hell do you think you're doing?

HENRY WEEMS: Going home.

JOE CUTRONA: No, no. Not so fast. We expect a chance to win some of our money back.

HENRY WEEMS: Guys, there's over $100,000 here.

JOE CUTRONA: You're damn right there's over $100,000 there.

HENRY WEEMS: $100,000 is all I need. Sorry. I had fun, though. Where can I cash out?

(JOE CUTRONA looks at DOMINIC.)

CUT TO:

(HENRY WEEMS on an elevator with two of CUTRONA's men, ANGIE and SAL. SAL looks a lot like a certain FBI agent we all know. One of them pushes the button for the 29th floor.)

HENRY WEEMS: Guys, I think we're going up instead of down.

(Ominous silence. They roughly drag him out onto the roof and he drops his poker chips.).

HENRY WEEMS: Guys... Guys, this is not what I meant by "cashing out"! Hey! Hey!

(The men throw him off the side of the building. HENRY WEEMS falls to the street. He falls into a large open grate. A moment later we see his hands come up out of the grate as he pulls himself up to the street. He walks away into the night unsteadily, one hand to his right eye.)

SCENE 2
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS
9:17AM

(Busy street corner. SCULLY, wearing a very nice black scoop-necked pant suit, gets out of a taxi. 555-TAXI. As she walks across a metal grate on the sidewalk, she pulls out her cell phone and dials.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hello.

SCULLY: (on phone) Hey, Mulder, it's me. What now?

(Behind SCULLY, the sidewalk grate has opened and a platform begins to rise out of it.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Are you in Chicago?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, I'm in Chicago. I'm on the northeast corner of 7th and Hunter just like you asked. Only you're not here. So where are you?

(MULDER is on the platform directly behind her. Either he is trying to look like a Chicago gangster or his color-blindness was acting up that morning. He is wearing a brownish suit with a dark blue shirt and a dark patterned tie.)

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, around.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah.

MULDER: (hanging up the phone) Hey, nice outfit.

(SCULLY turns to face him and puts her phone away. He is grinning at her. Very cute.)

SCULLY: Hey. What's down there?

MULDER: Before you check out down there check out up there. (points to the top of the tall building) Top two floors are leased to one Jimmy Cutrona whose name you might be familiar with.

SCULLY: Organized crime. The Bureau's been trying to build a racketeering case against him for the past few years. Gambling, extortion, murder.

MULDER: Which is why last night there were two agents parked across the street in surveillance. They witnessed a man being thrown from Cutrona's ROOF AT 10:40 p.m. This man fell for 30 floors, plus the distance down this shaft, because these doors just happened to be open-- straight through, nothing but net.

SCULLY: Ouch.

MULDER: I'm guessing that's what he said. After, he got up, climbed out of here and scampered off into the night.

(SCULLY and MULDER get on the platform and MULDER pushes the button to lower them to the basement level.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you keep saying "this man." Who is this man?

(SCULLY takes out her flashlight and begins looking around.)

MULDER: No idea. He got away. The agents gave chase, but no clear description.

SCULLY: Was this basement thoroughly searched?

MULDER: No. Technically, falling 300 feet and surviving isn't a crime.

SCULLY: And your theory is?

MULDER: What if this man had some kind of special capability? Some kind of genetic predisposition towards rapid healing, or tissue regeneration?

SCULLY: So, basically, what if we were looking for Wile E. Coyote? You're saying that he is invulnerable, right?

(MULDER starts to say "Yeah," but stops himself. Very funny.)

SCULLY: You know in 1998, there was a British soldier who plummeted 4,500 feet when his parachute failed and he walked away with a broken rib.

MULDER: What's your point?

SCULLY: My point is that if there's a wind gust, or a sudden updraft and, plus, if he landed in exactly the right way, I mean, I don't know. Maybe he just got lucky.

MULDER: (affectionate sarcasm) What if he got really, really lucky? That's your big scientific explanation, Scully? (laughing as SCULLY flashes the light across his face) I mean, how many thousands of variables would have to convene in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Well, thousands.

(SCULLY looks closely at a laundry cart in the basement. The wheel castors have been folded out as if a great weight landed in the laundry cart. The logo on the side of the cart is for Grayson's Linen Service.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Look at this. If this cart were on the platform when he hit, that would explain the condition of these wheels. And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life?

MULDER: We'd have to find him to ask.

SCULLY: Yeah, we have to find him.

(As MULDER sifts through the towels in the cart a small round object flips out onto the floor. They bend down to look at it. MULDER picks it up. It is a prosthetic eye.)

MULDER: Looks like maybe we've found part of him already.



SCENE 3
MELROSE PARK, ILLINOIS
10:23 AM

(Outside a low rent apartment building. MULDER and SCULLY are looking at the doorbell panel. MULDER pushes 313's buzzer and they wait.)

SCULLY: I think you're taking a flier here, Mulder. There's got to be at least 600 people with prosthetic eyes in the greater Chicago area.

MULDER: Yeah, but only this one Henry Weems made an appointment this morning to get a new one.

(MULDER buzzes again.)

SCULLY: Maybe he can't see his way to the door.

(MULDER smiles at her joke. An elderly lady with a rolling shopping basket comes out of the building. MULDER catches the door before it closes behind her.)

MULDER: Come on, Scully. I'm feeling lucky.

(MAGGIE LUPONE, late thirties, frustrated, comes out of her apartment and stops MULDER and SCULLY as they get off the elevator.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: Can you help me? It's an emergency.

(She leads them to her apartment. The kitchen sink is spurting water all over the kitchen floor.)

SCULLY: Ma'am, we're not plumbers.

MAGGIE LUPONE: I didn't say you were. I just want the damn water turned off so that I can go to work. (handing a plumber's wrench to MULDER) Look, you've got to be stronger than me, right? Valve's under the sink.

(MULDER holds the wrench for a moment, then reluctantly goes over to the sink.)

MULDER: Your building super-- Henry Weems-- he isn't around?

(MULDER crawls under the sink to work on the pipe.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: Mr. Dependable? Might as well wait for Jimmy Hoffa to show up.

(RICHIE LUPONE, a boy of about ten, joins them in the kitchen.)

RICHIE LUPONE: You're turning it the wrong way.

MAGGIE LUPONE: Hey, Richie sweetheart, back in bed.

RICHIE LUPONE: But, Mom...

MAGGIE LUPONE: "Buts" are for sitting and I want yours back in bed.

(She gently sends RICHIE LUPONE out of the room, then turns back to MULDER who is still turning the joint the wrong way.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: He's right. Clockwise.

MULDER: I know that. Clockwise.

(The joint pops open. Water is now spraying from the pipe under the sink also. MULDER, now drenched stands up slowly. SCULLY covers her mouth to try to keep from laughing. There is a creaking sound, and MULDER suddenly crashes through the floor to the room below. Alarmed, SCULLY runs to the hole.)

SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?

(She sees MULDER amid the floor debris.)

MULDER: Yeah, it's all right. My ass broke the fall. Guess who I found. (to someone else in the room) Henry Weems, I presume?

(HENRY WEEMS has a black eye patch over the right socket.)

(Later, HENRY WEEMS, carrying a toolbox, leads MULDER and SCULLY into his apartment. The living room is full of homemade Rube Goldbergesque machines. [SEE: HTTP://www.rubegoldberg.com/ for more info.] MULDER is drying his hair with a towel.)

HENRY WEEMS: Next time, leave the plumbing to a professional.

MULDER: Oh, uh... Oh, uh... You want to try this on for size, Cinderella?

(MULDER holds out the fake eye wrapped in the wet towel. HENRY WEEMS takes it and begins cleaning it off.)

SCULLY: Mr. Weems, why were you hiding in a vacant apartment?

HENRY WEEMS: Not hiding-- avoiding.

SCULLY: Avoiding whom?

HENRY WEEMS: You people. Now that you found me let's just get it over with. No way am I testifying against Jimmy Cutrona.

SCULLY: Last night, Cutrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue-- is that correct?

HENRY WEEMS: You didn't hear it from me. I'm not letting you people move me to Muncie, Indiana, to milk cows.

MULDER: More to the point, you survived a, uh... 300-foot fall essentially un... harmed.

(There is a squishing sound as HENRY WEEMS puts is eye back in. MULDER is disgusted, but at the same time fascinated. He glances at SCULLY, then back to HENRY WEEMS.)

HENRY WEEMS: I don't know. Maybe... The wind was just right and I landed on a bunch of towels-- no biggie.

SCULLY: You got lucky?

HENRY WEEMS: Yeah, I guess, except... you should look at my... bruise. (shows them his elbow)

MULDER: (unsympathetically): Oh...

HENRY WEEMS: Plus, I didn't get to keep my poker winnings.

SCULLY: So that's what you were doing there last night-- playing poker?

HENRY WEEMS: Cutrona thought I was cheating. I wasn't. But like I said, you didn't hear it from me.

MULDER: Must have been a high-stakes game, I imagine. Did you win a lot of money?

HENRY WEEMS: I don't know... A little.

(MULDER is looking at one of the machines.)

MULDER: What is that? Did you make it?

HENRY WEEMS: Uh-huh. It's sort of a hobby.

MULDER: Mm-hmm. Mind if I...?

(MULDER pushes a lever which releases a ball which rolls down a spiral which drops something which rolls a spool of duct tape which flips something, eventually releasing a lot of little balls which open a trapdoor that causes a little wooden man on a scaffold to be hanged.)

MULDER: (laughing) Ah... That's craftsmanship. What does it mean?

HENRY WEEMS: What do you mean "what does it mean?"

MULDER: Yeah, what's-what's...

HENRY WEEMS: It doesn't mean anything. I just sort of... I don't know.

MULDER: It's cause and effect.

HENRY WEEMS: (uncomfortable) So, are-are we done here?

SCULLY: Mr. Weems, can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Cutrona?

HENRY WEEMS: Nope. No way, Jose.

SCULLY: Well, it would be in your best interest. He's tried to kill you once and he will undoubtedly do it again.

MULDER: Yeah, we can protect you.

HENRY WEEMS: I'll take my chances.

(Later. MULDER and SCULLY are standing at the elevator. SCULLY pushes the down button.)

SCULLY: So, here's the plan, as I see it: we inform the Chicago field office about Weems, leaving it to them to secure his testimony, you change your clothes ...

(MULDER raises his eyebrows, SCULLY smiles.)

SCULLY: ... we fly back to D.C. by sunset and all is right with the world.

MULDER: Come on, Scully, you're going to dump this case just as it's getting interesting.

SCULLY: "Interesting," Mulder was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote. (she pushes the button again) Come on, Mulder, this guy just got lucky. There's no X-File here.

MULDER: Maybe his luck is the X-File.

(SCULLY decides they have waited long enough for the elevator.)

SCULLY: Stairs.

(SCULLY enters the staircase followed by MULDER. As the door closes, immediately the elevator bell dings and one of CUTRONA's men, ANGIE, steps out and heads for HENRY WEEMS' apartment.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY walking out the front door. MULDER is feeling around in his wet pockets then turns quickly to try to catch the door before it closes. He misses.)

MULDER: Oh... Car keys. Must have lost them when I fell.

CUT TO:

(ANGIE, gun in hand, kicks in the door to HENRY WEEMS' apartment. Just as he is about to fire at HENRY WEEMS, MULDER rings the buzzer. ANGIE glances over at the buzzer in the apartment and fires. The bullet hits a lamp. The lamp falls to the floor knocking over the ironing board. HENRY WEEMS jumps over the couch to hide, taking the couch over with him. ANGIE starts toward HENRY WEEMS but trips and does a spectacular flip through the air. MULDER and SCULLY who by this time heard the gunshot and have gotten back in the building and come down the hall, guns in hand, get to the door of the apartment. They stare at ANGIE who is now dead and hanging by one shoelace from the still spinning ceiling fan. HENRY WEEMS is gone.)



SCENE 4

(The apartment. Crime scene. A police photographer is taking pictures of the body still hanging from the fan. MULDER watches him.)

MULDER: So, you get many of these?

(The PHOTOGRAPHER shakes his head in disgust and walks away from MULDER, ignoring him. SCULLY, finishes talking to a policeman and crosses to MULDER.)

SCULLY: So, uh, we've searched the entire building and there's no sign of Henry Weems. I'm guessing that he's on the run.

MULDER: Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini a.k.a. "Angie the Animal." He's an enforcer for the Cutrona family and I don't think his visit was friendly.

SCULLY: You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense?

MULDER: Skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed "The Animal"? I don't think so. You and I both know Weems didn't kill anybody. Besides, we were just gone for two minutes. This guy doesn't have a scratch on him. I'm thinking it was a heart attack.

SCULLY: What the hell happened here, Mulder?

MULDER: Cause... and effect.

SCULLY: Meaning...?

MULDER: Okay, so... watch. (MULDER acts out the attack, interspersed with footage of the actual attack.) So Bellini kicks down the door-- whaa gaa!-- poised to kill Weems, right? And just as he's about to pull the trigger a noise startles him... the buzzer-- when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment. So when he does pull the trigger, his aim is off, right? And he hits the lamp, which falls over and knocks over the ironing board, so as the bullet ricochets Weems dives over the sofa. Now, when Bellini goes for him he trips over the ironing board, bounces off the chair, flips end over end and his shoelace gets caught in the fan-- QED.

(SCULLY gives a small laugh. The shoelace suddenly breaks and the body falls to the floor.)

MULDER: CAUSE AND EFFECT: seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences that appear unrelated and random beforehand but which seem to chain-react in Henry Weems' favor.

SCULLY: Dumb luck?

MULDER: Yeah, he seems to have tapped into it somehow. He-he won big at poker; he-he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper... and now this.

(RICHIE LUPONE has come out of his room and is looking in the apartment curiously.)

SCULLY: Hang on a second.

MULDER: Okay.

SCULLY: (she goes to RICHIE) Hey. Your name's Richie, right?

RICHIE LUPONE: Yeah.

SCULLY: I'm Dana.

RICHIE LUPONE: Hi.

SCULLY: (gently turning RICHIE away from the scene) Why don't we, uh, head back to your room? I'm sure that's what your mom would want.

(In RICHIE's room, SCULLY sits beside him as he lies in bed. Sports memorabilia line the walls.)

SCULLY: So I'm guessing you're a sports fan. Which one's your favorite?

RICHIE LUPONE: Well, it used to be basketball. But now the Bulls suck, so I think maybe baseball.

SCULLY: I like baseball, too. (SCULLY notices another intricate Rube Goldbergesque contraption in the room.) Did Henry make this for you?

(SCULLY starts the toy. After a complicated series of events on the board, a ball is thrown into a hoop. She chuckles.)

SCULLY: That's pretty neat.

RICHIE LUPONE: Yeah. He made it for me when I was in the hospital. He said... it's 'cause... everything happens for a reason... only just sometimes it's hard for us to see.

SCULLY: You went to the hospital because of your liver?

RICHIE LUPONE: It doesn't work so good. (pause) Police looking for Henry?

SCULLY: Yeah. They just want to talk to him. Do you have any idea where he might have gone?

RICHIE LUPONE: Mm-mm. Since I got sick, he hardly ever goes out.

(SCULLY returns to MULDER.)

MULDER: Boy give you any leads?

SCULLY: He knows nothing.

(They begin walking down the hall.)

SCULLY: Mulder, as to your theory...

MULDER: Mm-hmm?

SCULLY: Why would the world's most supernaturally lucky man work as a building superintendent? I mean, why doesn't he just run down to the Illinois state lottery, enter, and, you know, he'd win automatically?

(HENRY WEEMS is in the floor vent beside them listening to their conversation through a heating duct.)

(Later, HENRY WEEMS is sitting beside RICHIE LUPONE's bed. RICHIE LUPONE opens his eyes and smiles.)

HENRY WEEMS: How you feeling, pal?

RICHIE LUPONE: I'm okay. The police are looking for you, though. How come?

HENRY WEEMS: Uh... you know-- you do folks a favor, wire the joint for free cable... don't worry about it. You going to be okay by yourself for a while?

RICHIE LUPONE: Where you going?

HENRY WEEMS: Something I got to do I've been putting off. You get some rest.

CUT TO:

(Outside. SCULLY is standing beside the car with her phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) That's it? ... Got nothing else. Okay. Thank you.

(She hangs up and joins MULDER in the car.)

MULDER: Henry Weems has no police record, I assume?

SCULLY: He has no record of any kind, Mulder. He doesn't earn enough in a year to file tax returns. He has no savings account, no checking account, no insurance. Doesn't even have a video rental card for that matter. He doesn't even have a driver's license. I mean, it's like he's intentionally stayed off the radar. He's retired from the world.

MULDER: Ever since December, 1989. (shows her a newspaper clipping) When a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan carrying 21 passengers. There was one survivor.

SCULLY: Henry.

MULDER: Yeah. That's how he lost his eye. Snowy night, Christmas rush. He'd been bumped from three previous flights before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane. Guess what seat number.

SCULLY: 13?

MULDER: On flight seven.

SCULLY: More good luck, you're saying?

MULDER: Call it good or bad, but maybe that's where it all started. What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage? One whose fortunes had been irrevocably, permanently changed? Before 1989, Henry held down a job for nine years at the train yard but after the accident, as you said it's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth. He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park.

SCULLY: Mulder, there are millions of reasons for that including survivor's guilt. I mean, what doesn't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky.

MULDER: What doesn't track for me is why he's resurfaced after all these years. Why he's suddenly decided to use his luck in this way.



SCENE 5

(HENRY WEEMS enters a convenience store that sells lottery tickets. The store clerk, an older man, MAURICE ALBERT, is finishing a sale.)

MAURICE THE CLERK: All right. Take care of yourself, Brother.

CUSTOMER: (leaving the store) Later.

(HENRY WEEMS goes to the counter.)

HENRY WEEMS: Hey, what's the lottery up to?

MAURICE THE CLERK: $28 million.

HENRY WEEMS: I don't need that much.

MAURICE THE CLERK: You don't need that much. How much do you need, uh, Rockefeller?

HENRY WEEMS: More like 100 grand.

(MAURICE THE CLERK rips off one of the tickets and sells it to HENRY WEEMS.)

MAURICE THE CLERK: Here goes. One dollar.

(HENRY WEEMS carries the ticket over to where another customer, a young man with a spiky punk rocker hair-cut, is rubbing off a ticket.)

PUNK: These suck.

(HENRY WEEMS uses his Leatherman tool to rub off his own ticket. A TV is on. NEWSWOMAN Megan MacLean of WTMK is broadcasting.)

NEWSWOMAN ON TV: Police have confirmed that a Melrose Park building superintendent is wanted for questioning in a case some sources term an unusually vicious gangland slaying.

(PUNK looks over at HENRY WEEMS' ticket.)

PUNK: You did it! You won 100 grand!

NEWSWOMAN ON TV:... One source close to the case described it as a clear...

HENRY WEEMS: (to clerk) Where do I collect the money?

MAURICE THE CLERK: (excited) They'll mail it to you. $8,200 a month for 12 months. Yeah!

HENRY WEEMS: That's too long.

(Disappointed, HENRY WEEMS drops the ticket into the trashcan. There is a beat, then the PUNK dives into the can and retrieves the ticket.)

HENRY WEEMS: No, please. I wouldn't do that.

PUNK: Oh, baby. Oh, sweet baby.

MAURICE THE CLERK: Anything in the trash can is store property.

PUNK: Yeah, right. In your face.

HENRY WEEMS: No, just throw it away. Something bad is going to happen.

PUNK: So long, suckers.

(The PUNK runs out and stands in the middle of the street holding up his ticket.)

PUNK: I did it! I won! I won the lottery! 100 grand, fools. 100 grand!

(Sound of tires screeching as a large truck hits the PUNK.)



SCENE 6

(Later, in front of the store. The PUNK, oxygen mask in place, is loaded onto an ambulance.)

PARAMEDIC: On three... One, two, three.

(SCULLY is talking to MAURICE THE CLERK. She shows him a picture of Henry Weems.)

SCULLY: So, let me get this straight. This is the man who initially won the money?

MAURICE THE CLERK: Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive this man fled on foot?

MAURICE THE CLERK: Mm-hmm.

SCULLY: Afterwards, the man who was hit by the truck handed you the lottery card, and said...

MAURICE THE CLERK: (proudly) "Maurice, I want you to have this."

SCULLY: (skeptical) Mm-hmm. Thank you, Mr. Albert. I think that will be all.

MAURICE THE CLERK: Thank you.

(MAURICE THE CLERK walks away. MULDER joins SCULLY.)

SCULLY: For such a fortunate man a lot of unfortunate things happen in Henry Weems' wake.

MULDER: Maybe that's part of the package. Can't have one without the other.

SCULLY: So, Mulder, Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket. Why?

MULDER: Maybe it's like you said. Why wouldn't the luckiest man in the world enter the lottery? (they realize) Actually, that's exactly what you said about an hour after you said it.



SCENE 7

(MULDER is using his flashlight to look in the heating vent right outside HENRY WEEMS' apartment. SCULLY comes out of the apartment.)

SCULLY: Well, he's not in his place and he's not with Richie. You think he hid in there?

MULDER: He doesn't "hide," he "avoids."

SCULLY: Pretty damn well, I'd say. That thing must go all over the building, Mulder. I'll start with the roof if you want to start with the basement.

(MULDER watches as SCULLY goes over to the stairs, then he joins her. As the door to the stairwell closes, another of JOE CUTRONA's men, SAL, rounds the corner of the hall and heads for the apartment. He finds it empty, but notices the uncovered vent, puts his gun away and looks at it.)

(In another room downstairs, HENRY WEEMS is using his Leatherman tool to carve another wooden figure. He hears the doorknob rattling. HENRY WEEMS puts the tool in his pocket and hides. MULDER enters the room and looks around. He notices the vent in the room. He pulls the cover off and drags HENRY WEEMS out.)

HENRY WEEMS: Hey... hey. Watch the rough stuff.

MULDER: Henry Weems... you're a hard man to track down.

HENRY WEEMS: I'm working here.

MULDER: Oh? You and I are going to have a talk. (MULDER pushes him into a chair.) Just sit right here and don't move, okay?

HENRY WEEMS: Tough guy.

(MULDER pulls out his phone to call SCULLY. HENRY WEEMS sees SAL in the doorway, gun in hand.)

HENRY WEEMS: Oh, crap. Not again.

(SAL aims at HENRY WEEMS and is startled to see MULDER who is startled to see him. SAL fires at HENRY WEEMS. The bullet bounces off of HENRY WEEMS chest, grazes MULDER's arm, bounces off two walls and lands in the center of SAL's chest. SAL falls to the ground. SCULLY appears in the door. She and MULDER stare at HENRY WEEMS who pulls the now dented Leatherman tool out of his breast pocket and shows it to them.)



SCENE 8
ST. PATRICIA'S HOSPITAL
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

(Hospital emergency room. SAL is lying face down on a gurney, his back bandaged.)

NURSE: Let's get him up to OR 40. Coming through.

(MULDER, in his t-shirt, is getting his wound bandaged by an INTERN. He smiles at her as she finishes up and leaves.)

HENRY WEEMS: Does it hurt?

MULDER: (putting on his shirt) Stings a bit. But I'll live.

(SCULLY joins them and hands MULDER a new pack of cards.)

MULDER: Come over here, Henry. I want to try something.

HENRY WEEMS: What's that about?

SCULLY: I haven't a clue.

(MULDER cuts the deck and shows a card.)

MULDER: Nine of clubs. You go.

HENRY WEEMS: What for?

MULDER: I think you know.

(Reluctantly, HENRY WEEMS turns over the 10 of clubs.)

MULDER: (faking surprise) Uh, you win. Double or nothing.

(MULDER shuffles the cards and flips over the King of diamonds.)

MULDER: Whoo-hoo! Tough to beat.

(HENRY WEEMS flips over the Ace of spades.)

MULDER: You win again.

SCULLY: Mulder, what does that prove?

MULDER: It proves that if we played this 10,000 times in a row he would win 10,000 times in a row. He's incapable of losing. How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe, Henry?

(Pause.)

HENRY WEEMS: It's a nightmare. You have no idea.

MULDER: No, no, I do, 'cause when you get lucky-- really, really lucky-- people around you tend to suffer. Is that right?

HENRY WEEMS: I think it's a balance thing. Something good happens to me and everybody else has to take it in the keister.

MULDER: So you've stayed close to home mostly, kept a low profile but recently you've been venturing out a little further. You played poker with those mobsters.

HENRY WEEMS: I figured they could stand the trimming. Bunch of goombah jerks... They got issues, man.

MULDER: You don't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt but then you went and you played the lottery.

HENRY WEEMS: I knew I shouldn't have done that. I needed the money.

MULDER: For what?

(Pause.)

SCULLY: For Richie, right?

HENRY WEEMS: (sitting) It's the complications from his hepatitis. He's on every donor list they got. But he's got a rare blood type-- B-negative. And he's C-N.... something.

SCULLY: CMV negative. Cytomegalovirus.

HENRY WEEMS: There's no way they're going to find a donor in time. There's a treatment program in England. 100 grand gets him in. It's experimental, but it's the best chance he's got now. Am I under arrest?

MULDER: No.

SCULLY: However, you will need protection from Cutrona and his men.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a look. HENRY WEEMS turns over another card from MULDER's deck. It is the King of hearts.)

HENRY WEEMS: I'd say they need protection from me.

(HENRY WEEMS walks away down the hall.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder. That was utterly irresponsible. You're feeding the delusions of a man who has had three attempts made upon his life. You're supposed to be talking him into protective custody, not out of it.

MULDER: I'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger.

(As MULDER and SCULLY continue their conversation, we see HENRY WEEMS leave the hospital just as JOE CUTRONA and the big guy, DOMINIC, arrive. JOE CUTRONA is holding a bouquet of flowers.)

MULDER: (voice) As it is, he's doing a better job on Cutrona's organization than the FBI. I'm wondering if we shouldn't make him an honorary agent.

(JOE CUTRONA sees HENRY WEEMS, and nods for DOMINIC to go after him. DOMINIC begins following him.)

SCULLY: (voice) Mulder, you're putting an astounding amount of faith in coincidence and luck. Essentially, you're betting a man's life on it. And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks you have to know they all eventually end.

(In the hospital, SCULLY flips over the Ace of hearts from MULDER's deck.)

SCULLY: Luckiest man in the world? Hell, Mulder, I just beat him.

(MULDER gets his jacket and runs toward the exit.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Come on, Scully.

(MULDER runs out of the hospital and sees HENRY WEEMS just as DOMINIC, switchblade in hand, is approaching him.)

MULDER: Henry!

(HENRY WEEMS runs into the street and is hit by a truck. DOMINIC walks away. MULDER runs to HENRY WEEMS and reaches down to feel for a pulse. The fake eye has once again popped out and is resting on the pavement. MULDER looks up at SCULLY.)



SCENE 9

(LUPONE's apartment. RICHIE LUPONE is on the floor playing with the toy that HENRY WEEMS made for him. We see him from the back. He keeps scratching at his neck and shoulder. MAGGIE LUPONE enters.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: You're supposed to be resting.

RICHIE LUPONE: I am resting.

MAGGIE LUPONE: Playing on the floor doesn't count. Don't you ever get tired of this thing?

RICHIE LUPONE: Henry said it's educational.

MAGGIE LUPONE: Yeah, well, I don't want you believing everything that Henry says.

(MAGGIE LUPONE has helped her son up and is leading him to the bed.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: Did you know the police are looking for him?

RICHIE LUPONE: Henry said it's no big deal.

MAGGIE LUPONE: When did you see...?

RICHIE LUPONE: Mom, what's wrong?

(MAGGIE LUPONE stares at his face. His eyes are a sickly yellow and his lips are bluish-grey.)

CUT TO:

(Hospital room. HENRY WEEMS is resting on a bed. MULDER comes over to SCULLY as she pulls the privacy curtain and they speak quietly.)

MULDER: How's he doing?

SCULLY: Well, he's got a bruised rib and a black eye. It certainly could have been worse. And don't tell me he just got lucky.

MULDER: Far from it. Maybe what you said about streaks is right. It looks like his has just about run its course.

SCULLY: I don't mean to make light of his misfortune but it may have knocked some sense into his head. He's agreed to testify against Cutrona.

CUT TO:

(CUTRONA's dining room. JOE CUTRONA sets down a teacup.)

JOE CUTRONA: What?

DOMINIC: Our guy from the justice department just called. They're filing a federal warrant this afternoon. This mook Weems...

JOE CUTRONA: This mook Weems was street pizza last I heard from you.

DOMINIC: He was. I don't know what it is. Maybe he has some special ability. He's impervious or something. Anyway, we can't get to him. They got cops all over the hospital.

JOE CUTRONA: Who says we have to get to him?

CUT TO:

(LUPONE's apartment. PARAMEDICS are wheeling RICHIE LUPONE out on a gurney.)

RICHIE LUPONE: I want the toy Henry made me, Mom. Can you please go get it?

MAGGIE LUPONE: Uh, sure, honey.

(She looks uncertainly at the PARAMEDIC.)

PARAMEDIC: We got to go.

MAGGIE LUPONE: (kissing his forehead) All right, Richie. I will bring it and I will follow you there. I will meet you at the hospital, okay?

RICHIE LUPONE: Mm.

(RICHIE LUPONE is wheeled out. MAGGIE LUPONE gets the toy, then puts a few clothes into a bag. We see DOMINIC enter her apartment.)



SCENE 10

(RICHIE LUPONE's hospital room. He looks bad. HENRY WEEMS is with him as MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

HENRY WEEMS: Did you find her?

SCULLY: No.

HENRY WEEMS: You know Cutrona took her. He did it to keep me from testifying.

MULDER: And he's who we're focused on but there's no sign of a kidnapping, there's no ransom note.

HENRY WEEMS: He's too smart for that.

MULDER: Which makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant.

SCULLY: We'll get one, though.

HENRY WEEMS: When? Tomorrow? Next week? Could someone sit with him at least? (starts to leave)

MULDER: Hold up, Henry. Henry, what if what I said before wasn't true? That your luck hasn't changed? Maybe all this is happening for a reason.

HENRY WEEMS: So you're saying that Maggie getting taken is a good thing?

MULDER: No, I'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck, but we can't tell yet. We're not in that position. We can't see the forest for the trees.

(HENRY WEEMS tries to put on his jacket, but the sleeve rips. Frustrated, he leaves.)

MULDER: How is he?

SCULLY: Not good. If we don't find a donor in the next few hours...

MULDER: Scully, what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems' life somehow becomes an integral part of his luck, including you and I?

SCULLY: Mulder, you're speaking as if we're all trapped in one of those contraptions that he built.

(MULDER starts to walk out of the room.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: Looking for Maggie Lupone. (He lifts up a patient's chart and gets a phone book from the nurses' station.) Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation. I say we roll with it.

(MULDER opens the book to a random page, waves his hand in the air with a dramatic flourish and lets his finger fall. They look at the ad. It is for a daycare center. "MUHAYMIN DAYCARE - Nurturing the Children of Islam Since 1983.")

MULDER: Yeah, let's call that a dry run.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER opens to another page and lets his finger fall. This time it lands on Grayson's Linen Service.)

CUT TO:

(CUTRONA's building. DOMINIC roughly escorts HENRY WEEMS off the elevator to face JOE CUTRONA.)

DOMINIC: Look who came calling.

HENRY WEEMS: I wanted to tell you personally that there's no hard feelings. I'm not testifying against you. Just let Maggie Lupone go.

JOE CUTRONA: "Maggie"? I don't know anybody named Maggie. (to DOMINIC) Do you know anybody named Maggie?

(JOE CUTRONA and DOMINIC laugh sarcastically.)

HENRY WEEMS: Fellas, don't jerk me around.

JOE CUTRONA: Jerk you around? You tried to cheat me out of a hundred large, you kill Angie, you put Sal in the hospital-- I'm jerking you around?

HENRY WEEMS: I apologize for my choice of words. Please, just let her go. Her kid's really sick. I don't care what happens to me.

JOE CUTRONA: You'll care. By the time I'm finished, you'll definitely care.

(JOE CUTRONA and DOMINIC, holding onto HENRY WEEMS, enter the basement of the building. Lots of industrial clothes washing machines are around. MAGGIE LUPONE is locked behind a chain-link fence.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: Henry? Richie-- how is he?

(DOMINIC shoves HENRY WEEMS against a cart which knocks an iron into some water. There is a large metal hook on a cable above him.)

JOE CUTRONA: (picking up what looks like a whip) Not that one. Use the small one.

MAGGIE LUPONE: Hey. Henry...

(DOMINIC hooks HENRY WEEMS' hands to a smaller hook across the room. JOE CUTRONA pushes a button, but nothing happens. DOMINIC flips a main power switch. JOE CUTRONA pushes the button and HENRY WEEMS is pulled up into the air.)

MAGGIE LUPONE: (shaking the fence) Don't you hurt him you son of a bitch!

JOE CUTRONA: Shut her up.

MAGGIE LUPONE: Henry!

(DOMINIC starts for MAGGIE LUPONE. As he does, the iron lying in the water shorts out causing a shock to go up the cord, into the light and into the chain-link fence just as DOMINIC is unlocking it. He is electrocuted and falls to the floor. The hook from which HENRY WEEMS is suspended swings away causing the large hook to start sliding down the cable. JOE CUTRONA looks up just in time to see the large hook crash into his face.)

CUT TO:

(Chicago skyline. All the power in the city flickers.)

CUT TO:

(RICHIE LUPONE's hospital room. SCULLY is sitting beside his bed. She looks up as the lights flicker and surge. The sign for the center, "R.I. CHILDES Pediatric Care" flickers. When it comes back on, the letters L, D, and S don't light up so that the sign spells RICHIE. SCULLY stares at it.)

CUT TO:

(Basement. HENRY WEEMS has gotten off the hook and helps MAGGIE LUPONE out of the fenced in area. They look at JOE CUTRONA's body. MULDER and several policemen enter the basement. MULDER sees JOE CUTRONA lying dead in a laundry cart, the large hook lying on his crushed head. His medical ID bracelet is visible proclaiming his blood-type as B-Neg.)



SCENE 11

(RICHIE LUPONE's hospital room. He is much better and smiling. MAGGIE LUPONE is beside him. MULDER, SCULLY and HENRY WEEMS are watching them through the window.)

MULDER: What are the odds for Cutrona being a perfect match? A thousand-to-one? A million-to-one?

SCULLY: Maybe higher. Maybe everything does happen for a reason... whether we see it or not.

MULDER: Maybe your luck is changing.

HENRY WEEMS: Maybe.

(HENRY WEEMS joins the LUPONES in the room. MULDER and SCULLY watch as HENRY WEEMS starts the toy and turns to RICHIE LUPONE. As the little ball pops into the basket, SCULLY smiles up at MULDER.)

[THE END]
                                    ORISON


SCENE 1

(Prison chapel room. Bare bricks with a cross at one end. About 20 prisoners are listening to the Reverend ORISON, 60's, preach. He has a very evangelical style.)

REVEREND ORISON: God's love will set us free. And I believe... if I pray for that love... if I get down on my knees... (he does) ... and allow God to enter my hardened, lonely miserable heart and change me through and through ... that miracle ... will come. (he gets up and walks through the prisoners) Now, who here believes that with me? Do you? Do you?

(BRIGHAM, a prisoner, gazes with adoration at REVEREND ORISON.)

BRIGHAM: Yes, sir, I believe it.

(REVEREND ORISON looks at another prisoner.)

REVEREND ORISON: (to DONNIE PFASTER) Do you? Well, believe, because God's love is not just some slogan. (ORISON moves on, preaching to the room, as the camera stays on DONNIE PFASTER) It's a promise straight to you from the Lord Almighty Himself. A promise paid for with the blood of his only begotten son, Jesus Christ of Nazareth. All you have to do ... is believe.

PRISONERS: Amen!

(A GUARD is not pleased with REVEREND ORISON.)

REVEREND ORISON: God's love will set you free. Now, doesn't that just lift up your heart and make you want to say Glory! Amen!

(As he says "Glory, Amen," REVEREND ORISON stamps his foot on the floor and raises his uplifted palm. As the PRISONERS echo him, they also stamp their feet.)

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

(ORISON picks up a small glass dish filled with what we assume is holy water. He dips his fingertips in it and sprinkles various prisoners as he talks and they continue to echo his words and foot stomps.)

REVEREND ORISON: Join with me. Allow the spirit of Jesus Christ to show you the way up to our Heavenly Father. Glory! Amen!

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

REVEREND ORISON: Let God's love free you from your prison and deliver you to His side in heaven. Glory! Amen!

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

REVEREND ORISON: Praise His name. Praise His holy love. Glory! Amen!

(Focus on DONNIE PFASTER who is not stamping his foot, and not speaking.)

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

REVEREND ORISON: Glory! Amen!

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

REVEREND ORISON: Glory! Amen!

PRISONERS: Glory! Amen!

(Next morning. Prison sweatshop. Prisoners are working at assorted sewing and fabric cutting machines.)

(The prisoner, BRIGHAM is working with what seems like a very slow fabric bandsaw, a bible on one corner of his machine. He is not focused on the machine - he seems to be in a deliriously happy trance. His foot, operating the machine, raises and lowers in time to his chanting.)

BRIGHAM: Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen...

(DONNIE PFASTER brings up a garment to a GUARD for inspection. The GUARD is looking at BRIGHAM in disgust.)

GUARD: You believe that, Donnie? God loves a sack of crap like you?

DONNIE PFASTER: Bible says.

GUARD: Bible says you kill women, cut their pinkies.

(DONNIE PFASTER turns to watch BRIGHAM, who is now rocking from side to side in rhythm to the chanting.)

BRIGHAM: Glory. Amen.

GUARD: You're going to burn in hell

BRIGHAM: Glory. Amen.

GUARD: You listening to me? God's got a place for you, all right. Sick puke.

DONNIE PFASTER: Then where does that leave you?

(GUARD rips apart the garment that DONNIE had handed to him and DONNIE turns his head to look at him in shock.)

GUARD: (sarcastically) Sorry. Just not good enough for the Illinois penal system.

(BRIGHAM suddenly begins screaming.)

BRIGHAM: My hands! My hands!

(All his fingers have been cut off at the knuckle.)

(SLOW MOTION sequence begins. The GUARD runs to BRIGHAM. Other prisoners stand and stare. Other GUARDS run in. DONNIE PFASTER, the only person in the scene not in slow motion, looks around in surprise, then casually tosses the ripped garment over his shoulder and walks out.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(SCULLY's apartment. Night. Scully wakes up suddenly as a gust of wind flips her hair into her face. She gets up and closes the windows in her room. She rearranges some papers near her Bible at the end of her bed which were tossed around by the wind. As she turns back to her bed she sees her RCA digital clock - the time says "6:66 AM". She picks it up to investigate, the clock goes dark, then the power comes back on as her bedside lamp comes on and the clock says 6:06 AM.)



SCENE 3
US PENETENTIARY
MARION, ILLINOIS

(Prison. Later. Throughout the scene, MULDER seems very concerned about SCULLY and her reactions to the case.)

MARSHALL DADDO: Life without chance of parole for the premeditated and sadistic sexual murders of five Twin Cities women in 1994. Donald Addie Pfaster. (SCULLY takes the folder and steps away to look at it.) You two put this man away.

MULDER: Yeah. Someone forgot to throw away the key.

(SCULLY looks at DONNIE PFASTER's picture.)

MARSHALL DADDO: Ah, well, that's another story. Right now, we have to apprehend this man. We'd use all the help you can give us in understanding exactly who it is we're after.

MULDER: Donnie Pfaster is a death fetishist-- a collector of bone and dead flesh, of toenails and hair. It's what floats his boat, gets him off.

MARSHALL DADDO: He's a sick man.

MULDER: Sick would describe him. We found women's fingers in his freezer. He liked to eat them with his peas and carrots.

MARSHALL DADDO: So it's just women he's after?

MULDER: Just women. Been five years in here thinking about only that. I'm sure he's worked up quite an appetite.

MARSHALL DADDO: I happen to know you two agents have a particular forte-- a thing for... what is it called? The supernatural? (MULDER smiles) Now, the circumstances of the escape...

SCULLY: (turning back to the men) I promise you there is nothing supernatural about this man. Donnie Pfaster is just plain evil.

(MULDER watches as SCULLY walks out of the room. She goes into the prison chapel. There are several things written on the walls including "Sheep go the Heven, (sp) Goats go to Hell")

(Through the ventilation grate we hear a recorded rhythm and blues song playing. SCULLY walks closer to the vent to hear it and her face shows mild surprise.)

MUSIC: (man's voice) Don't look any further
Don't look any further
Someone to count on
In a world ever changing

(MULDER follows her into the chapel.)

MULDER: Case closed.

MUSIC: Here I am, baby

MULDER: Didn't look at the file, did you?

SCULLY: A man escaped from prison.

MULDER: (circling her) Not a man. Donnie Pfaster. And he didn't just escape, he walked out. He walked out of a maximum security facility and no one seems to know how he did it.

SCULLY: Isn't that why we're here?

MULDER: (walking toward her) That's why I'm here. I don't know about you. Why are you here? Go home, Scully.

SCULLY: Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.

MULDER: The man abducted you. Donnie Pfaster did a number on your head like I've never seen and it's okay ... to walk away.

SCULLY: Mulder, that man does things to people that no one should ever have to think about. It's not a question of if I should stay. I don't have a choice. So let's get to work.

MULDER: Well, this isn't the first incident. Two prisoners have escaped from maximum security facilities in neighboring states over the past year. at 6:06 this morning Donnie Pfaster made it three.

SCULLY: 6:06? And what's so supernatural about that?

MULDER: Dozens of witnesses, guards, and staff, and no one seems to remember anything. For a while, they didn't even know these guys were missing.

SCULLY: Have they been apprehended?

MULDER: No, neither of the men have ever been seen again.



SCENE 4

(Interrogation room. MULDER is sitting with BRIGHAM. SCULLY is standing against the wall observing.)

BRIGHAM: I already told the Warden everything I know ... everything I saw that day.

MULDER: Yes, but I'm still a little confused. Maybe you could go over it again.

BRIGHAM: (proudly) I'm a Christian man.

MULDER: Then I know you'll tell me the truth.

BRIGHAM: Yeah, but I got no idea about Donnie Pfaster ... (to SCULLY) .... or how he broke out.

MULDER: You and Donnie Pfaster were in the garment shop at or about the time he disappeared.

BRIGHAM: Well, it wasn't just me. I mean, there was a lot of us in the shop.

MULDER: Yeah, but you had something happen. You had an incident.

BRIGHAM: Yeah. Something like that.

MULDER: You cried out to the guards that you'd cut your hands.

BRIGHAM: My fingers, man. I saw them all cut off.

(He holds up his hands, looking at them. The fingers are whole.)

MULDER: Others saw them, too.

BRIGHAM: No, but I felt them cut off.

MULDER: How do you explain that?

BRIGHAM: God works in mysterious ways, brother.

(MULDER raises and lowers his outstretched palm.)

BRIGHAM: (trancelike) Glory. Amen.

(As MULDER raises and lowers his hand, BRIGHAM raises and lowers his foot and says the words, a rapturous smile on his face.)

BRIGHAM: Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.

(MULDER and SCULLY go out into the hall.)

MULDER: Post-hypnotic suggestion. Did you see him?

SCULLY: You mean, did I see him raise his foot? Yes, I saw that.

MULDER: A programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion in this case, a rhythmic motion of the hands producing a unconscious act in a conscious state.

(MULDER raises and lowers his hand in front of SCULLY. Very cute.)

MULDER: Doesn't work on you.

SCULLY: (smiling) I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.

MULDER: Group hypnosis.

SCULLY: If you're suggesting that Donnie Pfaster escaped from prison using a technique from a Vegas lounge act I'd think again.

MULDER: Mesmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences.

SCULLY: So, how would Donnie have acquired this amazing ability?

MULDER: I'm not saying that it was Donnie.

SCULLY: Well, then, who?

MULDER: Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons. One man has had possible contact with each of those cons. The prison chaplain. (bad Southern accent) Glory. Amen. (SCULLY again notices the song "Don't Look Any Further" playing. She walks over to the heating vent to hear it better.) Not God, the chaplain. Scully, what?

SCULLY: That song-- can you hear that?

MUSIC: Someone to count on

(MULDER joins her under the vent.)

MULDER: Barely.

MUSIC: Here I am, stop where you're standing...

SCULLY: I haven't heard that song since high school. That's the second time I've heard it in the last hour.

MULDER: (smiling) Well, I think if it was a make out song I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?

MUSIC: Oh, babe, don't look any further



SCENE 5
HARRISBURG, ILLINOIS
12:52 PM

(Bus stop on a city street. Next door, a Waffle House-type of diner. DONNIE PFASTER, now wearing civilian clothes, enters and sits at a booth. He looks at the waitress, 40ish, thumbing through her open checks. Specifically, he looks at her fingers. The nails are painted a bright red. A low end hooker, BLUEBERRY, slides into the booth across from DONNIE PFASTER.)

BLUEBERRY: Looking for something to eat?

DONNIE PFASTER: Me?

BLUEBERRY: (showing her body) How about today's special?

(DONNIE PFASTER looks at her nails. They are blue - either from bad nail polish or malnutrition. Uncomfortably, she hides her hands.)

BLUEBERRY: You aren't a narc, are you?

DONNIE PFASTER: No.

BLUEBERRY: You're looking at my hands.

DONNIE PFASTER: You need a buff and polish.

BLUEBERRY: What are you? A freak?

DONNIE PFASTER: I... I just got out of prison.

(The WAITRESS notices BLUEBERRY.)

WAITRESS: Hey, Missy. Leave the customers alone!

DONNIE PFASTER: I'll do it for free.

BLUEBERRY: You just got out of prison and you want to give me a manicure?

DONNIE PFASTER: I'll even do your cuticles.

(She laughs.)

REVEREND ORISON: You receive the Lord's grace and this is your thanks?

(DONNIE PFASTER looks up as if the Lord is speaking.)

DONNIE PFASTER: What?

(REVEREND ORISON is standing beside the booth. DONNIE PFASTER turns to him.)

REVEREND ORISON: Who do you think got you out of prison?

DONNIE PFASTER: (irritated) I don't care. I'm busy right now.

REVEREND ORISON: The Grace of God got you out and it's the only thing that will keep you out.

BLUEBERRY: I thought you were kidding.

REVEREND ORISON: He's chosen you, Donnie.

(Outside, we see several police cars pull up.)

BLUEBERRY: (getting up and leaving) Later.

DONNIE PFASTER: (accusing, to REVEREND ORISON, as he gets up) You called them on me.

REVEREND ORISON: No.

DONNIE PFASTER: Then do something.

REVEREND ORISON: I have a car.

(REVEREND ORISON holds out a keyring with several keys and a crucifix on it.)

DONNIE PFASTER: We aren't going to make it to the car.

REVEREND ORISON: It's within His power.

(MARSHALL DADDO and some other police, US Marshals, enter the diner, obviously looking for DONNIE PFASTER. As they spot him, everything goes into slow motion.)

REVEREND ORISON: Glory, amen. Glory, amen.

(REVEREND ORISON jingles his keys. One of the customers at the counter reaches over and attacks the waitress. MARSHALL DADDO turns away from DONNIE PFASTER to deal with the situation at hand. Still in slow motion, the WAITRESS screams, grabs the pot of hot coffee and hurls the liquid into her attacker's face. When MARSHALL DADDO turns back to where DONNIE PFASTER and REVEREND ORISON were standing, they are gone. Outside, REVEREND ORISON walks out from between two parked buses and turns to see an older model car driven by DONNIE PFASTER coming towards him. The car runs him down then stops as DONNIE looks back at him. BLUEBERRY is in the passenger's seat. The car backs up to try and run him over again but misses as REVEREND ORISON, bleeding, rolls over out of the way. He's in pain as people begin to attend to him and DONNIE PFASTER drives off.)



SCENE 6

(Same diner, later. Crime scene. MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car and join MARSHALL DADDO and the other police.)

MULDER: Was he here?

MARSHALL DADDO: Well, um... We're trying to determine that.

SCULLY: Did you see him?

MARSHALL DADDO: Well, that's a good question. We thought we saw something, but apparently we didn't.

(POLICE look uncomfortable.)

MULDER: We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect.

(No response.)

MULDER: Well, something happened here, huh?

WAITRESS: (pouring coffee) Guy got hit by a car.

MARSHALL DADDO: A prison chaplain, it turns out. A Reverend Orison. Paramedics took him to the hospital.

(SCULLY hears the song on the radio near the stove.)

MUSIC: Someone to count on

MARSHALL DADDO: He's in pretty bad shape.

MUSIC: In a world ever changing Here I am, stop...

(SCULLY walks over to the lunch counter. MULDER watches her.)

SCULLY: Excuse me, uh, could you turn that up, please?

(The WAITRESS turns up the volume.)

SCULLY: (looking very confused as she listens to the song) Yeah.

MUSIC: What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Oh, girl
Don't look any further
And it's strange
When you think of the chances...



SCENE 7
ST. CLARE MEDICAL CENTER
HARRISBURG, ILLINOIS

(Hospital. 4:20. SCULLY enters REVEREND ORISON's room. She looks at his chart.)

SCULLY: You're lucky to be alive, Reverend Orison.

REVEREND ORISON: Who are you?

SCULLY: Special Agent Dana Scully.

REVEREND ORISON: Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully. He believes in you.

SCULLY: (no nonsense) That's nice... But my partner and I are more concerned with several disappearances from maximum-security facilities that seem to involve you.

REVEREND ORISON: Don't be concerned. God has them.

SCULLY: What do you mean? Reverend?

REVEREND ORISON: You're a Believer, aren't you?

SCULLY: This has nothing to do with me, sir.

REVEREND ORISON: It has everything to do with you. You have faith... have had faith. You hear Him calling you but you're unsure what to do.

(SCULLY fingers her very visible cross.)

SCULLY: It's not exactly a long shot, sir.

REVEREND ORISON: You stand as you do now, neither here nor there... longing... but afraid, waiting for a sign. But the signs are everywhere.

SCULLY: What happened to the inmates, sir?

REVEREND ORISON: Everything has a reason, Scout. (SCULLY looks shocked.) Everything on God's earth. Every moment of every day the Devil waits for but an instant. As it is, it has always been. The Devil's instant is our eternity.

(MULDER enters the hospital room.)

MULDER: (very sarcastic) The Good Reverend. How do you do? Or maybe I should say, "How do you do it?"

REVEREND ORISON: His is the Word. I am but the Messenger who delivers it.

MULDER: Well, this delivery arrived a little late-- a little late and a little cold as a matter of fact. I thought you'd want to see it.

(MULDER hands a photo to REVEREND ORISON. It is of the hooker, BLUEBERRY, lying dead in a bloody bathtub - her hair and fingers cut off. REVEREND ORISON winces and looks away.)

REVEREND ORISON: What is this?

MULDER: Blood of the lamb, Reverend. Handiwork of Mr. Donnie Pfaster-- a young girl he picked up at the bus stop.

REVEREND ORISON: (very sad) Oh, Lord.

MULDER: Where is he, Reverend?

REVEREND ORISON: He took my car. She wasn't supposed to die.

MULDER: No. Donnie was supposed to die. You were supposed to kill him. That's why you freed him. God knows you're capable of it. (to SCULLY) The Reverend Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison-- convicted in 1959 of first degree murder. Served 22 years in Soledad.

REVEREND ORISON: God spoke to me. He told me to look after Donnie.

MULDER: When God spoke to you, Reverend, did He happen to mention where Donnie was headed?

(No answer. MULDER and SCULLY go out into the hall.)

SCULLY: Where are you going, Mulder?

MULDER: To prove that man's a liar.

SCULLY: How do you prove that somebody isn't being directed by God? You don't believe that it happens?

MULDER: God is a spectator, Scully. He just reads the box scores.

SCULLY: I don't believe that.

MULDER: You think God directs that man? You think He directs him to kill?

SCULLY: Donnie Pfaster isn't dead, and we don't know that the other inmates who escaped are dead, either.

MULDER: So, what? You think that God directs him to ... let the prisoners out to kill?

SCULLY: No, but I believe that the Reverend believes what he's saying-- that's it's God working through him.

MULDER: Well, plenty of nut bags do. Has he ever spoken to you?

SCULLY: (wounded) I'm trying not to take offense.

MULDER: (curious) What did he say?

(SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I have heard that song three times now. That may not mean anything to you but it means something to me.

MULDER: What does it mean?

SCULLY: I never thought about it before. It never meant anything to me until yesterday when it made me remember something.

MULDER: (gentle) What?

SCULLY: (sighs again) When I was thirteen my father was stationed in San Diego. I was listening to the radio to that song when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday School teacher had been killed.

MULDER: (sympathetic) Hmm...

SCULLY: He had been murdered in his front yard... And that's the first time that I ever felt that there was real evil in the world. Mulder, Reverend Orison called me "Scout." That's the same name that my Sunday School teacher called me. Donnie pfaster escaped from prison at 6:06 a.m. That's exactly the same time that I woke up yesterday morning when my power went out.

MULDER: So, what do you think that God is telling you?

(SCULLY has no answer.)

MULDER: Well, all right. Come with me, Scout. I'll show you how the Reverend talks to God.



SCENE 8

(DONNIE PFASTER has parked REVEREND ORISON's car on the side of a rural road. He is listening to the police report on the radio.)

REPORTER: Police are involved in a four-state manhunt for a prisoner who escaped maximum security in Marion, Illinois. He was last seen driving a green 1970 Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top. He is described as six feet tall, medium build...

(DONNIE PFASTER gets out of the car and uses a pocketknife to rip the fabric top off of the car He pulls two blood stained prison uniforms out of the trunk and then finds a gym bag. He opens it, discards a Bible and then pulls out a wallet with a driver's license for Reverend Orison which reads: Robert Gailen Orison, 1476 Wicks St., Equality, Illinois 62934. He holds up a keychain with one key which he finds in the bag and slams the trunk shut. Cut to ....)



SCENE 9

(MULDER and SCULLY are looking at a computer generated scan of REVEREND ORISON's brain.)

MULDER: It's a cerebral edema.

SCULLY: Swelling of the brain-- a trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident.

MULDER: Except this isn't accidental. The cause, in fact, as it was stated to me is self-inflicted. There's a small hole here in the skull which allows oxygen into the brain cavity, the result of which is the Reverend Orison has three times the normal blood volume pumping through his brain.

SCULLY: And he did this himself?

MULDER: Yeah. My guess is he-he probably did it when he first got into prison-- when he first learned how to use its powers.

SCULLY: "Its powers."

MULDER: There's a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities are limited only by inadequate blood supply. In fact, centuries ago, in the Peruvian Andes, Holy Men used to physically remove parts of their skulls in order to increase blood volume or drill small holes.

SCULLY: So this hole in his head enables Reverend Orison to help these prisoners escape?

MULDER: The practitioners of this found that they could perform certain mental tricks one of which they called "stopping the world."

SCULLY: Well, nobody can stop the world, Mulder. I don't care how many holes they have in their head.

MULDER: Yeah, but maybe they can alter perception of it creating a disparate version of reality which they can then project through hypnosis.

SCULLY: But why? I mean, even if he could, why?

MULDER: Donnie Pfaster is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. That's the final judgment as far as society is concerned but not in the eyes of God or in the eyes of a man who thinks he's God's tool.

SCULLY: Well, then, if Reverend Orison meant to kill Donnie Pfaster then why is he still alive?

MULDER: I don't know. Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn't control. Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception but then unwittingly he... opened the gates of Hell.



SCENE 10

(REVEREND ORISON's hospital room. Evening. A MARSHAL is guarding him, reading a paper. The beeping of the heart monitor slows and goes down in pitch.)

MARSHAL: What?

REVEREND ORISON: Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.

(The heart monitor is now beeping even more slowly. REVEREND ORISON gets out of bed. The MARSHAL does not respond except to look confused. The beeping continues slowly. The MARSHAL is in a trance, still holding the paper. REVEREND ORISON takes the MARSHAL's gun and leaves the room.)



SCENE 11
EQUALITY, ILLINOIS
5:02 PM

(An apartment. Hasn't been redecorated since the 70's. DONNIE PFASTER is in the kitchen wearing only a pair of tighty-whitey men's shorts and blue slippers. He finishes closing a plastic baggie and picks up the other baggie on the counter. They both contain women's fingers. He puts the baggies into the freezer next to some waffles. There is a knock at the door. He smiles and answers it with the door-chain still in place. It is the LADY IN RED, a higher class call girl than BLUEBERRY was. She is wearing a tight red dress. Her hair is bright red, piled high on her head with tendrils curling at her shoulders.)

LADY IN RED: Are you Donald?

DONNIE PFASTER: Yes.

LADY IN RED: I'm from Tip-Top Gentlemen's Service.

(He removes the door-chain, lets her in and closes the door.)

LADY IN RED: This isn't your place, is it?

DONNIE PFASTER: No. Why?

LADY IN RED: 'Cause I was coming up the stairs and got stopped by the landlord-- like it's any of his business. He told me some Reverend Orison lives here. Now, you ain't no preacher, are you?

DONNIE PFASTER: No.

LADY IN RED: Good. They always like the weirdest things. (She removes her jacket and puts it down on the couch.) You know what I mean?

(DONNIE PFASTER stares at her fingers then drifts his gaze up to her beautiful hair. He licks his lips slightly.)

LADY IN RED: You okay?

DONNIE PFASTER: Yes.

LADY IN RED: Something you want to say?

DONNIE PFASTER: Love your hair.



SCENE 12

(REVEREND ORISON's apartment, later. The LADY IN RED's manicured hand reaches out from the bubbles to turn off the bath water. She lays her head back on the bathtub and closes her eyes. Candles are burning all over the room. DONNIE PFASTER, now dressed in a robe, enters with an armful of hair-care products.)

LADY IN RED: What are you doing?

DONNIE PFASTER: Is your hair chemically treated?

LADY IN RED: My hair?

DONNIE PFASTER: I don't know which product to use.

LADY IN RED: You're not using no product-- I'm clean, my hair's clean, if you're going to be that weird about it I ought to just leave.

(She starts to get up.)

DONNIE PFASTER: I'm being a gentleman.

LADY IN RED: Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel. I'm going to get out of here.

(DONNIE PFASTER acquiesces and puts the bottles into the sink. He gets a towel and wraps it around her as she stands. He looks closely at the back of her neck. The hairline is now wet and he sees two different hairlines.)

DONNIE PFASTER: (furious) It's a wig. They lied to me. (he tears the wig off of her head) You lied to me!

(As he throws the wig at the sink in a rage, the LADY IN RED picks up one of the candles and flings the hot wax in DONNIE PFASTER's face. She then punches him and he falls to the floor, hitting his face off the sink. She runs out of the room. Cut to ...)



SCENE 13

SCULLY: Where did he go?

MULDER: Marshal?

(No response. MULDER smacks him gently on the face to wake him up.)

MULDER: Marshal?

MARSHAL: (confused) What?

SCULLY: The prisoner... the man you were guarding in this room. What happened to him?

MULDER: (looking at the MARSHAL's empty holster) He's gone, Scully, so's the Marshal's gun.

SCULLY: You didn't see him?

(The MARSHAL stands up and walks around the room in a daze trying to sort it out.)

MULDER: Let's go, Scully.

(SCULLY finds a pad of paper on the bedside table. She picks it up and reads it.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: What does this mean?

(SCULLY shows MULDER the pad of paper. Written on it are the words, "DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER.")

MULDER: Did you tell him?

SCULLY: No, I only told you.

MULDER: Oh, he must have... overheard us when we were talking in the hallway.

SCULLY: I didn't mention the name of the song.

MULDER: I'm sure you did.

SCULLY: No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.

MULDER: Well... maybe this was meant for you. Don't look any further.



SCENE 14

(Bathroom. DONNIE PFASTER gets up off the floor and positions himself over the sink to wipe away some of the wax from his face. He looks up at the mirror, blood trickling down from his cut temple, as REVEREND ORISON cocks a gun behind him.)

REVEREND ORISON: Whosoever shedeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.

DONNIE PFASTER: What are you doing?

REVEREND ORISON: Taking you home. The wicked... will be punished.



SCENE 15

(Night. REVEREND ORISON is digging a grave, DONNIE PFASTER is beside him on his knees with his hands tied behind his back.)

REVEREND ORISON: Pray for God's love, Donnie. Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart. All you have to do is believe. Repent. You'll feel God's love come to show you the way to His heavenly kingdom.

(DONNIE PFASTER whimpers and cries softly. ORISON points a gun at DONNIE's face.)

REVEREND ORISON: Are you sorry for what you've done?

DONNIE PFASTER: You... (mumbling)

REVEREND ORISON: What did you say?

DONNIE PFASTER: Never... No... No...

REVEREND ORISON: Why are you crying?

DONNIE PFASTER: I can't... I can't...

REVEREND ORISON: Beg His forgiveness for what you did to those girls. For what you did to all those poor, helpless girls.

DONNIE PFASTER: My violence is always waiting... for an instant. For when His back is turned. You can see it now.

REVEREND ORISON: Are you crying for your sins? Or for yourself?

DONNIE PFASTER: No, Reverend. I cry for you. Because you cannot kill me.

(DONNIE PFASTER's face shifts into that of a demon. ORISON backs away. Cut to ...)



SCENE 16

(Gravesite, next day. Crime scene team is uncovering REVEREND ORISON's dead body. MULDER and SCULLY observe.)

MULDER: You know, it's funny, when all is said and done, there's... not much mystery in murder.

SCULLY: And for that I owe you an apology, Mulder.

MULDER: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Well, you were right. I was looking too hard for connections that weren't there. Orison was a murderer, plain and simple. He liberated those prisoners so he could bring them out here and pass judgment on them.

MULDER: I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God. Glory, Amen. Let's go home, Scully.

SCULLY: You know, Donnie Pfaster placed the call to the police that led us out here. It's almost like he's begging us to hunt him down.

MULDER: This X-File is over... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself. Let's let the US Marshals take over from here. Don't look any further, Scully.



SCENE 17

(SCULLY's apartment. That evening? DONNIE PFASTER enters and looks around. He goes into her bedroom and takes her Bible from the chest at the foot of her bed and places it in a drawer. SCULLY enters the apartment and TURNS ON LIGHTS??? Yes, she turns on lights in every room. Great view of the apartment. She sets her keys on the table, her gun on the dresser, then begins taking off her suit and sleeveless navy top as DONNIE PFASTER watches from the closet.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY's apartment. She changes into a pair of gray flannel pajamas while DONNIE PFASTER watches from the closet. VERY creepy. SCULLY is about to put her work clothes in the closet when she sees that her clock again says 6:66. She picks up the clock and the power goes off plunging the room into darkness, save for the streetlights which shine in the windows. SCULLY looks at her closet door which is ajar, realizes something is wrong and starts to throw herself at the door to close it when it flies open and DONNIE PFASTER bursts out.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER's apartment. His phone rings. The answering machine picks up.)

MULDER: (recorded voice) This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message after the ... (beep).

MARSHALL DADDO: (voice) Agent Mulder, Marshall Joe Daddo in Marion. Just talked to a call girl who i.d.'d Donnie Pfaster as an attacker. Claims Pfaster got real upset when she was wearing a red wig. Upset she wasn't a redhead. This mean anything to you? Appreciate a call back.

(As the machine disconnects, MULDER enters his apartment. He does not check his messages.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY is thrown against a wall. DONNIE PFASTER picks her up, grabbing her by the throat. She fights back and manages to gouge his eyes with her thumbs, drawing blood. He yells in pain and releases her as he reaches for his eyes. She punches him and runs across the room to grab her gun. He runs at her and flings her repeatedly against the bureau mirror, breaking it. The pieces shatter all over the floor and she drops the gun. She kicks him, busts a lamp over his head, breaks free, dumps one of the bookcases on top of his head, and runs to the phone in the hall and dials 911. DONNIE PFASTER chases her and flings her to the floor on her stomach and lands on top of her.)

SCULLY: Go back to hell!

(DONNIE PFASTER has her hands behind her back. He looks at her fingers.)

DONNIE PFASTER: Who does your nails, girly girl?

SCULLY: (trying to reason with him) Let me go! The only reason why you're alive is because I asked the judge for life! The only reason why you're alive is because we didn't kill you when we could!

DONNIE PFASTER: You're the one that got away. You're all I think about.

SCULLY: I'm a federal agent. You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time.

DONNIE PFASTER: I'm going to run you a bath.

(SCULLY screams. He clamps his hand over her mouth.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER's apartment. He is in his bathroom brushing his teeth. He goes into his bedroom to set his radio alarm. The last alarm was set at 7 PM. Hmm. He sets it for 5 AM. While setting it, he hears a fragment of the song "Don't Look Any Further." He turns it back on while he finishes brushing and swallows the toothpaste. He looks thoughtfully at the radio.)

MUSIC: Don't look any further
Day-o, umba day-o
Mambu ji ay-o...

CUT TO:

(SCULLY's apartment. DONNIE PFASTER has tied SCULLY arms behind her back with her own pantyhose. Another pair, clean, I hope, has been used to gag her. He drags her, feet first, into a closet.)

DONNIE PFASTER: Now, be good and don't cause me any problems.

(DONNIE PFASTER closes the closet door and goes into her bathroom. SCULLY hears water running and her phone ringing. DONNIE PFASTER pushes "play" on her CD player. The song, "Don't Look Any Further" comes on.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER lying in his bed with the phone to his ear. Finally, he hangs up and gets up.)

CUT TO:

(DONNIE PFASTER filling SCULLY's tub with water and bubble bath.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY in the closet peering under the crack at the bottom of the door at her gun on the bedroom floor. She looks up at the door handle.)

CUT TO:

(DONNIE PFASTER testing the bath water and turning it off.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY standing up in the closet and opening the door with her tied hands.)

CUT TO:

(DONNIE PFASTER picks up a bottle of her shampoo. Willow Lake, made by the Lamour Corporation in Minneapolis.)

MUSIC: Ooh Oh, whoa, whoa Oh
Someone to count on
In a world ever changin'
Here I am
Stop where your standin'

CUT TO:

(SCULLY hiding under the bed as DONNIE PFASTER passes her into another room.)

MUSIC: What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Oh, girl
Don't look any further
And it's strange
When you think of the chances
That we've both been in a state of mind
Too cool to be careless
Lookin' for the right thing

(SCULLY, grunting, makes her way along the floor to the other side of the bed where her gun is. Meanwhile, DONNIE PFASTER, in search of candles, has gone into her kitchen, taken out a silverware caddy and removed a knife and a pair of scissors.)

MUSIC: Oh, baby
Don't look any further
Tonight
We're gonna take a trip to paradise
Rockin' all night long
Baby
Daylight
Daylight
I'll still be lookin' in your heavenly eyes
And we'll go on and on

(SCULLY is close to her gun, but she freezes in fear, blood trickling out of her nose as DONNIE PFASTER passes her again.)

MUSIC: Day-o, umba day-o
Mambu ji ay-o
Don't look any further
Day-o, umba day-o
Mambu ji ay-o
Don't look any further

(In the bathroom, DONNIE PFASTER is lighting a LOT of candles. Scully apparently likes them a lot. There must be 40-50 in the room that he has collected throughout the apartment.)

MUSIC: Someone to count on
In a world ever changing
Here I am, baby
Stop right where you're standing
What you need is a lover
Someone to take over
Here I am, babe
Don't look any further, further...

(SCULLY gets her feet, clad in very cute fuzzy slippers, through her hands, putting her hands in front of her. She keeps crawling to the gun over the shards of mirror on the bedroom floor. In the living room, DONNIE PFASTER turns off the stereo and heads for SCULLY. SLOW MOTION sequence starts. MULDER enters the front door and draws his gun on DONNIE PFASTER. CarriK's lip reading ability says that he says "Put your hands up!" and puts his hand on DONNIE's shoulder. DONNIE PFASTER does not obey. Instead, he turns his head as SCULLY enters the room, her hands unbound, the gag around her neck and her gun hanging loosely in her right hand. She is focused solely on DONNIE PFASTER. It looks like MULDER asks, "Did he hurt you?" [Others say he says, "Don't shoot!", but according to TD's brand new super-duper VCR he definitely says "Did he hurt you?"] We see a bullet casing hit the floor, SCULLY's face illuminated by a gunshot, DONNIE PFASTER having a slight reaction as the bullet passes through him, MULDER turning as the overhead light is blown out by the bullet. MULDER stares at SCULLY who is still holding the gun where she fired it into DONNIE PFASTER's ribcage. She is horrified at what she has done. The screen goes black as a gunshot rings out.)



SCENE 19

(SCULLY's apartment, later. Crime scene. MULDER has been talking to a policeman. He sees SCULLY, now with a shawl wrapped around her pajamas, go into her bedroom and close the door.)

MULDER: Excuse me.

COP: Yeah. Sure.

(SCULLY closes the window and takes off the shawl. MULDER enters SCULLY's bedroom.)

MULDER: If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.

SCULLY: Yeah.

(SCULLY pulls her Bible back out of the drawer and looks at MULDER.)

MULDER: You can't judge yourself.

SCULLY: (sitting on the bed) Maybe I don't have to.

MULDER: The Bible allows for vengeance.

SCULLY: But the law doesn't.

MULDER: (leaning into her) The way I see it... he didn't give you a choice. And my report will reflect that... in case you're worried. Donnie Pfaster would've surely killed again if given the chance.

SCULLY: He was evil, Mulder. I'm sure about that, without a doubt. But there's one thing that I'm not sure of.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: Who was at work in me. Or what... what made me... what made me pull the trigger.

MULDER: You mean if it was God?

SCULLY: I mean... what if it wasn't?

(MULDER has no answer.

[Fade to black]

[THE END]

                                          THE AMAZING MALEENI


SCENE 1

(Great music, Mark Snow. Sadly haunting. Santa Monica Pier. A carnival is set up. A man in his fifties, MALEENI, is sitting on the back of his old van. He is wearing a tuxedo. Faded, but ornate lettering on the van proclaims that he is "Amazing Maleeni." He looks rather sad and tired. A young CARNIVAL WORKER comes up to him.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Mr. Maleeni... Hey, guy. You ready to rumble?

MALEENI: (dryly) If by "rumble," you mean "perform..." yes, I am.

CARNIVAL WORKER: Cool. Uh, you know how they said you get $125 for the day? It's going to be $75 instead. The gate's for crap. But, hey, the show's got to go on, right?

MALEENI: This will be my greatest show ever.

(The CARNIVAL WORKER doesn't quite know what to think of MALEENI.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Right on.

(MALEENI is now on a small stage in the foot court of the carnival. People are eating and paying slight attention. One young man noisily slurps a soda. Lets call him HECKLER DUDE. There is also an older couple with a video camera recording the show.)

MALEENI: Ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros... I aim today not just to entertain, but to educate. To instruct and inform in the venerable and ancient history of my art. Until Johann Nepomuk Hofsinzer called playing cards "the poetry of magic" a conjurer's skill was determined entirely by his ability to perform one effect. That effect was known as "the cups and balls." The games were known for hundreds if not thousands of years. Perhaps the greatest performer was the Italian, Bartolomeo Bosco.

HECKLER DUDE: Get on with it!

(MALEENI begins the cup and balls trick with very small red balls.)

MALEENI: Bosco's passes with the cups and balls. (makes the balls disappear one at a time) Wah-day... Chubio... Colerader. Three gone... And yet, three return. (reveals the balls one at a time) Bosco had only one contemporary rival a slightly older Frenchman named Conus, who announced in 1795 that he would make his wife, who was five-foot-seven appear under one of the cups. Practice though I have, I have been unable even to get married.

(The HECKLER DUDE laughs in a sarcastic, obnoxious way.)

MALEENI: (placing the small red balls into his pockets) Conus placed one ball in his pocket. He put the second ball away. Putting the third ball in his hand he made it vanish and that's the mystery of the cups... and the balls.

(He tips the cups to reveal two lemons and a lime.)

HECKLER DUDE: Yo. Can't you do anything that ain't a hundred years old? That ain't old school, that's decrepit.

MALEENI: (patient) Young man, shall I come heckle you on your job? Make sure you count out the requisite number of McNuggets?

HECKLER DUDE: Show me something. Come on... show me something!

(Everyone is watching now.)

MALEENI: A callow challenge to be met by experience... and skill. To wit, the Egyptian, Dedi, whose most celebrated feat was to reattach a recently-severed head reuniting it with a still-warm body and no harm done. Western history knows three previous attempts at recreating this Noachian feat... each of the three ending in tragedy. This will be the fourth. May I have complete silence, please?

(MALEENI stretches his neck up and turns his head 360 degrees - completely around. The crowd cheers. The HECKLER DUDE throws his soda cup away and leaves.)

CROWD: Yeah! Senor Maleeni! Woo-hoo!

ANNOUNCER: (voice) Let's give it up for the Amazing Maleeni.

(After the show, the CARNIVAL WORKER is walking MALEENI back to his van. MALEENI, rubbing the back of his neck, looks tired as he gets into the driver's seat.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Guy, you rock! That kicked ass! I mean, it looked completely real! How did you do that? Oh, yeah, right-- magic. Oh, hey, your money-- hold up.

(The CARNIVAL WORKER goes to get the money, then comes back to the van.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Two, four, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75. You earned it.

(MALEENI appears to be asleep.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Mr. Maleeni?

(No response. The CARNIVAL WORKER clears his throat and shakes MALEENI's arm.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Mr. Maleeni.

(The CARNIVAL WORKER gasps as MALEENI's neatly severed head rolls off of his body and falls to the pavement.)

CARNIVAL WORKER: Oh, God...

SCENE 2

(Next day on the pier. Handheld picture of MALEENI's van is lowered to reveal the same scene as in the picture. Carnival. Area around MALEENI's van is now a crime scene. MULDER, in shirt sleeves, glances at the picture, then walks over to the open driver's side window. SCULLY looks in the passenger side window.)

MULDER: Neat trick, huh?

SCULLY: I can think of a neater one. How you convinced me to drop everything and get on the first plane to Los Angeles.

MULDER: Come on, Scully. This isn't intriguing enough for you? A magician turns his head completely around 360 degrees to the delight of young and old alike after which it plops unceremoniously onto the pier... see the picture? (he holds up the photo from the file)

SCULLY: Yeah, I saw the picture. And as for this Amazing Maleeni turning his head all the way around, LIKE YOU SAID, MULDER: neat trick.

MULDER: But...

SCULLY: (crossing to him) But... I'd guess this event was completely removed from the subsequent murder.

MULDER: You think this was a murder?

SCULLY: Don't you?

(MULDER gives her a mysterious little eyebrow wiggle.)

SCULLY: Mulder, his head was cut off.

MULDER: (in an affected presentational tone) Ah, observe the nearly complete absence of blood. Observe the paucity of fingerprints as evidenced by the LAPD's liberal use of lycopodium powder.

SCULLY: Why are you talking like Tony Randall?

MULDER: Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive one moment and expired the next. Know also that no one saw his fleeing attacker nor heard the dying man's cries.

SCULLY: Mulder, I admit that I don't know how it happened but I still say that it was a murder. So what's your theory?

MULDER: A magic trick gone horribly wrong. One that claims the lives of all who attempt it.

(MULDER turns to a COP holding the camcorder used by the tourist earlier.)

MULDER: Can I see that camcorder again? Thank you. A tourist videotaped Maleeni's performance. Look at this.

(We can see MALEENI performing and the back of HECKLER DUDE's head.)

HECKLER DUDE: (voice on tape) That ain't old school, that's decrepit!

SCULLY: Who's the heckler?

HECKLER DUDE: (voice on tape) Come on, show me something!

MULDER: I don't know.

(MULDER and SCULLY watch the head turn trick.)

MULDER: Neat trick, huh?

SCULLY: Hang on a second. Let me see this. That heckler was pretty hard to impress wouldn't you say? Look, and then he just takes off in a huff.

MULDER: What, you think he's a murderer?

SCULLY: Well, it's worth checking out, don't you think?

MULDER: That'll be a neat trick in itself. You never see his face.

(She rewinds the image to show HECKLER DUDE throwing away the cup.)

SCULLY: Ah, but observe. His discarded soda cup. The hand may be quicker than the eye but it still leaves fingerprints.

MULDER: Provided they haven't dumped the trash.

SCULLY: Skeptic.



SCENE 3
NORTH HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

(Old theatre. Silver Taurus, California plate #2PCE357, is parked out front. Inside, the HECKLER DUDE, now known as LABONGE, is alone practicing a card tricks as MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

SCULLY: Mr. LaBonge? We're Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.

(They show their badges. LABONGE glances up at them, then continues shuffling his cards.)

SCULLY: Were you at the, uh, Santa Monica Pier yesterday morning?

LABONGE: Yeah.

MULDER: You attended a magic show. The Amazing Maleeni.

LABONGE: Yeah, he sucks. Why?

SCULLY: He's dead, under extremely suspicious circumstances.

LABONGE: He still sucks. How'd you find me?

SCULLY: Your fingerprints. You have a criminal record.

MULDER: A conviction for pick pocketing.

LABONGE: (sighs) Man, that was performance art. And besides, it's ancient history. What are you saying, you think I killed him?

SCULLY: Well, you're on videotape heckling the deceased.

MULDER: What did you have against Mr. Maleeni?

(LABONGE begins working on a disappearing/reappearing coin trick.)

LABONGE: (laughs) First of all... his name's not Maleeni. That's the name of a real magician, a guy at the turn of the century, Max Malini. Ever hear of him?

SCULLY: No.

LABONGE: That's too bad; you should have. Anyway, he steals his name, spells it a little differently and he does some tired crap that wouldn't cut it at a kid's birthday party.

MULDER: What about the trick where he turns his head completely around?

LABONGE: Check it out.

(LABONGE kneels down on the floor and turns his hand 360 degrees on the floor. It looks painful. MULDER and SCULLY are impressed.)

LABONGE: No problem. Did you like that?

SCULLY: Yeah.

LABONGE: Watch. Coin in the hand... blows away. Maybe it's a little bit hard for you to see. Let me make that... Bigger for you.

(He reveals a very large coin in his other hand.)

MULDER: Those are great, but I don't see how they're any different or better than the ones Maleeni did.

LABONGE: (continuing the coin trick) Mozart and Salieri. They sound pretty much the same to a layman. But they ain't. You know what I'm saying? It's about... originality. Style. And more than anything else... soul. Because that's what separates the great ones... from the hacks. We can't do this halfway. We're dealing with powerful forces at work here. Energies far beyond our mere... mortal... understanding.

MULDER: Enough to make a magician lose his head?

LABONGE: Could be. That, and I hear Maleeni racked up some pretty big gambling debts. Who knows who he might've pissed off.

SCULLY: Well, thank you, Mr. LaBonge. We'll, uh... be in touch.

(They start to leave.)

LABONGE: Please do. Oh, and agents...

(LABONGE uncrosses his arms revealing MULDER and SCULLY's badges, one in each hand. MULDER and SCULLY check their empty pockets, then, irritated, take their badges back.)

(SCULLY and MULDER leave.)

MULDER: Mozart and Salieri. Which one's which?

SCULLY: Mulder, I think that professional jealousy is as good a motive for murder as any.

MULDER: If it was a murder. I'm not convinced.

SCULLY: If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay hopefully we can put this issue to a rest as soon as possible.



SCENE 4

(Autopsy bay. MALEENI's decapitated body is on the table. SCULLY, in blue scrubs, snaps off one of her bloody examination gloves and turns to MULDER.)

SCULLY: All right, I'm stumped... and I think I'm supposed to be.

MULDER: What do you think?

SCULLY: Well, first of all, and sorry to disappoint you but, uh, Mr. Maleeni's head didn't just magically fall off. It was very carefully sawed. Very slow and exacting work probably with a fine-tooth meat saw. And check out this little detail.

(SCULLY fingers a stretchy yellowish substance around the body's neck.)

SCULLY: Spirit gum, Mulder. It held the head to the body. Just barely, of course.

MULDER: So he was murdered.

SCULLY: Well, no. As far as I can tell this man died of advanced coronary disease.

MULDER: Natural causes.

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: So, basically he died of a heart attack, somebody crept up behind him, sawed his head off and then glued it back on all in the space of 30 seconds. (begins laughing) Does that make sense to you?

SCULLY: No. Which makes it even stranger still because, as far as I can tell this body has been dead for over a month. I see signs of refrigeration.

MULDER: And yet he performed yesterday. What a trouper.

SCULLY: Well, somebody performed yesterday.



SCENE 5

(Night. Pool hall. LABONGE enters and goes up to a Latino man with lots of tattoos, ALVAREZ. ALVAREZ is making notes in a small black book.)

LABONGE: Cissy Alvarez.

ALVEREZ: Who are you?

LABONGE: You don't remember me. Ain't that a bitch. My name's LaBonge. I did time with you about eight years ago. You were in for bank robbery.

(There is some history here. ALVAREZ "chooses" not to remember him.)

ALVEREZ: The name doesn't mean anything. What do you want?

LABONGE: I hear you're a poker player. You won big off a guy who calls himself the Amazing Maleeni. Also goes by the name of Herman Pinchbeck.

ALVEREZ: Pinchbeck?

LABONGE: He's dead.

ALVEREZ: Yeah, I saw in the paper. Something about his head fell off. What's it to you?

LABONGE: I'm the guy that made his head fall off.

(ALVAREZ's two THUGS across the room look up and take notice. ALVAREZ puts his book in his breast pocket.)

LABONGE: You took his marker, right? What did he owe you? 15 grand?

ALVEREZ: 20.

LABONGE: I don't think he was ever going to pay you back.

ALVEREZ: You want to cut to the chase? You know, get a little more of your story out before we stomp you to death?

LABONGE: How would you like to get back what you're owed? Times ten.

ALVEREZ: $200,000. How?

LABONGE: Helping me.

ALVEREZ: Do what?

LABONGE: Magic.

(ALVEREZ nods to his THUGS. The THUGS start toward LABONGE. LABONGE holds up his hand, then moves it slightly. The hand bursts into flame. He moves his hand again. The flames go out and he is now holding a small black book.)

LABONGE: Want to hear more?

(ALVAREZ slowly checks his breast pocket and finds that his black book is now gone.)



SCENE 6
CRADOCK MARINE BANK
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

(MULDER and SCULLY enter the Cradock Marine Bank.A FEMALE EMPLOYEE passes them.)

MULDER: Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.

FEMALE BANK EMPLOYEE: (pointing to an office) He's the gentleman right over there. (shakes her head sadly) The poor man.

(MULDER and SCULLY go over to the office and look in through the window.)

MULDER: He look familiar to you, Scully?

SCULLY: He certainly does.

(PINCHBECK is sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a neck brace. He looks just like MALEENI. The nameplate on his desk says "Albert Pinchbeck.")

MULDER: The plot thickens.

SCULLY: He might try and run.

(They knock and enter the office.)

PINCHBECK: Come in. Good morning, Mr. And Mrs...?

MULDER: (quickly as he and SCULLY pull out their badges) Agents... Mulder and Scully. FBI.

PINCHBECK: You're not here for a home loan, I take it.

(They sit.)

SCULLY: No. We are investigating the death of a magician who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.

PINCHBECK: Herman Pinchbeck, my twin brother.

SCULLY: Yes, we know. We checked his next of kin.

MULDER: What happened to your neck, Mr. Pinchbeck?

PINCHBECK: I was in a car accident.

MULDER: Car accident. So your injured neck has nothing to do with a magic trick you performed at the Santa Monica Pier two days ago? One which involved you turning your head around 360 degrees?

PINCHBECK: No. That wasn't me. I was in a bad car accident in Mexico.

MULDER: (not believing it) Oh, bad Mexican car accident. (to SCULLY) In Mexico.

SCULLY: Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?

PINCHBECK: Yes, I do. Back in the '70s, my brother and I performed together.

MULDER: Why did you stop?

PINCHBECK: You never really stop.

(PINCHBECK pulls out a deck of cards from his desk, fans them out in his hands, and holds them out to MULDER.)

MULDER: Pick a card, any card?

(MULDER takes a card. He and SCULLY look at it. The King of Diamonds. He puts it back in the deck. SCULLY clears her throat. PINCHBECK expertly shuffles the cards, then lets them cascade from one hand to the other. The last card he holds up is the King of Diamonds.)

MULDER: Hmm. Very impressive.

PINCHBECK: My brother and I both wanted to do the absolute best magic the world had ever seen. The difference was I knew he'd never get there but he always believed we would. We didn't talk much after I quit the act.

MULDER: I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck and I'm going to tell you how it goes. I think that your brother Herman died of heart disease having never made it as the world's greatest magician and I think that hurt you just as your estrangement from him hurt you. And I think what you did was perform his last act for him-- (SCULLY glances at MULDER.) -- one last act for which he'd always be remembered-- one last act that would end with such a shock, such a denouement as would be forever remembered in the annals of magic. That's what I think.

PINCHBECK: I so wish that were true.

(PINCHBECK pushes his wheelchair back from his desk. His legs are cut off at the knee.)

PINCHBECK: It was a very bad car accident in Mexico.

(MULDER and SCULLY have left the office and are heading out of the bank. Clocks says about 9:15 AM. MULDER is VERY embarrassed.)

MULDER: (rubbing his face) Oy.

SCULLY: No kidding. What now?

MULDER: A guy's head falls off. It's the greatest trick in the world. Only there's no discernible point to it. What's the reason for doing that in the first place?

SCULLY: Why do people do magic? To, uh, impress, to delight to gain attention.

MULDER: This one's gained mostly police attention. Maybe that's the point.

SCULLY: Well, maybe we should consult an expert. Someone who knows magic, who's seen the greatest trick in the world. Maybe he can help us figure that out.

MULDER: (with sarcastic disgust) Mozart.

SCULLY: Yeah.



SCENE 7

(Police impound garage. MULDER, SCULLY, and LABONGE are standing next to MALEENI's van, now covered with a tarp.)

LABONGE: What's in it for me? I mean, let's say I help you out. What do I get in return?

SCULLY: The feeling of pride that comes from performing your civic duty.

MULDER: How about the chance to root through the professional secrets of your least favorite magician?

LABONGE: Good for a laugh, I guess.

(MULDER pulls the tarp off and he and SCULLY open the back of the van. LABONGE climbs in and begins removing things, including a top hat.)

LABONGE: Man, it's worse than I thought.

(He uncovers the top hat, releasing a couple of white birds, then sets the hat on SCULLY's head. Cute look from SCULLY.)

LABONGE: You got to feed those things, you know.

(SCULLY takes off the hat and looks inside.)

LABONGE: So... Maleeni wasn't murdered?

SCULLY: It would seem not.

LABONGE: So someone impersonated him and his crappy act. It's impressive.

(LABONGE finds a gun. He pulls the trigger. A little red flag that says "Bang" pops out.)

LABONGE: I'd say the twin brother did it but I don't think he's any better a magician than Maleeni was...

MULDER: There's that, and he's got no legs.

(He and SCULLY share a look.)

LABONGE: Yeah. Whatever. Anyway, we're looking for a magician with the same height and build... a good makeup job and the right wig and no one would know the difference.

SCULLY: Not even you, I guess.

LABONGE: I had a couple of Jell-O shots in me.

MULDER: How did this impersonator switch out the dead body?

LABONGE: With ease. You're going to kick yourselves when I show you how he did this, it's so simple. 'Cause magic is all about... (wiggles his hand mysteriously)  misdirection.

(MULDER wiggles his fingers "mysteriously" at SCULLY. She bites back a smile and ignores him.)

LABONGE: Your impersonator simply made sure everyone was looking the other way when he pulled Maleeni's body from its secret hiding place underneath... the floor.

(LABONGE dramatically lifts one of the floor panels up from the bottom of the van revealing  nothing. He pulls up the other panels. Still nothing.)

LABONGE: (surprised) Man, this guy's good.

SCULLY: Thanks for your expert opinion. I guess we're right back where we started.

(A piece of paper has fallen out of the back of the van. MULDER picks it up.)

MULDER: Maybe not. You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni had some gambling debts?

LABONGE: Yeah, that's what I heard.

MULDER: Check this out. It looks like a marker. $20,000. Pinchbeck.

(The marker is dated 12/29/99.)

SCULLY: What would this be doing in Maleeni's van?

(MULDER nods at her.)



SCENE 8

(Bank. Two COURIER GUARDS are removing money from one of the vaults. As they finish, PINCHBECK rolls his chair forward and locks the vault back using a key around his neck.)

COURIER GUARD: Thank you, Mr. Pinchbeck. If you could sign here for me.

(He holds out a clipboard which PINCHBECK signs.)

PINCHBECK: With pleasure.

PINCHBECK: Anthony, what kind of gun is that?

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: Glock 17. Nine millimeter.

PINCHBECK: I've been thinking of maybe buying one since my accident.

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: Here-- take a look.

(He takes his gun out of its holster, removes the clip and the bullet in the chamber, and hands the gun and the clip to PINCHBECK who looks at it closely.)

PINCHBECK: Gosh, it's, uh... it's heavier than I would have thought. (ANTHONY smiles.) Thank you, Anthony... Marvin.

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: If you ever want I'll take you to the shooting range. Have a good one, Mr. Pinchbeck.

PINCHBECK: You, too.

(PINCHBECK goes back to his office. ALVAREZ enters, closes the door and sits down.)

PINCHBECK: Hello. May I help you?

ALVAREZ: Damn. You look just like him.

PINCHBECK: I'm sorry?

ALVAREZ: Your no-good, malapaga brother died owing me money. A lot of money. You're going to make good.

PINCHBECK: I'm sorry, but my, uh, brother's debts are his own.

ALVAREZ: I said, you're going to make good, 'cause me and my friends, we know where you live.

(PINCHBECK takes close note of the numerous tattoos on ALVAREZ's hands.)



SCENE 9

(Downtown Los Angeles. ANTHONY and MARVIN the COURIER GUARDS are in the armored car, MARVIN driving. They hear a thumping from the back of the truck.)

MARVIN THE COURIER GUARD: That sound like the rear diff?

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: Pull over. Stay here and, uh, call it in. I'll check it out.

MARVIN THE COURIER GUARD: (on the radio) We got a problem with the rear diff. Fourth and main, checking it out...

(ANTHONY gets out and goes cautiously around to the back of the truck. He unlocks the back door, then whips up his gun when he sees a man lying among the bags of money.)

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: You! In the truck! Get up where I can see you! Hands where I can see them! Up! Hands up!

(The MAN in the truck stands up and puts his hands up. We cannot see his face, but the hands are covered with tattoos.)

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: All right, get out! Mister, get out...

(The MAN reaches for a gun at his waist. Quickly, ANTHONY fires four times. The MAN falls. ANTHONY darts back to yell to MARVIN. )

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: I got a guy down back here!

(The COURIER GUARDS look back into the truck. The MAN is gone.)

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: It was a guy with tattoos! I shot him four times! I don't understand. He was right here.

(As they stare into the back of the truck, see LABONGE hiding in an alley just a few yards away. He smiles, and takes out a cloth and begins wiping away the tattoos on his hands. LABONGE smiles.)



SCENE 10

(Pool hall. MULDER and SCULLY have tossed the marker they found in MALEENI's van onto the pool table where ALVAREZ is playing, interrupting the game. The marker is now in a plastic sleeve.)

SCULLY: It's your handwriting, is it not? Mr. Alvarez please answer the question.

ALVAREZ: (defensive) That ain't mine. I don't know where you got that.

MULDER: Interesting. Yours are the only fingerprints on it.

SCULLY: We ran it through the California criminal history database to which you seem to be quite well known.

ALVAREZ: So it's my marker. So Pinchbeck owed me money. It was a friendly game of poker.

MULDER: Very friendly. $20,000 friendly.

ALVAREZ: Where did you find that?

SCULLY: In Herman Pinchbeck's van. Where were you last Thursday?

ALVAREZ: Here. All day. Ask them. (glances over at his two THUGS) What is it you think I did to Pinchbeck, huh? What's in it for me? If I kill him, he ain't going to pay me.

MULDER: Why did you play with him in the first place? You knew he was a professional magician.

ALVAREZ: I didn't know what he was... and he sure as hell couldn't play worth a damn.

SCULLY: (friendly warning) Don't leave town, Mr. Alvarez.

(MULDER and SCULLY leave the pool hall, MULDER taking the marker.)

MULDER: Don't you find it odd that the amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player? I mean, this is a guy who's adept at manipulating cards.

SCULLY: Maybe he wasn't so adept. LaBonge certainly doesn't have a high opinion of his skills.

MULDER: There's another possibility. Behold-- an ordinary household quarter. (he holds up a quarter.) I'm going to take the quarter from my right hand and place it into my left hand. (he does with a flourish) Where is it?

SCULLY: It's in your right hand.

(MULDER opens his empty right hand.)

MULDER: Oh, no, no, no.

(SCULLY smiles and taps his left hand open. It is also empty.)

SCULLY: (smiling, impressed) Ah... That's not bad.

(MULDER reaches out and tries to grab SCULLY's nose.)

MULDER: Blow your nose, Scully.

SCULLY: (warning him) Mulder...

MULDER: (holding her nose between his fingers) Blow your nose.

SCULLY: (deadpan) Ah-choo.

(The quarter falls from "SCULLY's nose into MULDER's other hand.)

MULDER: Ta-da.

SCULLY: (amused) Amazing!

MULDER: (proudly) The great Muldeeni.

SCULLY: And what's the point?

MULDER: It's misdirection. That's the heart of magic. I made you look one direction. The quarter went in the other.

SCULLY: And that's what's happening in this case?

MULDER: I think we're being led around by our noses.

SCULLY: By whom? Maleeni is already dead.

MULDER: It certainly would appear so, but then again, you thought the quarter was in the right hand.

(He waves the quarter at her and smiles. They get into their car and drive off. LABONGE watches them leave, then picks up a payphone and dials 911.)

911 OPERATOR: (voice) 911.

LABONGE: (quietly, disguising his voice) Yeah, hello? Yeah, I want to report a man with a gun. H-h- he's threatening to kill somebody.

911 OPERATOR: (voice) Please speak up.

LABONGE: No, I can't speak up. I... No, I can't!

(LABONGE drops the phone and casually walks across the street toward the pool hall.)

911 OPERATOR: (voice) Sir? Hello? Hello?

(Inside the pool hall, ALVAREZ is looking through his little black book of markers. One of the pages from late December has been ripped out.)

ALVAREZ: Son of a bitch.

(LABONGE enters the pool hall. ALVAREZ is not happy to see him.)

LABONGE: (smiling) Hey, partner. Hey, guys.

ALVAREZ: You son of a bitch.

LABONGE: I'm sorry?

ALVAREZ: You tried to frame me. Hijo de tu...

LABONGE: I didn't!

ALVAREZ: Oh, you didn't, huh?!

LABONGE: We've got a deal!

ALVAREZ: We got no deal. I'm gonna bleed you, you little bitch.

(LABONGE pulls out a gun and begins backing up to the door. ALVAREZ and the THUGS stop.)

LABONGE: Back off!

ALVAREZ: You're dead.

(LABONGE gets out the door and begins running down the street. ALVAREZ and the THUGS are about to follow him, but stop when a police car pulls up. They watch as the COPS get out and pull their guns on LABONGE.)

COP: Freeze! Drop your weapon!

(When LABONGE drops the gun, the "bang" sign pops out the muzzle.)

COP: Hands behind your head! Do it! Bring your head down. Spread your legs.

(LABONGE looks very pleased with himself.)



SCENE 11

(The bank. MULDER and SCULLY enter PINCHBECK's office where he is working on the computer. MULDER walks around behind PINCHBECK.)

PINCHBECK: Agents. An unexpected surprise. Good afternoon.

SCULLY: We'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Pinchbeck.

PINCHBECK: I'm fairly busy, actually.

MULDER: I'll bet.

(MULDER pulls PINCHBECK away from his desk.)

PINCHBECK: Hey! W-what...?

MULDER: Let's take a little spin, shall we?

(MULDER wheels PINCHBECK out of the office. SCULLY follows, glancing around to see if anyone notices. They enter an empty conference room.)

PINCHBECK: What's this all about?

MULDER: It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck... or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?

(MULDER dumps PINCHBECK out onto the floor.)

SCULLY: (shocked) Mulder?!

MULDER: It's a trick, Scully. Voila.

(PINCHBECK does, indeed have legs. The pants have been cut away to disguise them. He stands.)

PINCHBECK: (taking off the collar) Had you fooled.

SCULLY: You're Maleeni?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Call me Herman.

(Short time later, MALEENI/PINCHBECK is sitting at the table playing with a deck of cards.)

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: I was afraid for my life. That's why I did what I did. I'm not proud of that... but I owe a lot of money that I can't possibly pay back.

SCULLY: We know. Gambling debts to a man named Alvarez.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: (disgusted) That tattooed psychopath. I've since heard terrible stories about him-- things he did in prison to fellow inmates.

SCULLY: So why'd you play poker with him?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: He runs a good game. I gamble to supplement my income. God knows magic barely pays.

SCULLY: Well, why did you lose? You could have manipulated the cards, right?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Cheat? You're asking why I don't cheat at cards?

SCULLY: Well, you could, right?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Of course I could... (he flips four aces up on the table)  but how would I live with myself? Who raised you?

(SCULLY has a small reaction, thank you Orison 7x07, then continues.)

SCULLY: Well, sir... what does any of this have to do with your twin brother being found decapitated at the Santa Monica Pier?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: I went to my brother for a loan. Just my luck-- and his.

SCULLY: You found him dead of a heart attack.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: His body was still warm. Looking at him lifeless I saw myself-- my own eventual mortality. I saw all the things I meant to accomplish, but didn't. It was an opportunity to vanish-- to become someone else. Like I said, I'm... I'm not proud of what I did.

SCULLY: And so you refrigerated the body...

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: I needed time to figure out how to pull it all off. Impersonating my brother, I called the bank. Told them I needed a vacation week. A trip to Mexico. Then the bank received word that I'd been in a terrible accident. It gave me plenty of time away from work.

SCULLY: And you posed as an amputee to allay suspicion that you weren't your brother.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: That, and I rather enjoyed the sympathy-- especially from the women in our office.

(MULDER sort of smiles and looks down. SCULLY glances at him.)

SCULLY: You, uh, still haven't explained why you left your brother's body at the pier or why you arranged to have his head fall off.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: (indicating MULDER) He explained it. He put it so eloquently when we last spoke. It was my final performance. I wanted to go out with such a shock, such a denouement as would forever be remembered in the annals of magic.

MULDER: That was your last performance.

(MULDER takes out his handcuffs and puts them onto an unresisting MALEENI/PINCHBECK.)

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: What's this for?

MULDER: I still think you've got a few tricks up your sleeve.

(Later, MULDER, SCULLY and MALEENI/PINCHBECK, still in handcuffs, are back in the office talking to the BANK OFFICER.) BANK OFFICER: My god. We gave you handicapped parking. We built you a ramp.

(MALEENI/PINCHBECK hangs his head in shame.)

MULDER: Did he have access to the vaults?

BANK OFFICER: Well, yes, he has a key to the day gate. Several of us do.

(MULDER is looking around the desk.)

SCULLY: What are you looking for, Mulder?

MULDER: Any hint at all as to why Maleeni, here is really impersonating his brother. What about this. (taps the computer monitor) Could he have removed the funds electronically?

BANK OFFICER: Well, he didn't have security clearance for EFTs. Electronic fund transfers.

MULDER: Maybe he got around the security. Can we check the withdrawal records?

BANK OFFICER: It would require your badge number and thumbprint and probably a federal subpoena to boot.

(SCULLY notices and picks up the clipboard that the COURIER GUARD had MALEENI/PINCHBECK sign earlier. )

BANK OFFICER: We're extra cautious with the EFTs. You can understand why. There may be an easier way. If I call up a transaction list for this terminal...

(The BANK OFFICER types some commands on the computer. No transactions are registered.)

BANK OFFICER: No. No, everything's in order.

(MALEENI/PINCHBECK has gotten out of the handcuffs. He holds them up with a big smile at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it says here something about a robbery attempt yesterday.

BANK OFFICER: Yeah, that wasn't against us but the armored transport service we deal with. No money was taken, and no suspects were caught.

SCULLY: (looking at the clipboard) Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was the employee who signed out the truck. He knew the schedule.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: I had nothing to do with that.

SCULLY: Maybe, maybe not.

MULDER: (taking his handcuffs back) We'll hold you till we find out. Make sure you don't pull a vanishing act.



SCENE 12
NORTH HOLLYWOOD STATION

(Prison. A HOLDING CELL OFFICER leads MALEENI/PINCHBECK to a cell.)

HOLDING CELL OFFICER: (to a fellow OFFICER at the desk) Hey.

(A buzzer admits them into the cell area.)

HOLDING CELL OFFICER: Paul, I'm putting Mr. Pinchbeck in six.

PAUL THE OTHER CELL OFFICER: Right.

HOLDING CELL OFFICER: Sleep tight.

(He closes the door and walks away.)

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Wait, don't I get a phone call, sir? (no response) Sir?

(The OFFICER is gone. Someone casually taps the first phrase of "Shave and a Haircut" on the wall. Which appears to be made of concrete blocks. Oww. MALEENI/PINCHBECK finishes the phrase with "two bits." Camera pans over to show that LABONGE is in the neighboring cell.)

LABONGE: How'd it go?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Swimmingly.

LABONGE: (with a smile) Abracadabra, man.



SCENE 13

(Next morning. Bank. The BANK OFFICER and the COURIER GUARD open and look into the vault. To their horror, lots of money is missing.)

BANK OFFICER: Oh, Deeaammnnn!!!

(He runs to the phone. Later MULDER and SCULLY are there. COPS are dusting for fingerprints.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes... Okay. All right  All right, thank you.

MULDER: Maleeni?

SCULLY: He's still in the city lockup where he's been since we arrested him last night. It certainly doesn't look like he did this. Lots of fingerprints.

MULDER: Yeah. I guarantee you none of them match our thieves. They're too clever to leave clues... except for the ones they want us to find.

(BANK OFFICER walks up to them.)

BANK OFFICER: Excuse me. May I show you something?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER and SCULLY follow him to a video monitor showing people entering the bank. ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD is reviewing the tapes.)

BANK OFFICER: We thought the security camera footage might show the robbers.

SCULLY: Does it?

BANK OFFICER: No. They all mysteriously went blank from about 3:00 A.M. to 3:20, but that's not what we wanted you to see.

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: This is from two days ago.

(On the monitor, they see ALVAREZ enter the bank.)

SCULLY: Cissy Alvarez. Convicted bank robber.

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: You recognize this man?

MULDER: Yeah. Who is he to you?

(Close up of ALVAREZ'S hands. Number on the screen: 163321)

ANTHONY THE COURIER GUARD: I know those tattoos. That's the man who tried to rob my truck.



SCENE 14

(Pool hall. A COP roughly pushes ALVAREZ onto a pool table and handcuffs him. Other COPS, including MULDER and SCULLY are looking around the place.)

ALVAREZ: Ah! What the hell, man! What did I do?! You, FBI, what's up? (MULDER doesn't answer) What's up with this, man? Yo, man, you can't just come busting in here, okay? I got civil rights. I'm going to call my lawyer and then we're going to see what's what.

ANOTHER COP: There's nothing back there.

ALVAREZ: This is harassment, man. This is harassment! Yo, what are they looking for? Come on, man, yo! Somebody talk to me.

(The THUGS are also cuffed.)

COP: Shut up.

ALVAREZ: You shut up. This ain't right. You got the cuffs on so tight. Yo, will you please tell me what he's looking for?

(MULDER notices that one of the ceiling tiles is sagging a little. SCULLY joins him, then MULDER takes a pool cue and pushes on it causing it to crack and let several bags of money fall from the ceiling onto the pool table.)

SCULLY: Well... saving up for a rainy day?

ALVAREZ: (realizing what has happened) Oh, no, no, no, no. We got framed. This is a frame-up! That was the magician.

MULDER: The magician? Maleeni?

(The COPS are dragging a struggling ALVAREZ out of the building.)

ALVAREZ: No. Not the dead one, man. That little cabron! LaBonge! LaBonge set me up! Listen to me...

SCULLY: Billy LaBonge.

MULDER: (to SCULLY) And the Amazing Maleeni. That's a double bill I wouldn't want to miss.



SCENE 15

(Prison. The HOLDING CELL OFFICER unlocks the cells.)

HOLDING CELL OFFICER: Pinchbeck. You made your bail. You too, LaBonge.

(MULDER and SCULLY have entered the prison.)

PAUL THE OTHER OFFICER AT THE BUZZER: (to MULDER and SCULLY) Okay.

(The buzzer sounds, admitting MULDER and SCULLY to the cell area just as MALEENI/PINCHBECK and LABONGE are about to leave.)

SCULLY: I think releasing these two may be a bit premature.

MULDER: Give us a minute, will you?

(The HOLDING CELL OFFICER leaves.)

MULDER: Good morning, gentlemen. Did you sleep well?

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.

MULDER: Bravo. Really.

LABONGE: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Last night the Cradock Marine Bank was robbed of $1.8 million. This morning that entire amount was found in the possession of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Wow. I told you he was bad news. Bravo to you. That was expeditious police work.

MULDER: (smiling) Well, thank you. It was, wasn't it? It's only that Alvarez was so obviously guilty. A convicted bank robber caught red-handed witnessed trying to rob an armored car just two days earlier?

SCULLY: He'll need a good lawyer.

MULDER: Yeah. Yeah, he's up a creek... Just like you two want him.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: I don't quite see where you're headed with this.

MULDER: I have no evidence but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni and, uh, I'll tell you how it goes. I think that your twin brother, Albert, died of a heart attack at which point you and your young protégé saw a golden opportunity.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: My protégé? I hate this guy's guts.

SCULLY: That's what you wanted us to think.

MULDER: You wanted revenge against the man who made your life in prison a living hell.

FLASHBACK OF LABONGE TALKING TO ALVAREZ:

LABONGE: I did time with you about eight years ago.

MULDER: Alvarez. You and he were in the same cell block eight years ago.

SCULLY: It was a setup from the start. You played poker with him and you made sure that you lost big.

MULDER: Which gave LaBonge and "in" with Alvarez once everybody thought you were dead.

SCULLY: LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in Maleeni's van and made sure we found it  (Flashback of MULDER looking at the marker)  and then you used Alvarez's greed in order to ensnare him and then orchestrated the attempted bank robbery in order to implicate him.

MULDER: Yeah. That was you in the armored car disguised as Alvarez. (Flashback of PINCHBEK looking at the gun) Somehow, Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of the guard's gun and switched the clip. Guard didn't know it, but he was firing blanks. (Flashback of GUARD firing into the truck)

SCULLY: And then last night the two of you robbed the bank, and planted the money at ALVAREZ's place. (Flashback of money falling out of the ceiling)

LABONGE: (indicating the cells) Don't you think we have pretty good alibis?

MULDER: You have great alibis. You have the best alibis in the world which is why I think you two got arrested in the first place.

SCULLY: With your expertise at sleight of hand, pick pocketing, and escapology I think you were both able to get out of here by pilfering a guard's key.

MULDER: You could have escaped, stolen the money framed Alvarez and been back here in time for breakfast.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: Scrambled eggs and sausage. That would be the world's greatest trick, wouldn't it?

MULDER: One that would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.

LABONGE: What happens to us?

MULDER: To you? You go free... provided the magic is over.

MALEENI/PINCHBECK: (with dignity) The great ones always know when to leave the stage. (buzzer sounds, MULDER opens the door) Billy, let's get the hell out of here.

(MALEENI/PINCHBECK and LABONGE leave.)

MULDER: They are the world's greatest.

SCULLY: We saw through their magic.

MULDER: Nah, there's more.

(MULDER smiles, shows that his sleeves are empty and wiggles his left fingers up in the air. SCULLY obediently watches the fingers while MUDLER fumbles in his jacket with his right hand, then "magically" whips out a large wallet.)

MULDER: Behold! The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.

SCULLY: (surprised) You picked his pocket?

MULDER: No. I pilfered it from the evidence room to prevent them from completing their final act of prestidigitation.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I began to wonder, why did they need so elaborate a setup? Why so high profile? Why draw the attention of the FBI in the first place?

SCULLY: We were the last piece of the puzzle.

MULDER: Yes. Framing Alvarez was just another misdirection. This trick was about EFTs-- electronic funds transfers at the bank. Maleeni, Pinchbeck-- he didn't have security clearance for them so he needed a little federal law enforcement intervention-- specifically, my badge number... (Flashback of MULDER's badge - agent number 22791)  and my thumbprint. (Flashback of MULDER taking the King of Diamonds.) With those two items, they could pull off an EFT and steal enough electronically as to make that $1.8 million look like cigar-lighting money. But they can't do it without this. Pick a card, Scully... Any card.

(He pulls the plastic encased King of Diamonds out of the wallet. They walk down the hall to the exit.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, there's still one thing that you haven't explained.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: How the Amazing Maleeni was able to turn his head completely around.

MULDER: I don't know that.

SCULLY: I do. I'll show you. Observe.

(SCULLY gets down on her knees in front of MULDER who grins broadly. She places her hands awkwardly on the floor and turns her right arm a full 360 degrees, then gets up and smoothes her sleeve. MULDER is very impressed.)

MULDER: Gee! Very nice. How'd you do that?

SCULLY: Well... magic.

(SCULLY keeps walking down the hall. MULDER follows.)

MULDER: No. Seriously, Scully, how'd you do it? You know, it's not the same thing. It's different with the head. Come on. Look at this.

(He does the disappearing thumb trick that doesn't work on anyone over four years old. She doesn't even look back.)

MULDER: I'll show you - - -

(They are through the door and gone. Bet it's a fun plane ride back to DC.)

[THE END]


                                      SIGNS AND WONDERS


SCENE 1
BLESSING, TENNESSEE

(Stormy, rainy night. Bedroom of a large old house. Close-up of the rattle (not still attached) from a rattlesnake's tail lying on the dresser. A young man, JARED CHIRP, is packing a suitcase. He is very nervous. He looks at a piece of paper with medical lab test results. In disgust and anger he tears it in half and throws it toward the wastebasket and misses. He continues to pack.)

JARED CHIRP: (under his breath) Holy Ghost, come to me. Praise God. Praise God. Move up on me, Holy Ghost. Praise God.

(He removes a Bible from a drawer and holds it reverently.)

JARED CHIRP: This here sinner repents. Holy Ghost, move up on me.

(He takes a picture of a young blonde woman from the Bible and looks at it.)

JARED CHIRP: Protect me and mine with your quickening power.

(Flash of lightening outside allows us to see the outline of a man standing among the trees. In the next flash, he is gone. JARED CHIRP packs the Bible and the picture. He gets a gun from another drawer and checks the clip. It's loaded with six bullets. As he does, he hears the sound of a snake rattling. He looks over at the rattle on the dresser as it moves on its own. He gets even more nervous.)

JARED CHIRP: Holy Ghost, come to me.

(He tucks the gun into his pants, picks up the suitcase and goes outside into the rainy night and gets into his car. We see someone close by watching him. Their hands is resting on a tree. JARED CHIRP locks the car doors and places the gun on top of the suitcase next to him on the passenger side of the car. When he pulls out his keys, his hands are shaking so badly that he drops them onto the floor board. As he reaches down for them he hears the rattling again and a hiss. A large rattlesnake slides from under the car seat toward the keys. Trembling in fear, JARED CHIRP reaches for the gun. Another rattler slides up and onto the suitcase, slithering over the gun. He frantically tries to open the door, but it does not unlock.)

JARED CHIRP: Oh, help me, Jesus! Oh, help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

(The car is now full of snakes. He pulls the gun from under the snakes on the suitcase. Exterior shot of the car shows it shaking as he fires the gun several times. He begins screaming.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(X-Files office. MULDER's computer display shows a video of some evil looking hissing rattlesnake from some animal fact-type website. He is on the phone as SCULLY enters.)

MULDER: (on phone) Not as far as you know? ... Not this time of year? ... All right. Thank you, Doctor. Good-bye.

(SCULLY looks at the computer screen he turns to her as MULDER hangs up.)

SCULLY: Snakes.

MULDER: Lots and lots of snakes. Very pissed off ones, from the look of it.

(MULDER hands her a folder. SCULLY opens it and reacts to the image of JARED CHIRP's bloated and discolored corpse.)

MULDER: That's the former Mr. Jared Chirp of McMinn County, Tennessee.

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

MULDER: 116 separate bite marks. Judging from the wound measurements there were 50 different snakes involved-- mostly copperheads and rattlers.

SCULLY: But it says here that he was found dead in his car.

MULDER: Yeah, with a pistol in his hand. He fired six shots, into the floorboards, into the passenger seat, even into his own right kneecap, and the windows were shut and the doors were locked.

SCULLY: But, uh, what happened to all the snakes?

MULDER: No one seems to know that. There was not a scale found. I just got off the phone with a herpetologist at the Smithsonian, and he's stumped - especially because these rattlesnakes tend to hibernate in winter.

SCULLY: So you think that, uh... Mr. Chirp was murdered?

MULDER: Well, it certainly would appear that way but the question is "how?" There's no physical evidence at all-- no tire tracks, no footprints. I can't see how anyone could have accomplished this. And then you got to ask yourself "why?" Why would anybody use poisonous snakes as a murder weapon?

SCULLY: Maybe it's symbolic. I mean, serpents and religion have gone hand in hand. They've represented the temptation of Eve-- Original Sin. They've been feared and hated throughout history as they've been thought to embody Satan-- to serve Evil itself.

MULDER: Maybe these ones actually do.

SCULLY: These particular serpents actually were serving Evil? ("looks" at him) Are you going to type that on our travel request?

MULDER: (with a smile) Mmm ... No. But at the very least this case does seem to center around religion ... and you're not the only one to think that by the way.

(SCULLY looks at him questioningly.)



SCENE 3
BLESSING COMMUNITY CHURCH
BLESSING, TENNESSEE

(Small town church. Stained-glass windows, nice pews. After a funeral. A young blonde woman, the same as in the picture that JARED CHIRP was looking at in the teaser, is crying. She is GRACIE, very pregnant, and sitting with an older woman, IRIS FINSTER. IRIS has ... interesting hair. At least three cans of hairspray were needed to achieve the look. GRACIE clutches a tissue and has been crying for a while. REVEREND SAMUEL MACKEY, a gentle looking minister, comes up to them.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (comforting) Jared is in a better place now, Gracie. He's at peace.

(GRACIE, with IRIS' arm around her shoulder, walks to the coffin and tenderly fingers the flowers on top.)

IRIS FINSTER: You know, Reverend Mackey's right, honey. He is in a better place.

(GRACIE touches the coffin sadly and they go out of the church. A Ford Taurus is parked in front, MULDER and SCULLY walk over to them. MULDER is very casual, dark shirt, no tie. Okay, he's a good-looking man. SCULLY, of course, is stunning as always. They hold out their badges.)

MULDER: Reverend Samuel Mackey? My name is Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. We're with the FBI. May be speak with you, sir?

(SCULLY looks up to see IRIS FINSTER and GRACIE on the church steps.)

IRIS FINSTER: Come on, Gracie. Let's get you home.

(IRIS FINSTER leads GRACIE away to a car.)

MULDER: We apologize for our timing. We'd like to ask you a few questions about Jared Chirp.

REVEREND MACKEY: I've already spoken to the Sheriff about it... though I'm not sure that was a good idea.

MULDER: Specifically, you had suspicions about the manner in which he died?

REVEREND MACKEY: (sighs) I should be the last one to point a finger or say a harsh word. Our church is founded on acceptance and tolerance of all people, all beliefs...

SCULLY: But...?

REVEREND MACKEY: Before Jared joined us he belonged to a fundamentalist congregation outside of town-- the Church of God with Signs and Wonders. It practices snake handling.

MULDER: As a sign of faith, worshipers handle deadly snakes or drink poison.

REVEREND MACKEY: They believe that the Holy Spirit protects the righteous. Jared grew up in that church but it is very difficult to walk away from a belief system that one is raised in. It takes great courage.

(SCULLY reacts to that one.)

MULDER: Why did he walk away?

REVEREND MACKEY: He and Gracie, his girlfriend, left it together. They found that a rigid interpretation of the Bible was not for them, especially when it involves risking life and limb in the act of worship, but again it is not for me to judge. I will say, however, that both Jared and Gracie were persecuted by the members of their former church. All this animus... stems from their church leader-- Enoch O'Connor.

SCULLY: Animus enough to motivate a murder?

(REVEREND MACKEY looks at them.)



SCENE 4

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY pull up in front of the Church of God With Signs and Wonders. It is a small run down building. Hand painted sign outside the church:

"LOOK UNTO ME AND BE SAVED:
ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH;
FOR I AM GOD, AND THERE IS NONE OTHER:
ISAIAH 45:22"

All the windows are shaded. MULDER and SCULLY walk up the steps onto the porch.)

SCULLY: Snake handling. I didn't learn that in catechism class.

MULDER: That's funny. I knew a couple of Catholic schoolgirls who were expert at it.

(SCULLY gives him a look. They enter the dark church.)

MULDER: Enoch O'Connor? Federal Agents. (to SCULLY) Where's the light switch?

SCULLY: The nearest one? Probably ten miles from here.

(MULDER chuckles. The door won't stay open and swings shut. They pull out their small flashlights. SCULLY looks at a hand painted picture on the wall.)

SCULLY: Rattlesnakes and medieval visions of damnation. Well, I for one, feel a whole lot closer to God.

MULDER: I don't know, Scully. When you... when you get right down to it is snake handling any harder to buy into than communion wafers or transubstantiation...?

SCULLY: Or believing in flying saucers, for that matter.

MULDER: I'm just saying that-that your faith and O'Connor's seem to be based on the same book.

(As they look around, SCULLY walks past a snake that seems very interested in her feet. She doesn't notice it. MULDER finds a hinged box with a wire mesh screen.)

MULDER: Uh-oh, Scully. What do you think O'Connor keeps in here?

SCULLY: Something slithery?

MULDER: (shaking the box) It's all right. It's empty.

SCULLY: Why is it empty?

(Sound of loud rattling. MULDER and SCULLY both whip around and pull out their guns. Snakes begin slithering out of corners and from under pews. A man, REVEREND ENOCH REVEREND O'CONNOR enters the church. He has a thick [yet accurate, thank you] East Tennessee accent.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: By what right are you here?

SCULLY: (nervously, holding out her badge, not taking her eyes off the snakes) Reverend Enoch O'Connor, we're Federal Agents. We're, uh... with the FBI.

MULDER: Reverend, do something about these snakes, please.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: You got nothing to fear if you're righteous people.

MULDER: (very nervous) Just in case we're not, we could use a little righteous help here.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: What do you want?

(REVEREND O'CONNOR begins confidently picking up the snakes and putting them into a burlap bag.)

SCULLY: (still nervous) We're here to ask you questions about a former member of your church-- Jared Chirp.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: That boy strayed from the path and was lost to the dark one. I'm sorry for his soul. There ain't much else to say.

MULDER: He died from multiple snakebites. We thought maybe you'd have a special insight into that.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (picking up another snake) I do. It was a test.

SCULLY: A test? What do you mean?

REVEREND O'CONNOR: A test of faith. A test of righteousness. When the Devil aims to test you, you'd best be ready and you sure better know which side you're on.

(Rattling stops. The snakes are now all in the bag.)

SCULLY: Are you speaking about the Devil's test or your test?

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (to SCULLY) I don't think you people realize which side you're on. I do. You can leave now.

(SCULLY glances at MULDER. Then they holster their guns and walk out of the church and head for their car.)

SCULLY: Tennessee. Snakes. Thank you, Mulder. Thank you so much. I say we arrest him and catch the first flight out of here.

MULDER: He does seem like a likely suspect only the local sheriff's office ruled him out. Apparently, he was in Kentucky the night Jared Chirp died.

SCULLY: Well, Mulder, there are other people in his congregation.

MULDER: Jared Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side. There's got to be somebody that knows where he was headed.

(They get into the car.)



SCENE 5
BLESSING COMMUNITY CHURCH
7:03 PM

(REVEREND MACKEY's church. Several people, including GRACIE and IRIS FINSTER are getting ready for an evening Bible study class. IRIS FINSTER hands a cup of tea or coffee to GRACIE.)

IRIS FINSTER: Here you go, honey.

(REVEREND MACKEY enters. IRIS FINSTER is nervous. She goes up to REVEREND MACKEY and speaks to him privately.)

IRIS FINSTER: Reverend Mackey? This might not be the best time but can I speak to you?

REVEREND MACKEY: Of course.

IRIS FINSTER: Jared called the boardinghouse late the night he died. He wanted to talk to Gracie. I didn't let him. It was after 2:00. She was sound asleep and it sounded to me like the boy had been drinking. He just wasn't making any sense. He was ranting about seeing the Devil and paying for his sins.

REVEREND MACKEY: Iris, why didn't you tell the police?

IRIS FINSTER: Well, I don't know how to tell Gracie. I kept her from speaking to Jared his last night on Earth. I couldn't have known, though. I couldn't have...

REVEREND MACKEY: No, no. You couldn't have known. I can help you talk to Gracie.

GRACIE: Reverend Mackey? Everybody's here.

REVEREND MACKEY: Thank you, Gracie. (to IRIS FINSTER) You and I will see this through, Iris, right after study group.

IRIS FINSTER: (grateful) Thank you.

CUT TO:

CHURCH OF GOD WITH SIGNS AND WONDERS 7:09 PM

(REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. Service is beginning. Pick-up trucks are parked outside. The room is full of men, women and children. No one looks overly wealthy. REVEREND O'CONNOR preaches in a passionate sing-song evangelical style. Several people have musical instruments. Others are clapping to the music.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (voice) Our God is a fearsome God.

MAN: (voice) Amen!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (voice) He demands our very lives!

(Inside the church, REVEREND O'CONNOR is reading from the Bible.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Revelations Three, the 16th verse. "'Tis better to be hot or cold than lukewarm."

(Congregation shouts affirmation.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (laughing with joy) God says, if you're lukewarm He will vomit you out of His mouth.

CONGREGATION: Praise God!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Yes! Did you hear what I said?!

CONGREGATION: Praise God! Yes!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: God hates the lukewarm!

CUT TO:

(REVEREND MACKEY's Bible study class. They are sitting in a nice calm circle.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (reading from another, more "modern" version of the Bible) "So, because you are lukewarm I am about to spit you out of my mouth." Now, that could sound pretty harsh, couldn't it? I mean, depending on how one reads it. But if we put this verse in a historical context I think we'll see that John was specifically addressing the problems of the Church at Laodicea.

(In the office in the next room, IRIS FINSTER is collating and stapling together the church bulletin.)

CUT TO:

(REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. The congregation is getting ecstatic.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: God wants you hot! God wants you on fire!

(The REVEREND places his hand on a woman's head then continues walking around the room.)

MAN: Praise Jesus.

(People with musical instruments continue playing.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (slapping his hand on the Bible) God wants you to put your money where your mouth is!

CONGREGATION: Amen! Hallelujah! Praise Jesus! Praise the Lord!

(Sound of rattling as REVEREND O'CONNOR places his Bible on one of the snake cages and carries it to a table.)

CONGREGATION: Amen! Yes, amen!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: People ask me why I handle snakes.

CONGREGATION: Praise the lord! Hallelujah!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: I tell 'em it's 'cause the scripture tells me to.

CONGREGATION: Praise God!

(REVEREND O'CONNOR begins shaking in ecstasy.)

CUT TO:

(REVEREND MACKEY's church. IRIS FINSTER is still stapling. She is now using a staple remover to take out previous staples so she can add another page, then re-staple. Her hands are shaking. We hear REVEREND MACKEY in the other room.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (voice) ...he offers to Jesus to come into our lives and dine with us if only we'd open the door.

CUT TO:

(REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. He and others are now holding the snakes who are hissing and rattling.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR AND CONGREGATION: Praise God! Hallelujah! Praise God! Hallelujah!

(Camera close-up of a snake's fangs as it hisses with its mouth open ...

CUT TO:

... a close-up of the "fangs" on IRIS FINSTER's staple remover back in REVEREND MACKEY's church. In VOICE-OVER we hear REVEREND MACKEY's Bible study class.)

REVEREND MACKEY: ...the manner in which John ends this chapter. His emphasis is on teaching the Church at Laodicea perseverance. He uses the word "overcome" not once, but twice. I think he's also trying to...

(IRIS FINSTER continues to remove staples. Suddenly, the staple remover morphs into a rattlesnake and it bites her between the thumb and the forefinger. She gasps. It morphs back to a staple remover. Blood pours from the wound.)

CUT TO:

(REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. Lots of snakes, lots of convulsing, lots of music and sweating.)

CONGREGATION (singing) Dear Lord, come take me
I'm coming through the fire
Dear Lord, come take me
I'm coming through the fire
Dear Lord, come take me
I'm coming through the fire
Won't you please come and take us away
Dear Lord, I love you, I love, love you, God
Dear Lord, I love you...

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Witness the power! Witness the awesome power of God as He blesses His people and destroys His enemies! Thank you, God!

(Camera goes into slow-motion on REVEREND O'CONNOR, no audio as he praises God. The scene changes to a bright light which ... )

CUTS TO:

(... washroom light in bathroom. IRIS FINSTER is rinsing her bloody hand in the sink. She blots it dry then gets a box of band-aids out of the medicine cabinet. She hears a hissing, then gasps and drops the box as a snake rears up out of the sink drain. More snakes come out from under the bathroom stalls. IRIS FINSTER is frozen in terror as one of them strikes.)



SCENE 6

(REVEREND MACKEY's church, later. Crime scene. With REVEREND MACKEY, MULDER watches as IRIS FINSTER's dead snake-bitten body is wheeled out of the bathroom by the EMTs.)

REVEREND MACKEY: I don't understand it. None of us saw or heard anything. Just her scream. When we ran in, she was lying on the floor. I cleared everybody out of the building once I saw the bite marks, but...

MULDER: Reverend, how close was Iris to Jared Chirp?

REVEREND MACKEY: Not ... particularly close but I'd spoken with her not 15 minutes earlier about him.

MULDER: What'd you talk about?

REVEREND MACKEY: She was upset. Something about Jared calling her the night he died looking for Gracie. Something about him... paying for his sins. Well, I don't know. We didn't get to finish our conversation.

MULDER: Maybe that was the point.

(MULDER and REVEREND MACKEY look at each other, then enter another room where SCULLY is with GRACIE who is crying.)

GRACIE: Why Iris? Why is this happening?

(REVEREND MACKEY sits down next to her. MULDER stands behind SCULLY.)

SCULLY: (gently) Gracie we're investigating the leader of your former church, Enoch O'Connor. We believe that he may have had something to do with what happened here tonight.

(GRACIE looks hurt and surprised. She shares a glance with the REVEREND.)

MULDER: We would appreciate anything you could tell us about him.

GRACIE: No, he didn't do this. No. He didn't do this. This... this is Satan's work, not man's.

SCULLY: Gracie, that sounds like something that Reverend O'Connor might say. Now, you're not a member of that congregation anymore. And I understand that's because you're someone who thinks for herself.

MULDER: Keeping an open mind, Gracie, is it conceivable that O'Connor could have done any of this?

GRACIE: No! Don't you think I would know, me, of all people? He couldn't have done this. He just cou....

(She cries some more.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (softly) Gracie might be biased.

MULDER: (realizing) O'Connor is your father.

(SCULLY sighs.)

REVEREND MACKEY: When Gracie got pregnant...

MULDER: O'Connor barred her from his church. She and Jared Chirp.

REVEREND MACKEY: His church and his home.



SCENE 7
10:06 PM

(MULDER and SCULLY are once again at REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. MULDER opens the door and steps in. SCULLY hangs back, clearly nervous. MULDER looks back at her.)

MULDER: You coming?

SCULLY: I think I'll check around back.

(SCULLY goes back off the porch. MULDER looks around inside the church. He sees a wall of pictures. Lettering above them says: "We pray for the souls of our brothers and sisters ... some passed, others lost to us.")

MULDER: "Pray for the souls ... lost to us."

(Among the pictures he sees GRACIE, JARED CHIRP, and a woman named ALICE O'CONNOR.)

(SCULLY finds a trailer behind the church. She pulls out her gun, enters the trailer and finds a cage of white mice and lots and lots of boxes of snakes. Some of them are rattling their tails. SCULLY turns to leave and is grabbed by REVEREND O'CONNOR.)

SCULLY: Oh!!

(Sound of rattling and hissing gets louder. SCULLY's gun is knocked from her hand.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: You must be judged.

(He holds her head against the wire screen of one of the big rattlers. She is terrified. He grabs her hand and shoves it inside the cage with the rattling snake and holds it there.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Repent! Pray for the Lord's quickening power. Into the hands of God.

(MULDER enters the trailer and points his gun at REVEREND O'CONNOR.)

MULDER: Let her go!

(REVEREND O'CONNOR doesn't let go of SCULLY. MULDER cocks gun and gives his "I'm not kidding around here" look. REVEREND O'CONNOR lets SCULLY go. She jerks her hand out of the box.)



SCENE 8
MCMINN COUNTY SHERIFF'S STATION
11:22 PM

(Interrogation room. MULDER is interviewing REVEREND O'CONNOR.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Your FBI partner could've learned something about herself if you hadn't stopped me. Some powerful good news, maybe.

MULDER: I'd say it's good news for you that she's not here right now ... considering what you tried to do to her. Is that what you did to your wife?

(MULDER sets down the picture of ALICE O'CONNOR that was on the wall of the church.)

MULDER: Alice O'Connor... succumbed to multiple snakebites in June, 1994. It happened during a church service or at least that's what you told local police. You got away with it... almost. What was, uh... the problem with your wife? Was she not... righteous enough for you? Just like your daughter's boyfriend ... or Iris Finster?

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (looking at MULDER) Educated man... too smart to know any better.

MULDER: Smart enough to know you're a murderer.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Satan is near, and you don't even have eyes. You're just proud and fancy free.

MULDER: No one quite passes muster with you, huh? You feel the need to exact some kind of Old Testament revenge? What about your daughter? What were your plans for her?

REVEREND O'CONNOR: I pray for her soul. I pray and I pray because she's lost.

MULDER: Because she no longer believes as you do?

REVEREND O'CONNOR: You think because you're educated you're better than most? You ain't. (He points to his heart.) Unless you're smart down here the Devil's going to make a fool of you and you ain't even going to know it.

(Outside the interrogation room. GRACIE is waiting with SCULLY.)

GRACIE: I changed my mind. I don't... I don't want to see him. Besides, I won't do any better than you people in getting him to talk.

(GRACIE starts to walk away, stops when SCULLY addresses her.)

SCULLY: Gracie. You still don't believe your father did it?

GRACIE: It don't matter what I believe. He'll be judged as he deserves. Can't nobody avoid it.

(SCULLY watches her go.)

(Later, REVEREND O'CONNOR is resting in a jail cell. He is awakened by the sound of rattling. Nervously he stands. The rattling gets louder. He sinks to his knees and begins praying under his breath as snakes begin sliding through the bars of the cell. One final overhead shot shows him completely surrounded by snakes.)



SCENE 9

(Hospital room. I.C.U.1 REVEREND O'CONNOR is unconscious. SCULLY enters and joins MULDER who is looking at REVEREND O'CONNOR's bruised, bitten, and bloated body.)

MULDER: Deputy found him about an hour ago. There's no telling when he was attacked.

SCULLY: I guess it's looking less and less like he's a suspect.

MULDER: Unless he somehow managed to do this to himself ... (SCULLY looks at him) ... as a test of his own righteousness.

SCULLY: Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's still out. I just spoke to his doctors. It's a toss-up as to whether he's going to pull through this.

MULDER: What about antivenin treatment?

SCULLY: He's not receiving it.

MULDER: Why not?

SCULLY: Gracie stepped in. She's trying to forbid treatment on religious grounds. It's not clear whether she has a legal claim to do it, but she says that it's up to God as to whether he lives or dies.

MULDER: And you're thinking that her actions may not be entirely motivated by concern for her father's eternal soul?

SCULLY: (she nods slightly) Well, more to the point, Mulder, what if she did this? She told me that her father would be judged as he deserves.

MULDER: Do you think this is what she meant?

SCULLY: Well, she grew up around snakes, Mulder. Who's to say she isn't every bit as adept at handling them as he is?

MULDER: I can see her being angry enough at her father to attack him, but... what about the others?

(SCULLY has no answer.)



SCENE 10
JARED CHIRP RESIDENCE
10:58 PM

(MULDER and SCULLY are looking around JARED CHIRP's bedroom.)

MULDER: He left in a hurry. Packed one suitcase and a gun. Earlier that night he calls Gracie. Gets Iris instead. Starts rambling about paying for his sins. He's frightened... wants to leave town, presumably with Gracie.

SCULLY: So, what's he scared of?

(MULDER looks in another drawer.)

SCULLY: Though I don't understand it, O'Connor's church exerts a strong pull on these people.

MULDER: (shaking the snake's rattle that he finds on the dresser) It's not so hard to understand. It's a culture with a very well-defined set of rules.

SCULLY: It's an intolerant culture, Mulder.

MULDER: I don't know, Scully. Sometimes a little intolerance can be a welcome thing. Clear-cut right and wrong, black and white, no shades of gray. You know, in a society where hard and fast rules are harder and harder to come by, I think some people would appreciate that.

SCULLY: You're saying that you, Fox Mulder, would welcome someone telling you what to believe?

MULDER: I'm just saying that somebody offering you all the answers... could be a very powerful thing.

(MULDER finds a crumpled paper on the floor. It is the lab result sheet that JARED CHIRP looked at in the teaser.)

MULDER: Oh, it's lab results. Am I reading this right? That Jared Chirp had himself tested for sterility?

(Camera shows some of the writing on the paper:

"Patient is infertile due to insufficient ...
No medical recommendation to ...
Condition considered permanent.")

SCULLY: Which turns out to be more or less the case. Based on this, that means that Jared can't be the father of Gracie's baby.

MULDER: It's dated the day he died.

SCULLY: So maybe he was killed because he discovered the truth.



SCENE 11

(Hospital. GRACIE is standing in her father's room watching him sadly. REVEREND MACKEY enters.)

REVEREND MACKEY: Gracie, I'd like to ask you to reconsider.

GRACIE: No. This is what he'd want.

REVEREND MACKEY: He may die without medical treatment.

GRACIE: I've seen him bit a dozen times. He always said that it was up to God whether he lives or dies. Said it was a worse sin not to trust God.

REVEREND MACKEY: There are many ways to trust God, Gracie. One of them is to trust in the miracles of doctors and medicine. Or... in your heart do you really not want him to get better?

GRACIE: It ain't for me. I can't risk his soul.

REVEREND MACKEY: And when you first came to me you said that you wanted to think for yourself. To live your life as you saw fit. If you stand here and let your father die, whose beliefs are you living? Yours? Or his?

(GRACIE looks at her father sadly and nods. It is very difficult.)

REVEREND MACKEY: You're doing the right thing. I'll go tell the doctor, okay?

(She nods again mutely as he leaves. The beeping on REVEREND O'CONNOR's monitor speeds up. Concerned, she goes to him. Pus begins seeping out of REVEREND O'CONNOR's discolored and swollen skin. Really nasty. His eyes open and he grabs GRACIE's arm. She gasps in fear.)

(Short time later, MULDER and SCULLY enter the hospital. REVEREND MACKEY is upset. He turns from the nurses.)

REVEREND MACKEY: Agents, Enoch O'Connor is gone. I was away for five minutes. His bed's empty. Gracie is gone, too.

SCULLY: How could Gracie have possibly gotten him out of here?

MULDER: Maybe he took her.

SCULLY: Mulder, he was on his deathbed; that's impossible. And besides, what's his motivation?

REVEREND MACKEY: I may be able to answer that. Jared Chirp wasn't the father of Gracie's child.

MULDER: We know that. What about it?

SCULLY: (shocked, but understanding) Enoch O'Connor is.

REVEREND MACKEY: That's why she wanted to get away from him and his church as fast as she could. And I tried to teach her to forgive him.



SCENE 12

(REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. REVEREND O'CONNOR drags GRACIE in. The congregation is standing silently, many holding candles. GRACIE struggles.)

GRACIE: Daddy, please...!

(She whimpers as he drags her to a tub of water.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: I'm bringing you home.

GRACIE: (sobbing) Somebody help me!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: In the name of our Holy and most fearsome God...

CONGREGATION: Hallelujah!

(GRACIE shrieks. REVEREND O'CONNOR plunges her into a baptizing tub)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Resist the devil and he will flee. Resist him!

GRACIE: Something's wrong... Something's wrong with my baby. Oh!

(REVEREND O'CONNOR pulls her to a table and pushes her onto it.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Jesus, put your hands on this one. You can heal her. Oh, yes, God is... Yes... Jesus...

(GRACIE is crying in pain and fear as the CONGREGATION watches.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Oh, Lord... Jesus. Dear Lord... Jesus, deliver this woman. Jesus, Jesus...

(Congregation is mumbling. One woman comes forward and stands at the foot of the table while others hold GRACIE down.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Yes, Lord. Yes, Jesus. Oh, yes. Jesus. Jesus.

GRACIE: Oh, no! Don't, don't!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Dear God, dear heavenly Father, deliver this woman. Jesus.

GRACIE: No, please...

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Lay your hands on this woman. God! Yes!

GRACIE: No... Don't! Don't!

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Hallelujah, praise the lord!

(REVEREND O'CONNOR exposes GRACIE's belly. Under the skin, we see shapes writhing. She is crying out.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

(GRACIE is gasping and crying in pain.)

(Everyone gasps as snakes begin falling to the floor in a bloody puddle from between GRACIE's legs.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: Dear Jesus. Dear Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Dear Jesus! Hallelujah! Hallelujah



SCENE 13

(Next morning. MULDER and SCULLY arrive at REVEREND O'CONNOR's church. EMTs are attending to an unconscious GRACIE. A COP is talking to the WOMAN and another man. Other members of the church are standing around silently.)

SCULLY: How is she?

EMT: Deep shock. Some loss of blood.

SCULLY: (to the COP) What happened here? Where's the baby?

COP: These folks aren't talking.

MULDER: Scully. Take a look at this.

(SCULLY kneels down and looks at the bloody puddle on the floor at the foot of the table. Several wiggly trails lead away.)

SCULLY: Snakes. (to WOMAN) She gave birth to snakes.

WOMAN: The devil has been cast out.

MULDER: (getting up and leaving) Stay with her.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To find her father. He's going to want to tie up some loose ends.



SCENE 14

(REVEREND MACKEY's church. He is alone, getting the church ready for a service. REVEREND O'CONNOR enters.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: You stole what was most precious to me.

REVEREND MACKEY: Gracie? She came to me on her own. She wanted to escape a life of fear and judgment. Of intolerance.

(REVEREND O'CONNOR begins advancing, his lips moving silently.)

REVEREND MACKEY: She fled a harsh and vengeful God. And you.

(REVEREND O'CONNOR pulls out a large knife and grabs REVEREND MACKEY by the throat. MULDER enters the church and pulls out his gun.)

MULDER: Drop the knife!

(REVEREND O'CONNOR moves to cut REVEREND MACKEY's throat and MULDER shoots him in the shoulder. REVEREND O'CONNOR falls and MULDER crosses to REVEREND MACKEY.)

MULDER: You all right?

(REVEREND MACKEY nods and sighs in relief.)

CUT TO:

(Moving ambulance. SCULLY is with GRACIE. GRACIE wakes up, disoriented.)

GRACIE: Daddy. Daddy?

SCULLY: Gracie, it's Agent Scully. We're taking you to the doctor right now, okay?

GRACIE: No. I... got to...

SCULLY: Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?

GRACIE: (hand on her face) Where's my Daddy?

SCULLY: You're safe, Gracie. My partner's gone after him. Gracie, you're going to be okay. He can't hurt you anymore.

GRACIE: You don't understand. He saved me.

CUT TO:

(Church. REVEREND MACKEY brings a clean towel which MULDER holds against REVEREND O'CONNOR's gunshot wound.)

REVEREND MACKEY: I'll call for an ambulance.

(REVEREND MACKEY leaves the room.)

MULDER: Relax. Help's on the way.

REVEREND O'CONNOR: No, it's not. I told you, boy. You still don't know which side you're on. Be smart down here.

(REVEREND O'CONNOR touches MULDER's chest. MULDER stares at him.)

(In his office, REVEREND MACKEY is on the phone when MULDER enters.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (on phone) Yes, please hurry. (hangs up) They're on their way.

(MULDER points his gun at REVEREND MACKEY.)

REVEREND MACKEY: (confused) Agent.

MULDER: It wasn't O'Connor. It was you. You killed Jared Chirp.

REVEREND MACKEY: You're joking.

MULDER: No, I'm just beginning to see it now. Jared must have come to understand that he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby... that you were. Did he confront you earlier that night only to see you for who you really are?

REVEREND MACKEY: Just who is it you think I am?

MULDER: Is that what happened with Iris Finster? Was she beginning to catch on? Is that why you killed her? Or was it just to further frame Enoch O'Connor? Is that what this is really about? Ruining O'Connor? Seducing his daughter? Destroying him by any conceivable means?

(REVEREND MACKEY draws himself up and looks intently at MULDER.)

REVEREND MACKEY: Are you a righteous man, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Stay where you are.

REVEREND MACKEY: It's just a simple question. Most people believe they're on the side of angels. But are they?

(MULDER is startled as the doors to the office slam shut. MULDER is nervous.)

REVEREND MACKEY: If you were put to the test... how would you do?

(A snake has appeared wrapped around MULDER's gun. MULDER gasps, drops the gun and begins tearing off his leather jacket. More snakes are coming out of his pants and are all over his chest. He is, to put it mildly, freaking.)

(SCULLY enters the church and finds REVEREND O'CONNOR holding the towel to his wound.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

(She hears him scream from the other room.)

MULDER: Help!

(SCULLY rises, but REVEREND O'CONNOR grabs her arm.)

REVEREND O'CONNOR: (grabbing her) You can't help him. This is his alone.

(SCULLY gives him a look that says, "I don't think so, buddy" and runs to the office.)

SCULLY: Mulder?!

(SCULLY begins kicking at the locked door. Inside the office, MULDER has been bitten several times. He is lying on the floor staring at a large rattlesnake inches from his face. The snake strikes his cheek. He screams. SCULLY kicks the door open and rushes to MULDER just as the last snake slides out another door. She begins frantically unbuttoning his shirt and looks at REVEREND O'CONNOR who is leaning against the door frame.)



SCENE 15

(Days later. MULDER's hospital room. His bites are healing. SCULLY enters and sits on the edge of his bed.)

MULDER: Mackey?

SCULLY: Still no trace... even though every law enforcement agency in Tennessee's out looking for him.

MULDER: They won't find him. People think the devil has horns and a tail. They're not used to looking for some kindly man who tells you what you want to hear.

SCULLY: He's just a man, Mulder. Just like O'Connor.

MULDER: Not like O'Connor. If this was some kind of test looks like I failed.

SCULLY: I'd say if it was, you passed with flying colors. You're alive, aren't you?

MULDER: (smiling at her) Proud and fancy-free.

(She smiles warmly back at him.)



SCENE 16
HAMDEN, CONNECTICUT

(Small church office. A WOMAN is talking to the minister.)

WOMAN: Reverend Wells, it's a real joy to have a man in the pulpit who has such an open and modern way of looking at God.

(The minister is REVEREND MACKEY.)

REVEREND MACKEY: Bless you for saying so.

WOMAN: Well, I won't keep you. I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden.

REVEREND MACKEY: Thank you. I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.

WOMAN: Thank you.

(The WOMAN leaves. REVEREND MACKEY sits for a moment, then removes a cardboard box from one of the desk drawers. He takes a squirming white mouse out of the box and holds it up high by it's tail. He opens his mouth wide and a snake pushes out of his throat, grabs the mouse, then sinks back down inside the man. REVEREND MACKEY adjusts his throat and tie, then returns the box to the drawer.)

[THE END]

                                  SEIN UND ZEIT


SCENE 1

(A child's bedroom. AMBER LYNN LAPIERRE, a little girl of about five, is kneeling beside her bed saying her prayers in sing-song. Her parents, BUD and BILLIE LAPIERRE watch her fondly.)

AMBER LYNN:
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep.
If I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.
God bless Mommy. God bless Daddy and Grandma and Grandpa LaPierre and Grandma
and Grandpa Dyson, and...

MRS. LAPIERRE: (with a smile, knowing some stalling is going on) Okay, okay, Amber Lynn. Bedtime. Come on. You grab Mike, okay? Hop in. Let's get you cozy, cozy, toasty, toasty. In the sack, snug as a bug.

(They tuck her into bed. )

MR. LAPIERRE: Night-night, Little.

AMBER LYNN: Night, daddy. (kiss) Night, mommy.

MRS. LAPIERRE: Night, love. (kiss) Headlights out, Amber Lynn.

(AMBER LYNN closes her eyes. MRS. LAPIERRE switches the light off)

MRS. LAPIERRE: That's a good girl.

(The night light is on as they leave the room. MRS. LAPIERRE pauses a moment to look affectionately at her daughter, then leaves the door cracked open.)

(Later, MR. LAPIERRE is lying on the couch watching television. It must be a Friday night in an alternate universe, because he is watching Harsh Realm. Chase scene in a hallway.)

MAN ON TV: Weapon on the floor!

MR. LAPIERRE: This is great.

(MRS. LAPIERRE enters the bedroom and turns down the bed. Then pauses, as if in a trance. She goes the closet and removes a paper-wrapped clothes hanger from a dry- cleaners. She rips off a section of the paper, then goes to her desk. She opens the drawer and takes out a red felt tip pen. There is also a Hollywood Video tape case in the drawer.)

(In the living room, MR. LAPIERRE is still watching TV.)

MAN ON TV: What is this trial I'm being put through?

(MR. LAPIERRE hears the sound of a door being shut.)

MAN ON TV: A test of my love for you?

MR. LAPIERRE: Billie?

(There is no answer. He gets up, turns off or mutes the TV, and goes toward the bedrooms. He glances at his wife. MRS. LAPIERRE is writing on the paper: "Mr. & Mrs. LaPierre, Listen carefully! I have kidnapped your daughter and will kill her unless you do exactly as I say. Any deviation from")

(MR. LAPIERRE looks in his daughter's room. He goes to her.)

(MORE OF MRS. LAPIERRE'S WRITING: "  my instructions will result in the execution of Amber Lynn.")

(MR. LAPIERRE looks at his daughter. Her face and neck are bruised and mottled as if she has been strangled to death. He gasps, and looks at her again. The bruising is gone. She is just a sleeping little girl. He sighs in relief.)

(MORE OF MRS. LAPIERRE'S WRITING: "Go to the police and I will strangle her and send you the body parts one by one. Tell a stray dog and you will never see her alive again. Don't do anything dumb. No one shoots at Santa Claus.")

(MR. LAPIERRE tucks his daughter in again and rubs his face. He goes out of the room. The door suddenly slams shut behind him. He tries the knob. It is locked. He sees either a shadow or some black oil seeping under the door.)

MR. LAPIERRE: Billie! Amber Lynn!

(MRS. LAPIERRE looks up from her note. MR. LAPIERRE begins breaking the door down. A picture falls off the wall. The door gives way. AMBER LYNN's bed is empty.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
3:14 AM

(MULDER, in jeans and leather jacket, gets off the elevator and goes to SKINNER's office. There are lots of agents present. SKINNER is on the phone. His ASSISTANT hands him a sheet of paper.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Amber Lynn LaPierre, that's right. A federal investigation is underway... Of a kidnapping in Sacramento, California.

(SKINNER notices MULDER in the doorway. Other agents notice him, too. SKINNER hangs up and goes to him. They speak softly. SKINNER is not pleased to see him.)

SKINNER: Why are you here, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I want this case.

SKINNER: I'm fairly certain I've got more than enough competent Agents in here.

MULDER: (sarcastic) Ooh, I can see that.

SKINNER: This is a kidnapping, Agent Mulder. A little girl snatched from her bedroom. Basic missionary-style FBI work. It's not an X-File.

MULDER: I'm aware of the facts.

SKINNER: We're trying to rule out all possibilities before we start making any statements.

MULDER: That's what I'm talking about-- ruling out other possibilities.

SKINNER: I can't just give you the case. I have to follow protocol. Behavioral gets first crack, then the people down at N.C.M.E.C.

MULDER: Two, three, four hours-- this case is going to be a circus. Every starstruck attorney in America is going to want to represent these people for free. If somebody doesn't ask the right questions right now they may never get asked.

SKINNER: (pause, looks at his watch) You've got till noon. Mulder... the agents in my office... they have a pool going.

(MULDER starts walking toward the elevator.)

MULDER: They think she's dead. Don't bet on it.

(SKINNER watches him leave.)



SCENE 3
SACRAMENTO, CLAIFORNIA
8:12 AM

(Outside the LAPIERRE's house. It is a crime scene and media circus. MULDER drives up, gets out and makes his way up to the OFFICER who is holding back the REPORTERS.)

OFFICER: Make room, make room. Back it up. Back it up. Come on, a little more, sir. A little more.

REPORTER: (to MULDER) Excuse me, have they found the girl? Are there any new developments in the case? Is she dead?

REPORTER 2: Are the parents suspects in the disappearance of their daughter?

(MULDER ignores the reporters and goes into the house. HARRY BRING, a small nervous man in the house stops MULDER.)

HARRY BRING: Sorry, no press allowed inside.

(MULDER holds out his badge.)

MULDER: Special Agent Fox Mulder, FBI. I'd like to speak to Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre, if I may.

HARRY BRING: My clients have nothing to say. (hands over his card) Uh... Harry Bring. How can I help you?

MULDER: Mr. Bring, your  your card says "real estate law and conveyances." Have you ever handled a murder case?

HARRY BRING: This isn't a murder case.

MULDER: Well, it might as well be once the facts about Amber Lynn's disappearance get out.

HARRY BRING: My clients are not murderers and  and I resent any such accusation.

MULDER: Yeah. If you really want to help your clients, Mr. Bring get them a real lawyer.

MR. LAPIERRE: It's okay, Harry.

(MR. LAPIERRE is holding his sobbing wife on the couch.)

MR. LAPIERRE: Billie and I got nothing to hide.

(MULDER sits across from them and speaks gently. MRS. LAPIERRE gets herself calmed down.)

MULDER: Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre, my name is Fox Mulder. I'm a Special Agent with the FBI and I have a lot of experience with crimes like the one that took place here. I know you've made a statement to the police but I'd like to ask you some questions about that and I'd like you to answer in as much detail as both you and your lawyer are comfortable with. I want to ask you about the note you found. Where did you find it?

MR. LAPIERRE: In my daughter's bedroom.

MULDER: When?

MR. LAPIERRE: When I went to check on her.

MULDER: Um, do you know what time that was?

MR. LAPIERRE: 9:30, I think. Right-right about then. I was watching TV in here.

MULDER: What were you watching?

MR. LAPIERRE: I never heard of it before. It was good.

MULDER: What about you, Mrs. LaPierre?

MRS. LAPIERRE: (pause as she looks at her husband) I was in bed already.

MULDER: Were you asleep?

MRS. LAPIERRE: Half.

MULDER: Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom that I saw down the hallway there?

MRS. LAPIERRE: (whisper) Yes.

MULDER: Do you always lock your doors at night even if you're home?

MRS. LAPIERRE: (nodding, almost crying) Yes.

MULDER: You know most of your neighbors, I bet up and down the street. You're on good terms with them?

MR. LAPIERRE: Most of them, yes.

MULDER: Can you think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?

(MRS. LAPIERRE sobs loudly.)

MRS. LAPIERRE: No.

HARRY BRING: (defensively) That's enough questions. They've been very helpful but I think you can see these folks have nothing whatsoever to hide.

MULDER: Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre, I want you to understand something because it's going to get very confusing from here on in. But whatever else the FBI says or does they're going to try their damndest to find your little girl.

MRS. LAPIERRE: Okay.

MULDER: Thank you.

(MULDER starts to leave.)

MRS. LAPIERRE: Agent Mulder... do you think they will? Find her?

MULDER: (softly) Oh, I hope so. Yeah... I really do.



SCENE 4
10:12 PM

(Night. Car pulls up to a motel room. SCULLY gets out and knocks at the door. MULDER is lying fully dressed on the bed. The only light is from the television. MULDER doesn't get up.)

MULDER: It's open.

(SCULLY opens the door. She's not very happy.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Come on in.

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: Thinking.

SCULLY: About?

MULDER: Amber Lynn LaPierre.

SCULLY: Mind if I turn on a light?

MULDER: (softly) Yeah. I do.

(SCULLY closes the door.)

SCULLY: Skinner is royally pissed. At you.

(MULDER watches as MR. LAPIERRE is hounded by a reporter.)

MULDER: I'm sure he is.

SCULLY: He expected a report at noon. He waited. Now he sent me to find you, to get it.

MULDER: I don't have a report.

SCULLY: They had to move on the case. The media got wind of the police findings and they're going to broadcast them. The parents are being held for further questioning.

MULDER: They're not guilty, Scully.

SCULLY: The facts would say otherwise. There's no sign of a break-in. Both parents were home when the girl disappeared.

MULDER: They lied about where they found the note.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: That's what I've been thinking about.

(On the television, we see a news story about Jon-Benet Ramsey segue into a story about AMBER LYNN LAPIERRE.)

SCULLY: Is it the media or just our own morbid fascination with the killing of an innocent?

MULDER: She's not dead, Scully.

(MULDER's cell phone rings. He answers it.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

WOMAN: (on phone) Fox? It's me.

(MULDER is surprised.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mom? Hi.

(In her house, MRS. MULDER is watching the same news story.)

MRS. MULDER: (on phone) I'm watching the news. That little girl in California-- you're out there, aren't you?

MULDER: (on phone) Yes. I am. Are you okay, Mom?

MRS. MULDER: (on phone) When are you coming back here?

MULDER: (on phone) Well, I'm not sure. I... You know, I... I don't know.

MRS. MULDER: (on phone) Call when you get back, Fox.

MULDER: (on phone) Okay, I will. Um, you take care, Mom, okay?

(He hears a dial tone and hangs up. Clinton is now on the news.)

(MRS MULDER looks at the framed picture of YOUNG MULDER and YOUNG SAMANTHA standing next to a tree.)



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS
9:41 AM

(SKINNER's office. The agents are looking at forensic evidence from the case. The note that MRS. LAPIERRE wrote is on the overhead projector.)

SKINNER: From the note we can and have determined several facts. There is a threat of physical violence but no demand for money or ransom. The note is short and written on a torn piece of paper suggesting haste and little or no planning.

(SKINNER looks up as MULDER and SCULLY enter the office.)

SKINNER: The paper's a type used by dry cleaners to protect laundered garments. The torn piece the note was found on matches exactly a piece that was found in the garbage at the LaPierre home. The ink matches a felt tip pen that was also found in the garbage. One set of prints were found on it-- Billie LaPierre's prints.

MULDER: Is it her handwriting?

AGENT FLAGLER: That's going to be difficult to prove due to the felt tip pen and the quality of the paper which tends to cause bleeding and makes the handwriting indistinct. It also looks like there's been an attempt to disguise the writing. By using samples of Mrs. LaPierre's handwriting, you see dominant letter forms-- the "s" in "strangle..." "Stray dog..." Here in "Santa Claus..." matches up with the S's in "dollars..." "Seven" and "cents."

(Compares the writing with a check carbon.)

AGENT FLAGLER: Enough to make a connection.

MULDER: But not an indictment.

SKINNER: (patronizing) Do you have information you'd like to share with us, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Bud LaPierre says he'd been watching television and had gotten up to go to bed when he found Amber Lynn missing. But according to the police report the TV set was still on when the first officers arrived on the scene. By his own account both mother and father put Amber Lynn to bed and were never more than 20 feet from her room during the period in which she was abducted. The LaPierres know all their neighbors up and down the street -- are on good terms with them. But no one saw a stranger on a Friday at a fairly early hour enter into a locked and lighted home and remove this little girl undetected.

AGENT FLAGLER: Husband's lying for his wife.

MULDER: I don't think so.

SKINNER: Why?

(MULDER stares at the note.)

MULDER: Because that doesn't explain what happened to this little girl.

(MULDER leaves the room. AGENTS look at each other. SCULLY looks at SKINNER, then follows MULDER.)

(SCULLY joins MULDER in the X-Files office where he is looking through files.)

SCULLY: What are you doing, Mulder?

MULDER: There's something in that abduction note that I've seen before.

SCULLY: That's not what I mean. You're personalizing this case. You're identifying with your sister.

MULDER: (with a soft smile at himself) My sister was taken by aliens. Did I say anything about aliens, Scully.

SCULLY: There are a lot of good agents up there in Skinner's office who do not have the patience for this.

MULDER: What did I do? I provided a logical counterpoint.

SCULLY: You told them that they were wrong, Mulder.

MULDER: And they are.

(He hands her a file. In it is a note that ends: "I will not hesitate to execute this child. Don't do anything dumb. No one shoots at Santa Claus.")

MULDER: Pocatello, Idaho, 1987. Look familiar?



SCENE 6
REDDING, CALIFORNIA

(A man is sitting in a car with a tiny Santa figurine dangling from the rearview mirror. He is video taping children playing.)



SCENE 7
IDAHO WOMEN'S STATE PRISON

(Women's prison. MULDER and SCULLY are admitted to KATHY LEE TENCATE's cell. She is in her late 30's, hair cut very short. She looks eager for company.)

GUARD: Kathy Lee. Visitors are here.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Oh, can you let them in, please?

MULDER: Hi, Miss Tencate, my name is Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. Will you have a seat?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: It's not the Ritz.

MULDER: (gentle) Um, we just have a few questions. We've reviewed the facts of your case and the facts seem to speak for themselves. Your six-year-old son, Dean, was taken from his bed while he slept. A note was found threatening his life later determined to be written by you. You plead innocent at trial but you were convicted and sentenced to 12 years even though your son's body was never found.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Yes, that's right.

MULDER: Your story is that, uh on the night your son disappeared you had a vision of him dead, but you thought it was your mind playing tricks on you but when you got up to check on him he was missing from his bed. Is that accurate?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Yes.

MULDER: Now, three years ago after seven years of incarceration, you changed your story and confessed to the murder of your son in a fit of insanity. A psychotic break.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Yes, that's right.

SCULLY: Why did you do it?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I don't know. I was full of rage.

MULDER: I have a, uh, copy of the note that you wrote. Do you mind if I show it to you?

(KATHY LEE TENCATE shakes her head.)

MULDER: Now there's a phrase down here at the bottom. "No one shoots at Santa Claus." Can you explain what that means to me?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Uh, it means, that, uh... when someone promises you something, a gift-- like Santa Claus-- that no one would do anything for fear of not getting the gift.

MULDER: A little girl disappeared from her bed three days ago. This is a note that was left at that scene. Will you take a look at that and tell me what it says at the bottom?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Same thing.

MULDER: Neither note makes a specific demand. In both cases, there's no evidence of foul play or a break-in. And as in your son's case there's no body to be found.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I told them where the body was.

MULDER: Yes, you did, but, uh, it wasn't where you said it was going to be.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I can't explain it.

MULDER: I think you can.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I can't.

MULDER: You can't explain it because you didn't do anything. You didn't kill your son and you didn't bury him. You're not guilty of anything other than a lie just like these people. The only reason you changed your story was to get out of here because you knew the parole board might buy the story of a psychotic break and of your terrible remorse but they would never, never let a woman out of jail who claimed her son just disappeared out of thin air. Now, these people, they need someone to tell them it's okay. Someone to corroborate their story.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I'm not that person.

MULDER: They need your help.

(GUARD enters the cell. MULDER and SCULLY leave.)

SCULLY: That was utterly irresponsible, Mulder. It was out of line and it was without any basis in reality.

MULDER: Do you think that woman could have killed her son?

SCULLY: She was convicted in a court of law.

MULDER: So how do you explain those two notes written ten years apart could contain the same obscure phrase?

SCULLY: I can't explain it, Mulder, but you're doing exactly what I said. You're personalizing this case.

MULDER: No, I'm going to solve this case. I am going to solve it.

SCULLY: How?

MULDER: I'm going to find those kids.

(Another GUARD lets them out of the block.)

SCULLY: What if they're dead, Mulder? Don't go looking for something you don't want to find.

(KATHY LEE TENCATE is crying on her bed. She looks up and sees a small boy in her cell staring at her. He is surrounded by a halo of light. The boy vanishes. She gets up and goes to the bars of her cell.)

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Guard. Guard, please can you get them back? Guard! I need to talk.



SCENE 8

MULDER: (voice on machine) This is Fox Mulder. Leave a message. I'll try to get back to you.

(The machine beeps. In her house, TEENA MULDER is looking at pictures of her son and daughter. She takes one out of it's frame and drops it into a wastebasket to burn.)

TEENA MULDER: (voice on phone) Fox, it's your mother. I'd hoped you'd call upon your return but I haven't heard from you. I'm sure you're busy. There are so many emotions in me I wouldn't know where to start. So much that I've left unsaid for reasons I hope one day you'll understand.



SCENE 9

(Police station or lawyer's office. MULDER enters and is there with the lawyer, HARRY BRING and MR. and MRS. LAPIERRE.)

HARRY BRING: This is highly unusual.

(MULDER closes the door.)

HARRY BRING: I want to know what you're doing here.

MULDER: There's something I want your clients to see.

HARRY BRING: I want to know what it is first.

MULDER: (putting a cassette into the video player) Don't shoot at Santa Claus, Mr. Bring. You're going to want to see it, too. (to the LAPIERREs.) I believe you share a secret.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: (on video tape) I'm, uh... I'm doing this because I feel that it's the right thing to do and because I know what you're going through and I wouldn't want to happen to you what happened to me. I just want to tell you that your little girl is okay. (MRS. LAPIERRE sobs) And I know you're afraid of the truth because I saw things that I was afraid of, too and I can't explain all of it except to say that I don't remember... Ever... Thinking those words that I wrote, let along writing them. It was like they wrote themselves using my hand. But, um, what I know  for sure because I feel it in my heart is that my son is safe and protected and in a better place.

(MRS. LAPIERRE cries.)



SCENE 10
UNKNOWN LOCATION

(Multiple monitors show children laughing and images of AMBER LYNN. Some have news broadcasts.)

NEWSCASTER: Rumors and suspicions aside the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre were released today for lack of evidence against them and after giving a new statement to the Sacramento police which insiders say has authorities still baffled and confused recounting a detailed story that claims supernatural forces were at work when their daughter was abducted. The LaPierres, seen here returning to their home declined comment...

(A man enters the room and watches. One of the monitors shows MULDER being interviewed.)

MULDER: (on video) ...Federal investigation of the case will continue but will no longer focus on the LaPierres as primary suspects. We, uh, we will intensify our search for Amber Lynn and we remain hopeful of her eventual safe return.

(Scene changes to SKINNER's office where SKINNER and MULDER are watching a recorded image of the newcast.)

SKINNER: (pausing the video) Intensify our search where? The twilight zone?

MULDER: I have a corroborating witness.

SKINNER: In state prison.

MULDER: There's a material connection between these two women.

SKINNER: The only connection, Agent Mulder, is you. I've got people busting their butts on this thing, Agent Mulder. Putting together hard evidence, real evidence while you're out gathering Grimm's Fairy Tales from convicted murderers.

MULDER: It doesn't make sense. It's incomprehensible in any kind of a real world way.

SKINNER: I deal in the real world, Agent Mulder. You begged onto this case as part of the solution. All you've done is hand our only suspects the Twinkie Defense.

(SCULLY has entered the room.)

SCULLY: Sir?

SKINNER: (very irritated) What? What is it, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I need to have a word with Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: It can wait.

SCULLY: No, it can't, sir.

MULDER: What is it, Scully?

SCULLY: (softly) Mulder, your mom's dead.

(MULDER stares at her.)



SCENE 11
MRS. MULDER RESIDENCE
GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT

(MRS. MULDER's house. Some OFFICERS are investigating the kitchen. MULDER enters, followed by SCULLY, and goes over and speaks to the OFFICERS in the kitchen. SCULLY watches MULDER with concern. The oven is open and there is tape along the edges of the door. One of the CORONERS hands MULDER an empty prescription bottle. MULDER goes into the bedroom area. SCULLY follows.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: Over here.

SCULLY: What is it?

MULDER: (indicating the prescription bottle) Diazepam. She used them to sleep.

SCULLY: Was there a note?

MULDER: (sighs "no") She called when I was in California. She wanted to talk, but, uh... I never called her back.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: (confused) Uh... Why would she do this? It just doesn't make any sense.

(MULDER wanders over to the dresser.)

SCULLY: We never truly know why.

MULDER: No, she wouldn't kill herself. (looks at empty frames) Why are these pictures gone? There were photos here. There were photos of my sister and I. This is all that she had left of us and they're missing. Why...?

(MULDER sits on the bed and closes his eyes and sighs. SCULLY sits on the bed behind him.)

MULDER: She saw me on the news. She wanted to talk about the missing girl, Amber Lynn. She wanted to tell me something about her, or maybe she couldn't tell me over the phone because she was afraid that they would do something like this to her.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: (rationalizing, grasping) Whoever took my sister. Look at this place. I mean, it's like... it's-it's all staged-- the pills, the oven, the tape. It's like a bad movie script. They would  they would have come here and they would have threatened her. She would be upset; they would have to sedate her. I would look for a, uh... a needle puncture mark or something else in her system besides these pills.

SCULLY: (rising, pleading) Oh, no, Mulder. Please don't ask me to do this.

MULDER: Scully, who else can I ask?

SCULLY: An autopsy, Mulder? I mean, it's one thing on a stranger but you're my friend, and she's your mother...

MULDER: I know, but if you don't do it, I might never know the truth.

(They look at each other. SCULLY sighs. She will do it.)



SCENE 12

(Prison. The GUARD lets MULDER into KATHY LEE TENCATE's cell.)

MULDER: (tired, quietly) You've seen things. I need to understand them.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Something's happened to you.

MULDER: My mother is dead. You know why.

(She shakes her head.)

MULDER: Look, I can help you. I can talk to the parole board for you. But right now, I need you to help me.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I don't understand what you want.

MULDER: I'm not here by accident. My sister was taken away from me  when she was eight years old... like your son was taken away from you.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Where's your sister now?

MULDER: (soft laugh) I don't know.

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Your mother knew, didn't she?

MULDER: Why do you ask that?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: She was trying to tell you.

MULDER: Tell me what?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: She'd seen them.

MULDER: Who?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: The walk-ins. Old souls looking for new homes. Your sister's among them.

MULDER: You can see them?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: (smiles) Yes. But sometimes it's very difficult because they live in the starlight.

MULDER: (pause, perhaps not believing her) Is my sister dead?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: They took her to protect her soul from the great harm it would have suffered in her life just like they did my little boy.

MULDER: Where do they take them? Your boy? This little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre?

KATHY LEE TENCATE: I don't know. But they're okay. I'm sure your sister's there, too.

(MULDER sighs.)



SCENE 13

(Arched gate for "Santa's North Pole Village  Where it's Christmas All Year Round" Sound of children laughing and talking as a station wagon pulls up and kids get out run in to see some reindeer in a pen. WORLD WEARY DAD follows.)

LITTLE GIRL: That's not Rudolph.

YOUNG BOY: Do they all have names?

LITTLE GIRL: Is not. Is not.

YOUNG BOY: (singing) Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose

CHILDREN: Like a light bulb! Red-nosed reindeer!

YOUNG BOY: You can't say it.

LITTLE GIRL: Yes, I could.

YOUNG BOY: No, you can't.

LITTLE GIRL: I could.

YOUNG BOY: No, you can't.

(A PAUNCHY MAN, late 40s, walks up to the pen.)

WORLD WEARY DAD: Hey, buddy. The kids want to see Santa. What about it?

PAUNCHY MAN: He's just flying in.

LITTLE GIRL: We're going to see Santa!

(The kids cheer. The PAUNCHY MAN unlocks and goes into one of the buildings on the complex. It is the room with all the video monitors that we saw earlier. "Good King Wenceslas" playing softly on piano. The PAUNCHY MAN begins changing clothes.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER's apartment. He is in jeans and his gray t-shirt. He is rewinding and listening to the message on his answering machine over and over. It's not easy for him.)

TEENA MULDER: (voice) Fox, it's your mother. I'd hoped you'd call upon your return but I haven't heard from you. I'm sure you're busy. There are... so many emotions in me I wouldn't know where to start. So much that I've left unsaid, for reasons I hope one day you'll understand.

(He rewinds again and puts his head close to the machine as if trying to hear any noise in the background.)

TEENA MULDER: (voice) There are... so many emotions in me I wouldn't know where to start. So much that I've left unsaid for reasons I hope one day you'll understand.

(he leans his head on the machine. There is a knock at the door. MULDER opens it for SCULLY. She looks very sad and tired.)

MULDER: I'm glad you're here. My mother was trying to tell me something. I think I figured it out. It's something about my sister that she was never able to tell me.

(He plays the tape for her.)

TEENA MULDER: (voice) So much that I've left unsaid for reasons I hope one day you'll understand.

MULDER: She knew what I'd find with this case out in California.

SCULLY: How could she know that, Mulder?

MULDER: A child disappearing without a trace-- without evidence-- in defiance of all logical explanation? She knew because of what's driven me-- what I've always believed.

SCULLY: (walking toward him) Mulder...

MULDER: Scully, these parents who've lost... (swallows painfully)  who've lost their children... They've had visions of their sons and daughters in scenarios that never happened but which they describe in notes that came through them as automatic writing and words that came through them psychically from old souls protecting the children. My mother must have written a note like that herself. Describing the scenario of my sister's disappearance of her, of her abduction by aliens. Don't you see, Scully? It never happened. All these visions that I've had have just been... they've been to help me cope, to help me deal with the loss but... I've been looking for my sister in the wrong place. That's... what my mother was trying to tell me. That's what she was trying to warn me about. That's why they killed her.

(SCULLY is sitting facing him.)

SCULLY: Your mother killed herself, Mulder. I conducted the autopsy. She was dying of an incurable disease. An untreatable and horribly disfiguring disease called Paget's Carcinoma. She knew it. There were doctor's records. She didn't want to live.

(MULDER stares at her a moment, then puts his face in his hands. Suddenly he stands and shakes the desk violently. SCULLY touches his arm to calm him down. He pulls away in agony, starting to break down.)

SCULLY: Mulder 

MULDER: She was trying to tell me something. She was... (voice breaking as he cries) ...trying to tell me something.

(SCULLY is almost crying herself.)

SCULLY: Mulder, she was trying to tell you to stop. To stop looking for your sister. She was just trying to take away your pain.

(MULDER turns to her desperately and holds her tightly around her waist and cries. SCULLY holds him and puts her lips against his neck. She rocks him gently.)



SCENE 15
LAPIERRE RESIDENCE
11:17 PM

(Bedroom. MR. LAPIERRE gets into bed and puts his arm around his wife. MRS. LAPIERRE looks up and gasps as she sees AMBER LYNN standing in the bedroom surrounded by a faint light. AMBER LYNN's lips move as she says something.)



SCENE 16

(Next morning. Knock on MULDER's apartment door. SCULLY goes to the door and opens it for SKINNER. She is still wearing the clothes from the night before. She looks very tired.)

SKINNER: Hi.

SCULLY: Hi.

SKINNER: (looking into the apartment) How's he doing?

SCULLY: It's been a hard night for him.

(Pause. Small face off.)

SKINNER: Billie LaPierre is asking for him. She's got something to say and she'll only talk to Mulder.

SCULLY: It's not a good...

(SCULLY stops and looks over her shoulder as MULDER comes up behind her.)

MULDER: What is it?

SKINNER: This case has heated up. I've booked two flights for us.

(SCULLY looks up at MULDER. MULDER nods and goes back into the apartment. SCULLY looks at SKINNER.)

SCULLY: Well, then you better book three.



SCENE 17

(The LAPIERRE's bedroom. MRS. LAPIERRE is asleep. Her husband gently wakes her.)

MR. LAPIERRE: Honey, wake up. He's here. Come in, Agent Mulder.

(MULDER enters followed by SCULLY.)

MULDER: (indicating SCULLY) It's okay. She's here to help. What happened here, Billie?

MRS. LAPIERRE: I saw my daughter right in this room.

(SCULLY reacts.)

MRS. LAPIERRE: Standing right there. I swear to god. She was right over there in the pajamas her grandma gave her... saying something to me.

MULDER: What was she saying?

MRS. LAPIERRE: I don't know. Her lips were moving but I couldn't hear. (sobs) I thought... I thought she was saying "74."

MULDER: "74"? The number 74? Does that mean anything to you?

(MRS. LAPIERRE shakes her head.)

MULDER: (without much hope) 74 mean anything to you, Mr. LaPierre?

(He shakes his head.)

(MULDER, SCULLY, and SKINNER leave the house.)

MULDER: Let's go home.

SCULLY: Mulder, we just got here.

MULDER: We're not going to find these people's daughter alive.

SCULLY: How do you know that?

MULDER: What we're hearing-- it's the delusional talk of people that don't want to accept the truth.

SKINNER: You think they know what happened to their child?

MULDER: Maybe, maybe not but you can't see a ghost and still hope to find her alive. Both things can't be true. And if this little girl's spirit really did appear to her mother then there's probably only one explanation.

SKINNER: You think their daughter's dead.

SCULLY: Well, what about the handwritten note?

MULDER: (sad, tired) I don't know what that means. I don't know what is the truth and what isn't anymore. I'm way too close to this case to make any kind of sound judgment. In fact, I would like to ask for you to let me off this case, please, and I'd like to take some time off.

(SCULLY and SKINNER look at each other as MULDER walks to the car.)

(Later, SKINNER is driving SCULLY and MULDER along a rural road. MULDER is in the back seat staring out the window. SCULLY, in the passenger seat, glances back at him with concern. They pass a highway sign for Route 74. SCULLY thinks for a moment then pulls a very good road map out of the glove box.)

SKINNER: What is it?

(SCULLY follows Route 74 on the map to Santa's North Pole Village.)

SCULLY: Santa Claus.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Stop. Turn around.

(SKINNER does.)

(They arrive at Santa's North Pole Village. SKINNER looks around outside. It appears to be deserted. MULDER and SCULLY pass Christmas decorations and go into the room with the videos. They see SKINNER walking around.)

MULDER: Some of these tapes go back to the '60s.

(They put a tape in the machine.)

MULDER: I think I know what we're going to find here. It's what my mother was afraid of. My sister.

(They watch one of the tapes. Children are looking at the reindeer. One of the little girls is AMBER LYNN LAPIERRE.)

SCULLY: It's Amber Lynn LaPierre. This tape was dated two days before her disappearance.

(MULDER sees someone on one of the monitors and turns just as the PAUNCHY MAN slams and locks the door. MULDER begins trying to break down the door. SKINNER sees PAUNCHY MAN running and follows him.)

SKINNER: Hey!

(SKINNER chases PAUNCHY MAN. MULDER breaks open the door and he and SCULLY follow. Either SKINNER needs to work out more or MULDER and SCULLY should qualify for the Olympic sprinting team because suddenly they are right behind him.)

SKINNER: Stop!

(SKINNER fires his gun into the air and the PAUNCHY MAN freezes and drops to his knees.)

SKINNER: Keep your hands up.

(SKINNER holds a gun on him as SCULLY cuffs him.)

SCULLY: What's your name?

PAUNCHY MAN: Ed... Scruloff...

SCULLY: You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning. If you so desire...

(MULDER looks around at the ground with growing horror.)

MULDER: Scully.

(SCULLY and SKINNER look. All around them are what look like child-sized graves.)

[TO BE CONTINUED ...]

                                     CLOSURE

ANNOUNCER: Previously on The X-Files:

(SKINNER in his office directing the investigation.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Amber Lynn LaPierre. The kidnapping in Sacramento, California.

(SCULLY talking to MULDER in the X-Files office.)

SCULLY: You're personalizing this case. You're identifying with your sister.

(MRS. MULDER on the phone with MULDER.)

MRS. MULDER: (on phone) That little girl in California-- you're out there, aren't you?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. I am.

MRS. MULDER: (on phone) Call when you get back, Fox.

(SCULLY talking to MULDER in SKINNER's office.)

SCULLY: Mulder, your mom's dead.

(MULDER reacts.)

SCULLY: She killed herself.

(Women's prison. KATHY LEE TENCATE talking to MULDER.)

KATHY LEE TENCATE: Your mother knew, didn't she? She'd seen them. The walk-ins. Old souls looking for new homes. Your sister's among them.

(MULDER talking to SCULLY in his apartment right before he breaks down.)

MULDER: I've been looking for my sister in the wrong place. That's what my mother was trying to tell me.

(The Christmas Place from the last episode. SKINNER fires his gun into the air stopping the PAUNCHY MAN, ED TRUELOVE, so that SCULLY can arrest him.)

SCULLY: You're under arrest.

(MULDER, SCULLY and SKINNER look around them at all the mounds of earth. It looks like about two dozen very small graves.)



SCENE 1

(Same mass grave site from the previous episode. Under MULDER's voiceover, many people are working to uncover the bodies of the children that have been murdered over the years. They carefully uncover the small plastic-wrapped bodies and zip them up into very small body bags. Close up of one of the men working shows tears streaming down his face as he works. Slow motion shots of the bodies being gently carried by the men. The surrounding area is now full of empty, gaping holes in the ground.)

MULDER: (voiceover) They said the birds refused to sing and the thermometer fell suddenly as if God Himself had His breath stolen away. No one there dared speak aloud, as much in shame as in sorrow. They uncovered the bodies one by one. The eyes of the dead were closed as if waiting for permission to open them. Were they still dreaming of ice cream and monkey bars? Of birthday cake and no future but the afternoon? Or had their innocence been taken along with their lives buried in the cold earth so long ago? These fates seemed too cruel, even for God to allow. Or are the tragic young born again when the world's not looking? I want to believe so badly; in a truth beyond our own hidden and obscured from all but the most sensitive eyes...

(The scene shifts, night falls, after the coroners and investigators have left. A LITTLE GIRL sits up and gets out of one of the graves. Her body is almost transparent and glowing, as if she is made of light. Other children like her get out of the other holes and join her. The song "My Weakness" by Moby plays in the background.)

MULDER: (voiceover) In the endless procession of souls... in what cannot and will not be destroyed. I want to believe we are unaware of God's eternal recompense and sadness. That we cannot see His truth. That that which is born still lives and cannot be buried in the cold earth. But only waits to be born again at God's behest... where in ancient starlight we lay in repose.

(The glowing children have joined hands and are standing in a circle. They look happy, gazing up to the starry sky above as they fade away and the camera drifts up towards the stars.)

SCENE 2
TECHNICAL SERVICE ROOM
SACRAMENTO POLICE STATION

(SCULLY enters the room where detectives are looking at the videotape of AMBER LYNN LAPIERRE. The DETECTIVES glance up at SCULLY, one of them gives her a sad smile. SCULLY looks over at MULDER who is using a magnifier to pore over details in some photos from the crime scene. He seems oblivious to everyone around him. SCULLY walks over to him. He looks up and they share the same sad smile. He goes back to his work.)

SCULLY: (deep breath) Ed Truelove was 19 when he committed his first murder. He was working as a janitor at an elementary school and they needed someone to play Santa Claus. He never got over the feelings it aroused. He's admitted to all of it, Mulder. 24 separate murders. (no response) But he refuses to take blame for Amber Lynn LaPierre. (she glances at the videtape image) I was just handed the preliminary forensics report. (she puts it on the desk) Her body was not one of those found in the graves. (MULDER continues looking at the pictures) Mulder, I know you wanted to find her out there.

MULDER: He's got hours of video of her.

SCULLY: I'm talking about your sister. (MULDER sits up and stretches his neck.) I know that's who you're looking for.

MULDER: Yeah. You don't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of those graves. As hard as it is to admit, I wanted to find her here riding her bike like all these other kids. I guess I just want it to be over.

(SCULLY looks at him sadly. A DEPUTY enters the room.)

DEPUTY: Agent Mulder, Scully, there's a Mr. Harold Piller here to see you.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. Neither of them knows who it is. They go out into the hall. HAROLD PILLER, about 40, is waiting for them. He is looking at and touching some photos of missing persons on a bulletin board.)

MULDER: Mr. Piller?

HAROLD PILLER: Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.

(He shakes their hands.)

SCULLY: Do we know each other?

HAROLD PILLER: Not personally, but I'm happy to meet you. Hi. Harold Piller.

SCULLY: Mr. Piller, are you part of this investigation?

HAROLD PILLER: Yes, I hope to be.

(Pause.)

MULDER: How can we help you?

HAROLD PILLER: I was hoping to help you.

(HAROLD PILLER hands SCULLY his business card. She looks at it skeptically.)

SCULLY: You're a police psychic.

(MULDER give her the "eyebrow raise.")

HAROLD PILLER: My references are on the back. I've gotten some... strong hits off this case. You're looking for a little girl but she's not among the dead. Your suspect is going to say he didn't kill her.

MULDER: Did he?

HAROLD PILLER: No. I think I can help find her.

(SCULLY has been reading the back of the business card.)

SCULLY: Mr. Piller, you have some interesting references here. You've, uh, worked with law enforcements in Kashmir, India, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khyber Pass...

HAROLD PILLER: That was a train wreck. A horrible tragedy. They called me in to locate the bodies of seven children who were unrecovered.

SCULLY: And did you recover them?

HAROLD PILLER: I didn't recover them, no. But I explained what happened.

MULDER: What happened?

HAROLD PILLER: The children's bodies... were transported from the accident site by a spiritual intervention-- what are known as "walk-ins."

(SCULLY is not impressed with this guy. MULDER is listening.)

SCULLY: Thank you, Mr. Piller, but we have real work to be done.

(SCULLY turns to go, but then stops when she realizes MULDER is not following her.)

HAROLD PILLER: I've studied this phenomenon the world over. It-it... Mudslides in Peru, earthquakes in Uzbekistan... Kids' bodies never found, never accounted for in any other way.

MULDER: What happened to them?

HAROLD PILLER: The bodies were transported from the various sites in starlight.

SCULLY: Please excuse us.

(SCULLY takes MULDER's arm and pulls a few feet away to speak privately.)

SCULLY: Mulder... Mulder, please.

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: Mulder, you have been through so much in such a short time -- the death of your mother and the feelings it's brought up for your sister -- you're vulnerable right now.

MULDER: We still have a missing body -- Amber Lynn LaPierre -- she may be alive -- we don't know.

SCULLY: Yes, but this man isn't going to help us find her by his own admission.

MULDER: It's not the first time I've heard what he's saying. About the intervention of these walk-in spirits? Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned it to me in prison. She said that's what took her son.

SCULLY: Because it's foolproof, Mulder. Nobody is going to disprove it if there's no body. I mean, that's exactly what this man does. He gives a, a comforting explanation that a train wreck or an earthquake that everyone can live with but the fact is the bodies are still buried.

MULDER: Or maybe they "are" somewhere else.

SCULLY: Like your sister. Mulder... You told me that all you wanted was for this to be over.

MULDER: (looks at her) I do. ... I do.

SCULLY: Well, then I'm going back to Washington. There's nothing more to be done here.

(SCULLY is calm, rational, and gentle. Perhaps she is expecting that he will follow her. MULDER nods. She walks down the hall.)



SCENE 3

(MULDER holds up the crime scene tape for HAROLD PILLER as they approach the empty graves.)

(CLOSED CAPTIONED) HAROLD PILLER: Thank you.

MULDER: How long have you been doing this?

HAROLD PILLER: A few years. I have a son who disappeared... under strange circumstances. He's never been found. And then one day I just, uh... started to see them.

MULDER: These walk-ins-- you say they come and take the children. Why?

HAROLD PILLER: In almost every case the parents had a precognitive image of their child dead. Horrible visions. I believe what this is, is the work of good spirits. Foretelling their fates. The fate the child was about to meet. A particularly violent fate that wasn't meant to be ... which is why the spirits intervene transforming matter into pure energy. Starlight. (sighs) But it's not what happened here.

(PILLER walks among the graves, on the verge of tears.)

MULDER: How do you know that?

HAROLD PILLER: Because these children... all died suffering. Pleading innocently for their lives. These beautiful children, so... trusting and pure. I see them. (gasps sharply) My God, why? Why must some suffer and not others?

MULDER: You see them. Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?

HAROLD PILLER: She wasn't here. She never was. But I'm... I'm sensing a connection with her... to this place. It... No, it's a connection to... It's a connection to you.

(HAROLD PILLER is now looking at MULDER in wonder and amazement.)

MULDER: How's that?

(HAROLD PILLER puts his hand on MULDER's chest.)

HAROLD PILLER: You lost someone close to you. A young girl. It happened a ... a long time ago. A sister. There's a connection between these girls, isn't there? Between her and Amber Lynn.

MULDER: What is the connection?

HAROLD PILLER: (with joy) I don't know. But we're going to find them. I'm sure of it.



SCENE 4

(FBI Headquarters. SCULLY is with AGENT SCHONIGER. They are watching the original videotape of MULDER's regression hypnosis about Samantha. Video date is 06/16/89. MULDER is being interviewed by DR. HEITZ WERBER. No shots of him.)

WERBER: (on video) I'm going to count backwards now, Fox. And you'll fall into a deep, relaxed state so that you remember all about your sister and what happened.

1989 MULDER: (on video, takes a deep breath)

1989 WERBER: (on video) 100... 99... 98... 97... 96... Where are you now, Fox?

1989 MULDER: (on video) I'm at home, at my Mom and Dad's. We're in the den playing a game.

1989 WERBER: (on video) Who are you there with?

1989 MULDER: (on video) Samantha.

1989 WERBER: (on video) Do you feel in any danger?

1989 MULDER: (on video) No. We're arguing, you know but not really-- just playing the game. You know, fooling around.

(The video continues as AGENT SCHONIGER and SCULLY talk.)

AGENT SCHONIGER: By what I can tell from the tape he seems to be in a legitimate hypnotic state.

1989 MULDER: (on video) ...a little afraid. The pieces on the board have fallen off and...

AGENT SCHONIGER: Here I became suspicious.

1989 MULDER: (on video, calling) Samantha?

SCULLY: Suspicious of what?

AGENT SCHONIGER: (turns off the video) In 30 years with the FBI, you'd think you've seen it all. I sometimes think I have. But this is just garden-variety compensatory abduction fantasy.

SCULLY: Compensatory for what?

AGENT SCHONIGER: His guilt, his fear... everything that's preventing Agent Mulder from remembering the truth about what really happened that night.

SCULLY: You mean his sister wasn't abducted.

AGENT SCHONIGER: No, the sister definitely went missing in 1973. That's not in dispute. Agent Mulder, however, wasn't regressed until 1989. See, his delusion is playing into his unconscious hope that his sister is still alive ...and if you think about it, his delusion has the effect of giving a reason to pursue her.

SCULLY: But why alien abduction?

AGENT SCHONIGER: Close Encounters, E.T., who knows? But there was probably a lot of imagery collecting in his head in those 16 years and then he comes down here and he finds the X-Files.

[TD NOTE: Just a thought. Remember "Unusual Suspects"? Those events took place in May, 1989, a month before Mulder's regression therapy. As was speculated at the time, perhaps the alien imagery came from the gas he was subjected to back then.]

SCULLY: So what do you think happened to his sister?

AGENT SCHONIGER: Well, in 1973, we were pretty damned unsophisticated about violent, predatory crime. My guess is she was kidnapped in the house, her body was disposed of, never found.

SCULLY: You think that his sister's dead?

(AGENT SCHONIGER gets up and pulls out the file on Samantha. Missing person's report for Samantha Mulder, RT6 Chilmark, MA. Age 14. 11/27/73.)

AGENT SCHONIGER: Have you seen this file? There was an extraordinary amount of effort put into finding his sister. Even the Treasury Department got involved. His father worked at a high level in the government. They found nothing. Why, Agent Scully? Why do you want to bring all this back up now?

SCULLY: Someone owes it to Mulder.

AGENT SCHONIGER: Word of advice, me to you: Let it be. You know, there's some wounds that are just too painful ever to be reopened.

SCULLY: Well, this particular wound has never healed. And Mulder deserves closure, just like anyone.



SCENE 5
RED CARRIAGE MOTEL
SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA

(MULDER's hotel room in California. The last scene of the movie, Planet of the Apes is on the television. Watch it. CHARLTON HESTON is on the horse with the woman. The APE is tied up on the beach.)

CHARLTON HESTON: (on TV) Apes evolved from men? There's got to be an answer.

APE: Don't look for it, Taylor. You may not like what you find.

(There is a knock at the door. In the mirror behind the TV, we see a rumpled-looking MULDER sit up on the bed. He looks at the clock. 3:03 am. He rolls over and goes to answer the door for HAROLD PILLER who is looking very agitated.)

APE: (on TV) Untie me!

MULDER: What? What are you doing?

HAROLD PILLER: I'm picking up something.

MULDER: (Tired) It's 3:00 in the morning.

HAROLD PILLER: There's someone here.

MULDER: Yeah, the TV is on.

HAROLD PILLER: No. A visitor.

(HAROLD PILLER enters. MULDER closes the door behind him.)

APE: (on TV) Lieutenant! Fetch our explosives. We've got to seal off the cave.

APE LIEUTENANT: (on TV) Yes, sir!

HAROLD PILLER: They... they want to speak. They want to tell us something.

MULDER: What?

APE: (on TV) You will both stand trial for heresy.

HAROLD PILLER: Get a piece of paper.

APE: (on TV) In a few minutes there will be no...

(MULDER turns the TV off.)

HAROLD PILLER: And a pen.

(MULDER gets a pad of paper and a pen from the nightstand and holds them out to PILLER.)

HAROLD PILLER: No, you.

(MULDER, not convinced this is going anywhere, puts the pad on the dresser and holds the pen over it.)

MULDER: Shoot.

HAROLD PILLER: (trance-like) It's your mother. She's here in the room with us. She's trying to speak to you.

MULDER: (dryly) What does she say?

HAROLD PILLER: She wants to tell you about your sister. Where she is.

(MRS. MULDER is standing behind MULDER. She is transparent, ghostlike. Her lips move, but we hear no sound. MULDER is looking impatiently at PILLER.)

MULDER: What is she saying? Harold?

(In the next frame, she is gone.)

HAROLD PILLER: I don't know. I... She's gone.

MULDER: Come on, Harold.

HAROLD PILLER: I lost her.

MULDER: (angry) That's crap. You're full of crap.

HAROLD PILLER: No.

MULDER: Get out of here.

HAROLD PILLER: I'm telling you...

MULDER: No, I'm telling you. I never should have listened to you.

HAROLD PILLER: She was here. She had a message.

MULDER: Please go.

(MULDER starts toward the door.)

HAROLD PILLER: Look.

(PILLER notices the pad of paper and holds it up for MULDER. The words "APRIL BASE" have been written on it. Looks like Best Western stationary.)

MULDER: Who wrote that?

HAROLD PILLER: You did.



SCENE 6

(SCULLY enters MRS. MULDER's house with a lockpick? and begins looking around again. She notices the empty picture frames on the shelves again. She goes into the bedroom and begins looking through drawers. The wastebasket still has burned fragments of the pictures that MRS. MULDER burned the night she killed herself. SCULLY finds a fragment of an official-looking document in the basket with the initials "C.G.B.S.")

(MULDER is in the car with PILLER. His phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. I found something, and I'm standing here not quite believing what it is.

MULDER: (on phone) What is it?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know if you know this but there was a special Treasury Department investigation into Samantha's disappearance.

MULDER: (on phone) In 1973. I know all about that.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I'm in your mother's house and I found a piece of a document that she burned -- a document that matches one that I found in the treasury investigation file. But she had the original, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) I don't see where you're going with this, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) This is the document that effectively calls off the search for your sister, Mulder. And it's signed with the initials "C.G.B.S."

(SCULLY matches the burned fragment to the photocopied one she has.)

SCULLY: (on phone) C.G.B. Spender. The Smoking Man. He was involved with this back in '73.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, that's not exactly a revelation, Scully. He was a friend of my father's.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, you told me you believe that he's the man that killed your father. That he's the man who's done nothing but confound your work. Who's come close to killing you and here he's ordering people to stop looking for your sister.

MULDER: (on phone) I don't see what you think this proves or how you think it's gonna help me find her now.

SCULLY: (on phone, surprised) You don't want to press him?

(MULDER is impatient.)

MULDER: (on phone) It's a dead end. He's never been of any help and he's not going to be of any help now. Look, I'm pursuing this my own way, all right? I got to go.

(SCULLY sighs as MULDER hangs up. He and HAROLD PILLER pull up to a chain link fence surrounding a deserted military base. April Air Force Base. They get out of the car.)

MULDER: Not exactly the end of the rainbow, is it, Harold?

HAROLD PILLER: There's something here. I'm getting a strong sense of it. I think we should have a look.

MULDER: (heading back to the car) I've had a look.

HAROLD PILLER: What are you afraid of? That you'll really find her? That you'd have to deal with it?

MULDER: There's nothing here. It's a decommissioned base.

HAROLD PILLER: You wrote the name down yourself.

MULDER: Why do you care so much about what I feel? Why is it so important to you?

(A security car pulls up on the other side of the fence and a GUARD gets out.)

GUARD: You gentlemen need to move along. I have to ask you to turn around and get back in your car. There's nothing to see here.

(MULDER nods and he and PILLER get back in the car.)

HAROLD PILLER: There is something here to see, Agent Mulder. I'm sure of it.



SCENE 7

(SCULLY's apartment. The phone is ringing as she enters. She picks it up.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(Too late. All she hears is a dial tone. She sighs and hangs up.)

MAN'S VOICE: I should've grabbed it for you.

(SCULLY looks up and sees the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, aka CGB SPENDER, sitting in her living room. He lights a cigarette.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I like to make myself useful.

SCULLY: (calmly) You can start by putting out that cigarette.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Got it all figured out, don't you, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: All but why you can't just come to the door and knock.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I did that. No one answered.

(He stands and walks toward her.)

SCULLY: You're sick.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN chuckles softly. Indeed, he does not look well. Of course, when has he ever looked well. He seems especially sad and weak.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I had an operation.

SCULLY: What do you want?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I want you to stop looking.

SCULLY: You've wanted that since 1973... when you ordered an end to the search for Agent Mulder's sister. Your initials are on that document.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Yes, I signed that order because I knew then what I know now: No one's gonna find her.

SCULLY: Why not?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Because I believe she's dead. No reason to believe otherwise.

SCULLY: You're a liar. If you knew that she was dead why didn't you say something earlier? Why now?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: There was so much to protect before. It's all gone now.

SCULLY: So you just let Mulder believe that she was alive for all these years.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Out of kindness, Agent Scully. Allow him his ignorance. It's what gives him hope.

(He crosses to the door and closes it behind him as he leaves. SCULLY stands quietly in her apartment, thinking.)



SCENE 8

(Night. MULDER and HAROLD PILLER pull up to the base again, headlights off. MULDER gives HAROLD PILLER a leg up, then they both climb over the fence and run to the residential section of the base. They get to a corner. One of the streets is "Albatross Street.")

MULDER: My sister was here?

HAROLD PILLER: Yes.

MULDER: In one of these houses? Where?

HAROLD PILLER: I've lost it, whatever it was.

MULDER: Which house, Harold? Come on, which house?

HAROLD PILLER: I don't know.

MULDER: Harold, we don't have all night. Come on, which house was it?

(Headlights from a GUARD's car approach. MULDER and HAROLD PILLER run. They hide behind stacks of old newspapers. The car passes.)

MULDER: Let's go, Harold.

(As they leave, MULDER looks down at the sidewalk and pauses.)

MULDER: You were right. This was the house.

HAROLD PILLER: How do you know?

MULDER: Look. (points down)

(HAROLD PILLER looks down at the sidewalk. There is a handprint in the cement with "SAMANTHA" written under it.)

HAROLD PILLER: I told you. What did I tell you?

MULDER: You told me she was here. You didn't say with who.

(Camera pans below her name. Beneath it is another handprint with the name "JEFFREY.")



SCENE 9

(MULDER's hotel room. MULDER and SCULLY are arguing. In a good way.)

SCULLY: When did you come up with this story, Mulder? Because yesterday, when I spoke to you, you said that the Smoking Man wasn't involved.

MULDER: Well, it turns out you were right, Scully. He had every reason to call off the hunt for my sister. After her abduction, she was returned to him and he raised her at the military base along with his son, Jeffrey Spender.

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: Scully, I saw her name in the cement. Her handprints, right next to his.

(SCULLY goes to him, perhaps touching him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I spoke to him. The Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender, whatever his name is...

MULDER: (staring at her) You went to him?

SCULLY: He told me that she was dead.

MULDER: (sighs) Oh, well... he's a liar.

SCULLY: Mulder, why would he lie now? I mean, think about it. It hurts me to tell you this.

(MULDER is up, getting angry and defensive. SCULLY stays right with him.)

MULDER: (loudly) The handprints prove he's a liar! I saw her handprints in the cement. Her name, Samantha, right underneath them. How more obvious can it be? Harold Piller led me there. He led me right to them.

SCULLY: Oh, he led you, Mulder. He led you from the moment that he met you.



SCENE 10

(Restaurant. HAROLD PILLER is drinking coffee at a table. MULDER and SCULLY enter. They are both glaring at him.)

HAROLD PILLER: (starting to rise) Something wrong?

MULDER: Sit down, Harold.

HAROLD PILLER: (to SCULLY) Hi. You're back.

(SCULLY nods tensely.)

MULDER: Agent Scully has informed me that you failed to mention something to me when we first met.

HAROLD PILLER: What?

MULDER: That you're currently the subject of a criminal investigation into the murder of your son.

HAROLD PILLER: My son was taken from me. The police need someone to blame.

SCULLY: That's not all, Harold. Your history of mental illness. You were institutionalized, diagnosed with schizophrenia.

HAROLD PILLER: I've got that under control. You wouldn't have believed me if I told you any of that. Look what I've shown you.

MULDER: You only tell me what you see.

HAROLD PILLER: I came to you because I want to help. You think I'm a fraud. What do I have to gain from this? How am I any different from you? All I want is to find my son. I... I just... I just want my little boy back.

(He holds back tears. SCULLY looks down.)

HAROLD PILLER: I see these things. I don't know how, but... there has got to be a reason and if it's not to help, what is it? I know your sister is out there. Maybe I can prove it to you.

(MULDER looks at SCULLY. So does HAROLD PILLER. She thinks.)



SCENE 11

(Later that night. MULDER, SCULLY, and PILLER have sneaked onto the base again. They enter the same house that MULDER and PILLER found the night before. SCULLY pauses to look at the cement block with the names and handprints and then goes inside the house. It's deserted and stripped to the bare bones with no furnishings.)

SCULLY: Well, whoever's lived here hasn't lived here in a long time.

HAROLD PILLER: We're gonna need to hold hands.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

HAROLD PILLER: I'm going to try and summon their presence into the house.

SCULLY: (sarcastically) Oh, yay. A seance. I haven't done that since high school.

MULDER: (to SCULLY, taking her hand) Maybe afterwards we can play postman and spin the bottle.

HAROLD PILLER: I'm not going to say anything. I'm just going to be very quiet and still. That's how it seems to work best. Um, you might experience a sudden chill or feel a... a pressure in your ears. That means they're here. And if they need to, they'll let themselves be seen. Close your eyes and let them come to you. They will come to you if you're ready to see.

(They all close their eyes. SCULLY is still skeptical.)

SCULLY: How will we know?

HAROLD PILLER: Shh. Stay quiet. You'll know.

(All around them are glowing, ghostly figures, just standing, watching them. There are several boys/men in what look like old military uniforms. All ages, dressed simply, perhaps from different eras. Some are closer, clearer than others. Some are standing alone, some are in pairs. One of the tall young military men has a smaller woman on his arm. They look as if they might have lived during WWII. MULDER looks down. A small boy, perhaps five, takes MULDER's hand from SCULLY's and leads him through the figures to another room. SCULLY's hand remains suspended in the air.)

(The light has changed. SCULLY "wakes up" and realizes MULDER is missing. She goes to find him in the other room.)

SCULLY: Mulder? What are you doing?

MULDER: It's here.

SCULLY: What is?

MULDER: There was a boy - he led me into this room.

(MULDER begins breaking through a built-in wall bookshelf. He finds a small book.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(HAROLD PILLER has entered the room.)

HAROLD PILLER: It's a diary. It's your sister's.



SCENE 12

(Restaurant. Later that night. MULDER and SCULLY are sitting at a table. MULDER is reading to SCULLY from the diary, written in blue pen. It is hard for him to read. Every once in a while, he will pause, then continue. SCULLY never takes her eyes off of him.)

MULDER: (reading) "They did more tests today, but not the horrible kind. I was awake and they made me lay still... while they shined lights in my eyes. They asked me questions, but I always lie now and tell them what they want to hear, just to make them stop. I hate them and I hate the way they treat me... like I'm an old suitcase they can just drag around and open up whenever they want to. They know I hate them, but they don't even care."

(SCULLY looks sad.)

MULDER: This is 1979. She's 14 years old here. 14 years old.

(MULDER turns the pages to later entries. SCULLY watches MULDER.)

MULDER: (reading) "Sometimes I think my memories were taken by the doctors but not all of them. I remember faces. I think I had a brother... with brown hair, who used to tease me. I hope someday he reads this and knows I wish I could see his face for real."

(MULDER turns a few more pages, skimming them.)

MULDER: And then, uh... she's, uh... talking about running away. She wants to run away so that they stop doing the tests. And then it just stops.

(Here's what it says on the final page which he doesn't read aloud)

"No more. No more tests. No more questions. I'm getting out of here and not turning back. Tonight. Tonight I'm going to run far, far away. I can't let them catch me. They'll kill me if they do. Running for my life, for the rest of my life."

(He looks at the book. SCULLY, almost crying, reaches over and gently holds his hand.)

SCULLY: Let's get out of here.

(SCULLY pays the bill then joins MULDER outside the restaurant where he is looking up at the stars.)

MULDER: You know, I never stop to think... that the light is billions of years old by the time we see it. From the beginning of time right past us into the future. Nothing is ancient in the universe. (glances at her) But, maybe they are souls, Scully. Traveling through time as starlight, looking for homes. I wonder what my mother saw. And I wonder what she was trying to tell me.

SCULLY: Go get some sleep.

(MULDER finds her words both funny and painful. He smiles, and bends over slightly, then straightens.)

MULDER: All right.

(SCULLY leaves.)

(Later that night. MULDER is sleeping peacefully in his hotel room, no TV on. The glowing figure of his mother appears and leans over and begins whispering in his ear. We cannot hear what she says.)



SCENE 13

(Next morning. SCULLY knocks at MULDER's hotel door. He sleepily answers it. She holds out a document.)

SCULLY: I got it, Mulder. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. It was like it was looking for me. Sergeant's blotter, 1979.

(IT READS: "Approximately 14 year old girl picked up. Runaway claims she was held hostage ... hospital for exam." Other names on the document are Patrolman J. Poole and Detective J. Floyd)

MULDER: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: The description matches your sister.

MULDER: When did you find this?

(SCULLY stares at him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's almost noon.

(MULDER is surprised.)



SCENE 14
DOMINIC SAVIO MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
4:08 PM

(Later. MULDER and SCULLY are at the hospital looking through files.)

SCULLY: Maybe she went by another name. She could have given them a name other than her own.

MULDER: She didn't give a name at all. Read this. It's the medical report. The admittance notes say the E.R. nurses couldn't get her name out of her. Neither could the cops.

SCULLY: Her medical examination is normal. Her mental state -- it says here she was exhibiting signs of paranoia.

MULDER: (reading) "Evidence of probable self-inflicted abuse. Including small crescent-shaped scars on her knees, wrists and chest." Those were from the tests, Scully. That's her. She was here. 14 years old, in this hospital.

SCULLY: (reading) "Diagnosis of condition incomplete... tests unavailable."

MULDER: And he knew. He lied. He knew she was alive and the only reason he's lying now is because she's still alive.

(MULDER gets up, excited.)

SCULLY: Mulder, wait.

MULDER: I know. I know. You don't want me to get my hopes up. I understand that.

SCULLY: That was 1979. It was 21 years ago. I don't even know where to begin and .. and we don't even have a record here of a doctor signing her out.

MULDER: (pointing) We have an E.R. nurse who signed her in.



SCENE 15
VICTORVILLE, CALIFORNIA

(Night. MULDER, SCULLY, and PILLER pull up in front of a house. They start walking toward it, but SCULLY senses when MULDER stops and she turns to him.)

SCULLY: What's wrong?

MULDER: I have this... powerful feeling and I can't explain it, but that... this is the end of the road. That I've been brought here to learn the truth.

SCULLY: Are you ready for it?

(MULDER nods slightly.)

SCULLY: Do you want me to go talk to her myself?

(MULDER nods again.)

SCULLY: Okay.

(MULDER stays by the car as SCULLY and PILLER go up to the door. SCULLY knocks twice on the screen door. A woman, ARBUTUS RAY, perhaps late 60's, answers the door.)

ARBUTUS RAY: I thought that was the door.

SCULLY: (holding out her badge) Arbutus Ray?

ARBUTUS RAY: Yes.

SCULLY: Are you the same Arbutus Ray that worked as a nurse at the Dominic Savio Memorial Hospital in 1979?

ARBUTUS RAY: Yes, I'm she.

SCULLY: I'd like to ask you about a patient you treated... a 14-year-old girl.

(SCULLY opens the screen door, hands her the file and closes the screen door again. MULDER listens.)

ARBUTUS RAY: I remember, yes. She was such a pretty young girl. You couldn't forget someone like her or how frightened she was. Scared for her sweet life. Deputy brought her in, she was shaking like a leaf. Wouldn't let anyone touch her but me. Then the strangest thing happened...

HAROLD PILLER: (interrupting) You had a vision of her... dead, like the parents of Amber Lynn LaPierre.

ARBUTUS RAY: (stares at him with amazement) No one believed me. Honestly you're the first person who...

SCULLY: So you saw her dead?

ARBUTUS RAY: That night, in her bed I blinked and it was gone. She was sleeping as sound as could be. I don't know why but it made some kind of strange sense.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

ARBUTUS RAY: There were men. They came to pick her up late that night. I assumed the one was her father but he gave me such a chill when he looked at me when I asked him would he please put out his cigarette.

(SCULLY reacts.)

SCULLY: So they took her?

ARBUTUS RAY: They meant to but when I took them to her room she was gone. Disappeared out of a locked room. Just vanished.

(SCULLY looks at HAROLD PILLER, then at the car. MULDER is missing.)

(MULDER is walking into the woods nearby. The song "My Weakness" by Moby starts to play again. He sees the ghostly image of the boy. The BOY holds his hand out to MULDER and leads him up a small hill. The rest of the scene takes place in slow motion. Lots of ghostly, glowing children are playing together, all ages. They are all happy. MULDER lets go of the BOY's hand. He sees AMBER LYNN LAPIERRE who looks up and smiles at him. MULDER smiles back. He sees a pretty young brown haired girl running toward him. He stares in amazement.)

MULDER: Samantha.

(The glowing 14-year-old girl embraces him warmly, touches his face as they gaze at each other, then holds him again as he holds her and strokes and kisses her hair. He is smiling. It's okay.)

(Back to regular speed. SCULLY and HAROLD PILLER are waiting by the car as MULDER comes back out of the woods. He is calm.)

SCULLY: Mulder, where did you go?

MULDER: End of the road.

(MULDER turns to HAROLD PILLER.)

MULDER: He's okay. It's okay.

HAROLD PILLER: My son? You saw my son?

MULDER: He's dead. They're all dead, Harold. Your son, Amber Lynn, and my sister.

HAROLD PILLER: No.

MULDER: Harold, you see so much but you refuse to see him. You refuse to let him go. But you have to let him go now, Harold. He's protected. He's in a better place. They're all in a better place. We both have to let go, Harold.

HAROLD PILLER: (desperate) You're wrong. I'm going to find him. I don't believe you.

(HAROLD PILLER walks away quickly. SCULLY walks up behind MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what happened? Are you sure you're all right?

MULDER: I'm fine.

(MULDER looks up at the starry sky, and sighs.)

MULDER: I'm free.

[THE END]
                                   X-COPS               



FOX PRESHOW WARNING VOICEOVER AND GRAPHIC: The following is a special episode of the "X-Files." Viewer discretion is advised.

(Episode is filmed completely in the COPS TV show style. Many very nice people watch and enjoy COPS. For those of you fortunate enough never to have seen an episode of COPS: A camera crew consisting of a camera man and a sound guy get in the back seat of a police car and follow along with the officer or officers for the duration of their shift filming EVERYTHING with a single handheld video camera. The effect is a video that is badly lit, shaky, and often hard to see and hear. The officers are for the most part NOT actors as evidenced by their rambling monologues to the camera. They are usually in a high crime area filled with criminals and crack whores who DON'T want to be on camera. There is usually a lot of screaming and cursing in many languages. If they decide that the evening is interesting enough for the masses, FOX edits the video, blurs out some faces and any bare sexual anatomy, "bleeps" out curse words, and sells advertising. Then, lucky us, on Saturday night they broadcast the results to us, the viewer. Episode opens with the classic reggae COPS theme song, "Bad Boys." The video consists of clips from the upcoming show set in LA as evidenced by the famous Hollywood sign. Looks just like the opening of COPS, except for a familiar tall dark-haired man and short red-haired woman who are also present in some of the shots.)

COPS THEME SONG SINGERS (Inner Circle):

Bad Boys whatcha want, whatcha want?
Whatcha gonna do when Sheriff John Brown come for you?
Tell me, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Yeah Bad Boys, Bad Boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Bad Boys, Bad Boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Nobody naw give you no break
Police naw give you no break

Not even you idren(?) naw give you no breaks
Bad Boys, Bad Boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Bad Boys, Bad Boys whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?

COPS ANNOUNCER: Cops is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement. All suspects are innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.



SCENE 1
WILLOW PARK, CALIFORNIA

(Shot of full moon over Los Angeles pans back down into a car. Camera crew is in OFFICER KEITH WETZEL's patrol car. He is young rookie officer. The cameraman is in the passenger seat. They are driving through a low-income neighborhood.)

WETZEL: I don't know what it is about a full moon. It's just something about it. People just go off the wall. I mean, these are some pretty scary neighborhoods to begin with.

WETZEL: I haven't been on the job that long myself but I've seen more than my fair share of crazy stuff. When the moon is full, it's just like times ten. I don't know, uh... I don't know. Maybe it's the tides or something. But irregardless, we're on the job and if that makes people breathe a little easier knowing we're out there. Be a little less nervous walking the streets at night, well, that's, that's a good feeling.

(The radio beeps and WETZEL looks at the readout on the cars dashboard computer. )

6:48 PM
PROWLER CALL

WETZEL: Okay, we got a report of somebody lurking around the neighborhood making noise. Actually, I take that back. We got a report of a... "monster" lurking around the neighborhood? What the ...? (He looks into the camera and shakes his head.) Hey, it's a full moon. (car speeds up) A lot of drug activity in this district. We're probably looking at somebody rattling doorknobs trying to steal some money for a quick fix. Usually they're not the stealthiest of criminals so maybe we'll get lucky and sneak up on 'em.

(He pulls up in front of a house.)

WETZEL: (on radio) 2-12 Adam is 10-97.

DISPATCH: 2-12 Adam is 10-97 at 543 local.

(WETZEL and the camera crew get out of the car. WETZEL gets out his flashlight and looks around the area in front of the house and over the fence. He sees nothing and speaks quietly into his radio.)

WETZEL: 2-12 Adam to dispatch. I don't see anything. Can you let the lady inside her house know I'm out here?

DISPATCH: 2-12 Adam, copy your request. Calling now.

(WETZEL enters the fence and looks around the yard with his flashlight. He shines the light at a small cat.)

WETZEL: Think he was doing it? (waves the cat away) Psst!

(The cat wanders off. WETZEL goes up to the front door which has five large scratches near the doorknob. He shows them to the camera crew.)

WETZEL: A lot of scratches. Maybe a big dog. That's probably what she saw.

(WETZEL knocks at the door with his flashlight.)

WETZEL: Sheriff's Department.

(We hear a woman breathing heavily, she is terrified. A Hispanic woman, MRS. GUERRERO, opens the door a crack leaving the chain on. She speaks very rapid Spanish.)

MRS. GUERRERO: Is a claw monster! Mira... Matenlo! Matenlo! (Look ... Kill it ! Kill it!)

WETZEL: Calmate! No monstruo... (Calm down. It's not a monster.)

MRS. GUERRERO: It's a monster!

(She slams the door shut again.)

WETZEL: Senora!

MRS. GUERRERO: (from behind the door) Buscalo! (Look at it.)

(WETZEL turns back to the camera. He is nervous, but playing cool.)

WETZEL: Man, scared of something.

(He begins looking around the yard again. From behind the house, we hear a loud bang. WETZEL immediately runs around back.)

WETZEL: Hey, you there! You! Freeze! Sheriff's department! Freeze! Sheriff's department!

(The camera follows more slowly, taking time to film all the junk in the yard including a sink. We can hear WETZEL, but we can't see him. There is a loud clattering, then WETZEL comes tearing around the corner toward the camera crew, ala Han Solo pursued by the Storm Troopers in Star Wars. He is terrified, pushing the crew back.)

WETZEL: Run, run! To the car! Back to the car now! Now! Run! Run, *bleep* damn it, run!

(View of dirt. The cameraman has tripped and fallen down. WETZEL pauses briefly to help him up.)

CAMERAMAN: Ow!

WETZEL: Now, now! Come on! Get up! Get up! Back to the car! Come on! Run, run! Get in the car! Get in the car!

(They are running to the car, panting loudly.)

CAMERAMAN: Holy ( bleep )!

WETZEL: Come on!

(Sound of panting as the crew gets in the back seat. WETZEL slams the door closed and gets back on the radio.)

WETZEL: (yelling on radio) 10-33, 10-33, 2-12 Adam needs assistance...

(Loud crash as the windows of the car are smashed in. Camera frantically pans around seeing nothing.)

WETZEL: (yelling on radio) I need assistance at the 500 block of Vogel! I need assistance! Ah! 999! 999... 9...!

(WETZEL keeps screaming as the car is violently flipped over. Stuff falls everywhere. The camera goes to static, then into ...)

SCENE 2

(Sound of sirens wailing as other police cars arrive at the scene. Camera is working again as our cameraman climbs out of the back seat of the overturned police car. Other police run up as WETZEL, groaning, gets out. WETZEL's forehead is bleeding. A no-nonsense African-American woman, SERGEANT DUTHIE, is in charge.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Everybody all right? (to camera crew) Hey, you all right? You all right? *Bleep*, Keith. What was this?

(WETZEL is very nervous, very aware of the camera. There is something he is not telling.)

WETZEL: I was responding to a 921 at this house right here and... there was a prowler call and, uh ...

SERGEANT DUTHIE: You flipped it?

WETZEL: No, no. Hell, no, I didn't flip it. (glances at camera) It was... We were parked. The... we were attacked.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: By who? By gangbangers?

WETZEL: Uh...

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Keith?

WETZEL: Yeah, I mean yeah, it was gangbangers.

(SERGEANT DUTHIE turns to the rest of the officers.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Okay, fan out and search.

WETZEL: (urgently) Hey, Sarge, you better double everybody up.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Hold on a minute. Everybody double up. Set me up a command post and check on that airship. (She turns back to WETZEL.) How many?

(He doesn't answer.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Keith, Keith?

WETZEL: You know, I didn't get a good look. Maybe...

(Radio interrupts.)

DISPATCH: (on radio) 417, suspects on foot just one block north of Holly!

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (yelling to the others) Armed suspects! Bring some units around on Holly Street!

(Sound of sirens wailing as several cars and many officers on foot run one block and around the corner back to MRS. GUERRERO's house. By the time the crew gets there, the officers have a man and a woman surrounded. It is MULDER and SCULLY. They have their hands up. MULDER is in jeans and leather jacket. SCULLY is Scully!Casual in some type of black pantsuit with tight black t-shirt and jacket. Lots of yelling and confusion and guns waving around. MULDER and SCULLY's guns are on the ground.)

OFFICER: Get your hands up!

SCULLY: FBI!

OFFICER: I don't care! Get your hands up!

MULDER: FBI!

OFFICER: Turn around! Turn around!

(MULDER and SCULLY turn their backs to the officers.)

MULDER: I got I.D. In my back pocket.

SCULLY: We're investigating a case!

MULDER: Check the I.D.!

(All the officers are yelling.)

OFFICERS: Behind your head!

(MULDER and SCULLY put their hands behind their heads.)

MULDER: Check my I.D. in the back pocket.

(SERGEANT DUTHIE frisks MULDER, a male officer frisks SCULLY. Hmm. SERGEANT DUTHIE looks at MULDER's ID.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Hold it, they're FBI! Give 'em back their guns!

(SERGEANT DUTHIE hands MULDER back his badge. The camera is now very interested in MULDER and SCULLY.)

MULDER: Thank you.

SCULLY: We're investigating a case.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: What case?

MULDER: Same case you're working on.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: So who we looking for?

MULDER: Not who, what.

(MULDER and SCULLY notice the camera crew. A "What the hell?" expression is on their faces. Very funny.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what the hell is going on here?

MULDER: I don't know.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (to WETZEL) You okay?

(MULDER shows SCULLY the five long scratches on the door.)

MULDER: See the claw marks here? Someone tried to get in.

(MULDER and SCULLY go over to where WETZEL is being treated by an EMT in the back of an ambulance. Camera follows. SCULLY stays back, out of the camera's range.)

MULDER: Deputy? Deputy, can you describe for me what you saw?

WETZEL: (aware of the camera) Um, I mean, it was pretty dark. Umm. I didn't really see. I don't know. I don't know.

MULDER: Well, you must have seen something in order to run away from it, huh? You were responding to the same call we were-- of a monster prowling the neighborhood.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: We've been to this house before. The lady has a history of medication. Know what I mean?

(SCULLY realizes that the camera can see her and ducks quickly behind the tinted rear window of the ambulance.)

MULDER: Yeah, maybe, but she's not the only one seeing monsters. There's been half a dozen such sightings in this area in the past 60 days. Were you aware of that?

(Pause.)

WETZEL: No. I mean...

MULDER: Yeah. Also, these sightings only occur on nights when there's a full moon which tells me something.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: What?

MULDER: What you saw was large, right? Maybe seven, eight feet tall when it stood up on its two legs? And it was covered in fur and had glowing red eyes and claws...

(MULDER has his hands up in a menacing clawlike gesture. SERGEANT DUTHIE is staring at him in disbelief.)

MULDER: Claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: You're not serious.

(SCULLY is watching MULDER, her arms crossed. The camera focuses on her. She ducks behind the tinted window again.)

MULDER: And dare I forget teeth. It bit you, didn't it? (grabs WETZEL's wrist) Look at that. Deputy, how long were you going to hide that from the E.M.T.S?

(SERGEANT DUTHIE looks at the red marks on WETZEL's wrist.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Where did you get that, Keith?

(SCULLY comes forward to look at the wounds then retreats again.)

WETZEL: I don't even know where that came from.

(Loud crash as the car is flipped back over.)

WETZEL: I mean, I didn't see anything that he's talking about.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Big teeth, eight feet tall? What the hell are you describing?

MULDER: (confidently) A werewolf.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Excuse me?

MULDER: (points to the wrecked police car) It's what did that. It also attacked one Hyman Escalara 29 days ago during the last full moon. Hyman died of his wounds in Compton General Hospital but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him. My partner and I are here to catch it.

(Camera back to SCULLY who turns her back with her hand covering her mouth.)

MULDER: Unfortunately though, Deputy, you've been bitten. The skin is broken. Werewolf lore pretty much universally holds that someone who's been bitten by such a creature is going to become such a creature himself, so...

WETZEL: Wait a minute. I mean, that's not what really happened, though.

MULDER: I'm sorry, but you're going to have to be isolated and kept under guard.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: With all due respect what the *bleep* are you talking about?

MULDER: I'm talking about preventing this man from becoming a danger to himself and to others.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Can I see your badge again?

SCULLY: (smiling sweetly) Agent Mulder, can we have a word a second.

MULDER: (to SERGEANT DUTHIE) Excuse me.

(He lets SCULLY lead him a few feet away. The camera follows.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: "What is it"? Mulder, have you noticed that we're on television?

MULDER: I don't think it's live television, Scully. She just said *bleep*.

(The camera is right beside them again.)

SCULLY: But it's a camera and it's recording.

(SCULLY glares at the camera and pulls MULDER farther away. The camera follows.)

SCULLY: It's recording everything that you are saying. Do you understand that? I just want to make sure that you're clear on that.

MULDER: I'm clear on that, Scully.

SCULLY: My point being, Mulder, that we're on a case.

MULDER: This presents an opportunity. I feel we're very close here. The possibility of capturing concrete proof of the paranormal? Of a werewolf in front of a national audience, even an international audience? What's not to love?

SCULLY: Wh ...

(SCULLY realizes MULDER is looking at the camera which is right beside them again. Frustrated, SCULLY glances back again and pulls MULDER back the way they came. They are standing very close.)

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, you want to talk about werewolves to me you can knock yourself out. I may not agree with you but at least I'm not going to hold it against you but this... Mulder, this could ruin your career.

MULDER: (laughing) What career? Scully, I appreciate it. You don't want me looking foolish. I do. I appreciate that.

SCULLY: I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.

(Sounds like the CAMERAMAN chuckles. MULDER looks at her a moment, aware of the camera once again right beside them.)

MULDER: Okay, fine. Well, do me a favor. Will you escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital? Just keep an eye on him in case I'm right? Thank you.

(Without waiting for an answer, MULDER pats her on the shoulder and starts into the house.)

SCULLY: I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.

MULDER: (unconcerned) Okay.

SCULLY: I'm sure he's going to want to say a couple of words about this.

(As MULDER enters the house, SCULLY dials her cell phone. The camera gets very close to her. She looks at them.)

SCULLY: Guys, give it a rest, huh?

(They don't leave. SCULLY places her hand over the lens.)

CUT TO:

(Inside MRS. GUERRERO's house. One of the pictures on the wall is different depending how you view it. It fades from Jesus to the Last Supper. MRS. GUERRERO is still hysterical. An officer, DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA is trying to talk to her.)

MRS. GUERRERO: Por favor, me tiene que creer. Lo vi con mis propios ojos. Mire, paso por ahi. Yo lo vi. Paso por ahi, por la ventana. Lo vi por la ventana de mi cocina. [Please, you have to believe me. I saw it with my own eyes. Look, it passed over there. I saw it. It passed over there at the window. I saw it from my kitchen window.]

Deputy Juan Molina

(Both MRS. GUERRERO and DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA are talking at the same time. She is hysterical.)

MRS. GUERRERO: Por favor, hagan algo. [Please, do something.]

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Calmese. [Calm down.]

MRS. GUERRERO: No me digan que me calme. Hagan algo, por favor [Don't tell me to calm down. Do something, please.]

(DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA turns back to MULDER and the other officers.)

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: She says... I guess she's calling it a "claw monster" ... was trying to break into the house and get her. It was big and had claws pretty much. She's going on and on.

MULDER: Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist. Will you work with her?

(RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST is a white twenty-something guy with fuzzy dreadlocks.)

RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST: (dubiously) "Claw monster"?

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Just do it, Ricky.

RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST: Okay.

(RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST goes to sit at the table with MRS. GUERRERO and DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA. Two cats are eating on the table.)

(MULDER goes back to the scratches on the door.)

MULDER: Look at that. Excuse me. Look at this. It's like five claw marks. Just like the human hand has five fingers. Pretty much the same spread, too.

(MULDER places his hand over the marks, lining up his fingers.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Agent, you seriously believe we're looking for some kind of a...?

MULDER: I'll show you. This... this is what Hyman Escalara described just before succumbing to his injuries.

(MULDER unfolds a sketch of a werewolf from his jacket pocket.)

MULDER: Ten to one that's what Mrs. Guerrero's going to describe, too.

(DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA speaks some Spanish, then calls to MULDER.)

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Sir? Sir? We got your suspect.

(RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST has finished the drawing. He rips it out his notebook. It is a representation of Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Kreuger, complete with the knives on his fingers. MRS. GUERRERO points to the picture.)

MRS. GUERRERO: Claw monster. Claw monster.

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Claw monster. Boy, you know, they kill him in every movie and he just keeps coming back. (chuckles and heads for the door.) I'm sorry.

MULDER: (looking at the drawing) This is strange.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (impatient) Gracias, Mrs. Guerrero. (to MULDER) We're looking for gangbangers.

(MULDER wants to talk to her, but she walks away.)

RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST: (very nervous) You don't think it's some guy dressed up like Freddy Krueger, do you?

(MULDER shrugs.)

RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST: Can somebody walk me to my car? It's dark out and I'm parked up the street.

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Come on, Ricky, I'll walk you to your car.

RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST: Can I return this vest later?

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Yeah, you can return the vest later, Ricky.

MULDER: This is what she was seeing?

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: That's what she's saying. That's the claw monster, man.

(The other officers have left the house. MRS. GUERRERO stops MULDER at the doorway. She is pleading.)

MRS. GUERRERO: You catch?

MULDER: Catch him?

MRS. GUERRERO: (sobbing) Si, si. You catch.

(MULDER nods, not knowing what else to do.)

8:41 PM

(Sound of winch whirring as WETZEL's car is loaded onto a tow truck. SCULLY drives up followed by a police car. She gets out.)

MULDER: How's Deputy Wetzel?

(SCULLY is subdued, not looking at the camera. She nods back to where WETZEL is getting out of the patrol car.)

MULDER: You let him get released?

SCULLY: Well... those weren't teeth marks, Mulder. They turned out to be insect bites...

MULDER: Oh.

SCULLY: Individual welts or stings of some sort. Together, they just looked like a larger pattern especially when we want them to... (peripherally glances at the camera) ... although it was an understandable conclusion that I'm sure anybody would have made.

(MULDER looks down at her and begins to smile.)

MULDER: (grinning) So, what did Skinner say?

SCULLY: He said that the FBI has nothing to hide... and neither do we.

MULDER: Well, if it makes you feel any better, Scully, I'm not entirely convinced that we're looking for a werewolf anymore.

SCULLY: (surprised) Oh. All right, good.

MULDER: No, something else. I'm not sure what. Some other kind of creature, though. That I'm sure of.

(Camera jerks away briefly at the sound of activity nearby. MULDER stops an officer running past them.)

MULDER: Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

OFFICER; Six blocks from here-- could be what we're looking for.

DISPATCH: (on radio) 800 block of Belmont.

(MULDER and SCULLY run to their car. As SCULLY is getting in the passenger side, the camera crew starts to get in the back seat. SCULLY stops them by slamming the back door closed again. She glares at them.)

SCULLY: No. You go with someone else.

DISPATCH: (on radio) We have a 9-29, man down on the corner of Belmont and Fisher.

PERSON DOWN

(They all make their way to the scene. SCULLY runs up to the front. RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST is lying in a crumpled heap in front of a closed liquor store. He has five slash marks across his chest.)

SCULLY: Guys, watch out. I'm a doctor.

DEPUTY JUAN MOLINA: Oh, man, it's Ricky.

(SCULLY gingerly presses at the unconscious RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST's chest. Blood seeps out of the wounds. Even the vest didn't protect him.)

MULDER: That's what I was afraid of, Scully.

(Fade to a grainy image of the X-Files logo lit by police lights.)



SCENE 3

(Another shot of the moon. RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST is on a stretcher. He is being loaded into an ambulance. WETZEL is talking to the camera.)

WETZEL: Well, when a fellow officer goes down in the line of duty or even if this... or even if it's not a fellow officer-- if it's just somebody working part-time with the department in a, uh, support, um... a-arti-artistic capacity, uh, like R... like Ricky, there-- we all feel it. Uh... Back there is every cop's worst nightmare... But that's when you got to cowboy up and give 150%... catch the bad guys.

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY are looking around the area where RICKY THE SKETCH ARTIST was wounded.)

SCULLY: Last call from this phone was made to the Road Club-- Ricky Koehler requesting roadside assistance for his flat tire. He asked them to hurry. He said he didn't feel safe.

(SCULLY notices that MULDER is looking at the sketch of Freddy Kreuger.)

SCULLY: What's that?

MULDER: Our suspect, apparently.

(SCULLY laughs shortly and glances at the camera.)

MULDER: Slash marks match up pretty well, wouldn't you say?

(SCULLY finds a fake pink fingernail on the ground.)

SCULLY: Somebody lost a nail.

MULDER: Nice color.

SCULLY: Check out this color, Mulder-- blood red.

MULDER: (to the other officers) Hey, uh... who called 911 on this?

CUT TO:

(Later. SERGEANT DUTHIE knocks at a door. Other officers and MULDER and SCULLY are with her.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Hey, Steve and Edy-- Sergeant Paula.

MULDER: *The* Steve and Edy?

(MULDER smiles at SCULLY.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (smiling) They're good folks. They usually call us if there's trouble in the neighborhood.

(STEVE and EDY answer the door. They are both VERY gay, black men in their 40s. STEVE is a little shorter and seems a little "tamer" than EDY. EDY is very feminine and very excited to see the cameras. MULDER has trouble not laughing throughout the scene.)

STEVE: Ooh...

EDY: Oh, my God, look at this. Look at all these people, Lord.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (friendly) How are you two doing this evening?

STEVE: Uh, uh, we're fine.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Can y'all tell us what happened out here this evening?

EDY: Not with me looking like this, mm-mmm. Now, you should know better than that, Sergeant Paula.

(EDY runs back into the house.)

STEVE: Like she going to run from a camera. Lookit here... we heard all this screaming. Peeked out the window and this boy with crazy hair was having a conniption fit all rolled up there by the phone.

SCULLY: You didn't see his-his attacker?

(STEVE is looking approvingly at MULDER/DUCHOVNY.)

STEVE: Mmm... Mm-mmm.

(MULDER/DUCHOVNY smiles. EDY comes to the door. He is now wearing a turban and brightly colored robe.)

EDY: (dramatically) I'm ready for my close-up.

STEVE: Oh, ain't nobody care about your scabby ass. (pats MULDER's shoulder) This is police business. Now, I didn't see... (to SCULLY) What you say-- "attacker"? No, he was just kind of all rolled up and yelling.

EDY: (playing for the camera) Mm-hmm. Mmm

(MULDER shows them the pictures of the werewolf and Freddy Kreuger.).

MULDER: Did you see anything... that looked like this?

STEVE: Ooh, stop.

MULDER: Or this?

STEVE: Ooh, excuse me?

EDY: That's going to give me nightmares.

SCULLY: So, you didn't see anything at all?

EDY: Mm-mmm, no, mm-mmm.

SCULLY: Did you, uh, did you see a woman?

(SCULLY holds up the bagged fingernail.)

EDY: Mmm... M...

BOTH: Mm-hmm.

EDY: Chantara. I know that skanky-ass color anywhere.

STEVE: Sure do. Chantara.

EDY: Mm-hmm.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Chantara the streetwalker?

EDY: Mm-hmm.

STEVE: She work the corner.

EDY: Mm-hmm.

STEVE: She on the pipe...

EDY: Oh, yeah.

STEVE: So, we don't associate, you know what I'm saying?

EDY: Mm-mmm, mm-mmm, no.

MULDER: (trying not to laugh) Well-well, we should may... we should go tal... we'll go talk to Chantara, then.

STEVE: Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right. Mm-hmm.

(The officers and MULDER and SCULLY leave. The camera stays a minute with STEVE and EDY.)

EDY: Hey, hey... When am I going to get my own TV show? (singing) If I didn't care ...

STEVE: Oh, she's showing off now.

EDY: (singing) ... more than words can say

STEVE: (pushing EDY back into the house) Stop. Get in the house. Stop. Get back.

EDY: (singing) If I didn't care

STEVE: (to camera) Would you excuse us? Excuse... Stop it.

EDY: (singing) Would I feel this way?

STEVE: Bye, y'all. Bye.

(STEVE gets EDY inside and closes the door.)

CUT TO:

(Camera crew is in the back seat of MULDER and SCULLY's car as they drive slowly through the neighborhood. MULDER hands SCULLY the blurred picture of CHANTARA GOMEZ.)

MULDER: So, apparently, we're on the lookout for someone whose hair matches her fingernails-- bubblegum pink. (smiles and glances over at SCULLY) That'd be a good color for you, Scully.

(A pause. She glances at the picture and sets it on the dashboard. Her lack of response speaks volumes.)

MULDER: (over his shoulder to the camera) I'd have to say that at, uh, this point in the investigation I'm-I'm usually a little more secure in-in what it is we're actually investigating but we've had so many conflicting eyewitness reports that it's-it's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we're looking for... (Pause. Camera focuses on MULDER's fingers tapping the steering wheel. Fuel gauge is low.) But the crimes we are investigating are-are paranormal. Uh, I can say that... with absolute conviction um, an-and the nature of these crimes they're-they're-they're notoriously hard to quantify on any kind of regular scientific level as Agent Scully will tell you.

SCULLY: (dryly, not looking up) Oh, yeah.

MULDER: Yeah, which-which in it... in it... in its own way i-is a... is a kind of a validation if you think about it, in and of itself, uh, but-but, you know, that's-that's our job. That's why they pay us the big bucks.

(SCULLY sees a streetwalker, CHANTARA GOMEZ, running unsteadily down the street. She is wearing a pink shirt, pleather miniskirt, fishnet stockings, very high heels and a faux fur jacket. She also has very long, very pink hair.)

SCULLY: Bubblegum pink.

(They pull up close to her.)

SCULLY: Don't run! FBI.

MULDER: Chantara Gomez? Chantara Gomez.

SCULLY: FBI. Chantara! Go...

(MULDER chuckles at the way poor CHANTARA GOMEZ is running in her heels. They get out of the car and go to her, followed by the camera crew.)

SCULLY: Don't run. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right.

MULDER: Chantara Gomez?

(CHANTARA GOMEZ is crying and shaking. She is afraid.)

SCULLY: Can I see your hands please?

CHANTARA GOMEZ: I didn't do nothing!

SCULLY: May I see your hands, please? It's okay. Let me see your hands, please.

MULDER: Show her your hands.

(CHANTARA GOMEZ cries harder, but allows SCULLY to look at her fingernails, one of which is missing. SCULLY shows her the evidence bag containing the bloody fingernail.)

SCULLY: Earlier this evening, a man was attacked. He was badly slashed and you realize this places you at the crime scene.

MULDER: Fisher and Belmont-- that's your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Look, I heard screaming, okay? And I went and I tried to help this guy and when I heard the sirens, I just ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!

MULDER: All right, look, I believe you. I think you saw something. You witnessed something. Tell me what it is.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: I can't.

SCULLY: You can tell us, Chantara.

(She continues to cry.)

SCULLY: Come on, Chantara.

(MULDER speaks gently and tries to stand protectively between CHANTARA GOMEZ and the camera.)

MULDER: Chantara... if you're afraid that what you tell us we're not going to believe it, don't be 'cause whatever it is you saw tonight... whatever it is, whatever you think you saw however strange or terrifying or bizarre, you are not going to surprise me, okay?

CHANTARA GOMEZ: You'll protect me from Chuco?

MULDER: Who's Chuco?

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Mi novio. He's the one who cut that guy up, not me! I didn't do anything!

MULDER: I'm s... I'm sorry, what?

SCULLY: "Mi novio"-- her boyfriend.

MULDER: No, no, I-I got that.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Look, he's been chasing me for a week, okay? He said he was going to twist my neck off like a little chicken if I didn't give him more money.

MULDER: (to camera) Chuco.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Chuco Munoz-- the cops know who he is.

CUT TO:

11:08 PM
ARREST WARRANT SERVED

(Street in front of a dilapidated house. Lots of officers getting ready for an assault. In the background is the garbled sound of a radio transmission.)

OFFICER: This is my favorite part of the job-- knocking down crack houses.

WETZEL: I heard that.

(CHANTARA GOMEZ, even more upset now, is sitting in the back seat of one of the police SUVs. SERGEANT DUTHIE is talking to her. SCULLY and WETZEL are with her.)

CHANTARA GOMEZ: I don't understand. I told you everything. Why can't I just go now?

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Chantara. Chantara! First of all, you are not out of the woods yet ...

CHANTARA GOMEZ: I just want to go home.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: ... as far as possible accessory charges.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Chuco's the one you want.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: So, the sooner we find him and sort this out the sooner, I hope, we can let you go.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: He's going to kill me! He told me he was going to twist my neck off like a chicken.

SCULLY: Chantara, no one's going to kill you.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: (hitting the seat in frustration) He's going to kill me!

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Chantara, look ar... look around you! You see all the deputies here? You see? No one is going to get you. Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here is going to keep an eye on you while we go and put the cuffs on Chuco. No one is going to get you.

CHANTARA GOMEZ: Shoot.

DISPATCH: (on radio) 76. Roger. 9-1-1 Davidson, 0-9-9-6, checking N.C.I.C.

(SCULLY crosses over to MULDER who is standing beside their car with vests. She takes off her jacket, puts on a bullet-proof vest, then replaces her jacket. SCULLY shows him the blurred wanted flyer for MUNOZ.)

SCULLY: Chuco Munoz, the man himself. Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull.

MULDER: He's not our guy.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

MULDER: I don't care how bad his rep is, he can't turn over a squad car.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, maybe not by himself but he's probably got friends, right?

MULDER: No, there's something else going on.

(A leaf falls on the car.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Let's hit it.

(More garbled radio transmission. The officers break down the door and enter the crack house. MULDER and SCULLY are with them. Mass confusion ensues.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Go, go, go! Go, go! Hands above your head! Put your hands above your head! Go, go, go!

(Several stoned individuals are lying around in different parts of the house. Candles lit in nearly every room, trash everywhere. Someone picks up a crying baby. Lots of shouting. Camera moves to a room with a man on his knees, hands behind his head.)

OFFICER1: Have you seen Chuco Munoz?

ANGRY CRACKHEAD; *Bleep* you, mother-*long bleep*!

OFFICER 2: Move it! Move it!

(Someone else arrests a topless woman in the kitchen. Her breasts are, of course, blurred for our protection. More shouting.)

OFFICER 3: Where are they? Put your hands where I can see them. Where I can see them.

CALM CRACKHEAD: Take your *bleep* hands off me!

DISPATCH: (on radio) 2-13 Lincoln, we are...

CALM CRACKHEAD: Oh, man.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Agents? Agents, in here.

(They enter a bathroom. A man with a tattooed, shaved head, CHUCO MUNOZ, is lying dead on the floor. SCULLY examines him.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Hey, what happened, huh? Wake up. What happened to your friend in there?

MAN: What's going on?

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Looks like he O.D.'D.

MULDER: Yeah, but how long ago?

SCULLY: Couple of days, maybe a week. He didn't attack Ricky Koehler, that's for sure.

(They hear many gunshots fired outside in quick succession.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Shots fired.

(Lots of shouting and more gunshots as they all run back outside.)

DISPATCH: (on radio) 2-12 Adam, be advised that you're a 9-23.

(More gunshots. They reach WETZEL who is firing his gun, obviously terrified.)

OFFICER: There!

SERGEANT DUTHIE: What? What? What? What you got? What you shooting at? What are you shooting at?! Keith, what are you doing?!

(WETZEL looks disoriented.)

WETZEL: It just came back. It was here.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Keith...

WETZEL: (very upset) It was... It was here. Oh, man. I heard her screaming and I-I-I tried to. I tried to stop it. I swear to you, I tried. I did everything I could do.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Oh, shoot.

WETZEL: I did everything I could do.

(MULDER goes over to the SUV where they left CHANTARA GOMEZ. He looks inside with his flashlight, then walks away. SCULLY follows him.)

SCULLY: What is it, Mulder? What? (she looks in the car) Oh.

(From the position of her blurred face it appears CHANTARA's head has been twisted to the side. Fade to logo.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (voice) Call it in.

OFFICER: (voice) 2-12 boy, I have a possible 9-27.



SCENE 4

(Later. Outside the crackhouse. Another shot of the moon with a helicopter flying past it.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: I wish someone would explain to me what the hell is going on here. It just doesn't make sense. Keith Wetzel may be a little green but he is a solid deputy-- a squared-away individual. Nothing could have gotten past him and killed that woman.

OFFICER: There's no sign of what he was shooting at. (shows them a crushed bullet) This was all we found. Nine millimeter. It's our issue.

SCULLY: Where'd you find that?

OFFICER: It was lying in the middle of the street. Doesn't look like a ricochet.

MULDER: Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at. Excuse me.

(MULDER and SCULLY cross over to where WETZEL is standing, his head bowed. Other bullets are marked where they fell.)

MULDER: Hey, Deputy. You ready to talk to me now? You and I both know you saw something. We're way past claiming you didn't.

WETZEL: I only know what I thought I saw.

MULDER: Well, describe it for me.

(WETZEL turns his back to the camera.)

WETZEL: (deep breath) The wasp man.

MULDER: The wasp man?

(Camera swings around to the side of MULDER and WETZEL.)

WETZEL: It's ridicu... (glances nervously at the camera) It's ridiculous. The scary stories my older brother used to tell me when I was a kid about a monster with a head like a wasp and a mouthful of stingers instead of teeth. He said that it would come get me in my sleep and that... and that it would sting me to death. (He rubs his bandaged wrist.)

MULDER: So you're saying that the, uh, the wasp man attacked you both times here, and earlier in the patrol car?

WETZEL: I - I'm not saying that that's what it was, okay? I mean... they didn't see it. (indicates camera crew) It's not on the videotape. This... this can't be real.

MULDER: I think maybe it can. Just... just relax a minute. Excuse me. Scully?

(MULDER walks SCULLY a few paces away.)

MULDER: We came on this case looking for a werewolf, right?

SCULLY: Well, you did, that's correct.

MULDER: Hyman Escalara claimed he was attacked by a werewolf and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out, right? And then, Wetzel over here sees a wasp man with stingers for teeth and he gets a bite mark that you say is irrefutably insect-like, right?

SCULLY: Mulder, that's not exactly... (sighs)

MULDER: And then another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger. Scully, what if we're dealing with one creature, one entity that, when it attacks, appears to you as your worst nightmare? Fear. Maybe that's what this thing feeds on.

SCULLY: Okay, well, for the sake of this argument...

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: ...How would one catch something like that?

MULDER: (thinking) Probably by... by figuring out how it chooses its prey. I mean, there... It seems to spread like a contagion, doesn't it? One person's fear becomes the next. There's a definite chain of victims. Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist and then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez and then...

SCULLY: Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.

MULDER: Right.

SCULLY: But you're missing someone, Mulder.

MULDER: Who?

SCULLY: Edy. Steve and Edy. They're a part of this chain, too and, and according to your theory they would have been attacked, right?

(They look at each other.)

CUT TO:

11:48 PM

(MULDER is following SCULLY up to STEVE and EDY's front door. He speaks over his shoulder to the camera.)

MULDER: Well, we're back at the home of Steve and Edy. Thought we'd check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile.

SCULLY: (confused) I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?

(MULDER nods with embarrassment at the crew. SCULLY barely glances at them. As they get to the door, they hear screaming from inside. MULDER breaks open the door with his shoulder and he and SCULLY rush in. They run through the beaded doorway into the kitchen and find STEVE and EDY, wearing only underwear, yelling at each other. EDY is in tears and appears to be slashing at STEVE with a knife or scissors. STEVE yells at MULDER and SCULLY.)

STEVE: ...What the hell is this?! What the hell is this?!

CUT TO:

(Short time later. Things are quieter. Sort of. EDY is crying and wailing at STEVE who is sitting on the couch. MULDER is standing between them.)

SCULLY: Steve, are you going to be all right?

STEVE: I'm all right.

EDY: Somebody ask me if I'm all right. I'm the victim. I'm the victim here. He don't treat me right. You'd better appreciate me or I'll walk out that door.

STEVE: The hell you would.

MULDER: We're not here to get involved in any kind of personal...

EDY: He treats my mama with disrespect. He treats me with disrespect.

STEVE: Oh, shut up!

MULDER: We're not here to get involved in personal problems.

EDY: (to STEVE) You-- you, shut up.

MULDER: Settle down.

EDY: (sobbing to MULDER) He won't make love to me!

MULDER: (no idea what to say) Oh. Uh...

STEVE: I should have never touched you!

(This sends EDY into another hysterical bout of sobbing.)

EDY: Oh, no! No...

SCULLY: (calmly) Look, you guys, Steve, Edy. The reason why we are here is because we are concerned about your safety. We're concerned about your lives. You witnessed a violent attack right across the street from your house.

STEVE: So you say. I just saw a rolled up boy with crazy hair.

MULDER: Well, take our word for it. Because of your proximity to the attack we think you may be targeted as well.

EDY: Why? Because we called the police?

(MULDER crosses over and tries to calm EDY down. EDY is now seated at the dining room table.)

MULDER: (emphatically) No, no. That's not why. That's not why. I can't really explain it exactly, but it's... I think the key is to remain unemotional, okay? Try to stay calm. Try to keep your heart rate down. Try to keep your adrenaline down. Just try to relax. Just... Oh, you got it. You got it.

STEVE: Good luck!

EDY: (throws his handkerchief at STEVE) Oh, you!

MULDER: I think maybe we should stay up for a little while. Let's just... let's just re-lax.

(EDY is still sobbing. MULDER suppresses a laugh and looks at SCULLY. SCULLY looks resigned and heads for the couch as MULDER sits at the table with EDY.)

MULDER: (perhaps telling himself also) Just relax.

(Camera pans over a smiling portrait of EDY.)

CUT TO:

1:32 AM

(Moon shot. Later. STEVE and EDY's house. There is the sound of a toilet flushing and MULDER reenters the room. SCULLY is sitting on the couch looking exhausted. Soundman gets back behind the camera.)

STEVE: Mr. Mulder? Look here. I got to go to bed.

MULDER: How you doing, Edy? You still upset?

EDY: I'm scared.

MULDER: You're scared?

EDY: (sobbing) I'm scared he gonna leave me.

(STEVE gets up and walks over to EDY and embraces him. All is okay and calm.)

STEVE: (to EDY) No, no, no, no.

SCULLY: Think we should take them to a motel?

STEVE: We don't need no hotel. We've been living in this house for 17 years. Ain't nobody going to chase us out.

EDY: Mm-mm.

MULDER: You're not afraid?

STEVE: Now, I didn't say that. I said, ain't nobody going to chase us out.

EDY: Mm-mm.

(MULDER and SCULLY exit the house. Another camera team arrives with WETZEL. SCULLY looks at them with horror.)

SCULLY: Oh, God. More of you?

WETZEL: We any closer to an arrest?

SCULLY: I'm afraid not. Mulder, what next?

MULDER: Well, I'd say we should station a couple of deputies out here but I don't think it's coming back here. We're just playing catch-up with this thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect. And, uh, well, we've got four or five hours till the moon sets. The attacks only occur on the full moon then we're out of luck.

SCULLY: Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.

MULDER: For a possible contagion?

SCULLY: Your "contagion of fear"?

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: No?

SCULLY: But if I can't figure out what this thing was at least I can figure out what it wasn't.

(MULDER, man-in-charge, hands her the car key.)

MULDER: All right. Make it fast. Fill that tank up with gas.

(SCULLY shoulders tense slightly as she heads for the car. This will be discussed later. MULDER turns to WETZEL.)

MULDER: Uh, Deputy, you're the only person who's seen this twice so I'd like to ride with you, if you don't mind.

WETZEL: Let's go.

MULDER: Thanks.

(One of the camera crews gets into the back seat of WETZEL's car with WETZEL and MULDER. The other crew follows SCULLY to her car. There is a pause as she glares at them. She reluctantly says nothing however, and they get in the backseat.)

(Inside WETZEL's car. MULDER's eating, possibly sunflower seeds, while he talks to WETZEL.)

WETZEL: You really believe me, huh? You really believe I saw what I thought I saw?

MULDER: Yeah, I believe you.

WETZEL: Why?

MULDER: Why do I believe you?

WETZEL: Yeah. I mean, what proof do you have what I'm saying is real? I mean, it's not... it's not on the video tape.

MULDER: The camera doesn't always tell the whole story.

WETZEL: And what about your partner? Does she believe me?

(There is a pause.)

MULDER: I don't think she thinks you're lying.

WETZEL: Yeah, but what? Maybe I'm crazy? You know, I've been on the job 18 months-- all I ever wanted to do. Right out of the gate, I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy? I mean, you know how cops are. How's somebody supposed to live that down?

MULDER: I don't know. Uh, I guess just do good work.

WETZEL: It's a hard enough job already, you know? You want to help people but it's like the freaking Wild West out here. You know people hate you? Every shift, I go out thinking... (he waves for some pedestrians to cross in front of the car) Go ahead. ...I go out thinking, "You know, there's somebody out there who wants to take me out. Am I going to run into him tonight?" And it's hard to have a fast-track career in law enforcement when everybody thinks you're nuts.

MULDER: Tell me about it.

CUT TO:

LOS ANGELES COUNTY MORGUE

(Autopsy bay. SCULLY and the CORONER'S ASSISTANT, a nervous woman of about 30, are conducting the autopsy of CHANTARA GOMEZ. The body is blurred. Close up of instrument tray.)

SCULLY: Chantara Gomez, age 31, apparent cause of death is the fracturing of the second and third cervical vertebrae. There are contusions consistent with, uh, choking or throttling uh, by very powerful hands.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: People are saying her pimp killed her from beyond the grave. (SCULLY gives her a look.) That's the story going around. It's crazy, huh?

(SCULLY picks up the Very Large Camera and begins taking pictures of the body.)

SCULLY: Well, let's see if we can put that story to rest, shall we?

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: The other thing I heard was, uh... something about contagion? Like with this body?

SCULLY: (taking pictures) That's... that's completely inaccurate. This, uh, investigation is... is... We're moving towards an apparent chain of victims and I seriously doubt that we're going to find anything that looks like a contagious pathology here.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: Because, I mean, if we were we should be taking precautions. If the body could be contagious, you... We're not even wearing masks.

SCULLY: (confident) Look, this is obviously a murder, here. I mean, this woman died of a broken neck, right? Not the hantavirus.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: (startled) Who said anything about the hantavirus?

(SCULLY is still calmly examining the body, getting irritated with the other woman who is just standing, looking scared.)

SCULLY: Nobody. I just... I was, um... It was a figure of speech.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: It's just, the reason I asked is why is it so urgent TO DO AN AUTOPSY AT 3:00 in the morning? I mean, that kind of rush-- it's just unheard of.

SCULLY: (examining the body) We're trying to look for the killer.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: Well, we got murder victims stacked three-deep in the freezer. Plus you got this camera crew reporting everything. Why?

(Long pause as SCULLY looks up at the camera. She smiles "pleasantly," - read "painfully" - the picture perfect agent. The FBI Public Relations department would be proud.)

SCULLY: (to the camera) Because the FBI has nothing to hide.

(She goes back to the body.)

SCULLY: Look, there is no ulterior motive here. It's just... Are you going to help me out here, or what?

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: Yeah. Of course.

SCULLY: Thank you.

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: Why did you mention the hantavirus?

SCULLY: Look, I...

(The CORONER'S ASSISTANT suddenly sneezes twice and looks down at blood on her fingers. Blood is trickling from her nose.)

CORONER'S ASSISTANT: Oh, my God.

(The CORONER'S ASSISTANT falls gasping to the floor. SCULLY kneels down next to her. The Camera Crew comes closer. SCULLY yells at them.)

SCULLY: Call 911. Call 911! 911!

(They don't move.)

SCULLY: Get out of here! Come on!

(Fade to grainy logo and ...)



SCENE 5

4:41 AM

(Moon shot. Autopsy bay, later. MULDER and SERGEANT DUTHIE have joined SCULLY. Camera shows the blood still on the floor. SCULLY is very frustrated. Her hair looks great, though.)

SCULLY: It's not the hantavirus. It looks for all the world like the hantavirus but I can promise you that it's not. Well, I mean, she-she exhibited all the symptoms-- the hemorrhagic fever, the severe chills, acute shock. But, I mean, the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds. And the hantavirus doesn't kill that fast. I mean, no virus in the world kills that fast.

MULDER: You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died? Why?

SCULLY: Because she kept bringing it up. I mean, it was like the power of suggestion, Mulder. She was-she was standing there. She was saying that she was afraid of contagion and then all of a sudden, she just...

MULDER: She was afraid. She was afraid... and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: What do you mean by that?

MULDER: It's the same. It's the same M.O. Same as the others. What we've been looking for all night. This-this entity or force somehow vectored off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman.

SCULLY: No, no, no, Mulder. I was standing right here. I didn't see anything. (indicates the camera) They didn't see anything.

(MULDER comes close to SCULLY.)

MULDER: Yeah, but you weren't afraid.

SCULLY: (softly) The hell I wasn't afraid, Mulder. I don't know what's going on here.

MULDER: (softly) You weren't afraid for your life. Neither were Steve and Edy and it left them alone. Mortal fear: I think that's what it comes down to. This... this... this thing whatever it is, is attracted to that. Everybody who was attacked felt that intensely.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: For * beep* sakes.

MULDER: No, no. It makes perfect sense. (to SERGEANT DUTHIE) You said so. You asked me earlier what would this thing be doing in Willow Park. Well, where else would it go but a high-crime neighborhood? Somewhere where people live behind barred windows and are afraid to go out at night. Where's Deputy Wetzel?

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Back on patrol.

(MULDER exhales nervously.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you were walking around with him for three hours and you didn't see anything ...

MULDER: But I was with him. I was backing him up.

(MULDER starts to leave quickly.)

CUT TO:

4:48 AM
CRACK HOUSE

(WETZEL's car. He and the other camera crew pull up in front of the crackhouse.)

WETZEL: Like I said, there's something about a full moon. Things definitely get strange. (sighs) Well... we checked everyplace else tonight. Let's check this place again.

(They get out of the car. WETZEL cuts through the crime scene tape on the front door with a pocketknife and they enter the house. WETZEL has his gun out and is breathing heavily. His flashlight starts to go out.)

WETZEL: Ah... Come on. God * bleep* it!

(Sound of loud crashing. All is dark. Loud crash. Door slams shut.)

WETZEL: I'm calling for backup. Get out! Get out, now! Get out!

CAMERAMAN: Don't know how to!

(The front door won't open. WETZEL tries it.)

WETZEL: Let's go! I got it! I got it! Hurry up! Come on! I can't open it!

CAMERAMAN: Oh, God! God! *Bleep*

(Camera goes to static then out.)

CUT TO:

(Outside, sound of sirens blaring as MULDER, SCULLY and the others arrive, three in the back seat.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: There's Wetzel's car.

(They run up to the front door. It won't open.)

MULDER: Wetzel?!

SERGEANT DUTHIE: Get the battering ram.

(Someone goes to get it.)

(MULDER leads SCULLY around to the back of the house. The camera crew follows. Sound of helicopter approaching and a loud banging. SCULLY has her gun out.)

MULDER: That gun's not going to be any good.

(They enter the back door. Banging sound.)

SCULLY: It's the battering ram.

MULDER: Well, how come they're not in yet?

(The door slams shut. They look around nervously.)

SCULLY: Wind?

MULDER: If you say so.

(MULDER and SCULLY see the closet door handle jiggling. MULDER quickly opens it revealing the other two member camera crew. They scream and wave the microphone threateningly. SCULLY slams the door shut again. Very funny.)

SCULLY: Damn it. I hate you guys.

(SCULLY glares at the cameraman outside the closet.)

MULDER: (through the closed door) Where's Wetzel?

CAMERAMAN: (from the closet) We don't know. There's something out there.

MULDER: Stay where you are.

CAMERAMAN: (from the closet) * Bleep* yeah.

MULDER: Look at this, Scully.

(There is blood on the floor.)

SCULLY: Deputy Wetzel?

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (outside) Agent Scully? You guys need assistance?

(MULDER and SCULLY go upstairs.)

MULDER: Wetzel? Wetzel?

(Inside an upper room, Wetzel is screaming. MULDER is trying to push open the door, but it seems to be blocked by something. Either that, or he's not trying very hard. Maybe his shoulder is still bruised from the door he busted open earlier.)

MULDER: Wetzel?

WETZEL: (in the room, screaming) My God, let go of me! Get off of me!

MULDER: Wetzel?!

WETZEL: (in the room, screaming) Please, help me!

MULDER: (banging on the door) Wetzel, don't be afraid. It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid! That's what it wants. Hello? Wetzel? It can't hurt you! You're a * bleep* Sheriff's Deputy, Wetzel! Don't be afraid now. (glancing at the camera) And you're on national television, so cowboy up!

(MULDER shrugs at SCULLY and continues trying to open the door. WETZEL continues yelling.)

MULDER: Geez.

(The door suddenly opens for MULDER at the same time the door downstairs opens.)

MULDER: Wetzel?

(WETZEL is on the floor, alive, but bleeding badly.)

SCULLY: He's alive.

SERGEANT DUTHIE: (downstairs) Deputy Wetzel?

SCULLY: We're up here!

(Other officers run in.)

SERGEANT DUTHIE: *Beep* What happened?

MULDER: (looking out the window) The sun just came up.

CUT TO:

(Outside. Dawn. MULDER and SCULLY are standing beside their car as WETZEL is carried out on a stretcher.)

OFFICER: (to WETZEL) Be strong. Hang in there, kid.

(Camera finds MULDER and SCULLY.)

SCULLY: You think the Deputy stopped it whatever it was?

MULDER: Maybe it just went away until the next full moon. I don't know. You've got to figure there's enough fear in the world that if it doesn't show up in Willow Park it's going to show up someplace else.

SCULLY: (sounds disappointed for him) You didn't get the proof that you wanted, Mulder.

MULDER: (pointing up at the camera) Well, hey, you know, it all depends on how they edit it together.

(Begin fade out.)

SCULLY: (voice) It's going to be a hard one to write up.

[THE END]
                                 FIRST PERSON SHOOTER



SCENE 1

(High tech room. Flashing red light. Three geeky looking young men, RETRO, MOXIE, and LO-FAT are getting ready for battle. Raging testosterone. They are dressed in futuristic metal vests, pants, and boots. The computerized voice sounds like George Takei - Sulu in the original Star Trek.)

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: T-minus ten seconds to engagement.

(They begin grabbing high-powered weapons off of the wall. LO-FAT, a rather pudgy individual, is very excited.)

LO-FAT: Woo-hoo-hoo!

MOXIE: Lo-Fat's going off!

LO-FAT: Going to kill! Going to kill!

(RETRO exudes confidence.)

RETRO: Just stay out of my way, Geeks. I'm going to the next level today. I'm a death machine.

MOXIE AND LO-FAT: Woo-hoo!!!

(The red counter against the wall finishes countdown. 2 ... 1 ... The room is rocked as from a close impact from outside.)

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Status: Combat ready. Situation: Guerrilla units in immediate vicinity of insertion module.

(The Geeks put on headgear, funky glasses, and check weapon clips.)

CUT TO:

(In a computer control room, IVAN and PHOEBE are monitoring the Geeks' vital signs. IVAN is a very tense, easily excitable young man. Very similar in temperament to the Tweek Coffee kid from SouthPark. [Thank you, fellow OBSSE member Jennifer Stoy for that comparison!] PHOEBE is a small mousy looking woman, much like the girl in Season 2's Firewalker.)

GEEKS: (heard over the microphone) Woo-hoo! Woo! Let's do this! Bring it on!!

IVAN: (amazed, looking right into the camera) Look at these heart rates.

PHOEBE: If I don't let these boys out they're going to kill each other.

(On the monitor, we see the GEEKS facing a closed blast door, guns out, ready to go.)

GEEKS: Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: (has been counting down from 10) ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Engage.

GEEKS: Woo-hoo!

(The door slides up and open. The GEEKS run out into a very large area and position themselves behind a metal triangle shaped barricade, RETRO at the top of the triangle and the others on either side of him. Night street scene. It looks like the opening levels in games like DOOM and Quake. They crouch behind the metal barricade and wait. All is quiet.)

MOXIE: You see 'em?

RETRO: They're out there, Geeks. Looking to fry your huevos.

(Sound of engines from the far end of the street, then several motorcycles peel around the corner and head straight for the GEEKS.)

MOXIE: Call it, Retro! Call it!

(Pause as the motorcycles get closer.)

RETRO: Now!

(The GEEKS all open fire on the motorcycles. One after the other, the motorcycles explode in flashes of light. They just barely destroy the last one before it reaches them. They all duck behind the barricade.)

(IVAN and PHOEBE watch from the control room.)

IVAN: Whoa! It's a total massacre out there.

(The image in the game shifts slightly. Looks like some lower doors open.)

MOXIE: Phase two, Geeks!

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: We know you're up there! Prepare to die! ]

RETRO: Ready, knuckleheads?

MOXIE: Flank right!

LO-FAT; Flank left!

GEEKS: Go! Move out, baby! Come on, baby!

(They rush down the street firing up at Nazi-looking soldiers who are firing down at them from the upper levels. Total mayhem. LO-FAT is hit and falls to the ground, a blotch of yellow paint on his chest. RETRO and MOXIE make it to another barricade at the other end of the building. LO-FAT tries several times to get up, but every time he moves he moans as he is hit with a jolt of electricity.)

MOXIE: Lo-Fat's down.

RETRO: You got me, Moxie?

MOXIE: Got you covered.

(MOXIE fires his machine gun as RETRO runs to a side door and ducks inside.)

(In the control room, IVAN and PHOEBE watch.)

IVAN: Retro's in.

PHOEBE: Adrenaline redline.

IVAN: The bloodthirst is unquenchable.

(In the game, RETRO runs and fires his gun. He ends up in a lower level. Very Quake-like. He slides open another door, then looks around nervously as he hears footsteps.)

RETRO: Moxie?

(No answer. The footsteps get closer.)

RETRO: Who's there?

(A woman descends the steps. She is wearing thigh-high leather spike heel boots, and a very revealing leather bodysuit. Basically two strips of leather held together with a string and a thong. RETRO lowers his gun and gapes at her as she struts confidently to him. She is stunningly beautiful. She holds out her hand. RETRO kneels and kisses it.)

RETRO: Who are you?

MAITREYA: I am Maitreya. This is my game.

(Her right hand morphs. She is now holding a flintlock pistol. She fires. Scene digitizes and blurs white, then cuts to ...)

SCENE 2
FPS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
INLAND EMPIRE, CALIFORNIA

(Entry hall to the First Person Shooter development company. Very modern and secure. We see MULDER and SCULLY in the distance pass through a metal detector, presumably losing their guns. They approach the security desk. MULDER shows his badge.)

MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI. We're expected.

SECURITY GUARD: I need to scan your ID.

(The SECURITY GUARD takes his job very seriously. He looks suspiciously at MULDER and SCULLY and then runs a small handheld scanning device over MULDER's badge. The image appears on the computer monitor.)

SECURITY GUARD: Retina scan, please.

(The SECURITY GUARD puts the scanning device to MULDER's eye. MULDER's retinal scan appears on the computer monitor next to his badge image. MULDER looks at SCULLY.)

MULDER: (impressed) Cool.

SECURITY GUARD: Ma'am?

(SCULLY glances meaningfully at MULDER, then leans forward. The SECURITY GUARD scans SCULLY's badge and does a retinal scan on her.)

SECURITY GUARD: I'll need you to look over those nondisclosure agreements.

SCULLY: (reading, not impressed) "To protect all proprietary or intellectual property owned by F.P.S., a private California corporation under the harshest penalty of law."

SECURITY GUARD: Signature at the bottom, please.

(SCULLY looks up at a security camera that swings over to look at them.)

SCULLY: F.P.S.

MULDER: First Person Shooter.

SCULLY: (a rhetorical question) Video games.

MULDER: (defensively) Digital entertainment.

SCULLY: I can get in the Pentagon easier than this.

(They sign. The LONE GUNMEN greet them from the top of a stairway. LANGLY, FROHIKE, and BYERS are very happy to see MULDER and SCULLY. LANGLY is wearing a Led Zeppelin t-shirt.)

LANGLY: Dudes! Agent Mulder, what's up, wild man? Welcome to the land where silicon meets silicone.

FROHIKE: Can I get you a latte from the bar or perhaps a bottle of designer H20?

MULDER: Scully?

(SCULLY is not to be distracted from the case at hand.)

SCULLY: How about a simple explanation as to why we're here?

LANGLY: Well, why don't we take a brief moment just to feel the pulse of the new American gold rush?

BYERS: (proudly) You're standing on the launch pad of a rocket headed for the stars.

(SCULLY glances around. She obviously feels nothing.)

SCULLY: Okay.

(Pause. The men look uncomfortable.)

FROHIKE: There's been a little accident.

SCULLY: What kind of accident?

(As they walk through the hall and down the stairs, they pass a series of cardboard cutouts of game figures including the three GEEKS. One is a figure of a very surprised looking policeman who has just been shot.)

LANGLY: Like ... uh, an industrial accident.

SCULLY: How did the victim die?

FROHIKE: Uh... It's not exactly clear.

BYERS: Right.

SCULLY: Was there equipment involved?

FROHIKE: (together) No.

BYERS: (together) Yes. Mmm...

LANGLY: Yes and no.

SCULLY: What's your business here?

LANGLY: Our business?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: Uh-huh.

FROHIKE: We're consultants to F.P.S.

(They exit an elevator.)

BYERS: Langly did some programming for them. He created all of the bad guys.

LANGLY: Only the Euro goons.

FROHIKE: We don't want to give you the idea that we're major profit participants.

MULDER: Cash or stock options?

(Pause. The GUNMEN look at each other.)

LANGLY: Options ... preferred rate. Vesting immediately with a short-term exercise against venture collateral to bypass S.E.C. regs.

BYERS: The IPO'S in a week.

FROHIKE: Game ships on Friday. 50 malls across the United States and Japan.

SCULLY: Only there's a dead body between you and untold riches.

MULDER: I don't know about you guys but I'd be checking my shorts for cake.

(Later. In the game playing area. A layer of bubble wrap is lifted from where it has been covering the body of RETRO where he fell. SCULLY is kneeling before him.)

SCULLY: This man's been shot.

IVAN: (very upset, rationalizing) No! See, when somebody is shot, there's a gun involved, right? That is absolutely impossible because there's no way anybody could ever get a gun past security.

(SCULLY holds up the huge laser rifle.)

SCULLY: What do you call this?

IVAN: It's a laser blaster. For wasting cybertrash.

LANGLY: It emits a low-frequency ...

IVAN: (interrupting) Just let me.

LANGLY: All right.

IVAN: The weapons feed off the F.P.S. mainframe. The effect is intensely real, but harmless.

(PHOEBE is standing with her arms crossed, very uncomfortable.)

SCULLY: You say this weapon is a toy but this man clearly has gunshot wounds through his...

IVAN: Stun suit. See, it's rigged with paint for wounds and kill shots. It's total bleeding-edge technology.

(SCULLY dips her latex covered fingers into the bloody wound and shows the blood to IVAN.)

IVAN: (impatiently) He's dead. I got it.

MULDER: Who was he playing against?

IVAN: Against the game. You waste the cyberthugs before they waste you. It's all about body count. But they're computer-generated images running on a projector. It all happens in the game space.

PHOEBE: It's a total digital environment. Nothing's real. It's all virtual.

MULDER: Did anybody see what happened?

PHOEBE: I was in the control booth with Ivan. Retro was in the zone. His telemetry was solid. He looked unstoppable; like he was on his way to the next level when suddenly, he was cooked meat.

SCULLY: (taking out her phone) Well, the next call's going to be to the local P.D.

IVAN: No cops! (to LANGLY) No cops. You said no cops. You said you had connections.

SCULLY: Well, connections or not, you've got a murder victim here.

IVAN: (heading out of the room) Headlines-- just what the Wall Street money dudes want to read as we're going to market.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI...

MULDER: (to PHOEBE) You said you were in the control booth when it happened? Can you tell me exactly what you saw?



SCENE 3

(Later. Control room. PHOEBE is typing on computer. The monitor displays the three GEEKS as they were playing the game earlier.)

PHOEBE: I'm still not sure if we even saw it. I mean, one minute everything is going perfect and then we crashed. Ivan and I were sitting here. We both just looked at each other. It happened so fast. Moxie's covering Retro who's going inside after the enemy to rack up beaucoup points.

FROHIKE: And then, goosh! Retro's vitals spike like he's been shot.

BYERS: And the system defaults.

(Image digitizes white.)

PHOEBE: And they're right back in the game space.

(The background images have now disappeared and the men are in a large, plain room.)

MOXIE: (on video) Lo-Fat! Get over here.

LO-FAT: (on video) What happened?

MOXIE: (on video) Retro? Hey, man, get up.

LO-FAT: (on video) What happened?

(On video, MOXIE and LO-FAT run to the body of RETRO.)

PHOEBE: Lights out. Game over.

MULDER: What happened in there?

LANGLY: We don't know. There's no rez images on interior game spaces.

MULDER: What about the wireframe?

(GUNMEN look at MULDER with surprise.)

PHOEBE: Maybe I can. I'll strip down to wireframe display.

(PHOEBE types some commands. The computer displays an outline image display of the game, then goes to the area where RETRO ran.)

PHOEBE: I mean ... We've never mapped this area before. Retro was in noncombat space.

(The image shows the skeleton of a human lying on the ground and of a digital character with breasts standing over him.)

FROHIKE: It's a chick.

LANGLY: It can't be.

MULDER: Can you texture wrap her?

(The LONE GUNMEN glance over at MULDER. PHOEBE, sighs, types some commands. The wire image of the woman solidifies from the feet up. MAITREYA. She is wearing leather boots, thong bodysuit, and not much else. She is holding a gun.)

BYERS: Holy Toledo.

FROHIKE: She's packing a flintlock.

MULDER: That ain't all she's packing. Can you print that out for me?

PHOEBE: Mm-hmm.

(Sound of paper rattling as the picture prints. MULDER and the LONE GUNMEN leave the room. PHOEBE stares at the screen. The digital image of the woman lowers the gun, looks at the camera, and walks away. PHOEBE stares at the screen.)

PHOEBE: Goddess.



SCENE 4

(At the security desk SCULLY is talking to DETECTIVE LACOEUR as the body of RETRO is wheeled out. MULDER and the GUNMEN join her.)

DETECTIVE LACOEUR: Let me get this straight, Agent Scully: You've got no murder weapon, no forensic evidence, no motive, no suspect.

MULDER: (coming up the stairs) Scully.

SCULLY: My partner, Agent Mulder. This is Detective LaCoeur.

DETECTIVE LACOEUR: Have you got something?

MULDER: Yeah, our killer, I believe.

(MULDER unfolds the picture of MAITREYA for DETECTIVE LACOEUR. DETECTIVE LACOEUR is not impressed.)

DETECTIVE LACOEUR: Hey, I'll put out an A.P.B.-- for Frederick's of Hollywood.

(He leaves.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you're not serious.

MULDER: It's all in the computer.

SCULLY: Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen out of any number of video games.

MULDER: But she's not in any video game, she's in this one and no one programmed her in.

SCULLY: Yeah, but even if they had, she's not real. She's a character. She's some immature hormonal fantasy.

(An Asian man enters the building and heads straight for the staircase. He looks at no one. MULDER and the GUNMEN are awed.)

LANGLY: Daryl Musashi. You see who that is? Daryl Musashi.

FROHIKE: As I live and breathe.

(LANGLY and FROHIKE follow MUSASHI down the stairs.)

SCULLY: Who's Daryl Musashi?

MULDER: The O.G.-- Original Guru.

BYERS: Word is he slums as a game designer when he's not contracted to the CIA. The boy wonder of virtual mayhem.

SCULLY: What's he doing here?

BYERS: Ivan must have called him to go in and slay the ninja babe.

(Follows the others.)

SCULLY: Mulder, why does this game have the effect of reducing grown men back to moony adolescence?

MULDER: (whispering, speechless as he heads for the stairs) That's Daryl Musashi!

(SCULLY groans in frustration.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Huh?

SCULLY: Do you want me to autopsy the body?

(MULDER clicks tongue affirmatively and points his finger at her as he descends the stairs.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. IVAN, PHOEBE, FROHIKE, and LANGLY are watching as DARYL MUSASHI enters the game.)

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Immersion module in descent mode. T-minus 20 seconds to engagement.

IVAN: Pay attention, worms. Daryl Musashi's going to show us how this game's supposed to be played.

FROHIKE: I heard he scored 90 consecutive wins on Demon Space Drifter.

PHOEBE: (with a grin) 91.

LANGLY: Look at him. The man's a sphinx.

(In the game entry room, MUSASHI is standing confidently in full game gear. Red LED counter is counting down.)

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: T minus 10 ... 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Engage.

(Door opens and MUSASHI spins his guns, then walks out into position behind the barricade. He stands with the guns crossed over his chest.)

(In the control room, BYERS and MULDER join the others watching the monitor.)

FROHIKE: Hey, Byers, you got to see this. Mulder, get over here.

MULDER: Is that him? Is that Daryl Musashi?

(IVAN nods his head rapidly, his eyes transfixed on the screen.)

BYERS: Yeah, that's him.

LANGLY: He just stepped into the game.

MULDER: Why is he just standing there?

IVAN: Because he knows no fear.

CUT TO:

(In the game. The Mind-Numbingly Stupid Nazi Death Bikers begin advancing. MUSASHI waits, then blasts them all quickly before they even get close.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. Much cheering.)

LANGLY: Yeah!

BYERS: Unbelievable.

PHOEBE: (impressed, but not surprised) Standing heart rate is 68.

MULDER: He hasn't even broken a sweat.

IVAN: Look at him! He's not even waiting for the reset. He's going right for the kill.

CUT TO:

(On the monitor, MUSASHI runs down into the hidden area where RETRO met MAITREYA. We see someone behind him. He turns just as MAITREYA swings a broadsword down across his hands, severing them at the wrists. He screams in horror and agony, holding up his bloody stumps. The people in the control booth are watching everything, also in horror.)

IVAN: What just happened?

MULDER: (factually, staring at the screen) She cut off his hands.

(In the game, MUSASHI screams again, then stops and gazes at MAITREYA as she speaks softly to him in Japanese. Then she swings the sword again at his head.)

(In the control room, PHOEBE and the five men stare at the screen in horror. FROHIKE turns his head away in disgust.)



SCENE 5

(Autopsy bay. SCULLY is examining the body of RETRO. There is a gaping wound in the center of his chest, bloody with spots of yellow paint. SCULLY takes off her latex gloves.)

SCULLY: (into tape recorder) Preliminary external examination of deceased, a twenty-ish male, name listed only as "Retro," offers no additional clues as to actual cause of death.

(She turns his arm. Autopsy wrist tag lists name as "Retro" #443-77-779.)

SCULLY: (pause, she clicks the recorder on again) Scratch that. Cause of death is from a large entry wound at the sternum, resulting in trauma to the internal organs and blood loss. Wound is consistent with a high-velocity impact from a large projectile which passed through a three-ply Kevlar jacket. (pause, the recorder is turned on again) Scratch that. Wound is result of high-velocity impact from an unknown object, which even if it did enter the body left no damn trace evidence whatsoever-- no powder burns, no chemical signatures of any kind of explosive propellant ...

(MULDER enters the room.)

MULDER: No luck?

(SCULLY crosses to the damaged Kevlar vest. They look at it. It has a yellow paint stained hole in the middle of it.)

SCULLY: I thought I was on to something. You know, Mulder, this suit holds more than just exploding paint cells. It measures the player's vital signs from the heart rate to the extant body chemistry and then sends that information back to the computer. Then when a player is shot a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt that keeps him from getting up until the game is over.

MULDER: Virtual death.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, if only that were the case.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I thought at first that maybe the uh, suit had malfunctioned, that one of the charges had blown inward but, unfortunately, that wasn't the case either.

(MULDER has been looking at the vest. He holds it up against his own chest and looks playfully at SCULLY.)

MULDER: I've got a birthday coming up. You have to admit, though, Scully, this is a pretty amazing piece of technology.

SCULLY: Yeah, wasted on a stupid game.

MULDER: Stupid?

SCULLY: Dressing up like high-tech warriors to play a futuristic version of Cowboys and Indians? What kind of moron gets his ya-yas out like that?

(MULDER grins and points proudly at himself.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what - what purpose does this game serve except to add to a culture of violence in a country that's already out of control?

MULDER: Who says it adds to it?

SCULLY: You think that taking up weapons and creating gratuitous virtual mayhem has any redeeming value whatsoever? I mean, that the testosterone frenzy that it creates stops when the game does?

MULDER: Well, that's rather sexist, isn't it?

(SCULLY gives him a look. She is smiling, though.)

MULDER: I mean, maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses, that it fills a void in our genetic makeup that the more civilizing effects of society failed to provide for.

SCULLY: Well, that must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff.

MULDER: Well, testosterone frenzy or no the only suspect we have in this man's murder is a woman.

(He holds out the picture of MAITREYA.)

SCULLY: Yeah, I've seen it. A computer-animated woman, Mulder, with a computer-animated weapon.

MULDER: A flintlock pistol-- which would leave a very large entry wound.

SCULLY: Pictures don't kill people, Mulder, guns kill people.

(CORONER wheels in another sheet covered gurney.)

MULDER: As do swords.

(Under the sheet is the dismembered body of DARYL MUSASHI. The CIA will not be pleased.)

MULDER: The world-renowned Daryl Musashi.

(MULDER's phone rings. He answers it.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder. ... You're kidding. Thanks. (hangs up) L.A. Sheriff's department just picked up a female suspect for the murders.



SCENE 6
L.A. COUNTY
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT

(Testosterone frenzy. Every available male officer in the department is standing outside the interrogation room where the woman is being held. DETECTIVE LACOEUR comes out of the room and bites his knuckle junior-high boy fashion. The other officers cheer him on.)

OFFICERS: Who's the man? Who's the man? You're the man. You're the man with the badge.

(MULDER and SCULLY make their way through the OFFICERS, SCULLY leading. She is not pleased.)

SCULLY: You get the feeling these men have something better to do?

(The OFFICERS are laughing. MULDER and SCULLY reach DETECTIVE LACOEUR.)

DETECTIVE LACOEUR: We picked her up outside of a strip club in Reseda. Fits your description to a tee.

SCULLY: Was she read her rights?

DETECTIVE LACOEUR: About 500 times.

(OFFICERS chuckle. SCULLY enters the interrogation room. A very attractive, scantily dressed woman is sitting in a chair with her legs crossed. As MULDER follows SCULLY into the room he bites his knuckle for the benefit of the OFFICERS. They approve. SCULLY faces the woman. MULDER shuts the door and closes the blind.)

SCULLY: For the record, can you state your name, please?

(The woman looks just like the woman in the game, MAITREYA. She is wearing a silver metallic halter-top/miniskirt outfit with chains. SCULLY is unaffected. MULDER maintains a rather silly grin throughout the interrogation.)

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: For the record again, my name is Jade Blue Afterglow. I reside...

SCULLY: (interrupting) I'm sorry. Your real name?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: That is my real name. What were you expecting? Mildred?

SCULLY: No.

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: I sure seem to be upsetting a lot of people around here.

SCULLY: Well, you're not upsetting me, Miss, uh...

MULDER: (helpfully) Afterglow.

(SCULLY glances at him.)

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: I sure upset the man running the metal detector.

(She uncrosses and crosses her legs Basic Instinct-style, the camera angle shooting from the floor up. MULDER smiles and looks away. SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez or a company known as First Person Shooter or F.P.S.?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: I meet a lot of men.

SCULLY: Would it surprise you to know that you have been placed at a crime scene in the offices of F.P.S.?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: Let's just say it takes a whole lot to surprise me.

SCULLY: You might want to start telling the truth.

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: And what truth am I not telling you?

MULDER: That you murdered two men. One with a 14th century broadsword and the other with a flintlock pistol.

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: Oh. You must have had me confused with my sister-- Xena, Warrior Princess.

(MULDER shows her the image of MAITREYA. She looks at it with realization.)

MULDER: Are you denying that this is you?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: Now I get it.

SCULLY: What?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: The medical imaging place in Culver City. I got paid to let them do this body-scan thing.

SCULLY: They paid you to scan your body?

JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW: You think that's the strangest thing I've been paid to do?

MULDER: We're very sorry, Miss Afterglow but, um... We're sorry. You're... You're free to go.

(JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW gets up, picks up her coat and "sways" out of the room, passing the line of OFFICERS. MULDER sits in the chair that she just vacated and sighs. He leans to his right to get a better view of JADE BLUE AFTERGLOW as she leaves, but SCULLY faces him and leans to her left, blocking his view. Very cute. He gives up.)

MULDER: I don't know about you, Scully, but I am feeling the great need to blast the crap out of something.

(Scully smiles knowingly at him.)



SCENE 7
FPS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS
5:42 AM

(Control room at FPS. Another poster of the GEEKS. The lights are off as MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

SCULLY: Hello.

MULDER: Anybody here?

(They almost leave, then SCULLY walks over to where PHOEBE is asleep on the floor. MULDER tries the light switch. It doesn't work.)

SCULLY: Phoebe? Hey, you okay?

PHOEBE: Oh. I must've fell asleep. I... I was just going to take a nap. I've been up for 70 hours straight, analyzing code, trying to fix the game.

SCULLY: Where is everybody? Where's Ivan?

PHOEBE: Um, he's with the money guys. They're all freaking.

SCULLY: Well, we need to talk to him right away about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow. He scanned her body and he created a character out of her. He put her in the game.

(MULDER notices the LONE GUNMEN on a monitor standing in the game pace.)

MULDER: What are they doing?

PHOEBE: Oh...

MULDER: The Lone Gunmen are on the floor.

PHOEBE: Yeah, Langly and I wrote a software patch. We're going to run a rez-up test on the game.

SCULLY: What for?

PHOEBE: To bypass the problem.

(On the monitor, they watch as the scene shifts from blank white room, to the game street scene.)

SCULLY: Hey...

MULDER: What just happened?

PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know.

MULDER: They're in the game.

(In the game, the LONE GUNMEN are panicking.)

LONE GUNMEN: (on the monitor) Hey! What's going on?! Phoebe, are you paying attention? We're not ready yet! Who's running the program? What the hell's going on? Phoebe? Come on.

PHOEBE: I don't believe this. The program's running itself. This can't be happening.

(PHOEBE is typing. Sound of gunfire. The GUNMEN run for cover.)

SCULLY: Somebody's shooting at them.

PHOEBE: This was supposed to be background only. There wasn't supposed to be any gameplay.

MULDER: They need help.

(MULDER walks out of the room. SCULLY watches him.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

CUT TO:

(Game entry room.)

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: T-minus 10 seconds to engagement. ]

COMPUTERIZED VOICE: 9 ... 8 ... 7 ... 6 ... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... Engage.

(Camera pans up to show MULDER in full combat gear. Including large cod-piece and sleeveless shirt and big gun and dark sunglasses. He is holding a very large blaster. His arms are very nice.)

MULDER: Bring it on.

(The gate slides up and MULDER joins the GUNMEN behind one of the barricades. BYERS has a yellow paint blotch on his chest.)

MULDER: You guys okay?

FROHIKE: We've been better.

LANGLY: Byers's been hit.

BYERS: I'm okay. (he winces as a jolt of electricity hits him) It's a flesh wound.

FROHIKE: It's her. She's out there. She nailed Byers with that flintlock.

MULDER: Okay, on the count of three I'm going to lay down some cover for us. Ready? One... Two... Three.

(MULDER fires a cover of "bullets" as the GUNMEN run to the safety of the entry hatch.)

FROHIKE: Mulder!

(MULDER fires another volley.)

LANGLY: Get in the module!

(MAITREYA, wearing a black bodysuit, runs across the game area and into the lower area. MULDER watches her, then follows her.)

(In the control room, SCULLY and PHOEBE are watching.)

PHOEBE: What is he doing?

SCULLY: (exasperated) He's getting his ya-yas out.

(SCULLY heads for the game area.)

FROHIKE: Mulder!

LANGLY: It's suicide!

(MULDER runs into the area where the two previous victims found MAITREYA. She is waiting for him, lazily swinging her broadsword. He aims his rifle at her. She holds her sword in both hands above her head.)

MULDER: Put the sword down.

(MAITREYA swings the sword in a slow circle. As she does, her body disappears, then the sword does. She reappears behind him. He turns just as she swings. We hear a rapid volley of gunshots. The GUNMEN listen.)

FROHIKE: Mulder?

(Gunfire stops. The GUNMEN run for the area where MULDER disappeared. Halfway there, the image of the game digitizes, then goes to the plain room. Gunfire stops.)

PHOEBE: Oh, no.

(SCULLY enters the game area.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

(No answer. SCULLY looks around. She is worried.)

(SCULLY comes down the stairs into the gaming area.)

SCULLY: I said, where's Mulder? Maybe you guys didn't hear me. Come on, guys. Where is he?

LANGLY: We don't know. He just took off after her.

SCULLY: I saw what he did. But where did he go?

FROHIKE: He went into the building.

BYERS: He was firing his weapon.

SCULLY: I saw where he went. I want to know where he is. Is there a door? Or an exit? Or some kind of passageway that he could have used?

LANGLY: Just the one you came in.

FROHIKE: He should be right here.

BYERS: It's impossible. It's a digital environment. It's just a game.

(SCULLY wipes a bit of yellow paint off of BYERS' chest.)

SCULLY: Yeah. Easy for you to say.

(PHOEBE enters the room.)

PHOEBE: Agent Scully. I found him.

CUT TO:

(The control room. We see an fourth player's digital readout.)

PHOEBE: This monitors everyone playing the game. There-- player four. It's his telemetry.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

PHOEBE: Player four-- that's him.

BYERS: On the monitor.

FROHIKE: Right there.

SCULLY: Where?

PHOEBE: That's Mulder.

BYERS: He's alive.

FROHIKE: Those are his vitals.

LANGLY: He's still in the game.

SCULLY: Yes, but where's the game?

(No one has an answer.)

CUT TO:

(In the game, MULDER comes to on the ground. He is alone. He throws off his broken headset, gets up, looks at the sword imbedded in the wall next to him, then goes out into the main area, gun at the ready.)

MULDER: Frohike?! Langly?! Byers?!

(MAITREYA appears at the end of the street. She begins back-flipping toward him ala Blade Runner. At the last minute, MULDER fires at her. She flips over him and disappears. MULDER looks around.)

CUT TO:

(In the control room, the GUNNMEN are working on the computer. PHOEBE approaches them nervously.)

LANGLY: I think that's it.

PHOEBE: What are you doing?

FROHIKE: We're rerouting the circuitry.

LANGLY: Making a kill switch so we can shut down the game.

PHOEBE: Don't touch that. It won't work. There's no way to do that.

(IVAN enters the room, gazing adoringly at SCULLY.)

IVAN: We are back in business. Baby... You are dope.

SCULLY: What?

IVAN: We were toast. I felt the flames licking my ass. Then the bankers SAW THE LETTERS ON THE AUTOPSY: F-B-I. CAUSE OF DEATH: Unknown. (chuckles) You fixed our problems. The game's going to ship and we're going to be counting Franklins.

SCULLY: Yeah, and you're going to be counting teeth.

(SCULLY advances threateningly toward IVAN. The GUNMEN stop her.)

BYERS: Her partner's lost in the game.

IVAN: Lost?

SCULLY: The game has disappeared.

IVAN: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: Jade Blue Afterglow-- does that ring a bell?

(PHOEBE looks uncomfortable.)

IVAN: Jade Blue Afterglow?

SCULLY: Oh, you'd remember her.

(PHOEBE, in tears, has run out of the room. SCULLY follows her.)

SCULLY: Hey. Phoebe.

PHOEBE: I don't know how it happened.

SCULLY: You knew about her? Then it was you. You scanned that woman's body.

PHOEBE: Into my computer. She was my creation. She was mine.

SCULLY: But why?

PHOEBE: You don't know what it's like-- day in and day out choking in a haze of rampant testosterone.

SCULLY: I wouldn't be so sure.

PHOEBE: I mean, she was all I had to keep me sane. My only way to strike back as a woman. She was my goddess. Everything I can never be.

SCULLY: But, Phoebe, she is still a killer. I can't explain it, but she is. And you put her in that game.

PHOEBE: No, I didn't. I was creating my own game in my own computer. It was totally secret. I never told anyone. But somehow she jumped programs and she's feeding off the male aggression. It's making her stronger and stronger. I need your help. You're the only one who can understand.

SCULLY: You've got to destroy her, Phoebe.

PHOEBE: I don't know how.

SCULLY: Well, there's got to be some way. There's got to be some vulnerability or a weakness somewhere.

PHOEBE: She has no weakness anymore.

CUT TO:

(In the game, MULDER bangs on the door to the entry room.)

MULDER: Hey!

(He turns. MAITREYA approaches MULDER. He looks down at his gun. The digital display flashes "No Ammo". He lowers the gun and smiles charmingly at MAITREYA.)

MULDER: I bet you think you're going to kick my butt up and down the block.

(MAITREYA kicks his gun out of his hands.)

MULDER: Okay.

(She kicks him in the head.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. SCULLY rejoins the GUNMEN and IVAN.)

SCULLY: Her name is Maitreya.

IVAN: Maitreya?

SCULLY: She's input herself into the game. We have to download her.

BYERS: We can't even get on-line. The system's been hijacked.

LANGLY: The program won't respond.

(FROHIKE is looking at the computer readout for MULDER.)

SCULLY: Frohike, what's wrong? What is that?

FROHIKE: Mulder's vitals are wiggy.

SCULLY: What?

FROHIKE: They're all over the map.

(PHOEBE enters. IVAN advances toward her.)

IVAN: This is your fault. You put her here.

(SCULLY steps between IVAN and PHOEBE.)

SCULLY: Hey. No fair picking on a girl.

CUT TO:

(The game. MAITREYA kicks MULDER in the head. He is bleeding. As she goes for him again, MULDER grabs her foot and throws her to the ground. She has an almost satisfied look on her face. Meanwhile, MULDER runs back to the lower level where he first met her. He pulls the broadsword out of the wall then .... The scene shifts, and he is now standing in an Old West ghost town, complete with rolling tumble weeds.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. LANGLY gets the computer to respond.)

LANGLY: We're back on-line.

(Monitor shows static.)

SCULLY: There's no picture.

PHOEBE: No. We're just in rez up.

IVAN: No, there's something wrong.

(Old West scene shows on the monitor.)

SCULLY: That's not the game.

PHOEBE: Yes, it is. It's level two.

BYERS: How did that happen?

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

LANGLY: Mulder's in level one.

(Different view of the scene shows MULDER standing in the middle of the street.)

FROHIKE: No, he's right there.

SCULLY: Shut the game down.

IVAN: No, no, no, no. I can't.

SCULLY: Well, just turn it off!

BYERS: Power down, Langly.

(Langly tries to enter the command.)

LANGLY: The computer's not responding.

SCULLY: Look! We have to get him out of there!

FROHIKE: Yeah, and quick.

(On the monitor, we see MAITREYA, now wearing chaps and a halter and carrying pistols. She is walking up behind MULDER. SCULLY is very concerned.)

CUT TO:

(In the game. MULDER turns to see MAITREYA approaching. He raises his sword.)

MULDER: Whoa! Stop right there!

(MAITREYA whips out the pistols. MULDER drops his sword to the ground.)

MULDER: That's not really fair, is it?

(MAITREYA replicates. There are now five of her.)

MULDER: Well, that's just cheating.

(Behind him, the entry door slides open. Camera pans up SCULLY's body. She is now in full game combat gear and carrying a rifle almost as big as she is. MULDER stares at her in awe and maybe something else. MAITREYA looks a little nervous. SCULLY does not look nervous. SCULLY runs out of the entry room and stands behind the metal barricade. All the MAITREYAS begin firing at SCULLY. SCULLY returns fire with her laser blaster. MULDER hits the dirt. One after the other, the MAITREYAS spin and disappear as SCULLY destroys them.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. The GUNMEN and IVAN and PHOEBE are watching the scene on the monitor.)

FROHIKE: Go, girl!

BYERS: Oh... Scully's on fire!

LANGLY: The bloodthirst is unquenchable.

FROHIKE: Are you witnessing this?

IVAN: Oh, yeah.

BYERS: Scully's in the zone.

IVAN: Clearly.

LANGLY: What's wrong?

PHOEBE: This is level two. It only gets harder.

IVAN: No one's ever beaten level two.

CUT TO:

(In the game. MULDER stands up as SCULLY runs forward to join him.)

SCULLY: You okay?

MULDER: Ask me if I'm humiliated.

(They both look back at the sound of the entry room door sliding shut. They run for it. MULDER slides the sword under it just as it closes. A few feet away, another armed MAITREYA dressed in black appears. SCULLY faces her as MULDER tries to pry the door open.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(MULDER looks up as seven more MAITREYAS appear. He ducks down and keeps trying to pry open the door as SCULLY answers the MAITREYAS' gunfire. She is blowing them away. As they die, they spin like penny arcade figures.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. They are still watching MULDER and SCULLY's progress.)

BYERS: This is nuts.

FROHIKE: They'll never make it.

LANGLY: How do you kill something that won't die?

(PHOEBE takes over the keyboard.)

PHOEBE: Try and stop me, Ivan.

IVAN: My whole life is in this game.

FROHIKE: What are you trying to do?

PHOEBE: Stay out of this.

IVAN: She's gonna destroy it!

PHOEBE: It's the only way to save them.

(IVAN, PHOEBE, and FROHIKE are fighting for the keyboard.)

FROHIKE: Let it go! Both of you!

LANGLY: You can save them?

PHOEBE: There's a kill command.

IVAN: It kills the whole game.

BYERS: You knew about this?

IVAN: She knew about it, too.

FROHIKE: You said it wouldn't work.

IVAN: She was trying to save her creation; her Goddess.

PHOEBE: Well, you don't care who dies as long as your game survives.

BYERS: Our friends are in there.

LANGLY: And we're not going to let them die.

(Fight resumes for the keyboard.)

CUT TO:

(In the game. MULDER keeps trying to pry open the door. SCULLY kills off the last of the MAITREYAS. Gunfire stops. Then a WWII tank appears with a MAITREYA dressed as a soldier straddling the gun barrel.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(SCULLY blows up the tank. Another appears.)

CUT TO:

(Control room. FROHIKE gets the keyboard.)

FROHIKE: Give me that! This is out of your hands now.

BYERS: We have to shut down the program.

LANGLY: You're the only ones that can do it.

(PHOEBE and IVAN stare at each other.)

BYERS: They can't keep this up.

LANGLY: Scully's running out of ammo.

(Sound of gunfire continues on the monitor. IVAN shakes his head, pleading with PHOEBE.)

FROHIKE: What's the command?

IVAN: Don't do it, Phoebe. I'm so close.

CUT TO:

(In the game, SCULLY destroys another tank. Another appears.)

CUT TO:

(Control room.)

BYERS: The command.

LANGLY: Give it to him.

(Pause. PHOEBE looks sadly at IVAN. He shakes his head.)

PHOEBE: Shift-alt-bloodbath.

(FROHIKE rapidly types it in. Sound of gunfire stops. The game imaging goes to static, then stops. IVAN stares at the monitors in horror. Sad piano music. The GUNMEN and PHOEBE enter the playing area. It is empty.)

BYERS: Oh, my God.

(CLOSED CAPTIONING: What have we done?)

LANGLY: We've killed the game and Mulder and Scully along with it.

PHOEBE: Over here!

(PHOEBE finds the discarded laser rifle in front of the entry doors. She runs to it along with the GUNMEN.)

PHOEBE: Scully!

GUNMEN: Mulder! Mulder! Scully!

(PHOEBE and the GUNMEN manually raise the entry doors. MULDER and SCULLY, exhausted, are lying on their backs. They both have yellow paint marks on their chests and SCULLY's hair is very floofy. They sit up. MULDER smiles.)

MULDER: (happily) That's entertainment!

(SCULLY glances at him. In slow motion, the GUNMEN help MULDER and SCULLY up and together they walk out of the area under the monologue, which according to the closed captioning, originally belonged to Scully. SCULLY arches her neck tiredly. MULDER takes off his glasses.)

MULDER: We came, we saw, we conquered. And if the taste of victory is sweet, the taste of virtual victory is not Sweet 'N Low, nor the bullets made of sugar. Maybe out past where the imagination ends our true natures lie, waiting to be confronted on their own terms. Out where the intellect is at war with the primitive brain in the hostile territory of the digital world where laws are silent and rules disappear in the midst of arms. Born in anarchy with an unquenchable bloodthirst we shudder to think what might rise up from the darkness.

(In the control room, a depressed IVAN is slumped over a desk. One of the monitors is active however. A screen appears - "Data Acquisition." He looks up and smiles in amazement at the image of a new digital character that has appeared. She is wearing MAITREYA's leather thong outfit and has short red hair. She points her gun at the screen, and the camera pans around her. Why yes, it is Digital!Scully! IVAN chuckles and spins his chair. He is very, very, pleased.)

[THE END]

                           THEEF



SCENE 1
MARIN COUNTY, CALIFORNIA

(Late evening. A very nice mansion, huge staircase and chandelier in the entry hall. DR. ROBERT WIEDER and his family, are returning from an awards banquet. They are formally dressed and very playful and happy, but also tired from the night's activities. DR. WIEDER is about 50. He is warm and charming.)

DR. WIEDER: Jell-o salad with little pear chunks. It's the Wednesday special at the hospital cafeteria. I can't escape it.

(NAN WIEDER is a lovely, gracious woman. She looks about 40. She teases her husband affectionately.)

MRS. WIEDER: Listen to you. That didn't stop you from eating my dessert.

DR. WIEDER: Well, all right, the profiteroles weren't bad.

(DR. WIEDER resets the house alarm.)

DR. WIEDER: You didn't want me to starve, did you?

(His daughter, LUCY, enters. She looks about twenty. She is carrying a large, heavy engraved glass award.)

LUCY: He ate mine, too. Daddy, why don't you take this before my arm falls off?

DR. WIEDER: Thanks, honey.

(He takes it from her and mock groans at the weight.)

DR. WIEDER: Oh.

(IRVING, MRS. WIEDER's father, follows them into the house. He is holding a camera. He holds it up.)

IRVING: Everybody... One last shot.

(The other three reluctantly pose at the bottom of the staircase.)

MRS. WIEDER: Oh, Dad, do you think we could draw the line at 600 photographs?

IRVING: 601. Quit griping. And hold up that eyesore, Robert. God knows when you're going to win another one.

(IRVING sets the camera on a table and begins focusing.)

DR. WIEDER: Irv, you want to think about staying the night? It's awful late to head back to the city.

IRVING: (smiling) What, I get to stay at the home of the Bay Area Doctor of the Year? It's a deal.

(IRVING sets the timer on the camera and goes to stand behind the others. He rests his arm proudly on DR. WIEDER's back.)

IRVING: Proud of you, Robert. (indicating the award) Up, hold it up. Say, "cheese."

(The camera takes the picture.)

(Later, DR. and MRS. WIEDER are getting into bed. MRS. WIEDER is reading the awayd.)

MRS. WIEDER: "Presented to Dr. Robert Wieder, M.D. For the great wisdom skill and compassion he exhibits in the practice of medicine." (she kisses his head) Going to look awfully nice in your office. What are you thinking?

DR. WIEDER: How this is just the cherry on top. How lucky I am.

(They gaze lovingly at each other. They kiss and he sets the award on the nightstand.)

CUT TO:

(Guest room. IRVING is getting ready for bed. He turns the sheets down and is surprised to see a small human shape made out of dirt on the sheet. He brushes at the dirt, smearing the figure. He turns in shock to the MAN standing behind him. The MAN is tall, stringy graying hair, and disturbing eyes. He is not here to read IRVING a bedtime story.)

CUT TO:

(Later that evening. DR. and MRS WIEDER are asleep. They are wakened by a beep from the alarm panel in their room. DR. WIEDER gets up to check it. The motion sensor in zone 1 has been activated.)

MRS. WIEDER: What is it?

DR. WIEDER: The downstairs motion sensor.

MRS. WIEDER: You think Dad tripped the alarm?

DR. WIEDER: The alarm hasn't been tripped. You got me. I'm going to check it out.

(He goes downstairs and sees IRVING at the bottom of the staircase.)

DR. WIEDER: Irv? Irving? Is everything all right?

(He reaches out and touches IRVING's shoulder. IRVING rotates toward him. We now see that he is hanging by the neck from the ornate chandelier two stories above. DR. WIEDER stumbles back in horror. He pushes the alarm panel panic button, then stares at the wall behind IRVING's body. Crudely written in what looks like blood is the word "TheeF.")

SCENE 2

(MULDER and SCULLY are in the house looking at the crime scene. MULDER is looking at the word on the wall. SCULLY, in black, walks up behind him.)

MULDER: What do you think, Scully, is this a name, possibly? Or a code, or an anagram?

SCULLY: "T-h-e-e-f." I assume it's supposed to be t-h-I-e-f-- "thief."

MULDER: Insert your own Dan Quayle joke here.

(SCULLY gives him a small smile.)

MULDER: Lousy spelling aside, what do you think it refers to? Who's the thief?

SCULLY: Well, that's certainly one question. I've got many.

MULDER: "Mulder, why are we here?"

SCULLY: To be fair, I might have used the words "Mulder, how is this an X-File?"

MULDER: You see that, Scully, you always keep me guessing.

(He smiles, clicks his tounge, and walks over to the end of the cable still suspended from the chandelier. The body has already been removed.)

MULDER: This is Dr. Irving Thalbro, age 66. Found hanged with his throat cut. His family tucked away and in bed not 40 feet from here didn't see or hear anything.

SCULLY: Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them.

MULDER: Except they're the ones that called it in and there's no evidence whatsoever to link them to the crime.

SCULLY: Which is why the police are rightly wondering if Dr. Thalbro killed himself.

MULDER: (standing behind her, pointing to the word on the wall) Except who, then, did this? Blood pattern doesn't indicate that the good doctor did it, who I am assuming could read and write above a fourth-grade level.

SCULLY: I'll admit, Mulder this is not an open and shut case. But, uh  (whispering back over her shoulder)  it doesn't make it an X-File.

MULDER: (whispering mysteriously back at her) Oh, there is one detail that does.

(He heads upstairs. She follows.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY In the guest room that IRVING used. MULDER shows SCULLY the smeared dirt on the bed. She has her hands on her hips.)

MULDER: This.

SCULLY: Dirt?

MULDER: Dirt. It's a very powerful component of hexcraft. As well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged. Check this out.

(They use his flashlight to look closely at the smeared shape.)

MULDER: Looks like a human form.

SCULLY: (sighs) Hexcraft, as in, uh, putting a curse on someone? Murdering them magically?

(MULDER begins putting some of the dirt into an evidence bag.)

MULDER: Yeah, that's what it looks like to me. Now, I know what you're going to say, Scully.

SCULLY: No, hexcraft. I mean, I'll buy that as the intent here. It certainly jibes with the evidence. I say we talk to the family.

(SCULLY walks to the door, then looks over her shoulder at a stunned MULDER who is still kneeling next to the bed.)

SCULLY: I'll always keep you guessing.

(MULDER chuckles.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY are interviewing DR. WIEDER. MRS. WIEDER and LUCY are sitting together on the couch. All three are still very upset.)

DR. WIEDER: It was probably the greatest night of my life. Until...

SCULLY: Sir, can you think of any enemies that your father-in-law might have made? Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice or a business dealing, perhaps?

DR. WIEDER: Everybody loved Irving. Everyone who knew him. He was... (voice breaking, looks at his wife) No. I can't conceive of it.

MULDER: Dr. Wieder, do you have any enemies?

(DR. WIEDER looks up in shock.)

MULDER: I'm sorry, I have to ask. There was a message left behind. If it doesn't refer to your father-in-law, it may refer to you.

LUCY: (crying) "Theef?" Are you asking if my Dad's a thief? He saves people's lives. He's a good man.

(MRS. WIEDER holds her.)

DR. WIEDER: Honey...

(He turns back to MULDER and SCULLY.)

DR. WIEDER: If I have any enemies I don't know them.



SCENE 3
FOSTER CITY, CALIFORNIA

(Old run down house with a sign out front advertising "Rooms for Rent. 555-5208?" Inside, the LANDLADY, 50ish, a bit overweight, is pushing a carpet sweeper. She keeps one hand on her lower back and has a slightly pained grimace. The television is on.)

FEMALE REPORTER ON TV: ..at the home of his son-in-law. Dr. Robert Wieder, Dr. Irving Thalbro was found hanged at 1:48 this morning. Though details are sketchy, it's my understanding that police are treating the case as a murder. This is due in part to clues or evidence left at the scene according to spokesman Dan Merkin who will only characterize them as bizarre or ritualistic. Though Dr. Thalbro's family was in the house at the time of his death, they apparently are not...

(The LANDLADY sniffs the air and goes to one of the doors in the hall. She knocks.)

LANDLADY: Hello? Mr. Peattie?

(Under the door, she sees the shadow of someone standing in the room.)

LANDLADY: Mr. Peattie, I know you're in there. Are you cooking? You aren't supposed to be cooking.

(The MAN from the TEASER, ORAL PEATTIE, opens the door a crack.)

LANDLADY: You aren't supposed to be cooking.

(PEATTIE has a thick southern mountain accent.)

PEATTIE: That smell like something you want to eat?

LANDLADY: Well, what is it, then?

PEATTIE: Medicine.

LANDLADY: Oh, all right, uh... just so long as you're not cooking.

PEATTIE: Seems like you could use yourself a poultice for your back. Old Peattie fix you right up. Be ready later.

(He closes the door. In his room, the camera pans across assorted containers holding various liquids and herbs. PEATTIE is muttering under his breath as he stitches together a small, crudely shaped cloth doll figure. Another doll figure lies completed on the table and another dangles nearby from a string tied around it's neck.)



SCENE 4

(A car pulls up in front of the Marin County Morgue. MC Morgue. MULDER joins SCULLY where she is examining part of IRVING's brain in the microscope.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully.

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

MULDER: This dirt we found? Gas chromatograph shows pronounced spikes of methane and sulphur compounds - the signature of decay. It's graveyard dirt. Also known as conjure dust. It's one of the most powerful hexing elements whether for good or evil, not the kind of stuff you want to be on the wrong end of.

SCULLY: Uh-huh.

MULDER: (suggestively) Go ahead, Scully, keep me guessing.

SCULLY: (finally looking up at him) Kuru.

MULDER: (laughing) The, the, the, uh... the disease that New Guinea tribesmen get?

SCULLY: From eating the brains of their relatives.

MULDER: And I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad.

SCULLY: Practically speaking, Mulder, Kuru doesn't even exist anymore. Not in New Guinea and certainly not in the U.S. But this man's cerebellum and his striatum clearly show signs of it, Mulder. I mean, these... these amyloid plaques? His brain is riddled with them.

MULDER: Kuru makes you crazy, right?

SCULLY: Yeah, stark raving, among other things but in this case, stark raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself.

(MULDER shakes his head dismissively.)

SCULLY: Mulder, that's what his autopsy shows. From the wound pattern to the blood spray... this man did it to himself, there's no question.

MULDER: Unless... it was inflicted upon him. The graveyard dirt, the hex. He was given this disease so that he would kill himself.

(SCULLY considers it.)



SCENE 5
9:17 PM

(WIEDER house. MRS. WIEDER is upstairs in her nightgown. She notices a picture frame askew on the wall. The picture is missing. She takes it off the wall and looks at it. DR. WIEDER calls to her from downstairs.)

DR WEIDER: Nan? Honey?

MRS. WIEDER: Robert? Look at this.

(As she goes downstairs with the frame, we see PEATTIE hiding in one of the upstairs rooms, watching her. He is holding the missing picture.)

MRS. WIEDER: Who would've taken that?

DR. WIEDER: The police probably. Could be they needed it as evidence.

(DR. WIEDER seems unconcerned. MRS. WIEDER is nervous.)

CUT TO:

(Another part of the house. PEATTIE has cut out MRS. WIEDER's face from the picture and is tucking it inside one of the doll figures that he made. He puts what looks like a strand of blonde hair that he was holding in his mouth inside the doll also. He hears the WEIDERs entering their bedroom.)

MRS. WIEDER: That's not what I'm afraid of.

DR. WIEDER: Then you have nothing to worry about. ... a good night's sleep.

MRS. WIEDER: I'm telling you, I'm scared. I can't stay here, Robert. I can't live in this house anymore. Lucy can't. Not after what's happened here. And now this picture of us is missing.

DR. WIEDER: It'll turn up.

MRS. WIEDER: No. Doesn't make any sense. Nothing that's happened here makes any sense.

DR. WIEDER: (comforting her) It does. Nan... listen to me. Your Dad was ill. He had a kind of progressive dementia. That's what the FBI autopsy showed. I reviewed their findings, and I have to agree. Honey... we will get through this.

(DR. WIEDER goes to the bed and turns down the sheets on her side of the bed. Another dirt figure is on the bed. DR. WIEDER stares at it, then turns just as MRS. WIEDER collapses on the floor and begins convulsing. He runs to her.)

DR. WIEDER: Oh, my God! Nan? Honey?

(MRS. WIEDER's face and neck suddenly break out in black hives. She is having trouble breathing.)

DR. WIEDER: Oh, my god. Nan!

(LUCY comes to the bedroom door.)

LUCY: Dad?

DR. WIEDER: Lucy, call 911.

(LUCY is frozen in shock.)

DR. WIEDER: Call 911!

(LUCY runs to a phone.)

DR. WIEDER: Nan!

CUT TO:

(Outside the house, PEATTIE is sitting next to the steaming Jacuzzi next to the crystal blue pool. He holds the doll close to his lips as her mutters to it.)



SCENE 6
USF MEDICAL CENTER
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

(Next morning. DR. WIEDER is standing next to MRS. WIEDER's bed. She is hooked up to monitors. Her skin is mottled, swollen. She is unconscious. MULDER opens the door.)

MULDER: Dr. Wieder?

(DR. WIEDER joins MULDER and SCULLY in the hall.)

SCULLY: We understand you've made a diagnosis.

DR. WIEDER: Diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. Old world type.

(SCULLY stares at him in surprise.)

MULDER: I take it that's rare.

SCULLY: In San Francisco? It's unheard of. Maybe in... in Central Africa...

MULDER: Maybe the rarer, the better.

DR. WIEDER: What do you mean by that?

MULDER: Someone directed this to happen to your wife, just as someone directed what happened to your father-in-law.

DR. WIEDER: My enemy you were talking about. The one who thinks I'm a thief.

(DR. WIEDER looks at SCULLY.)

DR WIEDER: Agent, you're a doctor. Explain to your partner that no one can "direct" a person to get sick.

(Fortunately, MULDER saves her from having to answer that.)

MULDER: The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body. That's indicative of folk magic. That's what I believe is being used against you.

DR. WIEDER: Folk magic. You mean like Baba Yaga... Gypsies.

MULDER: I was actually thinking less Eastern and more Celtic.

(SCULLY glances at him.)

MULDER: Maybe... Scots-Irish or Appalachian, even.

DR. WIEDER: I'm supposed to take this seriously?

SCULLY: Sir, regardless of the particulars I think it's clear that there was an intruder in your home and I think it would be prudent for you to accept our protection and help us to identify this person.

DR. WIEDER: Prudent for me would be to continue treating my wife.

MULDER: If we don't stop who's causing this, your treatments won't matter.

DR. WIEDER: So... modern medicine, and all it encompasses-- artificial hearts, laser surgery gene therapy, to name a few-- all of that arrayed against a pile of magic dirt... and you tell me I'll lose.

(Pause. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

DR. WIEDER: I have MRIs to look at.

(DR. WIEDER leaves the hall.)

SCULLY: Oh, yeah, Mulder, win him over.

MULDER: Oh, he will lose unless we can find a way to stop it.

SCULLY: What do you suggest?

MULDER: A second opinion.

CUT TO:

(MRI viewing room. DR WIEDER is looking in shock at pictures of his wife's brain. All the images have the word "TheeF" visible on the brain. He turns at the sound of PEATTIE chuckling in the doorway.)

PEATTIE: Truth always hurts, don't it, Doc?

DR. WIEDER: Who are you?

(No answer.)

DR. WIEDER: Is this you? You did this? What do you want from me?

PEATTIE: Oh, don't you be fretting none about that. I gettin' my nickel's worth. You're doing a fine job so far.

DR. WIEDER: What the hell are you talking about? What is this all about?

PEATTIE: Lynette Peattie. And don't you be saying you don't recollect her, uh-uh! No, no, no.

DR. WIEDER: Look, if I've done anything to upset you, I... It's no use trying to intimidate me if I don't know how I've offended you. Tell me! What makes me a thief?

PEATTIE: You be a smart man. I figure... you ponder it awhile, it gonna come to you.

(PEATTIE rests his head against the door jamb, then leaves the room. DR. WIEDER hesitates a moment, then runs after him.)

DR. WIEDER: Wait!

(The hall is empty. PEATTIE is nowhere to be seen.)



SCENE 7

(Later. DR. WIEDER is with a hospital RECORDS CLERK who is looking up files on LYNETTE PEATTIE for him.)

TECH: No, no matter how I spell it, there's no Lynette Peattie.

DR. WIEDER: She's not in my patient file?

TECH: She's not in any doctor's patient file. No one by that name has ever been admitted to the hospital. You think you treated her?

DR. WIEDER: What about Jane Does?

(The TECH pulls up the files dated "Dec 15, 1997; Mar 28 1999; Oct 7, 1999.")

TECH: You treated three in the last two years.

DR. WIEDER: Pull the files, please.

(Later, DR. WIEDER is looking at the files. One of them listing the time of death as 13:58, contains a plastic bag containing a small strip of fabric with crude lettering on it. "Flax-hair lamb. TheeF of mine heart." DR. WIEDER takes a deep breath.)



SCENE 8

(The rooming house. In his room PEATTIE is muttering over his shoulder as he works on another doll. Cut out pictures of DR. WIEDER and LUCY are lying on the table.)

PEATTIE: You remember old Boon, I know you do. This mangy old ugly dog.. Smart! People-smart... and then some. Oh, he sure did love you. He crawled up under that house the very day you left... Wouldn't come out for nothin'. Not no ham bone, nothin'. He just knew that his life was over. You stole his heart, too. Oh, you shouldn't oughta left.

(He hears footsteps approaching and goes to the door and opens it quickly, startling the LANDLADY.)

LANDLADY: (nervously) Oh, you're there. I'm... wanted to thank you. That poultice... worked a miracle on my back. I was about to knock and... and ask if I could get a little more.

(PEATTIE goes to a drawer near the door and refills the poultice and hands it to her.)

LANDLADY: Whatever that is it sure is stinky.

PEATTIE: Stinky's good.

(He closes the door.)



SCENE 9
VALAENCIA AND 10TH
SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA

(Door opens into a mystic and herbal shop. A magical looking seal with a pentagram is on the floor near the door. Camera shows two pairs of feet entering, one male, one in very nice heels. MULDER and SCULLY stop at the seal, then both walk around it. Very funny.)

PROPRIETER: Good afternoon. Can I help you?

MULDER: Yeah, we're looking for some alternative medical advice.

PROPRIETER: Oh, well, you've come to the right place. I get a lot of folks fed up with their HMOs. . SCULLY: Well, actually, we're not here for us.

(MULDER pulls out the evidence bag containing the dirt collected from the WIEDER house. The PROPRIETER holds up her hand.)

PROPRIETER: Whoa, Chief... back in your pocket.

SCULLY: It's dirt.

PROPRIETER: It's goofer dust is what it is. I don't know what your intentions are with that.

SCULLY: Goofer dust?

MULDER: Conjure dust... Goofer dust. How would you go about making somebody sick using that?

(The PROPRIETER looks at them suspiciously. MULDER holds up his badge.)

MULDER: We're investigating a murder. That's why I'm asking.

PROPRIETER: Oh... Speaking strictly in the academic sense you'd spread it on or near your victim to direct misfortune.

MULDER: So you could give them any illness you wanted? One that you chose specifically for them?

PROPRIETER: Oh... that's a lot trickier. It requires something special.

(The PROPRIETER goes to another part of the store and gets out a packaged small red cloth doll figure. It is similar in size and shape to what PEATTIE makes, but these are machine made.)

SCULLY: (skeptically) A voodoo doll.

PROPRIETER: No, they're called "poppets". Inside you place three thorns of a blood red rose, a strand of hair and a photo of your victim. Maybe other items as well. It depends on the operator. You sew it up, say your spell.

MULDER: How would you counteract one of these?

PROPRIETER: It depends on who you're dealing with. But if the person you're looking for is powerful enough to bring about a murder he's probably charmed.

SCULLY: Which would mean what?

PROPRIETER: It means just that. He's drawing on the energy of a charm. A source of magic power... It could be any item provided that it's very important to him. Something that holds great meaning for him and unless you can separate him from his charm, you're out of luck.

(SCULLY looks up at MULDER who nods.)



SCENE 10
USF MEDICAL CENTER
9:10 PM

(Hospital break room. A MED STUDENT is sitting at a table. PEATTIE is looking intently at the food vending machine. He stops the machine when he sees a bag of microwave popcorn.)

PEATTIE: Poppin' corn.

(PEATTIE tries to open the door to get the snack. The MED STUDENT looks up, obviously thinking that this guy is weird.)

TECH: You got to put the money in first.

(PEATTIE puts money in the machine and gets the popcorn. He look at it suspiciously.)

PEATTIE: Don't look like no poppin' corn to me.

TECH: Put it in the microwave... then you get your popcorn.

PEATTIE: Oh, microwave. I heard tell of such a thing. It's a true wonder.

(PEATTIE puts the bag into the microwave and pushes the buttons to start it cooking.)

PEATTIE: Radiation... comes from the heart of the atom. I think it be God's own glow.

(He looks up at the window to the hall. DR. WIEDER and LUCY are passing.)

CUT TO:

(DR WIEDER leading his daughter, LUCY, into the MRI machine room. She is nervous.)

DR. WIEDER: Honey, she's doing much better. Come see for yourself. You're going to be very happy, I promise. The drug therapy I'm giving her is working wonders. Come on. Come see.

(LUCY goes to her mother, MRS. WIEDER, who is lying on a table, ready to be put into the machine. She looks tired, but not too bad.)

LUCY: Mom.

MRS. WIEDER: Hi, Sweetie.

LUCY: You look good.

MRS. WIEDER: Yeah, right. But I am definitely feeling better.

(She looks up at her husband.)

MRS. WIEDER: So how come I have to go through this thing again?

DR. WIEDER: Come on. This thing gives off about as much radiation as a dental x- ray. Nothing to worry about.

MRS. WIEDER: I know, still scares me. Wish me luck?

(LUCY smiles.)

CUT TO:

(In the break room, PEATTIE gets the steaming bag of popcorn out of the microwave. He glances over his shoulder to make sure the MED STUDENT is not watching him. He takes a poppet out of his pocket and makes sure a picture of MRS. WIEDER is tucked inside. He places it inside the microwave and starts the machine.)

CUT TO:

(MRI room. MRS. WIEDER is put into the machine and the hammering sound begins.))

CUT TO:

(In the break room, the poppet continues "cooking" in the microwave.)

CUT TO:

(MRI room. In the tube, MRS. WIEDER feels something wrong.)

CUT TO:

(In the break room, the poppet begins to smoke inside the microwave.)

CUT TO:

(In the MRI room, the TECH notices something wrong. MRS. WIEDER's feet are shaking violently.)

RADIOLOGY TECH: Doctor!

DR. WIEDER: Switch it off. Switch it off!

(The machine is turned off and DR. WIEDER runs and pulls his wife out of the machine. She is dead, burned to a crisp. DR. WIEDER touches her, then recoils from the heat of her burned skin. He stares speechlessly in horror at her dead body.)

CUT TO:

(In the break room, PEATTIE removes the smoking poppet from the microwave and looks at the picture. The picture is unharmed.)

PEATTIE: All done.



SCENE 11

(In his house, DR. WIEDER is staring at the last picture taken of his family. He is crying. MULDER and SCULLY stand nest to him.)

DR. WIEDER: How could somebody orchestrate all of this?

SCULLY: You believe that your wife was murdered?

DR. WIEDER: It was no accident. There was no malfunction of the machine. Yes, I believe she was murdered.

MULDER: And you still have no idea why?

(DR. WIEDER doesn't answer. MULDER pulls out a picture of MRS. WIEDER's burned corpse. The word "TheeF" is branded into the chest.)

MULDER: The pathologist found this branded into your wife's chest.

SCULLY: Sir, we can't help you if you withhold information from us.

(After a pause, DR. WIEDER gets up and begins pacing.)

DR. WIEDER: A man came to see me yesterday. My age, older, maybe. Tall. He mentioned someone named Lynette Peattie. I didn't know who she was at first. Turns out she was a Jane Doe I treated last October. She was in a bus rollover. Came in amid a wave of victims. She was the worst off. I could barely put fluids in fast enough to keep up with the blood loss. (his voice cracks) We were rushing around, triaging people. Everybody knew she was dying. Was only a matter of time. And she was in agony.

(Listening to this is painful for SCULLY. DR. WIEDER gets the chart on the girl.)

DR. WIEDER: This was my course of treatment.

(He hands SCULLY the chart. The girl was in bad shape. It indicates that 25 ccs of Morphine was administered.)

SCULLY: You gave her morphine. Lots of it.

DR. WIEDER: I pushed it myself. She kept screaming... and her heart rate kept climbing. So... I kept pushing.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at him sympathetically.)

DR. WIEDER: I took maybe the last 20 minutes of her life. It was a fair trade to make for the pain.

MULDER: Her father doesn't agree.

SCULLY: What makes you think it's her father?

MULDER: He thinks you robbed him of his family, and that's why he's systematically robbing you of yours.

DR. WIEDER: What am I supposed to do? My... my daughter Lucy.

MULDER: You don't do anything. You let us find a way to protect you.

DR. WIEDER: How?

MULDER: I have an idea where to start.



SCENE 12
MUNICIPAL CEMETERY
OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA

(This has to be the most depressing graveyard in North America. A small patch of land surrounded by interstate contains several dozen simple graves. A backhoe is working to excavate one of the graves. MULDER and SCULLY are both carrying umbrellas as they walk to the scene. Her umbrella fits completely under his. Adorable image.)

SCULLY: If Lynette Peattie was Carlos the Jackal I would've had an easier time tracking her down. There's no birth certificate, no social security number, nothing.

MULDER: Better known to the world as "Jane Doe 6149."

SCULLY: Her name shows up once in the records of a Vista inoculation program-- 1981. The Allegheny mountains of West Virginia.

MULDER: Deepest Appalachia.

SCULLY: That's when her father, one Oral Peattie refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio. But there's no address for him. There's no record of him whatsoever. So, Mulder, why are we exhuming this girl?

MULDER: Well, I'm thinking of her dear old backwoods Dad and where he gets all his graveyard dirt.

SCULLY: Here? His daughter's grave?

MULDER: The cultists we spoke to said that the person casting these magic spells was charmed. That he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him and he kept it close by.

SCULLY: Lynette Peattie's body.

MULDER: That's my guess. So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in the Bay Area, he remains powerful. But if we were to ship it off to Quantico...

(The coffin has been raised out of the ground. MULDER and SCULLY go up to it. MULDER hands his umbrella to SCULLY.)

MULDER: Hold that.

(MULDER opens the simple coffin. It is empty.)



SCENE 13

(Rooming house. The LANDLADY knocks at PEATTIE's door.)

LANDLADY: Mr. Peattie?! Mr. Peattie, my pain's back. I was wondering if I could get a little more of that poultice? Mr. Peattie?

(No answer. She is in pain. She takes her keyring out and opens the door and goes into the room. It still smells bad.)

LANDLADY: Phew.

(She goes to the drawer where she saw him get the ingredients. She turns quickly when she realizes there is someone lying in the bed.)

LANDLADY: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were home. I...

(The figure in the bed does not respond. She flips back the sheet on the bed exposing the decomposed corpse of a small woman. The LANDLADY screams and runs for the door. PEATTIE has arrived home and is standing in the way. She stares up at him in shock.)



SCENE 14

(DR. WIEDER's house. A sense of urgency is in the whole scene. MULDER is on his cell phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) All right, thank you. They'll be there before dark.

(He hangs up. DR. WIEDER and LUCY, carrying bags, are coming down the stairs followed by SCULLY who is checking her watch.)

MULDER: You all set?

DR. WIEDER: We still don't know where it is we're going?

MULDER: We rented a cabin for you. It's important that you get out of town.

DR. WIEDER: And you believe by our leaving will somehow weaken him?

SCULLY: Well, what's important is that he believes that. At any rate, if he can't find you he can't hurt you.

DR. WIEDER: How do you know he'll come forward?

MULDER: Because he hasn't gotten everything he wants.

(Both MULDER and DR. WIEDER glance at LUCY who looks very scared.)

(Outside the house, PEATTIE watches as SCULLY gets into a car. DR. WIEDER and LUCY are in the back seat. PEATTIE watches as they drive away.)



SCENE 15
11:23 PM

(WIEDER house. MULDER and a SECURITY GUARD are inside the house. (MULDER glances out the window. The SECURITY GUARD is looking at the news on television.)

TV ANCHOR: Our own John Gilnitz is on the scene.

JOHN GILNITZ THE TV REPORTER: San Mateo County health officials admit they're at a loss to explain the sudden onset of the 56-year-old woman's bizarre illness but insist there is no cause for alarm.

SECURITY GUARD: Pretty weird, huh?

(MULDER nods, watching the report.)

JOHN GILNITZ THE TV REPORTER: There has been no official diagnosis. Sources say they believe the woman contracted the rare, but deadly, group "A" streptococcus, better known as the "flesh-eating disease."

(On television, JOHN GILNITZ is standing outside the rooming house.)

SECURITY GUARD: Freakin' scary...

(The SECURITY GUARD turns just in time to see MULDER leaving through the French doors.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 16

(MULDER and POLICE burst into PEATTIE's room, guns and flashlights out. PEATTIE is not there. They look around. MULDER turns the sheet back on the bed. The corpse is still there, but the head is gone.)



SCENE 17
SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST

(A cabin in a remote area. SCULLY, DR. WIEDER, and LUCY are entering the cabin. SCULLY's cell phone rings. She answers it.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(MULDER is still in the rooming house.)

MULDER: (on phone) Peattie may be on to us.

SCULLY: (on phone) What happened?

MULDER: (on phone) I found out where he lives only he's cleared out, and he's taken his magic charm with him. At least as much of it as he can carry. My guess is he's looking for you.

(DR. WIEDER is embracing his daughter comfortingly.)

SCULLY: (on phone, quietly) I didn't see anybody following us.

MULDER: (on phone) Just keep an eye out, Scully. I'm on my way.

SCULLY: (on phone) Okay.

(She hangs up. She and the WIEDER's share a nervous glance.)

(Outside in the darkness behind the cabin, PEATTIE is hiding. He looks down at the now-severed decomposed head of his daughter.)

PEATTIE: Soon. Very soon.



SCENE 18

(Outside the cabin, PEATTIE is approaching the cabin. He stops at the car and uses his fist to break in the driver's side window.)

CUT TO:

(In the cabin. SCULLY is downstairs. DR. WIEDER and LUCY are up in the loft. They hear the sound of the car window breaking.. SCULLY turns and holds her gun pointed at the door.)

DR. WIEDER: (whispering) What was that?

SCULLY: Stay where you are.

(She walks over to the wall slowly and turns out the light.)

CUT TO:

(Outside, PEATTIE is looking through the car. In the console between the front seats, he finds SCULLY's clip-on badge. Umm, Scully? Don't leave your badge lying around.)

CUT TO:

(in the cabin. SCULLY finding a good location and holding her gun at the door of the cabin.)

CUT TO:

(PEATTIE finds a strand of red hair on the drivers seat. He places it inside a poppet along with SCULLY's picture.)

CUT TO:

(In the cabin. DR. WIEDER and LUCY are huddled together in the loft. SCULLY is watching the door.)

CUT TO:

(Outside, PEATTIE is mumbling to the poppet. He sticks two nails in the poppet's eyes.)

PEATTIE: ...Judas goat.

CUT TO:

(Inside the cabin. SCULLY gasps and puts her hand to her eyes.)

SCULLY: Oh! Oh, God!

DR. WIEDER: What is it?

SCULLY: (gasping in pain, disoriented) I don't know. I can't...

(She tries to see her hands in front of her face. Her eyes are completely white, as if she has thick cataracts.)

SCULLY: (panicked) I can't see.

(The door rattles.)

DR. WIEDER: Agent Scully!

SCULLY: Just stay where you are! Stay down.

(The door crashes open. Even though she can't see, SCULLY fires two shots at the doorway. She gasps as PEATTIE grabs her gun from her hand. She holds her hands up protectively. He places the gun on the newel post and starts up the stairs to the loft.)

PEATTIE: (taunting) Oh, doctor!

SCULLY: Leave him alone!

LUCY: Daddy!

(DR. WIEDER is standing protectively in front of his sobbing daughter. He is holding some kind of stick.)

DR. WIEDER: Get back. Get back! Don't make me hurt you!

PEATTIE: Can't hurt the man who ain't got nothing left. You know who I be now? Maybe you can recollect my daughter.

DR. WIEDER: I remember! I never forgot! I'm... I'm sorry for your loss but I did everything humanly possible to save her.

PEATTIE: You arrogant little man.

DR. WIEDER: I did everything I could! And when I couldn't do any more I eased her suffering!

PEATTIE: By killing her. If I be there... I save her!

DR. WIEDER: (yelling) You weren't there!

(These words hurt PEATTIE. Downstairs, SCULLY is frantically feeling around for her gun.)

PEATTIE: Buried her... in some field. Got no name. Far away from her people. That don't be right. So, now, little man... I gonna show you what be possible. (pointing to his own eyes) I gonna show you... an eye for an eye.

(PEATTIE is holding up a poppet and a knife.)

DR. WIEDER: You're not going to hurt my daughter!

LUCY: (crying) Daddy!

PEATTIE: Maybe.

(PEATTIE sticks the tip of the knife into the poppet's chest and begins twisting. DR. WIEDER suddenly collapses, groaning in pain.)

LUCY: Daddy! Daddy!

(Downstairs, SCULLY, still blinded, is still looking for her gun.)

SCULLY: Doctor... What's happening?

LUCY: (holding him) Daddy!

(DR. WIEDER is gasping as PEATTIE continues to twist the knife in the poppet.)

SCULLY: Dr. Wieder!

CUT TO:

(Outside the cabin. MULDER arrives. He looks in the car's broken window, then looks around and sees a poppet lying on a small human shaped figure made out of dirt. The poppet has two nails in its eyes.)

CUT TO:

(In the cabin. DR. WIEDER is moaning in pain.)

LUCY: (screaming) You're killing him! Oh, Daddy...

( Downstairs, SCULLY falls, looks up and blinks.)

LUCY: Stop! Daddy! Daddy!

(Sudden sound of a gunshot. PEATTIE collapses and falls downstairs. SCULLY, her eyesight back, lowers the gun as she watches him fall. MULDER enters the cabin, gun at the ready. The fire in the fireplace is blazing. He lowers the gun as SCULLY approaches him. He hold up the poppet for her. She looks at the two puncture holes in the poppet's eyes.)



SCENE 19
USF MEDICAL CENTER
10:23 AM

(Hospital room. MULDER and SCULLY stand next to PEATTIE's hospital bed. HE is intubated and unconscious, recovering from the gunshot wound.)

MULDER: Lynette Peattie's body is on its way back home to Indiola, West Virginia.

SCULLY: She's going back to her people after all. You know, Mulder, I would've made the same call... as a doctor... if I was certain that I couldn't save her life and she was in that much pain... I would've done what Wieder did.

MULDER: Mm-hmm. It seems pretty clear-cut.

SCULLY: Except maybe it's not.

MULDER: You're wondering if maybe Peattie could've saved her life?

(SCULLY looks at him, then leaves the room. MULDER watches her go then says softly TO HIMSELF: )

MULDER: You do keep me guessing.

(He looks back at PEATTIE, then follows SCULLY.)

[THE END]

                                  EN AMI



SCENE 1
GOOCHLAND, VIRGINIA

(An older model station wagon is driving along a rainy, rural road. CAMERON MCPECK is driving. His wife, IRENE and son, JASON are in the back seat. IRENE MCPECK holds JASON tightly. JASON is about 10 and looks sick.)

CAMERON MCPECK: Almost home now, Jason. What do we say?

IRENE MCPECK AND JASON MCPECK: (together) Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me.

CAMERON MCPECK: Keep your chin up, son. We'll get through this just fine.

(The car pulls up in front of a house. Lots of cars around. A crowd of people holding signs saying "Your faith is not an excuse to ...", "Save Jason", "Murder is illegal" and "You're not God". They are all yelling, protesting. SHERIFF's DEPUTIES hold them back from the car.)

REPORTER: (banging on the car window) How do you feel, Jason?

DEPUTIES: Back up, now... ...Boys, come on! Everybody back. Clear the car. Get back. Alan, you're in charge!

DEPUTY: Okay, folks, come on out. You're safe now, don't worry. Just step out and stay in front of me. We'll get you in your house.

CAMERON MCPECK: Come on, son.

(The DEPUTY escorts the family into a house.)

DEPUTY: Just stay in front of me.

(Later. Night. The rain is still coming down. JASON MCPECK's parents are putting him to bed. IRENE MCPECK sets a glass of water beside a small bell on the nightstand.)

IRENE MCPECK: There you go, sweetheart. If you need anything during the night... If you don't feel well you just ring that bell, okay?

JASON MCPECK: Okay, Mom.

IRENE MCPECK: Good night, Jason.

(She kisses his forehead. CAMERON MCPECK sits down beside his son.)

CAMERON MCPECK: I know you're afraid. Maybe you think those people outside are right-- that we should take you to the hospital and let the doctors treat you. We could do that... and they might take away your cancer... and your body might feel better... but not your soul. It's God himself who gave you this illness, Jason, for reasons that are His. If you're to be well in body and spirit it's God who must come to deliver you.

(He kisses his son's head.)

FADE TO:

2:14 AM

(Later that night. The storm seems worse. The fire is blazing away in the fireplace in JASON's room. JASON, alone, wakes up and looks out the window to see the wind blowing fiercely. A bright white light shines in the window. JASON MCPECK, awed, stands up and holds his arms out Christ-like as four very human-looking figures approach the window.)

SCENE 2

(Scully's apartment. 8:53 AM. SCULLY puts on her jacket, ready to go to work. She opens her front door and is surprised to see a newspaper lying there. She picks it up and unrolls it. The Goochland Guardian. A note has been taped onto the front page story, Miracle Ends Controversy. "You are the God who performs miracles. You display your power among the peoples. Psalm 77:14" The top of the newspaper reads, "If It's News It's News To Us". SCULLY looks down the hall to see if anyone else has a copy, closes the paper and then her front door.)



SCENE 3

(X-Files office. MULDER, feet propped up on his desk, is reading a printed out email. SCULLY enters. Is that a picture of Samantha on his desk?)

MULDER: Good morning. Here's a story to warm the cockles of your heart, Scully. An 11-year-old boy, diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, cured with a miracle.

SCULLY: Jason McPeck, Goochland, Virginia.

MULDER: (speechless) Ah.

SCULLY: Yeah. His parents refused treatment on religious grounds. His faith forbids medical aid and so Jason's cure was delivered by angels.

(MULDER nods.)

SCULLY: Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder, isn't completely unheard of. So-called miracle recoveries attributable to no clear cause or reason.

MULDER: It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of. It's the messenger. (hands her the sheet of paper) That came as an anonymous e-mail to me from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

SCULLY: DARPA.

MULDER: Someone at DARPA. (pause) How'd you hear about it?

(Long pause. SCULLY clears her throat and hands MULDER the newspaper.)

MULDER: You subscribe to the Goochland Guardian?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: (watching her) So this just appeared miraculously on your doorstep this morning?

SCULLY: As far as I can tell, I was the only one to whom it was delivered.

MULDER: Someone wants us on this case.

SCULLY: It's not a case, Mulder.

MULDER: Not yet. I'm going to go back over to DARPA. You see what else you can find out about that boy.

(MULDER gets up and starts heading out the door. He turns back and smiles.)

MULDER: I've just got to know whether it was Roma Downey or Della Reese.

(SCULLY picks up the newspaper and follows him out of the office.)



SCENE 4
GOOCHLAND, VIRGINIA

(SCULLY arrives at the MCPECK's house. She is driving a red car. Sound of children laughing. She goes up to the front door and knocks. IRENE MCPECK answers. Her husband joins her.)

IRENE MCPECK: Yes?

SCULLY: (showing her badge) Hi, I'm Dana Scully with the, uh, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Are you Mrs. McPeck?

IRENE MCPECK: What can we do for you?

SCULLY: I'm here about your son.

CAMERON MCPECK: Are we under investigation?

SCULLY: Ah, no. I was just hoping to better understand what happened to him. May I ask is he okay?

IRENE MCPECK: Jason, we've got somebody to see you.

(JASON MCPECK runs up to them from the yard. He is out of breath.)

IRENE MCPECK: Tell her how you're feeling.

JASON MCPECK: I feel good. Just a little out of breath.

CAMERON MCPECK: You're looking at God's work. Jason's life owes to his Grace and exalts his name in the highest. Praise the Lord.

IRENE MCPECK: Praise the Lord.

JASON MCPECK: Praise the Lord.

SCULLY: And you say that you saw angels?

JASON MCPECK: Yes.

SCULLY: May I ask what they looked like?

JASON MCPECK: They looked like men. They came from the sky in a ball of light.

SCULLY: And what did they say?

JASON MCPECK: They said not to be afraid. Then one of them pinched me kind of hard and then I was better right away.

SCULLY: He pinched you? Where?

JASON MCPECK: Right here.

(JASON MCPECK points to the back of his neck. SCULLY stares at him, then walks around him to look at it. There is a fresh scar at the base of the neck.)

(Later, SCULLY returns to her car. The CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is sitting in the passenger seat of her car. He has just used the cigarette lighter to light his cigarette. SCULLY is furious. She opens the door.)

SCULLY: What the hell are you doing?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: God's work, what else?

SCULLY: Get out of my car!

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'd hoped for more accommodation toward the man that saved that young boy's life... and yours.

SCULLY: You got your light. Now get out.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN gets out of the car, then leans in the window to talk to SCULLY who is now in the driver's seat.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You're not at all curious? About the chip that's been put in that boy's neck? You, a medical doctor who has the same technology in your body? Has witnessed this wondrous "miracle" first-hand? I've taken considerable trouble to prove my intentions. The newspaper at your door. The e-mail to Mulder.

(SCULLY looks at him.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: The elaborate demonstration of curing this boy's cancer. You see, I'm dying myself.

(SCULLY is listening.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: A dying man who wants to make right; to share his secrets; to bequeath this cure to millions of others just like that boy.

SCULLY: So you want to give it to us.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: To you, Agent Scully. I've tired of Mulder's mule-headedness-- his foolish ideas of overthrowing the system.

SCULLY: You think I'm fooled by this?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I've made you my offer. Agent Mulder hears a breath of this rest assured, I'll rescind it... take it to my grave.

(SCULLY starts the car. She notices a business card lying on the passenger seat. She glances up at CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, then drives away.)



SCENE 5
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(X-Files Office. The ceiling still contains several of Mulder's pencils. ALONE, SCULLY IS LOOKING AT THE CARD. ONLY A PHONE NUMBER: 202-555-1030. She picks up the phone, dials, lets it ring twice, then hangs up quickly. She looks at the card again. She thinks. She picks up the phone and dials.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, I need a trace on a D.C. area phone number. I need an address.

VOICE ON PHONE: Thank you.



SCENE 6

(Large unmarked brick building. SCULLY is shown on video monitor entering the building. The DESK GUARD watches her on the video, then turns as she enters. Another GUARD comes out of a door and confronts her "politely" yet aggressively. SCULLY steps back slightly. She is nervous.)

GUARD: May I help you?

SCULLY: I'm sorry, I, uh, made a mistake.

(She turns and walks back to the door. The DESK GUARD presses a button that locks the front door. SCULLY pauses, trying to be cool.)

GUARD: May I see some identification?

SCULLY: Look, is this necessary? I just walked through the wrong door.

GUARD: Your identification, please.

(Reluctantly, SCULLY hands over her badge. The GUARD takes it and checks a list on the DESK GUARD's desk.)

SCULLY: Look...

(The GUARD turns and holds out a clip on badge marked "VISITOR" to her.)

GUARD: Third floor.

(SCULLY goes up to the third floor and walks down the hall. Several men are milling about. The building is well occupied. The BLACK-HAIRED MAN assassin-guy from the movie watches her. She comes to a door with the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's name on it - C.G.B. Spender. She enters. It is a very dark masculine office. Lots of leather. Two chairs in front of the desk have an ashtray in front of them. The CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is sitting at his desk in the inner room.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Agent Scully... please, sit.

(She doesn't sit.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm glad you came.

SCULLY: You obviously knew that I would.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Well, I know you're a doctor and... a woman of compassion.

SCULLY: (no time for flattery) Please.

(He lights a cigarette.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (thoughtfully) In the end... a man finally looks at the sum of his life to see what he'll leave behind. Most of what I worked to build is in ruins and now that the... darkness descends, I... find I have no real legacy.

SCULLY: (sighs) What are you dying of?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Cerebral inflammation-- a consequence of brain surgery I had in the fall. The doctors give me just a few months.

SCULLY: So, you want to use me to clear the slate... to make you a respectable person. It won't work.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: How many people in the world are dying of cancer? And here we are wasting time with the past.

SCULLY: I'm here. Where is it ... this miracle cure of yours?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We'll need to take a trip. It'll require a few days.

SCULLY: I'll get back to you.

(She starts to leave. His words stop her.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (rising) I have access, Agent Scully. I have these miraculous chips but the genetic research that makes them work is closely guarded. There are men in this building who would kill me if they knew what I'd offered you. They'd kill you, too, in the blink of an eye. I've destroyed a lot of things in my life including the people most precious to me. All I want is a chance to do something in service to man before I go.

(SCULLY considers.)



SCENE 7

(MULDER's apartment. MULDER enters. His basketball is sitting on the coffee table. He goes to his answering machine and presses the button.)

MACHINE VOICE: CALL RECEIVED 8:01 P.M..

SCULLY: (on machine) Mulder, it's me. I wanted to let you know that I'll be out of town for a day or two. It's a family emergency. I'll... I'll call you when I can.

(MULDER immediately picks up the phone and dials.)

CUT TO:

(Phone ringing in SCULLY's apartment. SCULLY, holding a suitcase, looks at the machine. It is a struggle not to answer it. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is standing in the background.)

SCULLY: (recorded voice) This is Dana Scully. I'm not in right now. Please leave a message after the beep.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, it's me. Pick up if you're there. Scully? Are you there? All right, I just got, I got your message and I hope everything's okay. I'll try on your cell right now.

CUT TO:

(MULDER hangs up and stares at the phone.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY stares at the phone, then, with her back to CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN, opens her blouse and checks the microphone that she has hidden in her white bra.)

She leaves the apartment with CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. She doesn't make eye contact with him.)



SCENE 8

(Night. SCULLY and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN are in her car. She is driving. SCULLY subtly checks her wire. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth.)

SCULLY: (critically) You're going to smoke?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN sighs, rolls down the electric window, tosses the cigarette out and rolls the window back up.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It's time I quit.

SCULLY: Just like that.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: No sacrifice is purely altruistic. We give expecting to receive.

SCULLY: What exactly is it you expect to receive?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Your trust. You question my sincerity. You think I'm heartless. Would it soften your opinion of me if I confessed that I've always had a particular affection for you?

(SCULLY glances at him warily.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I assure you my intentions are honorable. I have affection for Mulder, too. My affection for you is special. I held your life in my hands. Your cancer was terminal. I had a cure. Can you imagine what that's like-- to have the power to extinguish a life or to save it and let it flourish? Now, to give you that power, so you can do the same.

(SCULLY is uncomfortable.)



SCENE 9

(SCULLY's apartment building. MULDER follows the LANDLORD as he goes to unlock SCULLY's door.)

LANDLORD: Yeah, she said it was a family matter. Dropped off the key... asked me to water the plants-- no biggie. Hey, great girl-- independent as they come, you know but a great girl.

MULDER: Yeah, yeah.

LANDLORD: Tenants like having an FBI agent in the building. Gives them a sense of security.

MULDER: Do you know how many people have died in there?

LANDLORD: Oh, we don't really talk about that.

MULDER: You said she was, uh, carrying a suitcase. Did you notice anything else, anything abnormal?

LANDLORD: No. No, actually it wasn't her carrying the suitcase. It was her driver.

MULDER: Her driver?

LANDLORD: Yeah, older guy... tall. I've seen him here before. Smokes like a chimney.

(MULDER stares at the LANDLORD, then turns and leaves the hall just as the LANDLORD gets SCULLY's door open.)

LANDLORD: Hey, don't you want...

(MULDER is gone.)



SCENE 10

(Day. SCULLY is still driving. She looks tired.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You've been at the wheel too long. Would you like me to drive?

SCULLY: I might if you let me know where we're going.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Knowing that, you'd feel comfortable? You'd trust me?

(She gives him a look.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: How long did it take Mulder to win your trust?

SCULLY: I've always trusted Mulder.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (chuckling) You're not being honest with yourself. Think back. There was a time when you feared for your future, for your career when you were first partnered with this man. I told you, I've studied you for years... and if you would permit me, I'd like to make an observation.

(She looks at him challengingly.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You're drawn to powerful men but you fear their power. You keep your guard up, a wall around your heart. How else do you explain that fearless devotion to a man obsessed, and, yet, a life alone? You'd die for Mulder but you won't allow yourself to love him.

(SCULLY is uncomfortable.)

SCULLY: Wow. I'm learning a whole other side to you. You're not just a cold-blooded killer, you're a pop psychologist as well.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I've been a destroyer all my life. Before I die, I'd like to prove that I'm capable of something more.

(They see a small road off the main one.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Turn here, on the left.

SCULLY: Where are we going?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: To show you what I'm capable of.

(She turns off. They are followed by a car driven by the BLACK-HAIRED MAN.)

(They arrive at a small house in the woods. A woman, MARJORIE BUTTERS, looks about 60, is tending the plants around her house.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Her name's Marjorie Butters. She's got quite a green thumb. Plays a mean game of Scrabble if you're interested.

SCULLY: And what's her relationship to you?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Well, how should I put it? You could say that I'm her angel. Marjorie's 118 years old.

(They get out of the car and go to greet MARJORIE BUTTERS.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Marjorie!

MARJORIE BUTTERS: Hey!

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN and MARJORIE BUTTERS laugh as he embraces her. SCULLY watches.)

MARJORIE BUTTERS: I'm glad to see you.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I thought I'd surprise you.

MARJORIE BUTTERS: I look an absolute wreck. I've been trying to get in some bulbs before spring.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Marjorie, uh, this is Dana Scully. She's a very good friend of mine.

SCULLY: Nice to meet you.

MARJORIE BUTTERS: My pleasure. Well, come inside. I baked some fresh bread this morning and there are tomatoes in the garden.

(As she walks in the house, SCULLY notices the scar at the base of MARJORIE BUTTERS's neck. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN speaks softly to SCULLY.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: To have this power... to visit this woman and see her joy... must be why you became a doctor.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN follows into the house.)



SCENE 11

(SKINNER's office. A knock at the door. SKINNER, on the phone, waves MULDER in. MULDER is in turtleneck and black leather jacket.)

SKINNER: (on phone) I'll expect your call. Thanks.

(He hangs up.)

SKINNER: She requisitioned a fleet sedan when she left the bureau yesterday. I don't know why and there have been no fuel charges.

MULDER: Her mother doesn't know anything about a family emergency.

SKINNER: Look, I know you're worried about the company that she's in but from what you've told me it's not like she's sneaking out. The truth is, she's gone to a lot of trouble to allay your fears.

MULDER: I know she can take care of herself. It's just not like her to lie to me.

(The phone rings.)

SKINNER: That's my private line.

(He answers it.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Skinner.

SCULLY: (on phone) Sir?

SKINNER: (on phone) Agent Scully, where are you?

(MULDER indicates that he wants the phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm on the road. Um, I'm sorry to call you on this line.

SKINNER: (on phone) No, it's all right. It's just we've been worried about you.

SCULLY: (on phone) Everything's okay. I just wanted you to express that to Mulder.

SKINNER: (on phone) Well, he's standing right here. Why don't you do that yourself?

(MULDER reaches for the phone again. He REALLY wants to talk to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: (on phone) No, sir. That's all right. Can you tell him that I'll call him later? Just, just tell him that I'm fine.

(Hearing a dial tone, SKINNER hangs up.)

SKINNER: She says she's fine.

MULDER: She's in trouble.

(MULDER turns quickly and walks out the door.)



SCENE 12

(SCULLY and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN pull into a gas station.)

SCULLY: I'm going to the restroom.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN gets ready to pump the gas as he watches her enter the restroom.)

(As soon as she enters the restroom, SCULLY unfastens her blouse and begins speaking to her breasts. We see that she is still wearing a microphone and tape recorder between her breasts. She speaks into the microphone quietly as she checks the stalls to make sure she is alone.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able to make sense of what's on this tape. I had no other way of contacting you. Please try to understand that I weighed the risks. I couldn't divulge these plans without risking them and I promise you that I weighed everything. Our current location is northbound on the upstate expressway. We are driving my FBI fleet sedan. I will promise I will get these tapes to you as fast as I can.

(She takes the tape out of the machine and addresses an envelope to FOX MULDER. As she exits the restroom, she is startled as she runs into an ATTENDANT.)

ATTENDANT: Whoa! Excuse me.

(She puts the letter in a post box, then joins the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN in the car. He is now in the driver's seat. She gets in the passenger side. He offers her a roll of candy.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Lifesaver?

(She gives a tight smile and shakes her head.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: May as well get comfortable. We've got a good drive ahead.

(He starts the engine. As they drive away, we see the BLACK-HAIRED MAN holding SCULLY's letter to MULDER which he has retrieved from the post box.)



SCENE 13
1:04 AM

(Motel near a lake. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN parks the car. SCULLY is asleep. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN puts on a pair of black leather gloves, then looks over at SCULLY. He tenderly brushes a lock of hair out of her eyes and looks at her wistfully.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER's apartment. Someone is pounding on the door. MULDER, in gray t-shirt goes to open it, checking the peephole first. It is the LONE GUNMEN. They are "in disguise." Very funny. FROHIKE has a thick brown wig and a suit, LANGLY is wearing a strange little round hat, BYERS is NOT wearing a suit!)

MULDER: It's the masters of disguise.

(They enter the apartment.)

LANGLY: Can we laugh it up in your apartment?

FROHIKE: We got heat on our tail.

BYERS: Did what you asked. We pulled up what we could on Scully.

LANGLY: We started with her credit cards to see if she purchased any airline tickets.

FROHIKE: And ended up hacking into some Defense Department node...

LANGLY: Where they demanded we immediately identify ourselves or face prosecution for espionage or crimes against the government.

MULDER: Well, what does this have to do with finding Scully?

BYERS: When we went into her computer we found a series of deleted transmissions.

FROHIKE: E-mail that had been erased from her subdirectories but not her hard drive. A series of communications.

LANGLY: From someone named Cobra.

MULDER: Who the hell is Cobra? Scully would have told me about him.

LANGLY: Well, it looks like she's gone to great lengths to keep this from you.

MULDER: I don't believe that. She knows that I'd find her, no matter what.

BYERS: Mulder, we can't find her. There's nowhere to start looking.

MULDER: I don't believe that, either. Give me that.

(MULDER takes the laptop from the GUNMEN and opens it up.)



SCENE 15

(SCULLY wakes up in a motel/cabin room. She is wearing silk pajamas, but clearly has no recollection of getting there. She gets up and looks in the closet, disoriented. She checks, but she is still wearing her bra and wire.)

(In another room in the cabin, CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is pouring coffee from a silver urn. SCULLY enters, fully dressed, carrying her suitcase and pissed off.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: How do you take your coffee?

SCULLY: Unadulterated, thank you.

(She takes the coffee, then empties it out the window.)

SCULLY: You drugged me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (chuckling) I did nothing of the sort.

SCULLY: How the hell did I get out of my clothes and into bed?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I carried you. You'd been up for over 30 hours. You were delirious. I only wanted to make you comfortable.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN takes a sip of his coffee.)

SCULLY: Where are we?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Milford, Pennsylvania.

SCULLY: Well, that wasn't part of the deal. I don't know what you're up to.

(She leaves the cabin. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN follows her. Very Richard III.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Keys are in the ignition. You're free to go, of course. The choice is still yours.

(BLACK-HAIRED MAN is watching from the bushes. SCULLY heads back into the cabin.)



SCENE 16

(SKINNER's office. MULDER enters abruptly.)

MULDER: Sir, I need your attention.

SKINNER: Is my assistant...?

MULDER: No. She's away from her desk. I wouldn't just bust in here but, as I said, it's a breaking situation.

(The LONE GUNMEN enter the office and set up the laptop.)

SKINNER: What the hell's going on here?

MULDER: That's my question exactly. I believe you've all met.

LANGLY: Is this place secure?

SKINNER: Is it secure?

FROHIKE: Don't get testy, G-man.

MULDER: Are you aware of a federal fugitive, code name Cobra? For the past six months Cobra's been e-mailing Scully from the Department of Defense where he works on a shadow project for advanced research.

BYERS: A shadow project is right.

LANGLY: Where this dude works even the shadows have shadows.

SKINNER: Is that what I'm looking at here?

MULDER: No. What they're pulling up is Scully's correspondence back to Cobra.

SKINNER: She has a relationship?

MULDER: No. Somebody posing as Scully who hacked into her computer and has been capturing all her e-mail. Passing themselves off as Scully in order to win Cobra's trust. The last five exchanges hint at a meeting where they're going to exchange information on the project Cobra's working on.

SKINNER: A meeting where?

FROHIKE: Don't know. They just ended.

SKINNER: Who's been in her computer?

MULDER: Smoking man. Or someone working for him. You got to get to him now.

SKINNER: You of all people should know that you just don't get to him.

MULDER: Well, if you don't get to him it may be the last time we see Scully alive.

(SKINNER is concerned.)



SCENE 17
6:22 PM

(Cabin. SCULLY is checking her wire. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN knocks at SCULLY's door.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We'll be getting final instructions from our contact tonight. He's invited us to dinner. I took the liberty of getting you something to wear.

(He holds out a very revealing, yet classy black dress. SCULLY accepts it.)

SCULLY: It's, uh... It's beautiful.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I'm glad you like it. I look forward to tonight.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN leaves the room closing the door behind him. SCULLY looks at the dress.)

(Later. SCULLY, now wearing the dress, and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN walk in and are seated at a table in an elegant restaurant. The situation is awkward, to say the least.)

SCULLY: So, your contact's going to join us?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I presume so.

SCULLY: You extol our great trust but you still haven't told me who he is.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: He is to human genetic science as Oppenheimer and Fermi were to the advent of nuclear warfare.

SCULLY: I'm still not clear what my importance is to this exchange.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: This man-- call him Cobra-- he needs assurances that the science he's going to hand over won't fall into the wrong hands. I've told him of you.

(The waiter pours the wine after getting the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's approval.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: He's expecting to meet you here. (he raises his glass in a toast.) Well, to the future.

(SCULLY raises her glass politely and takes a sip of the red wine.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (intensely) I must tell you something else. Something that's so unbelievable, so incredible... that to know it is to look at the entire world anew.

SCULLY: What?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: What we are being given... it's not the cure for cancer. It's the holiest of grails, Dana. It's the cure for all human disease.

SCULLY: How?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It's from that final frontier. It's largely extraterrestrial.

SCULLY: Then you would be cured.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: That which makes miracles can also make GREAT EVIL. THERE ARE THOSE WHO WOULD USE THIS POWER FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES: To choose who will live and who will die. Theoretically, I can be cured. Everything I've told you about wanting to make right? I'm a lonely man, Dana.

(SCULLY stares at him.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Would you excuse me?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN gets up and leaves the table. SCULLY processes what he has said. The camera shows a man seated at a table behind her, watching her, he is not the BLACK-HAIRED MAN. He gestures for the waiter, perhaps for his check.)

(Outside, CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN puts a cigarette to his lips and reaches into his pocket for a lighter. As the BLACK-HAIRED MAN joins him, he tosses the cigarette to the ground unlit.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Cobra hasn't shown.

BLACK-HAIRED MAN: What do you want to do?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Wait. What else can we do?

BLACK-HAIRED MAN: What trust you've won... Scully won't stick around forever. What's wrong?

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is troubled.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Just do your damn job.

(Inside at the table, the waiter removes what appears to be an uneated strawberry shortcake or cheesecake from in front of SCULLY and she looks at a piece of paper that was under the plate. "Calico Cove, first light of day." She looks around to see who the message may be from but the man that was sitting behind her has left.)



SCENE 18

(Early next morning. SCULLY and CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN arrive at a motor boat tied to a dock. She gets in the boat. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN unties the mooring.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Calico Inlet's 15 minutes out. South end.

SCULLY: What do I do when I get there?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I don't know. Just wait. Be careful.

(SCULLY gives him a look, then drives the motorboat around the lake. She must have really good hairspray, because the hair doesn't move. Another motorboat approaches her. The driver, COBRA, is a good-looking man in his 40s, the same man from the restaurant. He speaks intensely and admiringly.)

SCIENTIST/COBRA: Finally we meet. You're just as you described yourself. Certainly more so last night at dinner.

(Someone on the shore has trained a gunsight on the two of them.)

SCIENTIST/COBRA: I only wish we could continue to correspond but it must end after this. I hope one day we can take some time when I'm not a marked man. This is it. The science I promised you.

(He hands her a mini diskette.)

SCULLY: Well, wait. Where did you get this? Where did it come from, this science?

SCIENTIST/COBRA: Where did it come from?

SCULLY: Who developed it?

SCIENTIST/COBRA: (unsure of who she is) Scully?

SCULLY: Yes, I'm Scully but I don't believe that we've spoken before or corresponded.

(COBRA falls into the water as a gunshot echoes around them. The gunman trains the sight on SCULLY as she ducks down and tries to check COBRA's dead body. He shoots and misses. She tries to start the boat. Just as he is about to fire the second shot at her, another shot echoes around them. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN has killed the shooter, the BLACK-HAIRED MAN. He places the black leather gloves next to the BLACK-HAIRED MAN's body. SCULLY gets the engine started and steers the boat back to the dock where she is met by the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. She is not pleased.)

SCULLY: They shot him. They killed him and they shot at me.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Did you get it?

SCULLY: (accusingly) You told me that no one else knew about this.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I wouldn't have sent you if I thought there'd be any danger.

SCULLY: (sighs) Oh, man.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Dana...

SCULLY: (disgusted) Yes, I got it.

(She slaps the disk into his hand and turns away. Looks like he reaches into his pocket.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Forgive me. Here... take it. This is for you.

(He hands the disk back to her. She leaves quickly.)

SCULLY: I've got to go.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (looking after her, wistfully) Go.



SCENE 19

(MULDER's apartment. The LONE GUNMEN are around the computer checking the disk. SCULLY sits on the couch. MULDER stands in the doorway pouting, not making eye contact with SCULLY. This hurts her. The GUNMEN look at each other.)

FROHIKE: There's nothing on this.

LANGLY: It's empty.

BYERS: Completely.

SCULLY: (insistent, desperate) No, it can't be. It can't be. It's got to be on there.

(Nothing. SCULLY looks over at MULDER who finally meets her eyes sympathetically.)



SCENE 20
4:32 PM

(The unmarked brick building. MULDER and SCULLY have entered and gone up to the third floor. The building is now deserted, no people, no furniture, nothing. SCULLY leads MULDER to where CGB Spender's office was. It is empty. She is very upset.)

SCULLY: He was here! These were his offices. What the hell is this?

MULDER: He used you.

SCULLY: Mulder, he laid it all out for me. I recorded it. I mailed you the tape.

(MULDER nods.)

SCULLY: This old woman, Marjorie Butters, I met her. I saw her pictures, her birth certificate...

MULDER: You saw what you needed to see in order to make you believe.

SCULLY: Well, then what about this boy? This boy with cancer? You can't deny that. That's undeniable proof.

MULDER: Even if we could convince his parents to let us march him out how long before that chip in his neck mysteriously disappears? This was the perfectly executed con, Scully. The only thing I can't figure out is why you're still alive.

SCULLY: Mulder, I looked into his eyes. I swear what he told me was true.

CUT TO:

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN smoking and drinking a glass of wine before a roaring fire.)

MULDER: (voice) He did it all for himself-- to get the science on that disk. His sincerity was a mask, Scully. The man's motives never changed.

SCULLY: (voice) You think he used me to save himself-- at the expense of the human race.

MULDER: (voice) No, he knows what that science is worth, how powerful it is. He'd let nothing stand in his way.

(The disk is lying on the table beside CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN.)

SCULLY: (voice) You may be right... but for a moment, I saw something else in him. A longing for something more than power. Maybe for something he could never have.

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN stands outside on the dock. He looks at the disk, then sighs and tosses it into the water. He takes a cigarette out and lights it.)

SCENE 1
EASTER SUNDAY
BETHANY, VERMONT

(Perfect yard in front of a perfect home. An Easter egg hunt and luncheon for the children and mothers of the town hosted by the oh-so-perfect MARTHA CRITTENDON. Every dish on the lavish buffet is perfect, the flowers are arranged just so, and she has even managed to make flowers bloom at Easter that in New England would not dare show their face until well into May. ELLEN ADDERLY, tall and dark-haired, her months-old daughter, KATE on her hip, walks up to her friend. Both are in their Easter best. All is picture perfect. Everyone is happy.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Hey, you sure I can't help?

MARTHA CRITTENDON: (proudly) Absolutely not. All set.

ELLEN ADDERLY: (perhaps a little envious, but still admiring) Oh, Martha, you make this look so easy.

MARTHA CRITTENDON: (concerned) It's not too much, you think?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Are you kidding? This is just perfect. It's exactly the way I've always dreamt that Easter should be.

(MARTHA CRITTENDON's 8-year-old daughter, MICHELLE, passes them. She is also in Easter dress with perfectly plaited hair. She is holding a basket full of Easter eggs.)

MICHELLE CRITTENDON: Mommy, mommy, look!

MARTHA CRITTENDON: Oh, good for you, Michelle.

(MICHELLE runs off to find more eggs.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: What you've done is really fabulous. The kids are going to remember this forever.

(MARTHA CRITTENDON sees another woman, JENNY UPHOUSE, walking toward them. JENNY, in a short skirt, tight shirt, and jean jacket, is not as well dressed as the other women and has an unpleasant look on her face as if she is uncomfortable to be at this "perfect" party. She is carrying a covered dish.)

MARTHA CRITTENDON: I hope there are some things they won't remember. What is she doing here?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Her son is in Michelle's class, Martha. Be nice.

MARTHA CRITTENDON: (not happy) Yeah.

(ELLEN ADDERLY greets JENNY graciously.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Jenny, hi. It's good to see you.

JENNY UPHOUSE: Hey, Ellen...

(JENNY and MARTHA CRITTENDON glare at each other.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: Martha.

CUT TO:

(MICHELLE is still looking for eggs. She walks through the impeccable rose garden and into the woods behind the house. She is startled to see a raven sitting on a gnarled tree branch. It crows, then flies at her face. She screams and ducks as it flies over her head. MICHELLE turns and is startled as she backs into JENNY UPHOUSE who is standing behind her. MICHELLE gasps, drops her basket and runs away. JENNY UPHOUSE watches her go. Her eyes narrow.)



SCENE 2
CRITTENDON RESIDENCE
9:12 PM

(Later that evening, MARTHA CRITTENDON is in her house on the phone with her husband. Like the garden outside, the house is perfect. Cover of House Beautiful, eat your heart out.)

MARTHA CRITTENDON: (on phone) She's shaken up, Howard. It took me two hours to put her to bed.

MARTHA CRITTENDON: (on phone)  (pause)  All I'm saying is... Well, no, I didn't see any bird but whatever it was it scared her and she wants to be with her daddy. That's all I'm saying.  Well, can't you come home one day early? . A-a-all right, fine. (sighs) I love you, too.

(MARTHA CRITTENDON hangs up. She notices the lace curtains in front of one of the windows blowing slightly. She goes over and closes and locks the window and looks around the living room. She gasps when she sees a raven sitting on the mantle. It caws at her. She turns and sees her reflection in the mirror on the wall along with the reflection of something else. The mirror spontaneously shatters. MARTHA CRITTENDON screams as a figure with stringy dark hair and twisted features attacks her. They fall to the floor out of range of the reflection of the shattered pieces of mirror.)

SCENE 3
SOUTHEAST WASHINGTON, DC
8:42 PM

(Room in a deserted warehouse in a seedy section of DC. We see the entrance to the Dirty Dames strip club and the men and "ladies" out front. Cut to a hazel eye looking at the scene through a telescope. The eye belongs to MULDER. He watches as an older model van pulls up outside the club. It is crudely spray painted with messages of Christian savation, like "Jesus Saves." MULDER slowly chews the wad of gum in his mouth, then blows a bubble. SCULLY enters the room bearing a cardboard holder with two cups of coffee. She looks tired.)

SCULLY: Anything?

(MULDER reaches for the coffee without even looking up, knowing it will be there.)

MULDER: No. She'll come. Matter of time.

(Without taking out the gum, MULDER begins drinking his coffee. He continues looking through the telescope.)

SCULLY: Yeah. Well, I hope you realize there's no evidence whatsoever that this mystery woman of yours has even committed a crime...

(SCULLY looks down at a picture of a blonde woman in a very skimpy dress. Scattered on the table are the remains of several take-out meals.)

SCULLY: Though her wardrobe comes close.

(MULDER looks up briefly from the telescope and smiles at her.)

MULDER: Ah... Six prostitutes were seen with her at Dirty Dames never to be seen again. Not only might she be a female serial killer-- rare in and of itself-- but twice police raided that club to arrest her ...

SCULLY:  and twice they came up empty-handed.

MULDER: She's on tape going in. The exits are covered. She's nowhere to be found. What happens to her? She disappear... turn invisible?

SCULLY: (shrugs) Well, I hope we catch her, so she can tell us before I have to spend another night here. You know, Mulder, I don't know about you but I find this all very depressing... This round-the-clock exposure to the seamy underbelly.

(SCULLY is very tired. MULDER looks at her matter-of-factly and starts in on a pep talk.)

MULDER: That's the job, Scully-- vigilance in the face of privation... the sheer will that it takes to sit in this crappy room spying on the dregs of society until our suspect surfaces. There's something ennobling in that.

(SCULLY is not inspired. MULDER's cell phone rings. He answers it. SCULLY looks at a half-eaten sandwich, then discards it.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  Now?  All right.

(MULDER hangs up and picks up his jacket.)

MULDER: I got to go.

(SCULLY stares at him in disbelief as he walks toward the door.)

SCULLY: (plaintively) Mulder...

(MULDER is out the door. SCULLY sighs.)



SCENE 4
FBI HEADQUARTERS
9:17 PM

(Later, MULDER enters SKINNER's office. SKINNER is looking through the file on MARTHA CRITTENDON.)

MULDER: You wanted to see me, sir?

SKINNER: Yeah, sit down.

(MULDER sits.)

SKINNER: Two weeks ago a woman named Martha Crittendon disappeared from her home in Bethany, Vermont. Local police haven't turned up any sign of her. I'm hoping you may be able to.

MULDER: I'm already on a case.

SKINNER: You're on a stakeout. I'm confident Agent Scully can continue in your absence.

(MULDER looks at SKINNER suspiciously.)

MULDER: Why? What did I do?

SKINNER: There may be aspects to this that... speak to your strengths as an investigator.

MULDER: Specifically?

(SKINNER is very uncomfortable as he hands over the file.)

SKINNER: Ravens. What do you know about them-- their mythological or... paranormal significance?

(MULDER speaks hesitantly.)

MULDER: Well, the, uh... th-the raven is considered a-a very powerful symbol in certain Norse, Celtic and Native American cultures uh, mostly, a negative one. Indians view it as a deceiving spirit, Christianity mostly associates it with evil and, then, of course, there's Poe's raven and, "nevermore," an-and all that stuff.

SKINNER: Martha Crittendon's seven-year-old daughter claimed that she was attacked by a raven earlier the day her mother disappeared. Later, she heard one inside the house before she discovered her mother was missing.

(MULDER looks at SKINNER intently.)

MULDER: No, really, what did I do?

SKINNER: It's the only lead that hasn't been explored. I want to know if it has any bearing on the case.

(MULDER looks down at the file. From it we see MARTHA CRITTENDON's family history:

8092 Cliff St.
Bethany, Vermont 05032
802-555-0147
Father: Charles Campbell
Father's Occupation: US District Court Judge - DC
Mother: Mavine Cambell
Mother's Occupation: Housewife
Distinguishing Characteristics: None)

MULDER: I'm also assuming that the fact that Martha Crittendon's father is a federal judge also has a little bearing on this case.

SKINNER: It's been made clear to me that locating her is my top priority. I'm making it yours as well.

(MULDER nods.)



SCENE 5
BETHANY, VERMONT

(Day. Outside the CRITTENDON house. A mailman walks away from the house as he does his rounds. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY is sitting in his car waiting, tapping his fingers on the rear-view mirror. MULDER pulls up behind him. Both men get out. It is raining. MULDER puts a piece of paper over his head and SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY puts his hat on.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Yeah.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Phil Adderly. Welcome to Bethany.

(They shake hands.)

MULDER: Nice to meet you.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I appreciate the help.

MULDER: Sure. Uh, I don't know how much help I'm going to be. I know you already have a lot of good investigators on the case. So, um... You want to just take a quick look around?

MULDER: Great, thanks.

(They walk toward the house.)

MULDER: So, tell me about Martha Crittendon.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Well, she and my wife Ellen, they're best friends. Martha's... much admired here. She's devoted to her family... active in the community. I mean, needless to say, th-the whole town is very concerned.

MULDER: So, what's your theory on what happened?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I'm hoping you'll tell me. There's no ransom note... no prints or blood evidence.

MULDER: Her husband was out of town when she disappeared?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: In Miami, at a conference. It checks out. Howard... didn't have anything to do with this.

(They enter the house. MULDER looks out the window into the backyard and sees HOWARD CRITTENDON comforting his daughter MICHELLE who is sitting despondently on a swing-set. MULDER turns back to SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY.)

MULDER: What do you know about a raven?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Yeah, yeah, Michelle, their, um... their little girl was saying something about that. Got me. Poor kid. You want to talk to her?

MULDER: Not necessary.

(MULDER is looking around the perfect living room.)

MULDER: You're sure, uh, Martha's last name isn't Stewart?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: (chuckling) Tell me about it. Last year, this place made the cover of New England Home.

(MULDER notices three deep scratches on the otherwise immaculate mantle.)

MULDER: How many talons would you say a raven had?

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY looks like he thinks MULDER is crazy. MULDER smiles and taps the mantle thoughtfully.)

MULDER: Never mind.

(MULDER notices two empty picture hangers on the wall opposite the mantle.)

MULDER: You know what this is? You know what was hanging here?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: It was a mirror. It was found broken.

MULDER: You had no other signs of struggle?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Not a one. Does that mean something to you?

(HOWARD CRITTENDON enters the living room. He is a gentle, slightly pudgy business man. He shakes MULDER's hand.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Howard, this is Agent Mulder with the FBI.

MULDER: Sir. I hope we can help.

HOWARD CRITTENDON: I appreciate your coming. I'm wondering now if... this isn't just a waste of your time.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: How so?

HOWARD CRITTENDON: With all the police coming and going, this place was a wreck. I was straightening up and I... found something.

(HOWARD CRITTENDON hands MULDER a round plastic prescription container.)

MULDER: Uh, birth control pills.

HOWARD CRITTENDON: I think Martha was having an affair. After Michelle we decided not to have more children. I had a vasectomy. They're in Martha's name. She ordered them off the Internet... because, I guess... small towns talk. Of course, then I s-started looking all around and I, uh... found this in the pocket of her favorite coat.

(He hands MULDER an old fashioned skeleton key. It has the number "6" on it.)

HOWARD CRITTENDON: I don't know what this goes to or what it means, if anything, but... the pills...

(All of this is painful for HOWARD CRITTENDON .)

MULDER: Do you have any idea who your wife may have been seeing?

HOWARD CRITTENDON: Whoever he is... Martha may be with him. It explains why we haven't found her. She doesn't want to be found.



SCENE 6

(Neighborhood street. ELLEN ADDERLY is walking her daughter KATE in a stroller. She is placing colored flyers with MARTHA CRITTENDON's picture and contact information on the windshields of all the cars. She hears a bird caw and looks up to see a raven sitting in the pine tree above her. JENNY UPHOUSE's voice startles her.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: Cute kid.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Oh, Jenny, you scared me.

JENNY UPHOUSE: (looking at one of the flyers) You do those up yourself?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Uh... yeah.

JENNY UPHOUSE: I know Martha and you were good friends. You must be pretty upset.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Of course. I'm sure we all are. Hey, maybe you would like some of these to put up on your side of town.

JENNY UPHOUSE: My side of town. Yeah, sure.

(JENNY UPHOUSE takes some of the flyers. ELLEN ADDERLY is embarrassed.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Look, I didn't mean that the way it might have sounded.

JENNY UPHOUSE: (vicious) No, it just naturally comes out that way when you think you're better than everyone. You and Martha are two peas in a pod.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Jenny, I don't think I'm better than anyone.

JENNY UPHOUSE: You and me got more in common than you know.

(JENNY UPHOUSE leaves. ELLEN ADDERLY glances down at the window of the car next to her and sees the reflection of a woman with a really scary face and stringy hair. She gasps as the window shatters. She turns quickly, but sees no one behind her.)



SCENE 7
ADDERLY RESIDENCE
7:18 PM

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY and MULDER are in the house. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY is on the phone. MULDER is looking through a book.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Yeah. Right. Right. Thanks.

(He hangs up and walks over to MULDER.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Whoever Martha was seeing the two of them covered their tracks pretty good. Phone records don't show anything. You think this person took her? Harmed her?

(MULDER is looking through a coffee table book.)

MULDER: I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it.

(He holds up the book showing SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY and article on ravens.)

MULDER: According to your Audubon book here a raven has four talons. That matches the scratches we found on Martha Crittendon's mantel.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: You're not saying a raven's the reason Martha's gone missing?

MULDER: (smiling) No, no. Not... not a raven itself. But, in folklore, ravens are companions to evil-- evil spirits, witches, warlocks-- that kind of thing.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Agent Mulder, I appreciate the different tack you're taking on this investigation, but this whole bird thing...? And keep in mind you're basing this on the word of a seven-year-old girl.

MULDER: Well, there was also a broken mirror in Martha's house. Mirrors are considered items of enchantment. A broken one  means something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it means something.

(ELLEN enters the house carrying KATE. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY goes to greet them. He takes his daughter.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Ellen. Hey, sweet girl. Agent Mulder, this is my daughter Katy, my wife Ellen.

(ELLEN and MULDER shake hands.)

MULDER: Hi.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Hi. Oh, we're so glad you're here. Look, our house is your house. We have a spare guest room all set up I'm sure you'll be really comfortable.

MULDER: No, no, that... that's not necessary.

ELLEN ADDERLY: No, no, no. There's no arguments. We're so grateful that you're here to help find Martha. Really, it's the least we can do.

(MULDER gives in and nods.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Okay.

(Later, they are sitting down to dinner. Fine china, wine in crystal goblets. ELLEN ADDERLY is carving a roast. Lots and lots of food. MULDER is in shirtsleeves.)

MULDER: You know, I should really get the Bureau to reimburse you for room and board.

ELLEN ADDERLY: No. Don't be silly. No, this is just a typical meal around here.

MULDER: (very surprised) Really?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Phil works so much that supper is usually the only time we see each other and I like to make it special.

(MULDER chuckles. His cell phone rings in his jacket on the other side of the room. He seems reluctant to answer it.)

MULDER: Uh... Excuse me. Sorry. Thanks.

(He gets up and answers the phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

(SCULLY is still on the stakeout. She looks miserable, huddled in a coat.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, please tell me I can go home.

MULDER: (on phone, cheerfully) Oh, hey, Scully. How's the stakeout?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, the furnace broke and I can just about see my breath in here.

MULDER: (on phone) Ouch. I'm sorry to hear that.

SCULLY: (on phone) That... and I've witnessed a couple hundred things I'd like to erase from my brain. Eww.

(SCULLY looks through the telescope again. The Jesus Saves van pulls up outside the club again.)

SCULLY: (on phone) But as of yet, no mystery woman.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, she'll come, you know? It's just a matter of time. She'll show up-- I'm sure of that.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, well not before I die of malnutrition.

(She picks up a slice of cold pizza, then drops it again, disgusted.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, tough it out. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Right?

(At the table, ELLEN ADDERLY filling MULDER's plate with assorted side dishes.)

MULDER: (to ELLEN) No, no, no, no. No capers, thank you.

SCULLY: (on phone, confused) I'm sorry. What?

MULDER: (on phone, quickly) I said, "What a... what a crazy caper." I'll talk to you later... and, uh, keep warm. Bye.

(MULDER hangs up and returns to the table.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Did I hear you say something about "stakeout"? What's the case?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Sweetie, this is family time. Don't make our guest talk shop at the dinner table.

SHERIFF: Fair enough.

(MULDER smiles.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Cheers.

(ELLEN ADDERLY holds up her glass of red wine to MULDER. He clinks with her.)

MULDER: Cheers.



SCENE 8

(CRITTENDON house. HOWARD CRITTENDON and his daughter MICHELLE are sitting at their table. Very sad. Each has a plate of macaroni and cheese. MICHELLE pokes listlessly at hers. HOWARD CRITTENDON looks at her with concern.)

HOWARD CRITTENDON: What's the matter, Sweetheart? I thought that was your favorite.

MICHELLE: (sadly) It tastes different when Mommy makes it.

HOWARD CRITTENDON: Yeah. I know. How about we go get hamburgers? Would you like that instead?

(MICHELLE looks up to nod, then looks at the window behind her father. She looks frightened.)

MICHELLE: It's back.

(HOWARD CRITTENDON gets up and goes to the window. He sees a raven perched on the birdbath in the yard. It caws. He closes the curtains.)

HOWARD CRITTENDON: Everything's all right, Sweetheart. I'll be right back.

MICHELLE: (still scared) Okay.

(HOWARD CRITTENDON goes outside and walks through the dark yard. He sees a group of ravens feeding on something in the rose garden behind a tree. With a sense of dread, he walks closer and sees that the ravens' meal is that of a partially buried human.)



SCENE 9

(Later. The back yard of the Crittendon house is now a crime scene. MULDER joins DR. BLANKENSHIP, a kindly older man, where he is looking at the body of MARTHA CRITTENDON. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY looks on.)

MULDER: What do you make of these claw marks?

DR. BLANKENSHIP: Well, one time I saw the victim of a bear attack look something like that  only bears don't plant their kill in the rose garden.

MULDER: I was going to say.

DR. BLANKENSHIP: The body's been around here for a while-- probably since she went missing.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: What about your ravens?

(MULDER looks up at him.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDDERLY: Howard said something about ravens.

DR. BLANKENSHIP: Yeah. Feeding on her. See?

(DR. BLANKENSHIP shows them the body. Camera shows us exactly what MARTHA CRITTENDON looks like after being raven buffet. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY walks away quickly, head in hands. MULDER follows him.)

MULDER: You okay?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I'm not arresting Howard. I don't care how it looks-- body buried in his own yard-- he didn't do this.

MULDER: I agree.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Poor guy has suffered enough already.

(ELLEN ADDERLY, very upset, ducks under the crime scene tape and joins them.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: What are you doing? You shouldn't be here.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Oh, my God. Martha. No.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: (holding her) Ellen, honey, I am so sorry.

ELLEN ADDERLY: It can't be.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: It's okay, it's okay. Shh.

ELLEN ADDERLY: The thing that did that to her... I think I saw it today.

(Later, in the ADDERLY's house. ELLEN is very upset. She is looking at her reflection in the window.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: I saw its reflection. It had a face out of a nightmare. These long claws-- the kind that could... the window shattered-- I don't know how-- and when I turned around, it was gone. I don't know what I thought it was. I didn't think it was real. I mean, how could it be? But then, when I saw Martha's face...

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Honey, you've been through a lot.

ELLEN ADDERLY: You don't believe me.

MULDER: I do.

(ELLEN looks at him hopefully.)

MULDER: You said the car window shattered after you saw the reflection and there's a broken mirror in Martha's house. I don't think that's a coincidence.

ELLEN ADDERLY: But what could it mean?

MULDER: Mirrors are considered doorways. In the Victorian Era, they built mirrored rooms called psychomantiums where they thought they could summon forth spirits from the spirit world. Denizens from the spirit world were brought into this world.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Denizens... of the spirit world.

MULDER: Well, you asked about the raven, right? The raven is a carrion bird attracted to death and decay. What if this entity that you saw is somehow a personification of that? What if this creature was brought forth in order to attack Martha? Then the question becomes, "who summoned it forth?" Ellen, do you know if Martha had any enemies? Can you think of anyone at all who would have wished her harm?

(ELLEN ADDERLY thinks then looks up at MULDER..)



SCENE 10

(MULDER and SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY are interviewing JENNY where she works in a diner. She is very hostile.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: I sure as hell didn't have anything to do with it.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: They're routine questions, Ms. Uphouse. Answer them and we're out of here.

MULDER: We understand there was no love lost between you and Martha Crittendon.

JENNY UPHOUSE: And where do you understand that from? Mrs. Sheriff, right?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: It's not exactly a town secret.

JENNY UPHOUSE: Right. Like there aren't enough of those already. Queen Martha and her perfect little Easter egg hunts. She's so above the rest of us. Except I heard she was stepping out on her husband-- knocking boots with who knows who. I'm not happy she's dead, and all but you need to look into that.

MULDER: Well, let's stay on the subject of you. On your police record, for instance. You don't suffer people that don't give you respect. I'm thinking of that hair salon owner you assaulted.

JENNY UPHOUSE: That was forever ago and I paid for that. And I had nothing to do with Martha.

MULDER: Where were you the night she disappeared?

JENNY UPHOUSE: At home, all night. I got to get back to work.

(JENNY UPHOUSE walks away from them.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I don't know about you, but I believe her. She didn't do it. I just don't get that vibe.

MULDER: Fair enough, but why did she lie about her alibi? I got that vibe pretty clear.

(The two men look at each other. As they are leaving, MULDER's phone rings.)

MULDER: Excuse me.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I'll be in the car.

MULDER: Okay.

(He answers his phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone, miserable) Mulder, when you find me dead, my desiccated corpse propped up staring lifelessly through the telescope at drunken frat boys peeing and vomiting into the gutter just know that my last thoughts were of you and how I'd like to kill you.

MULDER: (on phone) I'm sorry. Who is this?

SCULLY: (on phone, whining ) It's a freak show, Mulder. It's a nonstop parade of every single lowlife imaginable.

MULDER: (on phone) Well, the view may not be too different here. It's dressed up a little nicer but underneath the surface, it's the same seamy underbelly.

SCULLY: (on phone) It's not the same, trust me.

MULDER: (on phone) You know, Scully, this case has turned out to be a little more interesting than I thought and I could use your help.

SCULLY: (on phone, hopefully) Are you talking about a reprieve for me?

MULDER: (on phone) Well, there's a murder victim that I'd like you to autopsy for me. What do you think? Scully? You still there? Hello?

(SCULLY is looking intently through the telescope at the ratty "Jesus Saves" van which has pulled up outside the club again.)

SCULLY: (on phone) That van is back.

MULDER: (on phone) What? What did you say?

SCULLY: (on phone) Nothing, Mulder. I'll talk to you later, okay?

(SCULLY hangs up and focuses the telescope. MULDER stares at his phone for a second, not believing she actually hung up on him, then hangs up and leaves the diner.)



SCENE 11
ADDERLY RESIDENCE
3:23 PM

(Outside the ADDERLY's house, a raven sits on the gatepost and caws. Inside, ELLEN ADDERLY is running the carpet sweeper. It catches something under the couch. ELLEN reaches down and picks up a skeleton key with the number 6 on it. Suddenly, she hears the bird cawing but the sound is a lot closer than before. She walks down the hall looking in rooms. She reaches her daughter's room.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Kat...

(A raven lands on the edge of the crib. ELLEN ADDERLY, gasps, then picks up her daughter from her crib, then screams when she sees the reflection of the stringy-haired creature in the mirror in the baby's room. The mirror shatters as she runs from the room, baby in arms.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Get away from her! It's okay. Come on.

(Another mirror shatters with the reflection of the creature as they run down the hall. ELLEN ADDERLY ducks into a closet with the baby. A shadow of a person is walking in the room outside.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Shh, shh, shh. Be quiet, now. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, be quiet.

(The closet door is suddenly opened. It is SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Oh, God. Ellen? Ellen, what happened?

(Later, living room. ELLEN is still shaken. MULDER is looking around the house. Crime scene techs are dusting for prints in the baby's room.)

MULDER: Are you feeling a little better, Ellen? Can you... just talk to me a little bit about what happened?

ELLEN ADDERLY: It came back.

MULDER: It came back-- the... the creature you saw?

ELLEN ADDERLY: It was here, Phil. It chased me.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: It's all right, Honey.

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY walks over to speak to MULDER privately.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Please don't encourage this. This is not what she needs.

MULDER: I believe she saw something.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: And I believe she didn't. Her best friend just died, for God's sake. These imaginings of hers are brought on by stress. I have been through the entire house and I didn't see any indication that anyone else was here.

MULDER: What about the two broken mirrors?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: What about them? You think broken mirrors have some deeper meaning but you still can't tell me what it is. And in this case? I'm thinking Ellen broke them herself.

(MULDER looks at and picks up the skeleton key on the floor.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: What?

MULDER: That's number six. It's a match to the one Howard Crittendon found in his wife's coat pocket. What would this be doing here?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I don't know.

MULDER: Ellen, do you recognize this key?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Well, I was sweeping the floor and it got caught up in the sweeper. I-I... never saw it before today.

MULDER: You found it before you were attacked?

ELLEN ADDERLY: Right before. Right before I saw the raven.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Let me see if my department can run this down, find out what lock it goes to.

(LATER. 12:38 AM. ADDERLY's bedroom. PHIL gets out of bed and leaves.)



SCENE 12

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY is standing outside a ratty hotel. Pineview Lodge. Flickering neon sign. He goes to room number six and uses the key to enter. A woman puts her arms around him from behind. It is JENNY UPHOUSE. She is wearing short satin pajamas and is very affectionate.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: Hi.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I can't do this anymore.

(JENNY UPHOUSE begins undressing him.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: You can't, huh?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: No. We got to stop.

JENNY UPHOUSE: Well, that's too bad.

(They kiss and JENNY UPHOUSE wraps her legs around his waist. He gives in and carries her to the bed. In the mirrors over the bed, we see her straddling his hips as she removes her top.)



SCENE 13

(Next morning. ADDERLY's house. MULDER comes downstairs in his slacks and t-shirt. ELLEN ADDERLY is making breakfast, pouring the hollandaise sauce over the Eggs Benedict. For those of you unfamiliar with gourmet breakfast, this is a very fancy dish.)

MULDER: Oh, hey-- good morning. Good morning, Ellen.

(He sees breakfast.)

MULDER: Wow... Uh, have you seen my shirt? I left it...

ELLEN ADDERLY: Oh, I'm sorry. It's over here.

(ELLEN ADDERLY goes over to the door where she has hung his neatly washed and ironed dark blue shirt.)

MULDER: Oh. Oh, Ellen, you-you didn't have to go to the trouble of...

ELLEN ADDERLY: No, it's no trouble. Actually, it helps me. Whenever my life's a mess, I just do some housework. It gives me the illusion I'm in control.

MULDER: Well, maybe I should try that sometime.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Hey, have a seat.

(MULDER sits and she serves him the Eggs Benedict.)

MULDER: Thanks. Yikes. Wow...

ELLEN ADDERLY: It's just Phil's breakfast times two.

MULDER: Well, Phil is living large. Where is he this morning?

ELLEN ADDERLY: (serving coffee) Out-- probably out on a call. He'll be back. You... you can just dig in.

(She sits and watches MULDER begin his breakfast. He takes a sip of coffee. It is hot.)

MULDER: Whoa.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Sorry. Do you need milk?

MULDER: Uh-uh. That's fine.

ELLEN ADDERLY: I get the feeling you're not used to anyone taking care of you.

MULDER: Well, that has a vaguely pathetic ring to it.

ELLEN ADDERLY: No, I just meant I didn't notice a wedding band.

MULDER: Oh.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Do you have a ... a significant other?

MULDER: Um, not in the widely understood definition of that term.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Ah. Well, the right woman will come along and change all that. Don't miss out on home and family, Mr. Mulder. With all the terrible things you must see in your work-- well, it could be a refuge for you.

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY, still in uniform enters the house.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Hi, Honey.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Sorry I'm late-- paperwork. Good morning, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Good morning.

ELLEN ADDERLY: I'm going to go check on Katy.

(ELLEN leaves the men alone.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: You sleep well?

MULDER: Eh, I only woke up once, when you went out.

(The two men look intently at one another. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY looks away.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Well, I'll try to be quieter next time. We got a deputy out-- we're shorthanded. I had to take some calls.

MULDER: All night?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Yeah. We were busy.

MULDER: Well, I spoke to the coroner this morning and the autopsy shows that Martha Crittendon was four weeks pregnant when she died-- despite her birth control pills. She probably didn't even know it. Any idea who the father might be? I mean, Howard's vasectomy pretty much puts him out of the running. (pause) Any inkling who it might be?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Just say what's on your mind, Agent.

MULDER: You have a piece of evidence in your possession that I'd like back-- the skeleton key. Number six.

(SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY sighs, gets up and goes to his coat and hands the key to MULDER.)

MULDER: You want to tell me what this unlocks?

(No answer.)

MULDER: Once I find out, we'll talk again.

(ELLEN returns carrying the baby.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I'm going to hit the shower.

(Door closes. SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY looks at himself in the bathroom mirror.)



SCENE 14

(In the hotel room, JENNY UPHOUSE is on the phone. Her breasts are  visible.)

JENNY UPHOUSE: (on phone) I know, Bret, sweetie. I'm sorry. No, I'm going to be home real soon. Mommy had to work a double shift. I know. I'm going to come home and make you breakfast. I know... No, no, no, don't eat a lot of cookies, no. Only two. I... Yes, oatmeal cookies have oatmeal in them. Okay, all right, three. I love you. (she kisses over the phone) Bye.

(She hangs up. She hears a series of caws coming from outside and goes to the window to look. Several ravens are sitting on the fence outside. The mirror above the bed suddenly shatters and the stringy-haired figure attacks. JENNY manages to slash the figure's shoulder with a broken piece of mirror. The fight continues.)



SCENE 15

(Hotel parking lot. Later. Crime scene investigation underway. MULDER tries the key successfully in the lock. He sees JENNY UPHOUSE's body, then goes over to where SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY is leaning against a car.)

MULDER: Sheriff, you know that talk I said we should have?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: (despondent) I left her sleeping.

MULDER: So you were having an affair with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon? (Sheriff nods slightly) I got to hand it to you, Sheriff. You put the service back into "protect and serve."

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I cared about both of them.

MULDER: They knew about each other? (another nod) But I'm assuming Ellen doesn't.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: No. But even if she did, she'd find a way to rationalize it. I'm not defending myself, but... two years ago I wanted a divorce. Ellen won't hear it. She got pregnant with Katie and locked me up good.

MULDER: Well, I think you got bigger problems facing you right now.

(They look over to where JENNY UPHOUSE's plastic-wrapped body is wheeled out on a stretcher.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: I didn't do this, I swear to you. Anyway, what about the broken mirrors and the raven? Y-you said that it was a-an entity that did this. Don't you still believe that?

MULDER: I said it was an entity summoned by somebody else ....

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Whether or not they even knew about it. I mean, is that possible? Can I be the reason for all this... and not even know about it?



SCENE 16

(Inside the ADDERLY's house. The phone rings and the machine picks up.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: (recorded voice) Hi, you've reached the Adderlys-- Phil, Ellen and Katy. Please leave a message.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: (on answering machine) Ellen, this is Phil. I was really hoping you'd be home. Look, I'm in a bit of a situation here and there's things we need to talk about but Agent Mulder's on his way over there to explain it all to you so if you get this message you just wait there for him, okay? Thanks.

(Right after the machine clicks off, ELLEN ADDERLY enters the house carrying her daughter.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: I think this sleepy little girl needs a nap. I sure do. Are you eating mama's jacket?

(ELLEN ADDERLY carries the baby upstairs, puts a passy in her mouth and puts her to bed. We see a deep scratch on her shoulder.)

ELLEN ADDERLY: Go to sleep now. Okay, baby? Mama loves you. I love you. Yes, I do.



SCENE 17

(ADDERLY house.)

(ELLEN goes into the bathroom. She turns the water in the tub off and begins to put her hair up with a clip. As her hand brushes her shoulder we again see the large deep wound. Startled, she turns to look at the wound in the mirror. She clearly has no idea how it got there. She has flashes of attacking JENNY in the motel room.)

(Downstairs, MULDER uses his key to enter the house.)

MULDER: Ellen? Ellen?

(His phone rings and he answers it.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder? I am free.

MULDER: (on phone) You're free?

SCULLY: (on phone) Mm-hmm. I'm going to go home, take a shower for, I don't know eight or nine hours, burn the clothes that I'm wearing and then... sleep until late spring.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, you solved the X-File.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, except it's not an X-File, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) What are you saying? You didn't catch our blond mystery serial killer?

SCULLY: (on phone) Oh, no, we caught her, but she isn't a serial killer nor is she a blonde, and she isn't even a she.

(SCULLY is looking through the telescope at a man wearing high-heeled leopard skin boots, mini-skirt, and wigless, shaved head.)

MULDER: (on phone) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: (on phone) What I'm talking about is the six missing prostitutes aren't dead, Mulder. They are alive and well in a halfway house that was set up by this mystery blond who happens to go by the name of Mark Scott Egbert and Mr. Egbert wishes to acquaint lost souls with the teachings of Christ and that's his hook, I guess. He dresses up like a fellow prostitute to make the girls feel at ease but this vanishing act is no more paranormal than a change of wardrobe, Mulder. He goes into a place like a, like a woman and he comes out as a man, right under...

MULDER: . our noses.

SCULLY: Exactly. A wolf in sheep's clothing or I guess, in this case, a sheep in wolf's clothing.

(MULDER is a little disappointed that it wasn't an X-File and distracted as he realizes Scully has given him the answer he needs for his case.)

MULDER: (on phone) Well, good work, Scully. I'll call you back later.

(He hangs up. He hears crying and knocks at the bedroom door.)

MULDER: Ellen? Ellen, it's Agent Mulder.

ELLEN ADDERLY: (voice from the bedroom) Please go away.

MULDER: Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead. Your husband is in custody suspected of murdering her only I don't think he did it. Do you?

(ELLEN is sitting naked in her bedroom. She touches her wound on her shoulder. She is on the verge of tears again.)

MULDER: Ellen, you went out this morning after breakfast. Where'd you go?

ELLEN ADDERLY: (touching her wound) It's not me. It can't be.

MULDER: I think it is. Ellen, I think you have a whole other side that you're afraid to face. That would explain all the broken mirrors. You don't want to see yourself for what you really are. Ellen, you have to come out of there.

ELLEN ADDERLY: Then what? My marriage, my life... everything I thought I had... is nothing. It's all lies. I wish you'd never come here.

(As she speaks, the camera pans around from behind her until we finally see her face. Her eyes are pure black, no pupils.)

MULDER: Ellen, you need to open this door.

(MULDER takes out his gun. Just then, the "creature" bursts through the door and attacks MULDER. Mirrors shatter around them. She throws him through a door into the bathroom and pushes him into the tub and holds him under the water. MULDER struggles unsuccessfully. When the creature sees her reflection in the water she lets go. MULDER rises from the water and takes a deep breath. He sees ELLEN huddled naked on the floor.)



SCENE 18
DESCHAMPS COUNTY
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

(MULDER is sitting in an observation room with ELLEN ADDERLY. She is huddled on the floor, non-responsive. MULDER goes out of the room where SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY is looking through the window at her.)

MULDER: You want to see her?

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Does she want to see me?

(MULDER shrugs and shakes his head, he doesn't know.)

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Doctors say she's got some kind of... dissociative disorder, split personality. That doesn't explain what happened, does it?

MULDER: I think it's about as close as science can come. I think the basic idea is right. There are some multiple personality disorders where an alternate personality displays traits that the host doesn't have-- like nearsightedness or high blood pressure or even diabetes. I think in Ellen's case the changes were just a lot more extreme.

SHERIFF PHIL ADDERLY: Like Jekyll and Hyde?

MULDER: She wanted so much from her life with you-- a perfect life-- and I think that at some point she found out you were cheating with Jenny and Martha, I don't know when, but at some point she did, and... and, like you said, I think she had to rationalize that. She just bottled up her anger, swallowed it, and it had to come out some way. I think she did what she did to protect her family.

(In the room, ELLEN ADDERLY hears a raven cawing. She gets up and goes to the window. A raven is sitting on the ledge outside the window. She stares at it.)

[THE END]


                               ALL THINGS



SCENE 1

(Early morning. Rhythmic dripping sound. SCULLY is getting dressed in a bathroom. A ceiling fan spins slowly above her. She pulls down her green t-shirt, then zips up her black skirt. The old faucet drips rhythmically as she looks at herself in the mirror, fixes her hair, then walks into the other room, a bedroom.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) Time passes in moments ... moments which, rushing past define the path of a life just as surely as they lead towards its end. How rarely do we stop to examine that path, to see the reasons why all things happen, to consider whether the path we take in life is our own making or simply one into which we drift with eyes closed.

(She picks up her black jacket and puts it on. She looks thoughtfully at the figure in the bed for a moment, then walks quietly out of the room.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) But what if we could stop, pause to take stock of each precious moment before it passes? Might we then see the endless forks in the road that have shaped a life? And, seeing those choices, choose another path?

(The camera pans across the bed. We see a man's naked foot and leg lying tangled among the blue sheets and beige comforter. Moving up, we see his bare arms and chest and peacefully sleeping face. It is MULDER.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
63 HOURS EARLIER

(X-Files office. Close up on the slide projector's light as it flickers in time to the music playing loudly on the boom box on the desk. "The Sky is Broken" by Moby. Very hypnotic style, rhythmic drumbeat. MULDER, casually dressed, is dancing slightly to the beat as he arranges the slides. SCULLY enters carrying a paper bag.)

MUSIC: "See, the storm has broken in the middle of the night nothing left here for me, it's washed away the rain pushes the buildings aside... "

SCULLY: I got the lab to rush the results of...

(SCULLY turns off the music.)

SCULLY: I said, I got the lab to rush the results of the Szczesny autopsy, if you're interested.

(SCULLY pulls out a packed salad and sets it on her desk.)

MULDER: I heard you, Scully.

SCULLY: And Szczesny did indeed drown but not as the result of the inhalation of ectoplasm as you so vehemently suggested.

MULDER: Well, what else could she possibly have drowned in?

SCULLY: Margarita mix, upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado Gold tequila which, as it turns out she and her friends rapidly consumed in the woods while trying to reenact the Blair Witch Project.

MULDER: Well, I think that demands a little deeper investigation, don't you?

SCULLY: No, I don't.

MULDER: Well, it doesn't matter. We got bigger fish to fry.

(SCULLY pulls a wrapped sandwich out of the bag as MULDER advances the slide projector to show three crop circles.)

MULDER: Have a seat, Scully. Check this out. Is that beautiful or what?

SCULLY: Crop circles, Mulder?

MULDER: Computer-generated crop circles. It's a fractal image predicted by a computer program and using data of every known occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 years.

(MULDER takes a bite of the sandwich that she hands him.)

MULDER: What most people don't realize is that, since 1991...

(Sound of slides changing. MULDER continues his monologue while watching SCULLY prepare and eat her salad. She doesn't look up once.)

MULDER: ... there's been a dramatic increase in size and complexity of circle design. That's when the Mandelbrot Set appeared in England.

(SCULLY methodically drips dressing using a fork from a small cup onto her salad.)

MULDER: A series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost impossibly overnight in a field near Cambridge.

(MULDER pauses and watches her. He clicks to the next slide.)

MULDER: But that was merely prelude of what was to come. Three years later, in 1994 even more complex formations occurred simultaneously on opposite ends of the English countryside with the Mandelbrot Set, were it still there, at its center. Then, in 1997, even more complex formations occurred...

(SCULLY is completely engrossed in her salad. MULDER pauses.)

MULDER: ... and I'm not wearing any pants right now.

(SCULLY looks up from the salad after a beat of silence.)

SCULLY: Hmm?

MULDER: You're not listening.

SCULLY: I am.

(He looks at her.)

SCULLY: I guess I just don't see the point.

MULDER: The point is is that a computer program has shown us that these are not just random, happenstance coincidental occurrences and that same program has predicted that in just 48 hours even more complex formations are going to be laid down in a field near Avebury-- 48 hours, Scully-- but I wouldn't mind getting there earlier if you don't mind.

SCULLY: Getting where?

MULDER: England - I got two tickets on a 5:30 flight.

SCULLY: Mulder, I still have to go over to the hospital and-and-and finish the final paperwork on the autopsy you had me do. And, to be honest, it's Saturday and I wouldn't mind, I don't know, taking a bath?

MULDER: Well, what the hell does that mean?

(As SCULLY speaks, she stabs the air with her fork containing a piece of lettuce to emphasize her remarks.)

SCULLY: What it means, Mulder, is I'm not interested in tracking down some sneaky farmers who happened to ace geometry in high school.

(MULDER looks hurt.)

SCULLY: And besides, I mean... what could you possibly get out of this? Or learn? I mean, it's not even remotely FBI-related.

(MULDER is disappointed, but not devastated.)

MULDER: I'll just cancel your ticket.

(He takes another bite of the sandwich thing she brought for him.)

MULDER: Thanks for lunch.

(He puts the rest of the sandwich next to the slide projector on top of the hand-held advance unit. Then he picks up his coat and starts out the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(He stops in the doorway and looks back at her.)

SCULLY: Look, we're always running. We're always chasing the next big thing. Why don't you ever just stay still?

MULDER: I wouldn't know what I'd be missing.

(MULDER leaves. The half-eaten sandwich and advance unit falls to the floor. SCULLY sighs as she is left alone with the now auto-advancing slide projector. The clicking sound segues into the next scene.)



SCENE 3
WASHINGTON NATIONAL HOSPITAL

(Hospital nurses station. Two NURSES are at the desk. One NURSE with blonde hair, is tapping a pencil rhythmically on the surface of the desk as SCULLY walks up.)

SCULLY: My name is Dana Scully and I was told I could pick up a postmortem folder for a Ms. Szczesny here. It's, uh, for the FBI.

NURSE 2: Let's see...

(NURSE 2 is surprised as NURSE 1, the blonde, silently hands SCULLY a file from the holder on the desk.)

NURSE 2: Oh!

(In slow motion SCULLY takes the file. The pencil keeps tapping. Time slows down around it.)

NURSE 2: You just sign here, please.

(SCULLY looks at her. All is normal again.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY signs, takes the folder and removes an image of a patient's brain from the folder. She looks down at the folder. The name SZCZESNY is on the folder, but the name D. WATERSTON is on the x-ray. SCULLY looks at it in surprise and confusion. She returns to the NURSES station. The blonde NURSE is no longer there.)

SCULLY: Hi, um... I was given the wrong test results. This, uh, x-ray marked "D. Waterston" was in the envelope marked "Szczesny." I was expecting autopsy results.

NURSE 2: Oh, I'm sorry. They must've gotten switched. Sorry for the inconvenience.

(NURSE 2 hands her another folder.)

SCULLY: Thank you. Is the, um... is the "D. Waterston" that was on the x-ray is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?

NURSE: (Looking at her charts) Let's see: Waterston, Waterston... Yes, it is. Admitted yesterday, coronary care unit, room 306.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY goes to room 306. A man, DR. KOPEIKAN, is talking to a young woman, MAGGIE WATERSTON. SCULLY watches from the doorway.)

DR. KOPEIKAN: I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. Everything appears to be as it should under the circumstances so don't worry. If you'd like, I can show you the hospital cafeteria.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (upset, not sure of what to do) Uh, yeah, I guess... Yeah, okay.

(SCULLY ducks out of the way and grabs a magazine as MAGGIE WATERSTON and DR. KOPEIKAN pass her. She is not looking at the magazine, "FUNG SHUI LIFE.")

MAGGIE WATERSTON: Are there phones down there, too? I need to make some phone calls.

DR. KOPEIKAN: Yes.

(They are gone. A heart monitor is beeping. SCULLY enters the room and pushes back the curtain. All other sound stops as she looks at the patient. Slow motion. A bell chimes ten times. A man, DANIEL WATERSTON, is lying in the bed asleep. He is a handsome older man, late 50's. SCULLY gazes at him.)

DR. KOPEIKAN: Excuse me...

(SCULLY is startled. Sound of heart monitor starts again. Slow motion stops. DR. KOPEIKAN is in the doorway.)

DR. KOPEIKAN: Can I help you with something?

SCULLY: Um, I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Scully. I-I was just in the hospital and...

DR. KOPEIKAN: Can we step into the hallway?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(SCULLY follows him into the hallway.)

DR. KOPEIKAN: I'm Dr. Waterston's cardiologist, Paul Kopeikan. Did you say your name was Scully?

SCULLY: Uh, yes, Dana Scully.

DR. KOPEIKAN: Dr. Waterston's mentioned you.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.

DR. KOPEIKAN: No, you were a student of his, right?

(SCULLY does not answer.)

SCULLY: He has a heart condition?

DR. KOPEIKAN: Dr. Waterston came in yesterday with severe chest pains and he ordered us to do an echocardiogram and a biopsy because he'd had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection the week before. Fortunately, it was the right call.

SCULLY: Then it's serious.

DR. KOPEIKAN: But treatable. I have to wake him up soon, if you'd care to...

SCULLY: No, that's all right. But, uh, thanks for your time.

DR. KOPEIKAN: He must've been a wonderful teacher. I've been following his work on constrictive pericarditis for years now.

SCULLY: Yes... he's a remarkable man.



SCENE 4

(SCULLY's apartment. Late afternoon. In the foreground, one of the curtain pulls is swinging back and forth tapping the window frame rhythmically, like a heartbeat. SCULLY enters just as the phone rings. She answers it. )

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone, voice) You came to see him.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry, who is this?

(MAGGIE WATERSTON is in the hospital waiting room.)

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone) Margaret Waterston.

SCULLY: (on phone) Maggie. Is everything all right?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone) Well, that depends, doesn't it?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone) Whatever. Dr. Kopeikan told my father you were here and now he wants to see you.

SCULLY: (on phone) About what?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone) Look, he asked me to call, so I'm calling.

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, Maggie. I don't know if I've got time.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone, voice) Don't know if you have the time.

(The call waiting signal on SCULLY's phone beeps.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Maggie, can you hang on a second? I have another call coming through.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone, voice) Listen... it's your choice, but if you come it doesn't mean I accept you being in his life.

(MAGGIE WATERSTON hangs up quickly. SCULLY presses the flash button to connect to the other call. The curtain pull keeps tapping.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

(In his apartment, MULDER is packing. An old black and white movie is on TV. [Camille?] It is a critical moment in the movie where the hero is saying goodbye to his heroine. MULDER's phone is on speaker, so SCULLY can hear the movie.)

MAN ON OLD BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE ON TV: I'll never see you again.

SCULLY: Hello?

(Surprised to hear her voice, MULDER stops packing and runs to turn down the TV.)

MAN ON OLD TV MOVIE: You're breaking my heart.

MULDER: (on speaker phone) Hey, you're there?

(MULDER picks up the receiver.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hey.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, aren't you supposed to be on a plane?

MULDER: (On phone) I got a 5:30 flight, remember?

SCULLY: (on phone) Right. Guess I lost track of time.

MULDER: (on phone) Listen, uh, the reason I called-- am I catching you at a bad time?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, I just walked in. Why?

MULDER: (on phone) Uh, there's this group in D.C. that is researching crop circles. They've got a totally different set of coordinates from the one that I got already.

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I'm not going.

MULDER: (on phone) I got to ask you a favor. One of the researchers lives out near the hospital and they've got these sensitive photos and data and stuff that they won't fax to me so I was just wondering if you would just, maybe go over there and, you know, and get it and put it in the bureau pouch for me...

(Mulder's voice fades out as SCULLY gazes at the swinging curtain pull. It goes into slow motion. MULDER's voice breaks through again and the pull begins tapping in normal time.)

MULDER: (on phone) Speak to me, Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm out for the evening, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone, shutting down defensively) Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?

SCULLY: (on phone) Look, um... why don't you leave that address on my answering machine and, uh, I'll try for you.

(She hangs up.)



SCENE 5

(Back at the hospital. Close up of wheels of a gurney being pushed down the hall. SCULLY walks down the cardio hall and enters the room. A person lies in bed surrounded by family and friends, including a tall RED-HAIRED WOMAN who looks up at SCULLY. SCULLY steps back in surprise. She looks up at the room number. She had entered room 304 by mistake.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I-I have the wrong room.

RED-HAIRED WOMAN: (friendly, smiling) It's okay.

(She walks on down to room 306 and enters. DANIEL WATERSTON is sitting up in bed. MAGGIE WATERSTON looks up from her magazine and angrily leaves the room. SCULLY and DANIEL WATERSTON look at each other for a moment.)

SCULLY: Hi.

DANIEL WATERSTON: So I have to lock eyes with the Devil for you to grace me with your presence?

SCULLY: Surely not the Devil.

(He gives a little nod of acknowledgement.)

SCULLY: How are you feeling, Daniel?

DANIEL WATERSTON: It's a real drag when the body doesn't want to play anymore.

SCULLY: You're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis.

DANIEL WATERSTON: Luck has nothing to do with it, Dana. It's what doctors do everyday. You may have forgotten that.

SCULLY: (softly, looking away for a moment) Daniel...

(Pause.)

SCULLY: So, how did you happen to be here in Washington?

DANIEL WATERSTON: That's a long story.

(He reaches out and takes her hand. She stares at their intimately clasped hands for a moment, then she sits in the chair beside him.)

DANIEL WATERSTON: How's the FBI?

SCULLY: Is that why you wanted to see me? To remind me once again what a bad choice I made?

DANIEL WATERSTON: (pressing her hand to his lips, shaking his head) Believe me. My motivation is far more selfish than that.

SCULLY: You scare me, Daniel.

(He lets go of her hand.)

DANIEL WATERSTON: I know. I scare you... (he doesn't like scaring her) ... because I represent that which is ingrained not only in your mind but in your heart-- that which you secretly long for.

SCULLY: You never accepted my reason for leaving.

DANIEL WATERSTON: It wasn't a reason, it was an excuse.

SCULLY: But you understood why.

DANIEL WATERSTON: I can't believe the FBI is a passion. Not like medicine.

(SCULLY rises.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry I came.

(DANIEL WATERSTON gently strokes her face with his finger.)

SCULLY: I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

DANIEL WATERSTON: (looking at her longingly) I know how difficult it must have been for you... just walking through that door but you wouldn't have come if you didn't want to and that says something, doesn't it?

(Later, outside the hospital, SCULLY gets into her silver car. Just as she closes the door, her phone rings, so she doesn't put on her seatbelt. She starts the car and enters traffic.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(MULDER is in an airport.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) I was just about to leave you a message. Listen, I got that, uh, that address that I wanted you to go to for me. It's a woman you're going to be dealing with. She's affiliated with The American Taoist Healing Center.

SCULLY: (on phone) She researches crop circles?

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Don't roll your eyes, Scully.

(SCULLY rolls her eyes. She turns on her left turn signal as the light turns yellow. It clicks rhythmically. The car in front of her makes the left turn, and SCULLY starts to follow.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder you want me to...?

(As SCULLY pulls forward to turn left, a woman with a blonde ponytail in a baseball cap walks in front of her car. It is the blonde NURSE from earlier, now in casual clothes. SCULLY drops the phone and slams on the brakes just as a large truck speeds through the intersection. In slow motion, the blonde woman looks over her shoulder and smiles at SCULLY. The turn signal clicks rhythmically.)

MULDER: (on phone, voice) Scully? Scully, you there?

(SCULLY stares after the woman.)



SCENE 6

(Night. Close-up of a sprinkler running. SCULLY arrives at a house in a nice neighborhood. She parks her car in the driveway, gets out and walks up to the doorway. She rings the doorbell. The RED HEADED WOMAN from the hospital answers the door.)

SCULLY: Hi. I'm...

(They recognize each other.)

SCULLY: You were...

WOMAN: (nodding) ... at the hospital today.

SCULLY: Right. That's strange. Um, I-I'm Agent Scully. I'm-I'm here on behalf of my partner.

WOMAN: About my research.

SCULLY: For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.

WOMAN: Right. I'm Colleen Azar. Would you like to come in?

SCULLY: No, thank you. I think I need some fresh air.

COLLEEN AZAR: (concerned) Are you all right?

SCULLY: Yes, I... I mean, yes, I-I'm just a little shaken. I... a near car accident, I think. It's nothing, really.

COLLEEN AZAR: A car accident isn't "nothing."

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

COLLEEN AZAR: In my experience they're often the end results of us not paying attention to something.

SCULLY: Look, I-I don't mean to be rude but I really don't have much time.

COLLEEN AZAR: Sure. I'll go get my papers.

(COLEEN gets a folder.)

COLLEEN AZAR: You think what we do is a little ridiculous, don't you?

SCULLY: Uh, to be honest, I don't know exactly what it is that you do.

COLLEEN AZAR: But you've already formed a judgment about it.

SCULLY: I really should be going.

COLLEEN AZAR: There is a greater intelligence in all things. Accidents-- or near accidents-- often remind us that we need to keep our mind open to the lessons it gives.

(She hands the folder to SCULLY.)

COLLEEN AZAR: (directly) You may want to slow down.

(COLLEEN AZAR releases the folder and shuts the door. SCULLY sighs in displeasure at the woman's audacity. As she turns, she drops the contents of the folder. In slow motion, she sighs and bends down to pick up the papers. She stares at one of the images on a paper. It is an Oriental symbol on a green crop circle - the heart chakra. SCULLY is snapped back into real time by her ringing cell phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello.



SCENE 7

(Hospital. DANIEL WATERSTON's room. Heart monitor beeping. SCULLY and DR. KOPEIKAN join DANIEL WATERSTON and MAGGIE WATERSTON.)

DANIEL WATERSTON: Aw, Hurricane Scully has arrived.

SCULLY: I was summoned.

DANIEL WATERSTON: Would you please tell the doc here why he should listen to me.

DR. KOPEIKAN: Sir, we've already agreed to doses of digoxin that are far beyond what I normally recommend.

DANIEL WATERSTON: I guarantee you, Doctor, you're doing it right.

DR. KOPEIKAN: But I can't be responsible for treatment that might exacerbate your illness. There hasn't even been a double-blind analysis of prednisone's effect.

SCULLY: Prednisone? That won't complicate cardiac arrhythmia. Not if it's just a short burst.

DANIEL WATERSTON: There. An informed opinion.

(DR. KOPEIKAN leaves the room.)

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (bitterly to SCULLY, as she leaves the room) You come off so rational but maybe you know less than you think.

(DANIEL WATERSTON sighs.)

DANIEL WATERSTON: She's ... been through some difficult times and she's very angry.

SCULLY: How did she even find out?

DANIEL WATERSTON: There are things you don't know... things I'm not proud of.

SCULLY: What things?

DANIEL WATERSTON: I screwed up, Dana. Things got bad at home after...

(SCULLY sits. Pause.)

SCULLY: Bad how?

DANIEL WATERSTON: I haven't been completely honest with you. It was hard for me... when you walked away. Shut down from my family and needless to say, it was very difficult for Barbara.

SCULLY: You divorced.

DANIEL WATERSTON: Only after an interminable period of discomfort for us both.

SCULLY: Where did you go?

DANIEL WATERSTON: Here. Washington.

SCULLY: When?

DANIEL WATERSTON: (softly) Almost ten years ago.

SCULLY: (also softly) Daniel... you didn't move here for me?

DANIEL WATERSTON: I didn't mean for it to happen this way, of course.

(SCULLY does not know how to process this information.)

SCULLY: Oh, God.

(She begins to cry.)

SCULLY: You've come at such a strange time.

DANIEL WATERSTON: I know, I know. You-you have a life.

SCULLY: (shaking her head) I don't know what I have. I mean... your x-rays were in the wrong envelope. I never would have even known you were here if it wasn't for a mix-up. It's just...

DANIEL WATERSTON: What do you want, Dana?

SCULLY: I want everything I should want at this time of my life. Maybe I want the life I didn't choose.

(SCULLY is crying softly. He holds his hand out to her. She clasps it with her own, then lays her head down on DANIEL WATERSTON's chest. He softly strokes her hair. She calms, her crying stops. She looks peaceful. The beep of the heart monitor matches the beat of the music under it. As SCULLY rests on his chest the monitor changes tempo, getting faster, then flat-lining. SCULLY jumps up in full doctor mode and begins performing CPR. She frantically calls to the nurse down the hall.)

SCULLY: Nurse! We have a code in here! Nurse!

(Hospital room. SCULLY is still trying to revive DANIEL WATERSTON. The NURSES arrives with the crash cart.)

INTERCOM VOICE: Code blue, C.C.U.

SCULLY: He's in v-fib, get his head.

(A NURSE switches pillows under DANIEL WATERSTON's head. SCULLY gives mouth-to-mouth until another NURSE arrives with an oxygen mask.)

SCULLY: In!

NURSE: In.

(SCULLY gets the defibrillator paddles off the crash cart.)

SCULLY: 200 joules. All clear?

NURSE: Clear.

(SCULLY applies the defibrillator paddles. Still there is the flatline tone.)

NURSE: No pulse, no resp.

SCULLY: 300 joules.

NURSE 3: 300 charge.

SCULLY: Clear!

NURSE: Clear.

(SCULLY applies the paddles again. Still the flatline tone continues.)

NURSE: No pulse, no resp.

SCULLY: Epinephrine, one milligram, I.V. Push. Now! Who's paying attention?!

(The injection is readied.)

NURSE 3: Ready.

SCULLY: Clear!

NURSES: Clear.

(SCULLY applies the paddle again. There is the sound of the flatline tone, then the heart monitor begins beeping normally again.)

SCULLY: We have a pulse.

(The blonde NURSE checks the heart beat.)

SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.

(SCULLY is gasping for breath, relieved and exhausted.)



SCENE 8

(Next day. Raining. SCULLY arrives at COLLEEN AZAR's house and rings the buzzer. A woman, CAROL, answers.)

CAROL: Hi, can I help you?

SCULLY: Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.

CAROL: You want to come in?

SCULLY: I just need to speak with her that's all.

(CAROL steps aside so SCULLY can enter. The house is tastefully decorated with lots of Eastern influences. SCULLY, awed, admires the simplicity of the furnishings. A small chime is ringing, slow motion. The moment is broken when CAROL and COLLEEN enter the foyer.)

CAROL: I have to go. Call me if anything interesting happens.

COLLEEN AZAR: Okay. Bye.

(The two women kiss on the lips and CAROL leaves. SCULLY looks away, then COLLEEN AZAR approaches her.)

COLLEEN AZAR: I'm surprised to see you again.

SCULLY: I'm sorry that I was rude before. I'm a medical doctor and a scientist and, you're right, I don't know what it is that you do ... but there was something that you said that I wanted to ask you about.

COLLEEN AZAR: About slowing down? Would you like to sit down? Please.

(SCULLY joins her on the couch. A small fountain is on the coffee table.)

SCULLY: I have a friend who's ill, and, um... I had a strange feeling today-- just a short while ago, actually-- that he may be dying from a more serious condition than anyone realizes.

COLLEEN AZAR: You sense something? Holistic practitioners believe, as do many eastern religions, that living beings exist beyond the physical dimensions of time and space that we're composed of layers of energy and consciousness. You've probably heard it referred to as an "aura."

(Oh boy, has she.)

SCULLY: Hmm... Yes.

COLLEEN AZAR: Witness this energy field and truths come out that have little to do with scientific proof and much to do with faith.

SCULLY: What are you saying that I saw?

COLLEEN AZAR: Pain. And where there's pain there's a need for healing-- physically, mentally or spiritually.

SCULLY: But he has a heart condition.

COLLEEN AZAR: When we hold onto shame and guilt and fear it creates imbalance, makes us forget who we are.

(SCULLY sighs.)

COLLEEN AZAR: This is difficult for you to accept.

(COLLEEN AZAR gently places her hand on SCULLY's leg. In the background, we hear a tea kettle whistling.)

COLLEEN AZAR: (brightly) Would you like to have some tea?

(Later, COLLEEN AZAR is pouring tea for them. SCULLY is contemplating a piece of hanging sculpture.)

COLLEEN AZAR: Have you ever had moments when everything gets incredibly clear? When time seems to expand?

SCULLY: Yes. It's so strange.

COLLEEN AZAR: You may be more open to things than you think. It's just a matter of what you do with it.

(She hands SCULLY her cup of tea as SCULLY reflects on her words. COLLEEN takes her cup and leans against the kitchen sink.)

COLLEEN AZAR: I used to be a physicist. I was successful in my field working 80-odd hours a week. I thought I was happy. Truth is, I was cut off from the world and from myself. I was literally dying inside. I was in a relationship with Carol, who you met but I was so afraid of what the world and my family and my fellow scientists would think that I told no one. Then, two years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

(SCULLY is very sympathetic.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

COLLEEN AZAR: (she takes a sip of tea) Mmm... Don't be. It's the cancer that got my attention. It stopped me from being on the self-destructive path I was on. It made me realize I was in a field that had little meaning for me and it's what's allowed me to be happy for what feels like the first time in my life.

SCULLY: But how?

COLLEEN AZAR: I was introduced to a healer who helped me see the disease for what it was. It wasn't until I began releasing shame and telling the truth that my cancer went into remission.

(SCULLY looks down.)

COLLEEN AZAR: You still aren't sure. You came here looking for answers and you want something to take back with you. Everything happens for a reason.

(SCULLY looks at her.)



SCENE 9

(Hospital. SCULLY enters carrying a bouquet of red flowers. She sees MAGGIE WATERSTON.)

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (angrily) Are you happy?

SCULLY: I'm sorry? I was just going up to see your father.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: You can't. He's in a coma.

SCULLY: Since when?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (angry) Since about two minutes after you supposedly saved his life.

(SCULLY starts to continue down the hall. MAGGIE WATERSTON steps in front of her.)

MAGGIE WATERSTON: Do you have any idea the hell you created in our lives?

SCULLY: Maggie, to be honest, I left so that there wouldn't be hell in your lives.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: Don't try to be reasonable with me. I am so sick of being reasonable. You moved on but we've had to live with what you left behind.

CUT TO:

(Out on the street. The rain has stopped. The same rhythmic song that MULDER was playing in the office earlier plays under the scene. SCULLY, flowers hanging limply from her hand is walking slow motion down the sidewalk through a Chinatown. Her black coat billows in the wind. Very surreal. Two men slowly turn and watch her as she passes. She turns and looks up at a slow-motion swinging sign above her. Apothecary, in English and Chinese characters. The music stops and the sign creaking rhythmically is the only sound. She sees the blonde woman in the baseball hat walking across the block. SCULLY runs after her. She is almost hit by a bicyclist, breaking the slow motion. She pauses and continues after the woman. She loses her, but stops at a plain wooden door. She enters. It is a peaceful Oriental garden with a pair of ornate red doors at one end. SCULLY enters the doors. Inside is a beautifully lit temple with a golden statue of Buddha. Votive candles surround it. SCULLY kneels in the rays of light streaming from above and sways as she closes her eyes, trancelike. Bright light, she has a vision. Images from her life rush past her. Still images of her family at her father's funeral, her father in dress whites, her mother, Mulder, Cigarette-Smoking Man, her sister, herself looking at Mulder for the first time in the pilot, the "I Want To Believe" poster, Colleen Azar, herself holding Emily, she and Mulder looking at her first UFO in Deep Throat, season 1, Mulder holding her in the hallway in Memento Mori, her frightened self just before she was abducted, and finally DANIEL WATERSTON lying transparent, floating in white light, his black heart thumping loudly, hypnotically. His lips move as if he is speaking silently. His eyes fly open suddenly. At the same time, SCULLY gasps and her eyes fly open. She is still in the temple. She catches her breath, very disturbed by what just happened. She looks up at the Buddha.)



SCENE 10

(DANIEL WATERSTON's hospital room. He is in a coma. SCULLY and MAGGIE WATERSTON watch as a man, the HEALER, holds his hands above DANIEL WATERSTON's chest. Another nurse, NURSE 3, is wheeling a medical cart down the hall. She sees what is going on through the window in the room. She walks away quickly.)

HEALER: What I try to do is clear the body's energy channels-- what we call Chakras-- which can become barriers to a doctor's ability to effectively heal the patient. When these channels are working improperly-- whether from poor physical or emotional health-- the block serves to create conditions for disease. If I can unblock the energy early on then I can prevent the onset or escalation of an illness or provide a place...

(He is interrupted by the arrival of DR. KOPEIKAN who was likely summoned by NURSE 3. He is not pleased.)

DR. KOPEIKAN: What's going on here? Dr. Scully, who do you think you are?

SCULLY: We have nothing but Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.

DR. KOPEIKAN: You're not his doctor.

SCULLY: I understand that. What's taking place here is an alternative approach.

DR. KOPEIKAN: What's taking place here is a waste of time, Dr. Scully, and I think that Dr. Waterston would be the first to agree with me. Have you considered that?

SCULLY: I just wanted to help him. It seemed like nothing else was working.

DR. KOPEIKAN: With all due respect that is not for you to assess. That is for me or Dr. Waterston's family to decide.

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (quietly) Then let him continue. If it isn't hurting him we should at least be open to it.

(MAGGIE WATERSTON and SCULLY look at each other.)

HEALER: I'm afraid there's really nothing more I can do at this time. This man, quite frankly, is ready to move on. But something seems to be holding him back. Unfinished business is binding him to the physical plane-- something he needs to release before he can let go.



SCENE 11

(SCULLY's apartment. Same rhythmic music from before playing under the scene. SCULLY moves in dreamlike slow motion.)

MUSIC: Broken heart pushing us hear the rain fall See the wind come to my eyes See the storm broken now I'm nothing Speak to me, baby in the middle of the night ...

(SCULLY is wearing a large white terry bathrobe and fuzzy slippers. She has made a cup of tea in her kitchen. As she passes through a door, the scene shifts and she is wearing a dark suit walking into a hospital room. SCULLY looks down at the bed and sees herself two and one half years ago dying of cancer. Her cancer self looks up and mouths the words along with the song.)

MUSIC: Speak to me...

(SCULLY's eyes fly open and she gasps as she sits up in bed, staring up. It was a dream. The phone is ringing. SCULLY, white satin pajamas, catches her breath and picks up the phone)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

MAGGIE WATERSTON: (on phone, voice) It's Maggie. I need you to come to the hospital right away.

SCULLY: (on phone) Maggie, what's...?

(MAGGIE WATERSTON hangs up.)



SCENE 12

(DANIEL WATERSTON's hospital room. SCULLY enters. DANIEL WATERSTON is awake.)

SCULLY: Daniel?

DANIEL WATERSTON: You think I'd give up so easily?

(SCULLY exhales and walks close to him.)

SCULLY: You were slipping away. No one thought you'd come out of this. I'm still in shock.

DANIEL WATERSTON: Imagine my shock when my doctor told me the voodoo ritual you'd arranged for last night.

SCULLY: I was afraid it didn't work.

DANIEL WATERSTON: (chuckling) Of course it didn't work. Don't be absurd. Where do you get this crap?

SCULLY: Daniel, that "crap" may have just saved your life whether you're open to it or not.

DANIEL WATERSTON: It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about that. Look at me. I'm going to get well... and we need to talk about... what happens next for us.

(He looks up at her confidently and warmly.)

SCULLY: I spoke at length to Maggie. It's time... that you took responsibility for the hurt you caused in your family. It's no accident that you got sick, Daniel. You've been running from the truth for ten years.

(DANIEL WATERSTON doesn't want to hear this.)

DANIEL WATERSTON: (a whisper) Dana... It was only to be with you. You were all I lived for.

SCULLY: Maybe the reason you're alive now is to make up for that. To make it up to Maggie.

DANIEL WATERSTON: That's Maggie talking, not you.

SCULLY: (voice breaking slightly) No. I'm not the same person, Daniel. I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't seen you again.

(SCULLY turns to see MAGGIE WATERSTON in the doorway. The three of them look at each other for a moment, then SCULLY leaves. MAGGIE WATERSTON hesitantly approaches her father.)

(Later, outside the hospital. SCULLY stands watching people pass. All is in slow motion. Two nuns walk past her. Camera circles around her. She sees the woman with the blonde ponytail. Slow motion stops. SCULLY runs past the nuns and stops the woman. Same clothes, but it is no longer the blonde woman. It is MULDER. He is wearing a cap that says "Stonehenge Rocks." He is happy to see her. She is surprised to see him.)

SCULLY: Excuse me!

MULDER: Hey.

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: I was just looking for you.

SCULLY: But you're supposed to be in England.

MULDER: I'm back.

SCULLY: What happened?

MULDER: (bummed) Nothing. There was no event. No crop circles. Big waste of time.

(SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason, Mulder.

MULDER: What is that supposed to mean?

SCULLY: Nothing. (she smiles) Come on, I'm make you some tea.

(SCULLY puts her arm around MULDER's and leads him away companionably.)



SCENE 13

(MULDER's apartment. MULDER and SCULLY are sitting close together on the sofa. Two half-drunk mugs of tea are on the coffee table. SCULLY, drowsy, has her shoeless, stockinged feet propped up on the table. They have been talking a while.)

MULDER: I just find it hard to believe.

SCULLY: What part?

MULDER: The part where I go away for two days and your whole life changes.

SCULLY: Mmm, I didn't say my whole life changed.

MULDER: You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple. God speaking back.

SCULLY: Mmm, and I didn't say that God spoke back. I said that I had some kind of a vision.

MULDER: Well, for you, that's like saying you're having David Crosby's baby.

(SCULLY smiles and looks thoughtful.)

MULDER: What is it?

SCULLY: I once considered spending my whole life with this man. What I would have missed.

MULDER: I don't think you can know. I mean, how many different lives would we be leading if we made different choices. We... We don't know.

SCULLY: What if there was only one choice and all the other ones were wrong? And there were signs along the way to pay attention to.

MULDER: Mmm. And all the... choices would then lead to this very moment. One wrong turn, and... we wouldn't be sitting here together. Well, that says a lot. That says a lot, a lot, a lot. That's probably more than we should be getting into at this late hour.

(MULDER looks down at SCULLY. She has fallen asleep against his shoulder. Music begins again. In slow motion, he tenderly brushes a strand of hair out of her face, then gazes at her a moment. He pulls his Indian blanket over her and carefully tucks it around her. Camera pans around to the fish tank with it's bouncing UFO decoration as MULDER gets up off the couch. The rhythmic song "The Sky is Broken" continues playing. The camera pans down under the fish tank to a small figurine of Buddha on the shelf below.)

[THE END]


                                BRAND X



SCENE 1
WINSTON-SALEM, NORTH CAROLINA
9:47 PM

(Late evening in the city where CarriK went to school. This is where most of the big tobacco companies are based. Smoke is coming out of the chimney of a very large, nice house. Two AGENTS are walking around the manicured grounds, watching and guarding. They communicate with radios. SKINNER is inside the house, also with a radio.)

AGENT: (outside on radio) Radio check. Perimeter is clear.

SKINNER: (on radio) Copy that. Give me a check every ten.

(SKINNER pockets the radio, and speaks to the man and woman in the room with him. JIM SCOBIE and MRS. SCOBIE are late forties/early fifties. MRS. SCOBIE is very nervous. JIM SCOBIE sits quietly on the couch. As he speaks, SKINNER is walking around the room, checking the windows, closing the blinds.)

SKINNER: Why don't you folks make yourselves comfortable? Watch some television, get some rest. Try to put your minds at ease. Just try to stay away from the windows and doors, if you would.

MRS. SCOBIE: Do we have to ask you if we can use the bathroom? I feel like I'm a prisoner in my own home.

SKINNER: Ma'am, I apologize for the imposition but my job is to protect you. As of this evening, the FBI's top priority is keeping you safe.

MRS. SCOBIE: For how long? A week? A month? Then what?

(SKINNER doesn't answer. She sits beside her husband.)

MRS. SCOBIE: Jim, don't do this, please. You don't have to testify. It's not worth it. These people have a long reach. They're powerful.

JIM SCOBIE: I have to do this.

(MRS. SCOBIE looks at her husband for a moment, then sighs, and stands up.)

MRS. SCOBIE: I'm going to bed.

(As she leaves the room, JIM SCOBIE coughs deeply. Another Agent, we'll call him WATER AGENT, brings him a glass of water.)

JIM SCOBIE: (taking a sip) Thank you.

SKINNER: The Grand Jury convenes at 9:00. We'll leave here at 7:30. I'll be right outside the door if you need me.

(JIM SCOBIE nods as SKINNER also leaves the room. He coughs badly again and takes another sip of the water. He has trouble taking in a breath, wheezing. Then without looking at the glass, he slowly sets it on the table and heads slowly upstairs. As the camera moves close to the glass, we see that the water is now slightly tinged with blood, and that there is a small black beetle wiggling its little legs as it tries to turn over among the ice cubes. Eww.)

(Later that evening. The SCOBIE's bedroom. MRS. SCOBIE wakes up and realizes that she is alone in the bed. She sees light and a shadow under the bathroom door. She goes to the door and knocks.)

MRS. SCOBIE: Jim? Jim? Are you feeling all right?

(There is no answer, and she is unable to push the door open. Something is blocking it. MRS. SCOBIE begins to get very upset.)

MRS. SCOBIE: Jim? Mr. Skinner... Mr. Skinner! Jim?!

(SKINNER and WATER AGENT come running into the room. SKINNER starts trying to push the door open as WATER AGENT pulls MRS. SCOBIE back.)

SKINNER: Dr. Scobie?

MRS. SCOBIE: (hysterical) Jim!

WATER AGENT: Ma'am...

(SKINNER gets the door open. JIM SCOBIE's body, which had been blocking the door, is lying face down on the bathroom floor. SKINNER reaches out and gingerly turns the body over. The floor is bloody, as is what is left of JIM SCOBIE's face. The flesh around his mouth and nose has been completely eaten away. SKINNER leans back in shock. Unfortunately, this gives MRS. SCOBIE a clear view. She begins screaming and crying.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Next morning. The front of the SCOBIE's house is now a crime scene. A dark sedan with a badly done North Carolina license plate, #02537VIA, pulls up in front of the house. [CarriK: For the record, non-personalized NC plates are all ABC-1234 format.] MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car and cross the yard to the house. SCULLY is in a skirt. SKINNER is inside on the phone. He is obviously being chewed out. Something we don't see often, SKINNER on the defensive. An AGENT escorts MRS. Scobie out of the room as MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Yes, at the time, I was in another part of the house. Yes... Yes, sir... Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I will have answers for you, I...

(The conversation is over. SKINNER sighs and hangs up. He looks tired.)

MULDER: Rough night?

SKINNER: Oh, it's shaping up to be a rougher morning. Follow me.

(SKINNER leads MULDER and SCULLY into the bathroom.)

SKINNER: There's fingerprints everywhere but as they all belong to the deceased and his wife they don't help us.

SCULLY: This is where the body was found?

SKINNER: Yeah.

MULDER: What can you tell us about him?

SKINNER: Dr. James Scobie, age 44. R&D biochemist with Morley tobacco. If he were alive as of  (checks his watch)  26 minutes ago he'd be giving testimony against his former employer before a federal grand jury.

SCULLY: Testimony concerning what?

SKINNER: Not even his wife or his lawyer know the specifics, only that it concerns research that he was involved in potentially extremely damaging to Morley... enough so that Scobie received death threats. Given the high-profile nature of the case the Director charged me with insuring Dr. Scobie's protection.

(MULDER and SKINNER share a look.)

SCULLY: And you think that someone made good on these threats?

SKINNER: I do. And we've yet to determine how someone got in here, or... what killed him.

(SKINNER shows them photos of the body. Even SCULLY reacts to the picture.)

MULDER: Can't blow the whistle with a mouth like that.

SCULLY: It's almost as if his flesh has been stripped or eaten away. I mean, an assailant could have thrown acid on him.

MULDER: Well, if it was acid in the face he would have screamed bloody murder.

SKINNER: We're looking at all possibilities, Agent. We need answers, we don't have a lot of time and we're going up against one of the biggest corporations in America. The Director himself personally instructed me that he wants this case closed as swiftly as possible. I trust I can count on your help.

(SCULLY gives a small smile and MULDER nods.)

SKINNER: All right, I want you to perform the autopsy. The body's in the county morgue.

SCULLY: I'll get right on it.

SKINNER: Thank you.

(SCULLY leaves the room. MULDER and SKINNER walk through the house.)

MULDER: Huh.

SKINNER: What?

MULDER: There's no ashtrays. Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?

SKINNER: Not that I've witnessed.

MULDER: A tobacco employee that doesn't smoke-- Isn't that kind of like a GM executive who drives a Ford? If this was a hit it seems unnecessarily high-profile. It kind of draws attention to itself, don't you think?

SKINNER: That could be the point-- to intimidate potential witnesses. Scobie had a supervisor at Morley-- a Dr. Peter Voss. I want to talk to him.

MULDER: You mind if I tag along?

SKINNER: No.

(An AGENT holding a file calls to SKINNER.)

AGENT: Sir, would you take a look at this?

SKINNER: What have you got?

(MULDER sees the water glass still sitting on the table. He picks it up. The water is bloody and the small beetle, having drowned during the night, is lying at the bottom of the glass.)



SCENE 3
MORLEY TOBACCO HEADQUARTERS

(Ornate entry hall of a very wealthy company. MULDER and SKINNER enter and go the central reception desk. The humorless SECURITY MAN is sitting at the desk.)

SKINNER: We're here to see Dr. Voss.

SECURITY MAN: Do you have an appointment?

(MULDER and SKINNER both hold out their badges.)

SECURITY MAN: Do you have an appointment?

(MULDER and SKINNER look at each other, then hold out their badges again. Very funny.)

SKINNER: Maybe you missed this the first time around.

(The SECURITY MAN is not impressed. A man, DAVID BRIMLEY, 40's, comes down the stairs and greets them "warmly.")

DAVID BRIMLEY: Gentlemen, I can help you. Daniel Brimley, head of Corporate Security. A pleasure.

(He shakes MULDER's hand, then SKINNER's.)

DAVID BRIMLEY: You're here concerning Dr. Scobie's death, I take it.

SKINNER: We are.

DAVID BRIMLEY: We're all extremely sorry to hear about it. Jim has a lot of friends in this building.

MULDER: Really? No hard feelings that he was about to turn federal witness against your company?

DAVID BRIMLEY: Nobody was happy about Jim's decision but the timing of his death couldn't have been worse.

SKINNER: So you have problem with us speaking to Dr. Voss?

DAVID BRIMLEY: Absolutely not. Whatever we can do to help. Please.

(He indicates that they should follow him.)

(Later. Large conference room. Huge table. Dimly lit. MULDER and SKINNER sit on one side of the table facing six men from Morley, including DR. PETER VOSS, 40's. DR. PETER VOSS is less stone faced than the others. DAVID BRIMLEY stands to one side.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Could you, um...

(He clears his throat, uncomfortable, perhaps a little emotional.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Would you give my sincerest condolences to Jim's wife, Joan? How is she?

MULDER: I'm sure she'll take comfort in finding out why her husband died.

SKINNER: Dr. Voss, can you enlighten us as to what Dr. Scobie intended to tell the grand jury? We know it had to do with company research.

(The LEAD COUNSEL, a large lawyerly looking man sitting next to VOSS interrupts as VOSS is about to answer.)

LEAD COUNSEL: I'm sorry. Dr. Voss would be in violation of his employment confidentiality clause in answering that question.

SKINNER: Dr. Scobie was your friend?

DR. PETER VOSS: Yeah, for 14 years, mm-hmm.

SKINNER: And yet you demoted him five weeks ago. You took him off a particular project. Can you tell us why that happened?

LEAD COUNSEL: (interrupting) As before, Dr. Voss would be in violation of his confidentiality clause in answering questions regarding the nature of his work here at Morley. I'm sure you understand our cooperation cannot extend itself to revealing corporate secrets.

SKINNER: (getting pissed) I'm not sensing any "cooperation" whatsoever. In fact, I'm one more non-answer away from getting a federal warrant and searching this entire building.

LEAD COUNSEL: Then this meeting is over. Dr. Voss.

(The LAWYERS all begin to get up from the table. MULDER pulls an evidence bag from his pocket.)

MULDER: Dr. Voss... can you tell me what that is?

(He tosses the bag to VOSS. Inside is the dead beetle from JIM SCOBIE's glass.)

DR. PETER VOSS: It's a tobacco beetle. Why?

MULDER: We found it at Jim Scobie's house.

DR. PETER VOSS: Well, you'll find a lot of these around here. They're everywhere. There's probably a dozen in the grill of your car right now.

LEAD COUNSEL: May I ask where you're going with this, Agent?

MULDER: (sarcastically) I'm sorry, I can't. Answering that question would violate FBI confidentiality due to the sensitive nature of our investigation.

(VOSS looks up at MULDER. The LAWYERS glare.)



SCENE 4
DR. VOSS RESIDENCE
7:38 PM

(Later that evening. Another very nice gated house. DR. PETER VOSS pulls into his garage, sits for a moment, then gets out of the car. He turns at the sound of footsteps. A grungy looking man, DARYL WEAVER approaches the car from where he has been waiting in the foggy yard. They know each other, but are not friends. DR. PETER VOSS is surprised to see him.)

DARYL WEAVER: Evenin'.

(His voice is gravelly, his manner subtly menacing.)

DR. PETER VOSS: What are you doing here?

DARYL WEAVER: Run out of smokes. Me and Dr. Scobie had an arrangement, as you know. So I figured, uh... Dr. Scobie not being around that my arrangement with him... slides on over to you.

(DR. PETER VOSS nervously shuts the car door and opens his briefcase and pulls out two unmarked cartons of cigarettes and hands them to DARYL WEAVER.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Here you go.

DR. WIEDER: That won't hold me.

DR. PETER VOSS: I'll-I'll bring you more. Just-just-just don't come here anymore, all right?

DR. WIEDER: It seems everybody's acting funny around me all of a sudden, you know? Telling me not to talk to stay away from their houses? Huh. Too bad about Dr. Scobie, huh?

DR. PETER VOSS: Yeah...

DR. WIEDER: I bet people are wondering how he died, huh? I've been working my own theory up in the old noggin. I'd be happy to share it with you someday.

DR. PETER VOSS: I think that you should leave now.

DR. WIEDER: (nodding) Yeah. I don't want to wear out my welcome. We'll be seeing a lot of each other, I expect.

(DR. PETER VOSS does not look thrilled at the prospect. DARYL WEAVER turns and walks away.)



SCENE 5
FORSYTH COUNTY MORGUE
8:02 PM

(SCULLY is performing the autopsy on JIM SCOBIE. MULDER and SKINNER enter.)

MULDER: Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

SKINNER: What have you found?

SCULLY: Well, the tissue damage on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends all the way down his trachea into his lungs. His alveoli look like corned beef.

(SKINNER takes a breath at the sight of the body. MULDER has seen worse.)

SKINNER: What about this being the result of some sort of corrosive agent?

SCULLY: No, that's not the case. There's no acids present, no caustics. This damage isn't the result of any kind of chemical reaction. His airways have more or less just been reamed out. I can tell you what killed him, though... strictly speaking.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: Hypoxemia. The, uh, inability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream.

SKINNER: He choked to death.

(SCULLY nods grimly.)

SKINNER: I mean, this damage-- however it was accomplished, someone did do this to him.

MULDER: Well, not necessarily. There weren't any signs of struggle in the room. Maybe no one was ever there.

SKINNER: Where are you going with this?

MULDER: Well, that this isn't a homicide. You... examined the body Scully. Did you... find any of these?

(MULDER holds up the evidence bag with the dead tobacco beetle.)

SCULLY: A bug?

MULDER: Well, it's a, tobacco beetle, yeah.

(SCULLY laughs nervously and glances over at SKINNER. She's used to not having an audience as she and MULDER "discuss" these things.)

SCULLY: I didn't find anything like that, Mulder. Were you expecting me to?

(MULDER shrugs.)

SKINNER: (disbelieving) Killer bugs? This is what I'm supposed to tell the Director?

MULDER: I don't know but judging from Dr. Voss's reaction to this I think it's the thing we should investigate.

(SKINNER stares at him. SCULLY sighs.)



SCENE 6
DOWNTOWN WINSTON-SALEM
11:24 PM

(Low-rent boarding house, Abbott Manson's. DARYL WEAVER is watching TV. Lots of gunfire and explosions. He is smoking. Next door, his NEIGHBOR is reading some Home magazine? He smells the smoke coming through the shared vent high up on the wall. Angrily, he yells over to DARYL WEAVER through the vent.)

NEIGHBOR: Hey, I've been telling you all week! How many times I got to say it? No smoking! You hear me?

(DARYL WEAVER calls back calmly, taking another drag of the cigarette.)

DARYL WEAVER: America, man! E. Pluribus, uh... (spits)

NEIGHBOR: I'll get you kicked out, you son of a bitch! You think I'm kidding? I'll do it!

(The NEIGHBOR begins coughing violently.)

NEIGHBOR: The law's on my side.

(He coughs again into his hand, even more violently. He stares at his hand which is now covered with blood. Next door, DARYL WEAVER continues smoking and watching the war movie on TV. On screen, a soldier bayonets another as we hear the NEIGHBOR fall to the floor. DARYL WEAVER looks up at the vent and ignores it. Next door, we see hundreds of tobacco beetles crawling across the floor and the NEIGHBOR's head and body. His mouth and nose area are bloody and eaten away. Eww.)



SCENE 7
6:16 AM

(Boarding house, next day. The NEIGHBOR's apartment is in full crime scene procedure. SKINNER, wearing latex, brushes a tobacco beetle off of the sheet covering the NEIGHBOR's body, then raises the sheet and glances at the body. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

MULDER: Guests check in, but they don't check out.

(SCULLY, in a lovely dark pantsuit, kneels down to look at the body.)

SCULLY: Oh... Well, judging from the condition of the body, I'd say that he died in the same manner as Dr. Scobie.

(SKINNER opens the NEIGHBOR's wallet.)

SKINNER: Except this man's no corporate whistle blower. "Thomas Gastall." Out-of- date Massachusetts license... food coupons... and a certificate of completion for a court- ordered anger-management class.

SCULLY: What could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts?

MULDER: Probably nothing.

SKINNER: What are you suggesting, Mulder?

(MULDER is crouched on the floor looking at the beetles.)

MULDER: That Jim Scobie wasn't murdered. Neither was this man.

SKINNER: Well, then what killed them?

(MULDER holds up one of the squirming beetles and bags it.)

MULDER: These.

SKINNER: We didn't find any insects in Dr. Scobie's bathroom.

MULDER: But there was an open window through which they could have escaped.

SCULLY: It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could be some form of contagious agent, like an insect-borne bacterium which would mean that there might be other victims in this building.

(SKINNER looks at MULDER.)

(Later, MULDER knocks at door #24.)

MULDER: FBI.

(He knocks again. DARYL WEAVER opens the door, leaving the chain on. MULDER holds out his badge.)

MULDER: Sorry to wake you.

DARYL WEAVER: You, you didn't wake me.

(He takes off the chain and opens the door. Inside the apartment, the walls look an unhealthy yellow.)

DARYL WEAVER: Come on in.

MULDER: Thank you. We're investigating the death of a man who lived right next to you-- a Thomas Gastall. Do you know him?

DARYL WEAVER: I knew his voice. He yelled a lot.

MULDER: He yelled?

DARYL WEAVER: Yeah. He said I smoked too much. Whatcha gonna to do, man? It's a free country. E. Pluribus, uh...

(DARYL WEAVER pulls out a cigarette and glances at MULDER.)

DARYL WEAVER: You mind?

MULDER: No. You don't seem surprised that he's dead.

DARYL WEAVER: Guess his number come up. (lights up) Just glad it wasn't me.

MULDER: What is your name, sir?

DARYL WEAVER: Daryl Weaver.

MULDER: Mr. Weaver, did you see or hear anything unusual last night?

DARYL WEAVER: Little Korean fellow down the hall. Dresses like wonder woman. But that's every night.

(He chuckles. MULDER smiles.)

MULDER: Other than that?

DARYL WEAVER: Say, there wouldn't happen to be, uh... any reward money involved would there? I mean, I could use an extra buck or two.

MULDER: The FBI would appreciate your voluntary cooperation, sir. That's the way it works.

DARYL WEAVER: Ain't that always the way? (pause) Nope. My mind is, uh, just drawing a complete blank.

(MULDER hands him one of his business cards.)

MULDER: That's my card. Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

(MULDER leaves. DARYL WEAVER puffs away.)

(MULDER joins SCULLY and SKINNER in the hall.)

MULDER: Anything?

SKINNER: Two deaths in less than 24 hours. We're no closer to an answer.

SCULLY: And the only thing I have to go on medically at this point is Mulder's bug. You know, I know an entomologist at UNC Wilmington-- Dr. Libby Nance.

[CarriK wonders why they don't find an entomologist at Duke, NC State, or Chapel Hill less than an hour away rather than going all the way to Wilmington. Maybe Scully just wants to visit the beach, or perhaps she just wants to make sure that there is no possibility of running into Bambi Berenbaum.]

MULDER: Good. Talk to her.

(SCULLY pulls out her phone and dials as MULDER walks down the hall.)

SKINNER: Where are you going?

MULDER: See about something else that's been bugging me.



SCENE 8

(VOSS house. Azaleas are a nice North Carolina touch. MULDER walks up the front steps and knocks on the door. A woman, ANNE VOSS, opens it. She has a little girl with her.)

MULDER: Mrs. Voss?

ANNE VOSS: Yes?

MULDER: Fox Mulder. Is your husband home?

ANNE VOSS: (hesitantly) Um...

(DR. PETER VOSS comes to the door.)

DR. PETER VOSS: It's okay, honey. It's okay. It will just be a minute.

ANNE VOSS: Sure thing.

(DR. PETER VOSS closes the door and he and MULDER stand on the porch.)

DR. PETER VOSS: I really shouldn't be talking to you without our lawyers.

MULDER: I understand your reluctance to talk, sir. You have a nice family-- a lot to lose.

DR. PETER VOSS: What do you want, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: There's been another victim-- Thomas Gastall. Died exactly the same way Scobie did.

DR. PETER VOSS: I'm sorry to hear that. But what's that got to do with me?

MULDER: Well, we found these all over him. I believe that that's what killed both men.

DR. PETER VOSS: Tobacco beetle. It's an herbivore. It eats tobacco. Hence its name.

MULDER: I... I understand that, but... maybe these don't.

DR. PETER VOSS: I'm not really required to talk to you, am I?

MULDER: No. But why are you hiding behind your lawyers, doctor? How many people have to die before you do the right thing?

(DR. PETER VOSS enters the house. He watches MULDER get into his car and drive away. The phone rings.)

DR. PETER VOSS: I'll get it. (on phone) Hello?

DAVID BRIMLEY: (on phone) What did he want?

(DR. PETER VOSS looks out the window. Outside the house, DAVID BRIMLEY, the head of security at Morley, is sitting in his car watching the house.)

DR. PETER VOSS: (on phone, angrily) Are you spying on me?

DAVID BRIMLEY: (on phone) I'm not spying on you, Peter. I'm looking out for you. What did he want?

(DR. PETER VOSS sighs.)

DR. PETER VOSS: (on phone) There's been another death. Downtown.

DAVID BRIMLEY: (on phone) How did it happen?

DR. PETER VOSS: (on phone) I don't know. I don't know. This has gone on long enough. We should come forward. I should.

DAVID BRIMLEY: (on phone) Do you hear what you're saying, Peter? Now, I want you to just take a moment. I want you to think about what really matters to you. Now, tell me where I can find Darrel Weaver.

DR. PETER VOSS: (on phone) Why?

DAVID BRIMLEY: (on phone) This was my mistake. I'll clean it up.

DR. PETER VOSS: (on phone) I don't know where he is.

(The phone clicks as DAVID BRIMLEY hangs up. DR. PETER VOSS looks worried.)



SCENE 9

(Lab. The entomologist, DR. LIBBY NANCE, is looking at the beetle through a microscope.)

DR. LIBBY NANCE: This doesn't make sense.

SKINNER: What doesn't make sense?

DR. LIBBY NANCE: Well, it's a lasioderma serricorne-- a tobacco beetle. Only... I've never seen one exactly like this.

SCULLY: Hmm. What are the differences?

DR. LIBBY NANCE: Physical differences-- uh... minor but definitely notable. Deviations in the mandibles, the antennae, the body segmentation.

SCULLY: What if such deviations arose from genetic engineering?

DR. LIBBY NANCE: Engineering the bugs themselves?

SCULLY: No. I was thinking about another possibility: "Transgenomics."

SKINNER: Which is...?

SCULLY: It's a form of DNA manipulation-- alterations made on the genetic level.

DR. LIBBY NANCE: It is pretty widely known that tobacco companies have been pouring money into that kind of research-- changing the tobacco plant itself in order to make it heartier, give it less nicotine, more nicotine, make it naturally menthol-flavored... you name it.

SKINNER: A form of what-- "super tobacco"?

SCULLY: Which possibly could have created super bugs. I guess the real question is could they have become dangerous to humans?



SCENE 10

(Boarding house. DR. PETER VOSS knocks loudly at DARYL WEAVER's door.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Mr. Weaver! Mr. Weaver?

DARYL WEAVER: Sorry, doc, no vacancy.

(Chuckling, DARYL WEAVER walks down the hall carrying a paper bag. DR. PETER VOSS indicates the NEIGHBOR's crime scene taped apartment.)

DR. PETER VOSS: What happened there?

DARYL WEAVER: (opening his door) Well, you tell me. You're the one with the Ph.D. I'm just a big old guinea pig.

(DR. PETER VOSS follows DARYL WEAVER into the apartment. DARYL WEAVER drops his keys on the table.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Now, listen... um... You have to leave town.

DR. WIEDER: And give up all this? Me not doing my part for science?

(DR. PETER VOSS hands him a wad of money.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Here. Take it. It's everything I have in the bank. $4,000.

(DARYL WEAVER looks through the $100 bills.)

DARYL WEAVER: It's not much, but, uh... It's a start.

DR. PETER VOSS: (urgently) Wait, wait a minute. I'm not kidding. You got to get out of here.

DARYL WEAVER: Why? I got a good thing going here. I got cash money. I got all the coffin nails I can suck down. (puts a cigarette in his mouth) Although... lately, I've been thinking this particular brand  it doesn't, um... do anyone else any favors-- healthwise.

(DR. PETER VOSS cringes as DARYL WEAVER flicks on the lighter.)

DARYL WEAVER: You've been thinking that, too, huh?

(DARYL WEAVER holds the lighter close to the cigarette.)

DARYL WEAVER: Would it bother you if I lit one up?

(DR. PETER VOSS looks very nervous. DARYL WEAVER closes the lighter.)

DARYL WEAVER: Toodles.

DR. PETER VOSS: No, you... You don't understand. Morley is a multi-billion-dollar global corporation. You think they're going to let you endanger that, huh? They'll kill you first.

DARYL WEAVER: (unconcerned) Sounds like a Darrel Weaver problem to me.

DR. PETER VOSS: Yeah.

(Giving up, DR. PETER VOSS leaves the apartment. DARYL WEAVER closes the door. DAVID BRIMLEY watches DR. PETER VOSS leave, then goes to DARYL WEAVER's door.)



SCENE 11

(Morgue. SKINNER joins SCULLY where she is autopsying the NEIGHBOR's body. SKINNER winces a bit at what he sees on the table.0

SKINNER: What am I looking at?

SCULLY: Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.

(The open lungs are crawling with larvae.)

SKINNER: Well, I guess that explains where the beetles came from.

(They hear footsteps approaching, and turn as MULDER enters the room. He looks tired.)

SCULLY: Hey, Mulder. Where have you been?

MULDER: Talking to lawyers over at Justice. Trying to get a look at Morley's files.

SCULLY: Well, take a look at this.

(Glancing at the body doesn't help MULDER. He swallows back a cough and goes over to sit against a counter. SCULLY expected him to be a little more excited.)

SCULLY: They're the larval stage of the tobacco beetle, Mulder and somehow, they have ended up nesting in Thomas Gastall's lungs.

SKINNER: But what doesn't make any sense is why Scobie's lungs didn't show this same condition.

(MULDER is trying not to cough.)

SCULLY: The larvae must pupate inside the lungs and then once they mature into beetles exit the body en masse.

SKINNER: Well, that explains the condition of the face and throat.

(MULDER coughs, SCULLY turns her focus to him.)

SKINNER: Only, how do they get into the lungs to begin with?

(MULDER puts his hand over his mouth and coughs violently. Something comes up. He looks at his hand.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(SCULLY walks over to him and turns his hand to face her. It is covered with blood. SCULLY and SKINNER look at MULDER with concern. He looks back at them with fear.)



SCENE 12
ASHFORD MEDICAL CENTER
4:20 PM

[4:20? Cute, boys.]

(Hospital operating room. Really gross. MULDER is unconscious on the table. A hose is down his throat. Everyone else is wearing a mask. SCULLY and the doctors watch as one by one larvae are sucked out of MULDER's lungs and are collected in a bloody jar already containing more larvae than MULDER will ever want to know. SCULLY watches him for a moment, then joins SKINNER in the hall where he has been watching through the window. She takes off her mask.)

SKINNER: How is he?

SCULLY: They're using a deep-suction technique that's been designed for asthma and cystic fibrosis. And, so far, we're having some luck at clearing his lungs.

SKINNER: But...?

SCULLY: For every one of those things that are in his lung tissue there may be a dozen eggs that have yet to be hatched.

SKINNER: Eggs?

SCULLY: His pulmonary tissue is riddled with them and they're going to hatch. It's just ... (she sighs)  we're buying time.

SKINNER: Well, how did this happen? These eggs-- how did they get into his lungs?

SCULLY: I'm thinking he inhaled them.

(He looks at her.)

SCULLY: Well, the tobacco beetle lives out its life cycle on or around the tobacco plant. That's where it lays its eggs. If those genetically-altered beetles that we found did that then maybe the eggs survived the processing into cigarettes.

SKINNER: And been carried into Mulder's lungs as smoke?

SCULLY: Right-- like spores or pollen, somehow small enough to be airborne.

SKINNER: But Mulder isn't a smoker, and neither was Scobie.

SCULLY: Maybe they were around someone who was.



SCENE 13
MORLEY TOBACCO
AGRICULTURAL REASEARCH DIVISION

(Morley Tobacco Headquarters. Action!SKINNER leads a pair of agents into the Reasearch and Development part of the building. Lots of supposedly tobacco plants are growing. DR. PETER VOSS and the LEAD COUNSEL are in the office area. The LEAD COUNSEL has picked up the phone.)

SKINNER: Don't bother calling security.

(The LEAD COUNSEL hangs up a SKINNER hands him the warrant.)

SKINNER: Federal search warrant, as promised.

(SKINNER turns to the pair of agent with him.)

SKINNER: Do it.

(SKINNER turns to DR. PETER VOSS.)

SKINNER: You're going to talk to me, Doctor. One of my agents is dying of the same thing that killed Dr. Scobie. I believe you have information that can save him.

LEAD COUNSEL: We stand by our contention that any and all such information is proprietary, and is therefore the sole property of Morley Tobacco.

(CarriK doesn't think SKINNER likes lawyers.)

SKINNER: (to the LEAD COUNSEL) You listen to me, you son of a bitch. This isn't about Morley or your precious research. This is about saving lives.

DR. PETER VOSS: That's exactly what we were trying to do.

LEAD COUNSEL: Dr. Voss, I'm advising you not to speak.

DR. PETER VOSS: This has gone on long enough.

(The LEAD COUNSEL backs down and walks away. SKINNER sits with DR. PETER VOSS.)

DR. PETER VOSS: We thought we were doing a good thing. We knew people were never going to stop smoking no matter how unhealthy it was so why not genetically engineer a safer cigarette?

SKINNER: Except you engineered the bugs, as well.

DR. PETER VOSS: (sadly) We recruited test smokers. We conducted focus groups. There were no problems. And, um... after a few months in, things... things got bad. We had four test subjects and, uh... three of them died.

SKINNER: Is that what Dr. Scobie was going to testify about?

DR. PETER VOSS: Yeah. Yeah. And the company wanted us to keep it quiet. I thought, let's correct the mistakes and face the consequences. Jim didn't. He was monitoring the focus group, and that's... that's how he got infected.

SKINNER: You said only three died. Who was the fourth?



SCENE 14

(DARYL WEAVER's apartment. SuperAction!SKINNER kicks in the door and enters the apartment, gun drawn. [Enjoying this, Tiny D?] His team follows him. DARYL WEAVER is not in the apartment, but DAVID BRIMLEY is. He is tied to a kitchen chair and is gagged.)

SKINNER: Clear.

(The other agents allow DR. PETER VOSS to join SKINNER who is pushing aside furniture to get to DAVID BRIMLEY.)

DR. PETER VOSS: He told me he meant to get Weaver.

SKINNER: Looks like Weaver got to him first.

(SKINNER gets the gag off of DAVID BRIMLEY's horrified face.)

SKINNER: Mr. Brimley can you hear me?

(DAVID BRIMLEY chokes and gasps, then tobacco beetles begin spilling out of his mouth. [CarriK nominates this moment for one of the top ten disgusting visuals this show has given us in seven years.] Unable to help, SKINNER and DR. PETER VOSS stare at him.)



SCENE 15

(Convenience store. DARYL WEAVER pulls up to the pump. It is DAVID BRIMLEY's car, license #0180WLT. [NC plates aren't on the front of the cars, either. That would take up the space for the "Jesus is Lord" and "Tina Jo Loves Travis" plates you can get at Myrtle Beach and Carowinds.] He gets out and takes a cigarette out of the pack. It is the last one. He crumples the pack and lights up. He goes into the store.)

DARYL WEAVER: You got Mickey's Big Mouth?

CLERK: There's no smoking in here.

(DARYL WEAVER slowly walks to the counter and tucks one of the $100 bills into the CLERK's pocket.)

DARYL WEAVER: Mickey's Big Mouth.

(The CLERK goes to the back of the store and gets the drinks. He sets them on the counter.)

CLERK: Anything else? Carton of cigarettes?

DARYL WEAVER: You don't have my brand.

(The CLERK hears a radio crackle and looks out to see a SHERIFF's DEPUTY looking at the car that DARYL WEAVER was driving.)

DEPUTY'S RADIO: This is code 4148.  81 clear. 8814 clear.

(When the CLERK turns back to DARYL WEAVER, he is gone.)



SCENE 16

(MULDER's hospital room. He is asleep. SCULLY enters and gently takes his hand and rubs his fingers. He wakes up and smiles weakly at her. He looks at her holding his hand. His voice is raspy and hoarse.)

MULDER: Mmm. It must be bad.

(SCULLY gives him a small smile and continues holding his hand.)

SCULLY: How do you feel?

MULDER: Like a dust buster attacked me.

(MULDER coughs.)

SCULLY: We're looking for someone who may be able to help you-- a Morley test subject by the name of Darrel Weaver.

MULDER: Mr. "E pluribus"

SCULLY: Yeah. Mr. Weaver seems to have some kind of tolerance or immunity and we're hoping that once we find him we'll be able to figure out how to treat you.

(MULDER begins gasping. He can't breathe.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(MULDER is wheezing and the monitors begin beeping. SCULLY looks at the readouts in alarm.)

SCULLY: Doctor!

(The DOCTOR runs in. SCULLY is trying to help MULDER prop his head so he can breathe.)

SCULLY: His SAT's down to 72. Get some O-2 on him and call the Code.

DOCTOR: Susan, Code Blue!

NURSE SUSAN: Right, Doctor.

(NURSE SUSAN pushes in the crash cart.)

DOCTOR: Over to my side.

(The get an O2 mask over MULDER's mouth, but he is still gasping. He's in almost as much pain as SCULLY is having to watch him. She gasps as she sees a beetle crawl out of his mouth.)



SCENE 17

(Hospital, later. SCULLY watches with concern through the window as a NURSE attends to MULDER. The DOCTOR comes up to her and hands her MULDER's chart.)

DOCTOR: Dr. Scully? We've got him stabilized on ECMO for the moment but we're not going to be able to maintain him on it for long. Of course, you see why.

(SCULLY looks at the x-rays of MULDER's lungs. Lots and lots of larvae.)

SCULLY: There's more now than there were six hours ago.

DOCTOR: They're beginning to block the flow of blood. Our best bet is to go back in there. I think this time, we have to crack the chest.

SCULLY: No. No, I... He's too weak for thoracic surgery. He-he'd die on the table.

DOCTOR: I don't know what our other options are.

SCULLY: (voice cracking) I'd say for the time being, we just wait.

DOCTOR: That'll definitely kill him. Sooner or later.

(The DOCTOR leaves. SCULLY turns back to watch MULDER through the window.)



SCENE 18

(VOSS house. SKINNER arrives with two agents.)

SKINNER: Mrs. Voss, I'm Assistant Director Walter Skinner with the FBI. May we come in?

ANNE VOSS: What is this? What's going on?

SKINNER: I have to ask for your cooperation. These men are here to protect you and your family.

ANNE VOSS: Oh, my God. Why?

(They enter the house.)

SKINNER: Your husband hasn't spoken to you about this?

ANNE VOSS: He's not here.

SKINNER: He told me he was headed home. (to his agents) Try Dr. Voss at work.

ANNE VOSS: I-I've just been trying. There's no answer.



SCENE 19

(Morley Tobacco Research Department. The automatic sprinklers are watering the plants. SKINNER enters, crouching through the plants. He sees DR. PETER VOSS crouched on the floor. His face is bloody as if he has been hit.)

DR. PETER VOSS: Behind you.

(SKINNER whirls around and sees DARYL WEAVER holding plain cartons of cigarettes.)

DARYL WEAVER: I was just leaving. I got what I came for.

DR. PETER VOSS: He took the test cigarettes. I couldn't stop him.

SKINNER: Stop right there!

DARYL WEAVER: Why? You gonna shoot me?

(He walks toward SKINNER.)

SKINNER: I'm not going to let you go infect more people.

DARYL WEAVER: You're going to let me do whatever I want to do. Dr. Voss here tells me you need me. You need me to save your boy.

(DARYL WEAVER takes a cigarette from behind his ear and puts it into his mouth.)

SKINNER: Don't do it.

DARYL WEAVER: (sad chuckle) They say these things kill people, you know? Any brand, sooner or later. But you know, it doesn't have to be that way. I think Dr. Voss is really onto something with his research. I do.

DR. PETER VOSS: It's over, Weaver. I'm through.

DARYL WEAVER: Oh... Come on, now. I mean... you gotta figure... the first, um, car killed a bunch of people before they perfected it 'cause it's all just part of the scientific process, you know?

(DARYL WEAVER ignites his lighter.)

SKINNER: Mr. Weaver, I will shoot you.

DARYL WEAVER: No, you won't.

(DARYL WEAVER lights the cigarette. SKINNER keeps the gun on him. Music gets ominous.)

DARYL WEAVER: I'm a regular damn scientific marvel. (he chuckles) They, uh... study me, they're gonna, uh... write scientific papers about me... I could be the cure for cancer. Me, Darrel Weaver.

(He and DR. PETER VOSS stare at each other.)

DARYL WEAVER: You ain't gonna shoot me. Toodles.

(He starts to leave. SKINNER fires, hitting DARYL WEAVER in the back of the shoulder. He falls to the floor. Change flies everywhere. SKINNER steps on the smoldering cigarette as he goes toward the fallen man.)



SCENE 20

(Hospital. SCULLY and the DOCTOR meet SKINNER as DARYL WEAVER is wheeled into the emergency room. All her focus is on DARYL WEAVER.)

SKINNER: How's Mulder?

SCULLY: Not good. Let's get the blood work on this man.

(SCULLY looks at DARYL WEAVER's nicotine stained fingers.)

SCULLY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Get me 30 milligrams of methyl pyrrolidinyl pyridine.

DOCTOR: (surprised) Nicotine?

SCULLY: Yeah. (to SKINNER) I think this could save Mulder's life.



SCENE 21
FBI HEADQUARTERS
TWO WEEKS LATER

(X-Files office. SCULLY enters. MULDER is sitting at the computer in the back of the office. His voice is still very raspy.)

SCULLY: Hey. Good to be back?

MULDER: (turning to face her) Beats the alternative.

SCULLY: Well, you'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed all of our files on the case. They seem extremely interested in your recovery.

MULDER: What about Darrel Weaver?

SCULLY: He's, uh, well enough to have been moved to the hospital ward at Raleigh Correctional.

MULDER: It was the nicotine itself that was keeping him alive?

SCULLY: Well, his fingertips were stained yellow with it. He was a four-pack-a-day smoker-- far heavier than any of the focus group members who died. You know, nicotine is extremely poisonous. It's actually one of the oldest known insecticides.

MULDER: (smiling) It's good for killing tobacco beetles.

SCULLY: Well, once we loaded your system up with enough of it, it acted as a sort of chemotherapy... except it almost stopped your breathing at the same time.

MULDER: That's not all it did.

(MULDER walks over to his desk and holds up an unopened pack of Morley cigarettes.)

MULDER: I bought these on the way to work.

(SCULLY stares at him.)

SCULLY: You're not going to start smoking.

(This said in the same tone as "You're not going to kill a puppy.')

MULDER: Well, they say the addiction is stronger than heroin.

(He smells the pack.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(After a beat, MULDER drops the pack into the trashcan. SCULLY nods in satisfaction.)

SCULLY: Good. Well, Skinner's waiting for us in his office.

MULDER: I'll be right up.

(SCULLY looks at him a moment, then nods and leaves the office. MULDER watches her go then looks at the pack of cigarettes lying in the trashcan.

[Fade to black]

[THE END]
                                   HOLLYWOOD AD



SCENE 1

(The screen is in letterbox format. Dramatic adventure movie music. A MAN in a dark business suit, ala Mulder, is running through a dark graveyard. Dodging bullets, he dives in a forward aerial summersault over one of the creepy headstones, then scoots back and reaches his hand back over the stone and fires randomly five or six times at whoever is following him. He removes the clip from the gun. It is empty.)

[TD NOTE: The name on the headstone he hides behind, Alan Smithee, is a well known Hollywood in-joke. It's the name a lot of directors "hide behind" when they have no interest in having their own names attached to the project any more. I honestly *did* know this already but kudos to Autumn T. for pointing it out.]

MALE VOICE: Give it up, Mulder! You've got no chance!

(The camera pans up showing that this is not the MULDER we know, but GARRY SHANDLING as MULDER. He has a cheap looking ceramic bowl between his legs. He searches his jacket for another clip. No luck. Things look hopeless for him at the moment.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: Damn it.

MALE VOICE: My sniper zombies are everywhere.

(Indeed, they are. Several gory looking, moaning ZOMBIES are getting into sniper position behind tombstones, automatic rifles trained on GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER. Red laser gun sights flash through the fog. All are pointed at GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER. The MALE VOICE belongs to a man wearing high-level Catholic priest's robes. He is known as the CIGARETTE SMOKING PONTIFF. He is a tall, older man with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth. He is holding a RED-HAIRED WOMAN hostage, his arm around her neck.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING PONTIFF: I'll offer you a deal. You give me the Lazarus bowl and I'll give you Scully.

RED-HAIRED WOMAN'S VOICE: Mulder!

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: How about this deal? You give me Scully, I don't smash the Lazarus bowl and shove the pieces where the Son of God don't shine, you Cigarette-Smoking Mackerel Snapper.

(GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER comes out from behind the tombstone. He is holding the bowl above his head. The ZOMBIES and the CSP stare at him. We get to see the red-haired woman's face. It is not SCULLY, but TEA LEONI AS SCULLY. Her shoulder is bloody.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: I break the Lazarus Bowl and all your sniper zombies go back to being good, little, well-behaved corpses.

(The ZOMBIES moan in fear.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING PONTIFF: You don't fool me, Mulder. That bowl is your Holy Grail. Encoded in its ancient ceramic grooves are the words Jesus spake when he raised Lazarus from the dead-- still capable of raising the dead 2,000 years later. Proof positive of the paranormal. You could no sooner destroy that than let the redhead die.

(Close up of GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER looking at TEA LEONI AS SCULLY. Close up of TEA LEONI AS SCULLY looking at GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER. That unspoken communication, gotta love it. A rational sounding ZOMBIE with a standard California accent steps forward and speaks to GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER.)

RATIONAL ZOMBIE: Come on, man. Don't break the bowl. We don't want to go back to being dead. There's no food, no women, no dancing. Save the bowl and we'll dump that Ciggy-Smoking Stooge for you and you'll be the new King of the Dead.

(GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER glances at TEA LEONI AS SCULLY. She shakes her head slightly.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: I'd rather serve in Heaven than rule in Hell.

[TD Note: Satan from Milton's "Paradise Lost": "Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."]

(All in slow motion, GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER throws the bowl high into the air. The ZOMBIES all drop their guns and run toward the airborne bowl. GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER runs toward the CSP and TEA LEONI AS SCULLY. As the CSP also tries to save the bowl, TEA LEONI AS SCULLY gets the gun from him and fires at a ZOMBIE who is about to catch the bowl. GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER pushes the CSP out of the way and grabs TEA LEONI AS SCULLY. Together, they roll down the hill and fall into an open grave and the coffin lid slams shut. All is dark. We hear heavy breathing.)

[TD Note: Freeze-frame the scene right as Shandling leaps on top of Tea and before they start rolling. That ain't Shandling, I recognize that classic profile anywhere, it's Duchovny!]

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: Is that your flashlight, Mulder, or... you just happy to be lying on top of me?

(We see the screen flicker. We realize that we are in a movie theatre watching this. The audience chuckles.)

DARRYL ZANUCK THEATER
20TH CENTURY FOX
HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: My flashlight.

(In the coffin, GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER turns on his flashlight, illuminating their faces. TEA LEONI AS SCULLY smiles and shifts position and GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER gasps.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: (realizing) Oh, that.

(Audience laughs harder.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: You know, seven long years I've been waiting for just the right moment, Scully.

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: Oh, you're a sick man, Mulder. Go on.

(Audience shot of Chris Carter eating popcorn out of a plastic replica of the bowl that is in the movie. He is grinning and nodding happily. We pan across to see that David Alan Grier and Minnie Driver are also in the audience.)

[TD Note: You can barely see someone whispering in Carter's ear at the start of this shot. That's Bill Millar who also plays the director of the movie.]

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: I love you, Scully. No ifs, ands or...

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: Bees.

(They both moan as he kisses her deeply. Audience laughs. Kissing and moaning continues as the camera pans across the rapt faces of TEA LEONI, GARRY SHANDLING, and other audience members, finally reaching SCULLY and MULDER at the end of the row. Like the rest, they are dressed formally, SCULLY in a black dress, MULDER in a tux. SCULLY's shoulders are up around her ears as she stares at the screen in horror. MULDER is watching in shock. As the kissing continues, he groans and drops his head into his hands. He looks up and across the aisle at SKINNER who looks back at him and grins broadly as he eats his popcorn out of his "Lazarus Bowl." MULDER stares at SKINNER a moment, then back up at the screen where TEA LEONI AS SCULLY and GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER are STILL kissing passionately inside the coffin. SCULLY hasn't moved. MULDER has a moment of extreme depression, and then drops his head despondently.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS EARLIER

(SKINNER's office. MULDER and SCULLY are in their usual places as SKINNER briefs them on the case. A MAN is sitting on one of the couches behind them.)

SKINNER: Yesterday, a small pipe bomb ripped through the crypt of Christ's Church here in DC. There were no casualties, no thefts, no note making any demand.

SCULLY: Who's taking credit for it?

SKINNER: Nobody.

(The MAN, about SKINNER's age, listening intently and watching MULDER and SCULLY, speaks into a hand-held mini tape recorder.)

MAN: SHE: Jodie Foster's foster child on a Payless budget. He's like a ... Jehovah's Witness meets Harrison Ford's "Witness."

(MULDER and SCULLY look back at the man, then at each other, then back to SKINNER.)

SCULLY: Uh, Christ's Church. Isn't that, uh, Cardinal O'Fallon's church?

SKINNER: Yes. O'Fallon's residence is adjacent to the crypt.

MULDER: Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?

MAN: (into the recorder, dramatically, nodding at SKINNER) Cardinal "Oh-fallen," perhaps.

(A cell phone begins to ring, much to the irritation of MULDER and SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Um... He's one of the most powerful men in the church today. His name often comes up as a possibility for the first American pope.

MULDER: Oh. I-I don't want to be myopic here, sir, but this looks like a straight up terrorist act for the A.T.F.

MAN: (into the recorder) "Myopic."

SKINNER: Yes, it does.

(MULDER can't take the ringing anymore and turns to face the MAN.)

MULDER: Are you going to answer your phone?

MAN: Me?

MULDER: Yeah.

MAN: I didn't want to be rude.

(The MAN goes for his phone. MULDER turns back to SKINNER.)

MULDER: Sir, who the hell is this guy?

MAN: (on phone) Hello?

SKINNER: This is Wayne Federman. He's an old buddy of mine from college. He's a writer out in Hollywood now and he's working on an FBI-based movie. He's asked me to give him access.

SCULLY: (in the same tone of voice that she might say doggie poop) A screenwriter?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: It's actually... It's a writer-slash-producer.

MULDER: Well, that's actually just a hindrance-slash-pain in the neck.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (hanging up) Yo, yo, yo. Agent Mulder, I don't want to eat your lunch. I'm just here for some procedural flavor-- just a taste.

(Pause as MULDER stares at WAYNE FEDERMAN.)

MULDER: I've no idea what you just said.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Well, the Skinman's filled me in on your particular bent.

(MULDER looks at SKINNER who shrugs.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: He said that you come at things maybe a little fahkatke, a little Star Trekky, which is the exact vibe I'm looking for for this thing I'm doing. It's a Silence of the Lambs meets Greatest Story Ever Told type thing. It's... beautiful, and I will not be in your way. I'll be strictly Heisenbergian-- a hologram.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a pained smile, then puts his hand to his forehead as SKINNER gives the order.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, Mr. Federman will accompany you today to Christ's Church where he will act as an observer on this case. You will extend to him every courtesy and protection you would a friend of mine and a friend of the Bureau's. Agent Scully, I require your services here for the morning.

(Federman chuckles and gives a suggestive "MmmHmm." MULDER looks pitifully at SKINNER.)

MULDER: Sir, have I pissed you off in a way that's more than normal?



SCENE 3

(MULDER and WAYNE FEDERMAN pull up in front of a large cathedral. A conversation is in progress.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Just curious if she's more than your partner.

MULDER: Enough, Wayne.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Hey, whatever.

(The two men get out of the car and enter the church. Two nuns pass by the entrance. Autumn? Nanchita?)

CHRIST'S CHURCH WASHINGTON, DC

(It's either 9:20 or 3:45. Later inside the church, MULDER is talking to a distinguished looking priest, CARDINAL O'FALLON. WAYNE FEDERMAN follows them as they walk through the church.)

MULDER: Cardinal O'Fallon can you think of anyone who might make an attempt on your life?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: The church always has enemies, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: The size of the bomb would have limited its destruction to just the crypt itself. Is there anything down there worth targeting?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Not really. Just some old bones, artifacts, relics... documents that we store down there in the cold. We like to think of it as God's Refrigerator.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: That's a great line.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Thank you.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (into his tape recorder) "God's Refrigerator."

MULDER: Wayne, shut up.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: No treasures to the outside world. Things of negligible monetary value... but great spiritual value to the church-- ancient devotional texts... and medieval relics.

(They are now descending a staircase.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: How about the Shroud of Turin?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: No, afraid not, but we do have the Bathrobe of St. Peter.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: You're kidding?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Yes, I am.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: That's a good line.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Thank you.

MULDER: (warning) Wayne... Shut up.

(They enter a dark, spider-webby crypt.)

MULDER: Who comes down to the crypt here?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Only myself. There are a half a mile of catacombs here. (he turns on a light) I like to walk here during lunch.

(They look around. One area of the crypt is rubble.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: That's where the bomb went off.

MULDER: Well, my instinct, Cardinal, is to see this desecration of the dead less as a murder attempt and more as a terrorist act-- a message...

(A cell phone begins ringing. MULDER looks accusingly at WAYNE FEDERMAN. WAYNE FEDERMAN sheepishly checks his phone.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Uh, this isn't me. I think it's you.

MULDER: Excuse me. (pulls his phone out) That's, uh, that's not me.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Let me check. (pulls his phone out) Not me, either. Can never get reception here.

(Phone continues to ring. MULDER kneels down beside one of the damaged crypts, removes rubble, and pulls a cell phone off of the not-long-dead body buried there.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Would that be St. Jude's cell phone, Cardinal?

(MULDER looks at the face of the body that he has revealed.)

MULDER: No. That's Micah Hoffman.

(MULDER activates the ID function on the Nokia phone and reads the name there. It is MICAH HOFFMAN.)



SCENE 4
ADAMS MORGAN DISTRICT
WASHINGTON, DC

(MULDER and SCULLY are walking down a residential inner city street followed closely by WAYNE FEDERMAN.)

MULDER: Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays, and Frank Serpico. That's my Holy Trinity, Scully.

SCULLY: Of course, I'm too young to remember but, uh, wasn't he some kind of a '60s campus radical, like a Jerry Rubin or Mario Savio?

MULDER: Yeah. Name a '60s counterculture movement and Micah Hoffman was at or near the center of it. He was one of the original Weathermen. He was the first Yippie. He was a better poet than Ginsburg and he was also the starting shortstop for his Columbia baseball team.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Then in the '70s, didn't he go real low profile?

MULDER: Yeah, right after Altamont. He was never really heard from again.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Aw, the Stones get blamed for everything. I don't get it.

(They arrive at the door of a low rent apartment.)

MULDER: This should be it here.

(MULDER begins to jimmy the lock with his kit.)

MULDER: (to SCULLY) What did Skinner want you for this morning?

SCULLY: Just paperwork.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Hmm...

(He gives MULDER a "knowing" look and touches his finger to his lips then points. MULDER, uncomfortable, chooses to ignore him. So does SCULLY. MULDER gets the door open.)

SCULLY: Mulder, we should have a warrant.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (sarcastically) Hey, it's only the Constitution. No big deal.

(They enter the apartment. Odd assortment of furniture, art, bomb-making equipment.)

MULDER: Wow.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Dis-feng shui.

(Little nod to Gillian, there, DD? See 7X17, all things.)

SCULLY: Mulder, sorry to denigrate a third of your Trinity, but, uh, looks like Hoffman was killed by one of his own bombs.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Well, from Dharma bum to Dharma bomb.

(MULDER gives him a look.)

MULDER: I knew, uh, Hoffman was a master potter...

SCULLY: Yeah, well, it appears he was a master calligrapher as well. Look, Mulder, they've got gum arabic and sodium hydroxide here. (reacting to the smell) Whoo, these would be used to, uh, to age the ink and the paper prematurely. It's a... it's a forger's trick.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Well, from counterculture to counterfeiter.

MULDER: All right, one more pun and I pull out my gun. Scully, look at that.

(They look at some parchment covered in a foreign language.)

MULDER: Christos. Looks like a religious text. Can you read Greek at all?

SCULLY: Well, it's pretty rusty but it looks like some kind of lost Gospel. A gospel of Mary Magdalene, and, uh, an account of Christ's life on Earth after the Resurrection.

MULDER: After?

SCULLY: Yeah. It's a heretical text, Mulder-- mythical, I should say, but long rumored to be in existence.

MULDER: Well, what would Micah Hoffman be doing with heretical religious texts?

SCULLY: I think the question is: What would Hoffman be doing forging them?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: I think the real question, "Agents," is: What might O'Fallon be doing with Hoffman's forgeries?

(They both look up at him in grudging respect.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (modestly) You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows.

(MULDER glares at him. WAYNE FEDERMAN holds his hands up defensively.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Don't shoot!



SCENE 5

(Later, MULDER and WAYNE FEDERMAN enter the crypt again. MULDER has his flashlight out.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: I like the way you guys work-- no warrants, no permission, no research. You're like studio executives with guns.

(MULDER ignores him.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Should I call you Agent Mulder or Mr. Mulder, or, like do you have a nickname or something like that?

(They hear a faint clicking )

MULDER: Shh, shh, shh, shh.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Like Skinman?

(MULDER ignores him, looking around the crypt.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Just ignore me.

(MULDER does.)

MULDER: What's that?

FEDERMAN: What the hell was that?

SCULLY: I'm sure this place is crawling with rats.

FEDERMAN: Is that supposed to comfort me?]

(They see another parchment.)

MULDER: Looks like the same gospel of Mary Scully ID'd over at Hoffman's place.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: So, is this a forgery, or is this the real thing?

MULDER: Well, there is no "real" Gospel of Mary, Federman. The, uh, original would be a fake.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: All right, so is this a real fake or a fake fake or...?

(They both jump as a cell phone rings.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Sorry, that's me.

(WAYNE FEDERMAN steps away to talk. MULDER puts his flashlight in his mouth and looks at the parchment.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Yes? ... No, no, no. No, I can hear you. It's just your voice is...

(As WAYNE FEDERMAN walks through the crypt, a human skull jumps out of the way to avoid being stepped on.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) There's like a crackly sound and then I hear a syllab... Stop yelling. Yelling isn't helping the situation. ...

(MULDER is still looking with interest at the parchment.)

MULDER: Hmm...

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Just talk. Y-you're breaking up. No, let me call you back. (turns on a light) Okay. Yeah, I'm telling you... I'm going through a crypt.

(Creepy harpsichord music. The clicking starts again. WAYNE FEDERMAN gasps and drops his flashlight at the sight of a pair of leg bones running across his path. A skull chatters its teeth and skeletal hands dance. One of the hands picks up the dropped flashlight and runs away with it. WAYNE FEDERMAN stares in awe.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Wow!

(The bones appear to be rebuilding a bowl.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (amazed) Oh, my... God.



SCENE 6

(Diner. WAYNE FEDERMAN is sitting between MULDER and SCULLY. They drink coffee, he a glass of juice.)

[TD Note: Mulder "walks" his hand over to pick up his coffee.]

SCULLY: Now, Wayne, I'm sure that it was dark in there and that your eyes were playing tricks on you and you've been influenced by ghost stories and horror movies that take place in crypts and graveyards and you hallucinated this vision of these dancing bones trying to reconstruct this bowl.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: No, I didn't hallucinate. That was mechanical or C.G.I.

MULDER: (chuckling) Federman, that wasn't a movie. That was real life.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: The difference being?

(They have no answer.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Well, I have got my flavor here, so I appreciate all your help. I've got a movie to write.

MULDER: (amazed) You're leaving? You don't want to get to the bottom of this?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Not especially.

MULDER: Well, you know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Well, fiction is quicker than truth and cheaper. You want my advice? You're both crazy.

MULDER: Well, why do you say that?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (to MULDER) Well, you're crazy for believing what you believe. (to SCULLY) And you're crazy for not believing what he believes. I'll leave you with that. Thank you.

(He leaves.)

MULDER: I miss him already.

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, I... I know that Federman's bs-ing you, so I'm really hesitant to mention this, but, um... his story reminds me of the Lazarus Bowl.

MULDER: The Lazarus bowl?

SCULLY: We had this wacky nun in Catholic school-- Sister Callahan-- we used to call her "Sister Spooky" 'cause she would tell us scary stories all the time.

MULDER: Twisted sisters, my kind of nun, you know?

SCULLY: Well, she would hold up an old piece of wood with a rusty nail in it, and she would say "this is an actual piece of the cross that Christ's wrist was nailed to." Or she'd show us a vial of red liquid and say that it was John the Baptist's blood, or something.

MULDER: She'd be in prison today. You realize that.

SCULLY: Well, she would tell this story of when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and she said that there was this old woman who was Lazarus's aunt or something...

MULDER: Lazarus's aunt?

SCULLY: ...who was spinning a clay bowl on a wheel nearby and that Christ's words-- the actual incantation to raise the dead--were recorded in the clay grooves of the pottery just like the way music is recorded into vinyl.

MULDER: You see? It's just not true that you can't get good science at Catholic school. It's a lie.

SCULLY: (laughing, fingering a piece of the clay bowl) Well, Sister Spooky says that, uh... that these words in the clay still have the power to raise the dead just like Jesus raised Lazarus.

MULDER: (smiling at her) That is a very cool story coming from you, Scully. I'll have Chuck Burks meet you over at my office see if this clay has Christ's Greatest Hits on it and I'm going... I'm going to go have another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.



SCENE 7

(MULDER's office. SCULLY is watching CHUCK BURKS examine the pottery piece with sophisticated laser equipment.)

CHUCK BURKS: There's music in the air, Agent Scully. See, everything that exists vibrates and therefore sings. The street, uh, your internal organs, electricity, everything. Here, I'll show you. You see, this is my voice bouncing around in the red here. And all this yellow is ambient sound that we habitually tune out. It's the hum of my hardware, Mulder's porn tapes on pause, the sounds from the street-- everything we hear but we don't know we hear. I can hear it with this machine.

(He hears something in the headphones.)

CHUCK BURKS: (awed) Oh...

SCULLY: What is it?

(CHUCK BURKS takes off the headphones letting SCULLY listen to the ethereal oscillating tone.)

SCULLY: Wow.

CHUCK BURKS: Who made this?

SCULLY: We're not sure. Either a forger by the name of Micah Hoffman or, uh, someone else in the vicinity of Jesus Christ.

(CHUCK BURKS chuckles, then realizes she's not kidding.)

CHUCK BURKS: Oh... Bazingo-- whoever did it is some kind of musical genius. This clay is vibrating in all the keys at once. It's heavenly.



SCENE 8

(Christ's Church. MULDER hands the fragment of parchment to CARDINAL O'FALLON. MULDER is very respectful.)

MULDER: Can you translate what it says there for me, please?

(CARDINAL O'FALLON is reluctant.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Did you recover them from the crypt?

MULDER: Yes.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: (reading) "And then Jesus took his beloved Mary Magdalene in an embrace, an embrace not of God and woman but of man and woman. And Jesus said to Mary, 'love the body for it is all of the soul that our senses can perceive.'"

(MULDER shows him more copies.)

MULDER: And how about these?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: These appear to be copies of the original.

MULDER: Or rough drafts.

CARDINAL O'FALLON: How?

MULDER: They're all forgeries, sir. Did you buy these from Micah Hoffman?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: (ashamed) I thought they were real.

MULDER: I can understand that. Hoffman was a master. My partner had them analyzed and they're virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. The paper is authentic, the ink, the hand, the diction-- everything. Hoffman was also an explosives expert. Do you have any idea what he might have been doing with a bomb in the crypt?

(CARDINAL O'FALLON shakes his head.)

MULDER: Can you think of anybody who might have wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: No.

MULDER: Why were you hiding the documents, sir?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: When Micah came to me... with these, as I then thought, ancient texts and our experts verified them - he exploded a bomb in my heart. The Christ that I'd loved was not the Christ in these texts.

MULDER: So you bought them in order to hide them?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: To keep others from feeling the despair... and the anger that I felt. To protect people from what I can now see they needed no protection from.

MULDER: Why didn't you just destroy the documents yourself?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: I thought they were real. I hated them, I despised them. I would have liked to destroy them, but I couldn't. Is being made a fool of a crime, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: I'd be doing life if it were, sir.



SCENE 9

(SCULLY is sitting at MULDER's desk. The phone rings.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, uh, Scully, it's me. Can you horn in on the Hoffman autopsy for me?

SCULLY: (on phone) Why?

(MULDER is in his car driving. It is raining.)

MULDER: (on phone) I got a feeling Hoffman was dead before he died. He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those forgeries. Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.

SCULLY: (on phone) Oh, Mulder, this bowl. Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has properties he's never seen before.

(MULDER's call waiting beeps.)

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, hold on a second. That's my other line.

(MULDER switches over.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, Mulder.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Agent Mulder? It's Wayne Slash Federman out in L.A.

(WAYNE FEDERMAN is driving his red convertible along a sunny California highway. He talks on the car speaker phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) I can't really talk about the case, you know.

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) That's all right-- Skinman's keeping me in the loop. Listen, who do you see playing you in the movie?

MULDER: (on phone, surprised) I'm in the movie?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Well, it's a character loosely based on you. It's more of an amalgamation.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, hold on a second, Wayne.

(MULDER switches lines back to SCULLY.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Sister Spooky, I've got to take this.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'll call you after the autopsy.

MULDER: (on phone) Thanks.

(MULDER switches back to WAYNE FEDERMAN.)

MULDER: (on phone) How about Richard Gere?

(WAYNE FEDERMAN bursts into laughter.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Ho! Yeah, okay. Uh, seriously. What if I said to you the name "Garry Shandling"?

MULDER: (on phone) Wayne, you're breaking up. It sounded like you said "Garry Shandling."

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Garry Shandling signed on to play the amalgamation loosely based on you and Tea Leoni's playing the amalgamation loosely based on your partner, you stud. The movie's called the Lazarus bowl.

MULDER: (on phone) How do you know about the Lazarus bowl?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) The Skinman. Listen, Shandling and Leoni want to meet you guys... get your flavor-- it's an actor type thing. Come on out to the studio on our dime. We'll make it nice.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, who's... well, then who's going to play Skinner in the movie?

WAYNE FEDERMAN: (on phone) Richard Gere.

MULDER: (on phone) Ri ... Ri ....

(Loud banging as MULDER either hits something with the car or gets a flat tire on the wet road.)



SCENE 10

(Morgue. SCULLY is doing the autopsy on MICAH HOFFMAN.)

SCULLY: Fracturing of skull and surface abrasions initially consistent with concussive force injuries. I am, uh, now weighing the heart which is relatively normal, although somewhat large.

(As she looks up at the scale, the corpse behind her sits up on the table, skin flapping around the open "Y" incision.)

MICAH HOFFMAN'S CORPSE: I'm going to need that when you're done with it.

(SCULLY gasps at the sight of MICAH HOFFMAN's CORPSE talking to her.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

(The body gets up and stands close to her. He stretches and makes a "hoowah" sound, and shakes his torso as if loosening muscles. SCULLY steps closer and stares at him.)

SCULLY: Who are you?

MICAH HOFFMAN'S CORPSE: I am who I am.

(SCULLY reaches out to touch him tentatively with the scalpel. He stops her and she drops it.)

MICAH HOFFMAN'S CORPSE: Ah-ah... Noli me tangere, baby.

[TD: "Noli me tangere" means "Touch me not", from the Bible, John 20:17]

(Keeping her eyes on him, SCULLY kneels down to pick up her scalpel. She cuts her finger through the latex.)

SCULLY: Ow! Damn it!

(When she looks back up from her bloody finger, the corpse is back on the table where it should be. SCULLY looks a bit unsettled. She checks her bloody finger.)



SCENE 11

(Morgue, later. MULDER passes a body on a gurney, then joins SCULLY who is contemplating her band-aid covered finger. She is very pensive.)

MULDER: What'd you find, Scully?

SCULLY: In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were traces of red wine and strychnine.

MULDER: Man, oh, manischevitz-- communion wine, I bet.

SCULLY: Mmm.

MULDER: I bet O'Fallon poisoned Hoffman then placed his body near the explosion to cover his tracks.

SCULLY: It's possible, Mulder.

MULDER: I could get a warrant for O'Fallon.



SCENE 12

(Small gathering in the beautifully lit cathedral. CARDINAL O'FALLON is leading Mass. MULDER and SCULLY enter.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: You're the One God living in truth. Through all eternity you live in unapproachable light...

(SCULLY stops MULDER from going straight up to the altar.)

SCULLY: Mulder... Let's allow the man some dignity, okay?

(MULDER and SCULLY go over to one side of the church. MULDER watches CARDINAL O'FALLON as SCULLY goes over to a side altar above which is a life sized figure of Jesus on the cross. She crosses herself and kneels before it to pray.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: ...to fill your creatures with every blessing and to lead all men to the joyful vision of our life. In our joy we sing to your glory with all the choirs of angels:

Holy, holy, holy Lord
God of power and might,
Heaven and earth are full of your glory.
Hosanna in the highest
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.
Hosanna in the highest...

(SCULLY looks up at the figure and is startled to see that it is now MICAH HOFFMAN CRUCIFIED. He no longer has the wounds from the explosion. He looks down at her.)

MICAH HOFFMAN CRUCIFIED: Consummatum est.

[TD Note: "It is finished.", from John 19:30]

(SCULLY looks to MULDER ten feet away, but he is watching CARDINAL O'FALLON. When SCULLY looks back to the figure, it is once again the statue of Jesus. She is not quite sure of what she saw.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Lord Jesus Christ, you said to your apostles: "I leave you in peace, My peace I give you." Look not on our sins..

(SCULLY goes over to MULDER who saw nothing of her little encounter.).

SCULLY: Let's get this over with.

(Surprised, MULDER follows SCULLY up to CARDINAL O'FALLON's altar.)

CARDINAL O'FALLON: ...But on the faith of your church and grant us the peace and unity of your kingdom. Amen.

(MULDER begins reading CARDINAL O'FALLON his rights.)

MULDER: Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest for the murder of Micah Hoffman. You have the right to remain silent.

(As MULDER places handcuffs on CARDINAL O'FALLON, SCULLY looks up at someone walking down the aisle.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

MULDER: Anything you say can and will be used against you...

SCULLY: Mulder... Do you see what I see?

(MULDER also looks down the aisle.)

MULDER: Yes, I do.

SCULLY: Is that Micah Hoffman?

CARDINAL O'FALLON: Yes, it is.

(MICAH HOFFMAN silently walks toward them smiling broadly. His body shows no signs of either an explosion or crucifixtion.)



SCENE 13

(GREAT shot of SKINNER yelling down into the camera. We feel very small.)

SKINNER: Misidentification of a corpse and subsequent unrequested autopsy...

(MULDER and SCULLY are sitting in SKINNER's office taking the abuse, weakly trying to defend themselves.)

SCULLY: Sir, the dead man looked very much like Micah Hoffman. He had Hoffman's I.D. on him...

SKINNER: Agent Scully... if I'm carrying Marilyn Monroe's purse do you assume that I slept with J.F.K.?

(SCULLY is silent.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, the FBI has always prided itself on the speedy expedition of its cases but this is the first time-- and I hope you're as proud of this as I am-- that we've ever attempted to pursue a murder case where the victim was still alive and healthy.

MULDER: A bomb went off, a crime's been committed. There's a dead body nobody seems to give a damn about, O'Fallon's been less than forthcoming and Hoffman, at the very least is guilty of forgery and extortion.

SKINNER: (standing, emphatically tapping on his desk) Agent Mulder, you will leave O'Fallon alone. You will leave Hoffman alone and Agent Scully, you'll put your trigger-happy scalpel away. Best case scenario... you get to keep your jobs. Worst case, O'Fallon and the church bring a huge embarrassing lawsuit against the Bureau which will feature you two as its sacrificial lambs. As of right now... I am forcing you to take a four-week leave effective immediately pending review.

(Later, SCULLY and MULDER enter MULDER's office.)

MULDER: I think this whole Richard Gere thing is going to Skinner's head.

SCULLY: We're off this case, Mulder.

(CHUCK BURKS is still in the office working on the bowl with his equipment.)

CHUCK BURKS: Compadres. I teased out something very fabulous from your pottery there.

(Recorded sound of a man speaking a foreign language.)

CHUCK BURKS: Layered in under the ambience there. Guess what language that is.

(MULDER is tired. He has had a bad day.)

MULDER: Chuck, I've had a bad day.

CHUCK BURKS: It's a dead language. I had a linguist in here to listen to the recording. It's Aramaic.

SCULLY: That's the language that Christ spoke. (she looks up at MULDER) Did your linguist happen to translate it?

CHUCK BURKS: Yes, he did. It's in two parts. The first part here roughly translates as "I am the walrus. I am the walrus. Paul is dead. Coo-coo-ca-choo." (SCULLY gives a look.) Although there is no Aramaic word for "walrus." So it literally says "I am the bearded cow-like sea beast."

MULDER: What's the second part?

CHUCK BURKS: Second part's a little freakier. Here.

(He plays another part of the recording.)

SCULLY: What is it?

CHUCK BURKS: It appears to be one man commanding another to rise from the dead.

SCULLY: Lazarus?



SCENE 14

(MICAH HOFFMAN's apartment.)

MICAH HOFFMAN: I am become Jesus Christ.

(He laughs loudly. MULDER glances at SCULLY who is sitting beside him on the low couch.)

MULDER: I am become skeptical.

(Camera circles the three as they talk.)

MICAH HOFFMAN: There I was totally bumming after Altamont, and I thought throw in the towel and go to law school or continue to fight and become a forger of scandalous religious documents.

MULDER: Well, I suppose that's a choice every young gifted American male is faced with.

MICAH HOFFMAN: I knew O'Fallon from college. He was a divinity professor of mine.

MULDER: At Columbia.

MICAH HOFFMAN: Yeah. And he's a decent man but with an overweening pride and sense of responsibility borne of a fundamental lack of respect for the human animal. He believes in God, but not in man, in man's ability to choose, to live in freedom. He has Christ in his brain, but not in his heart.

SCULLY: So, uh... you created a Christ in these forgeries that was more suited to your particular world view?

MICAH HOFFMAN: Yeah. But before I could write like Christ I had to become him in much the same way I imagine an actor who plays a part becomes that part. So I immersed myself in Jesus Christ. Not just the church and teachings but the man, the custom of his time, the language, the vibe, the feeling of Christ.

SCULLY: So why didn't O'Fallon and the Elders go outside the church for authentification?

MICAH HOFFMAN: Because the forgeries were too damning of the church. They couldn't risk the exposure. But then, something truly weird came over me.

SCULLY: Remorse?

MICAH HOFFMAN: Conversion, Agent Scully. The lightning bolt that transformed Saul to Paul on the road to Damascus. One day I was not just impersonating Jesus Christ, I had become him. That's why I blew up the crypt. The forgeries were blasphemous and needed to be destroyed.

(MULDER hands over the phone.)

MULDER: How did your cell phone get on the dead man in the crypt?

MICAH HOFFMAN: God works in mysterious ways.



SCENE 15

(MULDER's apartment. Late evening. MULDER is lying on his couch watching "Plan Nine From Outer Space" on TV, one of the first cheesy sci-fi films made. He speaks the lines along with the actors. He obviously knows the movie very well.)

MULDER AND TV: Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems. But those whom we are using cannot think they are the dead brought to assimilated life by our electrode...

(Someone knocks at the door.)

MULDER: It's open.

(SCULLY enters.)

MULDER AND TV: You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider the earth people who can think... ...

(MULDER sits up and makes room for SCULLY to sit on the arm of the couch beside him. The movie continues.)

TV: ... are so frightened by those who cannot be dead.

MULDER: Couldn't sleep either, huh?

SCULLY: Plan 9 From Outer Space?

MULDER: Yeah. It's the Ed Wood investigative method. This movie is so profoundly bad in such a childlike way that it hypnotizes my conscious critical mind and frees up my right brain to make associo-poetic leaps and I started flashing on Hoffman and O'Fallon. How there's this archetypal relationship like Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Judas or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor, or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's St. Paul.

SCULLY: How about Hoffman's Roadrunner to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?

(She grins and he laughs. On the screen, a body is rising out of the ground.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Yeah?

SCULLY: Do you think it's at all possible that Hoffman is really Jesus Christ?

MULDER: Are you making fun of me?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Well, no, I don't. But crazy people can be very persuasive.

SCULLY: Well, yes, I know that.

(They both smile as MULDER takes the hit.)

SCULLY: Maybe true faith is really a form of insanity.

MULDER: Are you directing that at me?

SCULLY: (emphatically) No. I'm directing it at myself and at Ed Wood.

MULDER: Well, you know, even a broken clock is right 730 times a year.

(They watch the movie. On the screen, a zombie woman walks toward the camera.)

SCULLY: How...?

MULDER: (answering the question before she asks) 42.

SCULLY: You've seen this movie 42 times?

MULDER: Yes.

SCULLY: Doesn't that make you sad? It makes me sad.

(They sit quietly for a moment as the movie continues. Two men are looking at a map.)

ACTOR 1: You ever been to Hollywood?

ACTOR 2: Oh, a couple of times a few years ago.

ACTOR 1: You're going to be there in the morning. Just a few minutes from Hollywood in the town of San Fernando reports have come in of saucers flying so low...

MULDER: You know, Scully, we've got four weeks probation vacation and nothing to do and Wayne Federman's invited us out to L.A. to watch his movie being filmed and God knows I could use a little sunshine.

(She looks up at him. He smiles.)

MULDER: Scully...

(On the screen, a flying saucer wobbles by.)

SCULLY: (resigned) California, here we come.



SCENE 16

(MULDER and SCULLY are walking down what looks like a Boston city street. [Ally Mcbeal?] Happy California Movie Music. A man on a bicycle behind them rings a bell and passes them with the Roadrunner "beep, beep." Then their GUIDE leads them through a lower door and they are on a sound stage set up to look like a graveyard. Lots of cameras, people in costume, cranes lowering gravestones, etc. ZOMBIES are practicing moaning and combat moves. MULDER grins at SCULLY. They look quite out of place. Of course, they are wearing their standard office wear. WAYNE FEDERMAN comes up to greet them.)

STAGE 8
20TH CENTURY FOX
HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Agents! I'm so glad you could hang.

(He kisses MULDER on the cheek, and moves to do the same to SCULLY, but ends up with a handshake.)

WAYNE FEDERMAN: Come on, I want you to meet the people that are going to play you. Garry Shandling, Tea Leoni, this is Agents Mulder and Scully.

(GARRY SHANDLING and TEA LEONI get up from their chairs and greet MULDER and SCULLY, all shaking hands. And looking closely at each other. TEA LEONI is wearing a HUGE cross.)

MULDER: Nice to meet you.

SCULLY: Hi.

GARRY SHANDLING: Nice to meet you.

TEA LEONI: It's a pleasure.

MULDER: Big fan. Fox Mulder.

(MULDER is shy in front of TEA LEONI. Both women notice. Very cute.)

TEA LEONI: No kidding. Huh.

(Pause. MULDER looks over at GARRY SHANDLING who jerks his eyes up from MULDER's crotch area. TEA LEONI turns to SCULLY.)

TEA LEONI: Well, you know, while I've got you here maybe, uh, maybe you could show me how to run in these things.

(She indicates the 2 inch heels she is wearing that SCULLY could easily wear in an aerobics class.)

TEA LEONI: Right over here, I was thinking 'cause, I tell you, I'm having a hell of a time with these heels. What, are they government issue or something?

(TEA LEONI walks a few steps away. SCULLY, not knowing what else to do, follows. MULDER is left with GARRY SHANDLING. While the two men talk, we see SCULLY, several feet away running her heart out back and forth in her own higher heels. TEA LEONI is barely watching her, much more interested in the conversation she is having on her cell phone. Hysterical. The scene must be watched twice - once for the guys and once for the girls.)

[TD Note: Arlene Pileggi, Gillian Anderson's stand-in and Mitch Pileggi's wife, is doing the running. She nearly tripped during filming but ended up receiving a huge round of applause. Very funny scene which I missed the first time 'round as I was too busy watching DD and Garry Shandling.]

GARRY SHANDLING: Hey, uh... Uh...

MULDER: Hi.

GARRY SHANDLING: How are you? Seriously, listen could I ask you something?

MULDER: Sure.

GARRY SHANDLING: Uh, do you dress to the left or to the right?

(Sound of SCULLY's heels as she runs past them. MULDER glances down and laughs, embarrassed.)

MULDER: What do you... What do you mean?

(GARRY SHANDLING laughs briefly, then clears his throat. He is very serious. SCULLY runs past again.)

GARRY SHANDLING: Look, when I play a character I need to find his center, his, sort of, rudder, so to say and then everything comes from that.

(MULDER thinks about it uncomfortably and looks over to where SCULLY is sprinting past TEA LEONI yet again.)

MULDER: (thinks about it) Uh... I guess mostly to the left.

(Again, GARRY SHANDLING chuckles then gets serious. A dog, looks like DD's Blue, walks around in the background.)

[TD: Check, it is Blue. Blue's mother appeared in "Ice".]

GARRY SHANDLING: "Mostly"?

MULDER: (clarifying) Most of the time.

GARRY SHANDLING: Most of the time. To the left.

MULDER: Mm-hmm.

GARRY SHANDLING: Wardrobe!

(GARRY SHANDLING walks away, leaving MULDER alone staring after him.)

(Later, MULDER and SCULLY watch as the scene in the graveyard is being filmed. SUGAR BEAR, the director, is with the camera crew.)

WOMAN: Rolling!

SUGAR BEAR: And rollando! Come on, now, kick it in the ass and action, zombies!

(The scene starts. ZOMBIES do their zombie thing. TEA LEONI screams as one of them bites her shoulder. Then the ZOMBIE pauses. His mouth full.)

ZOMBIE: What is this?

SUGAR BEAR: Cut! Go ahead, ruin my career.

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT : What seems to be the problem, Mr. Zombie, sir?

ZOMBIE: (mouth still full) What the hell is this? What the hell's in my mouth? What's Tea Leoni's shoulder made out of?

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: Uh, craft service, what is Tea Leoni's shoulder made of?

TINA THE CRAFT SERVICE GIRL: Turkey, just like you asked for.

PRODUCTION ASSISTANT: Turkey. Ms. Leoni's shoulder's made of turkey.

ZOMBIE: Tofurkey! I asked for tofurkey! I'm a vegetarian! Half the zombies are vegetarian! Oh, my God!

(The TOFURKEY ZOMBIE spits the meat out and runs off the set yelling: )

TOFURKEY ZOMBIE: The people are made out of turkey!



SCENE 17
THE BEVERLY ERNESTO HOTEL
HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

(Nice hotel. SCULLY is in a bubble bath. Camera pans up her leg to her face. Her hair is up in a clip. She is drinking a glass of red wine and is on the phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hello?

SCULLY: (on phone) Hey, Mulder, it's me. What are you doing?

MULDER: (on phone) I'm, uh, working at the, uh, computer. What are you doing?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm, uh, packing. Just, you know, getting ready for our trip back to D.C. tomorrow.

MULDER: (on phone) You know, Scully, I was just thinking about Lazarus, Ed Wood, and those tofurkey-eating zombies. How come when people come back from the dead they always want to hurt the living?

(As he talks, SCULLY's portion of the screen pushes to the left. The right side of the screen now shows MULDER in an identical bubble bath. There is a bottle of beer on the side of his tub in the same place SCULLY has her wine. It looks like they are sitting in a heart shaped tub together.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, that's because people can't really come back from the dead, Mulder. I mean, ghosts and zombies are just projections of our own repressed cannibalistic and sexual fears and desires. They are who we fear that we are at heart-- just mindless automatons who can only kill and eat.

(MULDER's right hand is not visible and the water in his tub starts moving as she talks. Hmm.)

MULDER: (on phone) Party pooper. Well, I got a new theory. I say that when zombies try to eat people, that's just the first stage. You see, they've just come back from being dead so they're going to do all the things they miss from when they were alive. So, first, they're going to eat, then they're going to drink, then they're going to dance and make love.

SCULLY: (on phone, smiling) Oh, I see. So it's just that we never get to stay with them long enough to see the gentler side of the undead.

MULDER: (on phone) Exactly.

(MULDER's call waiting beeps.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hold on a second, that's my other line.

(He clicks the receiver.)

MULDER: (on phone) Hello?

SKINNER: (on phone, voice) Agent Mulder, it's Assistant Director Skinner. I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time.

MULDER: (on phone) No, sir, I'm just at the, uh, computer.

SKINNER: (on phone) Listen, I just wanted to apologize for coming down so hard on you during the Hoffman slash O'Fallon case.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh. I appreciate that, Skinman.

SKINNER: (on phone) Don't call me that.

MULDER: (on phone) Yes, sir. Um... Uh, where are you now?

SKINNER: (on phone) I'm right underneath you. I'm in L.A., at the same hotel as you. Right below you and Agent Scully.

(The screen splits again at the bottom showing SKINNER also in a bubble bath with a bottle of champagne.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Federman got me an Associate Producer credit on the movie.

MULDER: (on phone) A.P. Skinner, huh?

(MULDER chuckles, then stops when SKINNER doesn't chuckle.)

MULDER: (on phone) Uh... So what are you up to right now, sir?

SKINNER: (on phone, taking a sip of champagne) I'm taking a bubble bath.

MULDER: (on phone) Uh, hold on just one second, sir.

(MULDER clicks over on the receiver.)

MULDER: (on phone, grinning with delight) Hey, Scully, Skinman is calling me from a bubble bath.

SKINNER: (on phone) It's still me, Mulder.

(Indeed, SCULLY takes a sip of her wine, not hearing anything. MULDER is embarrassed.)

MULDER: (on phone) Uh, sir, well, hold on one second, sir.

(He clicks the receiver again.)

MULDER: (on phone) Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah.

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, Skinner is calling me from a bubble bath.

SCULLY: (on phone) Wow, he's really gone Hollywood.

MULDER: (on phone) Totally.

SCULLY: (on phone) You know, Mulder, speaking of Hollywood, I think that Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.

MULDER: (on phone) Oh, yeah, right. Like Tea Leoni's ever going to have a crush on me.

SCULLY: (on phone) I think that Shandling likes you a bit, too.

MULDER: (on phone) Really?



SCENE 18
SIXTEEN MONTHS LATER

(Back in the movie theatre from the teaser, GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER and TEA LEONI AS SCULLY are beginning the kiss in the coffin again.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: I love you, Scully. No ifs, ands or...

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: Bees.

(Passionate kissing goes on and on. MULDER and SCULLY are mortified. They glance at each other.)

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: Wait, wait, Mulder... I can't.

(SKINNER is beaming.)

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: I know this feels wrong because we're friends and we treat each other as equals, but...

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: No, no, it's not that. It's not that.

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: Well, what then?

(Moment of heavy breathing. In the foreground of the movie, we see MULDER turn as if to say something to SCULLY, then he drops his head.)

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: I'm in love with Assistant Director Walter Skinner.

(The AUDIENCE does not seem surprised to hear this. MULDER stands up from his seat.)

MULDER: (loudly) That's it, Scully, I can't take it anymore.

SCULLY: Shh, Mulder, sit down.

GARRY SHANDLING AS MULDER: What does he have that I don't have?

TEA LEONI AS SCULLY: A bigger flashlight.

(The AUDIENCE laughs loudly. SCULLY watches MULDER walk up the aisle, then looks over at SKINNER who has been watching them. He shakes his head and she shrugs weakly. His date, a young starlet looking girl takes his arm and kisses his cheek, playfully turning his attention back to the movie. He glances over at SCULLY again, feeling a little guilty perhaps.)

(Later. MULDER is sitting on a hill in the graveyard movie set. He is holding his plastic "Lazarus Bowl" and morosely eating the popcorn out of it. He looks up as wind begins blowing. SCULLY has turned one of the big fans toward him. She releases the fan and goes over to sit beside him.)

SCULLY: Been looking all over for you.

MULDER: (sadly) They got it so wrong, Scully.

(SCULLY sighs and sits, taking some of his popcorn.)

SCULLY: I got a page from the Washington Bureau. Micah Hoffman was murdered tonight. Murdered in his own home by Cardinal O'Fallon who then hanged himself. A murder-suicide.

MULDER: It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.

SCULLY: Wow... It's all over now.

MULDER: No, no, it's just beginning. Hoffman and O'Fallon were these complicated, flawed, beautiful people and now they'll just be remembered as jokes because of this movie. The character based on O'Fallon is listed in the credits as "Cigarette-Smoking Pontiff." How silly is that?

SCULLY: Pretty silly.

MULDER: Yeah, what about us? How are we going to be remembered now 'cause of this movie?

SCULLY: Well, hopefully, the movie will tank.

MULDER: What about all the dead people who are forever silent and can't tell their stories anymore? They're all going to have to rely on Hollywood to show the future how we lived and it'll all become... oversimplified and trivialized and Cigarette-Smoking Pontificized and become as plastic and meaningless as this stupid plastic Lazarus Bowl.

SCULLY: I think the dead are beyond caring what people think about them. Hopefully we can adopt the same attitude. (suppressing a laugh, she smiles at him) You do know that there aren't real dead people out there, right? That this is a movie set?

MULDER: The dead are everywhere, Scully.

SCULLY: Well... We're alive. And we're relatively young and Skinner was so tickled by the movie..

MULDER: I bet he was...

SCULLY: That he has given us a Bureau credit card to use for the evening.

(She holds up the card and giggles. He smiles.)

SCULLY: Come on.

(She takes his arm and helps him up. Together, they run down the steep slope of the hill to a path.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I have something to confess.

MULDER: What's that?

SCULLY: I'm in love with Associate Producer Walter Skinner.

(They both laugh, and MULDER dumps the half-full bowl on top of a small statue's head.)

MULDER: Ah... Me, too.

(Holding hands, they walk out of sight past the moonlit backdrop. The wind from the fan causes one of the branches on a tree to dip down and scratch again the plastic bowl. It sounds like a record player needle. Then, as the shadows of MULDER and SCULLY pass on out of view, the music begins and undead figures rise up from the graves and begin to dance passionately and happily, cha-chas and tangos. The green screen in the background changes to a graveyard continuing the scene from the foreground. A full moon glows.]

[TD Note: The music playing is the fourth track from BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB, in a superior interpretation rendered by Mark Snow, called "PUEBLO NUEVO".]

KANSAS CITY, KANSAS

(Nice average neighborhood. Lovely day. Someone is mowing a yard. Two young men wearing dress shirts and ties are riding their bicycles. They turn and move their heads in perfect harmony with each other. Very funny. They ride up to one of the houses. In the driveway is an older model red convertible with a personalized Missouri plate, BETTY. Two bumper stickers: "Eat Right, Exercise, Die Anyway," and "Cleverly Disguised as a Responsible Adult" are on the back of the car. They each remove a couple of religious pamphlets, "The Messenger," from the backs of their bikes and go up to the door and knock. A woman, BETTY TEMPLETON, late thirties, answers the door. We don't see her face. Part of her curly red hair is in a ponytail on top of her head held together with a Betty Boop hairclip. She is wearing a pink and black shirt. The two MISSIONARIES beam at her.)

FIRST MISSIONARY: Good afternoon. I hope we're not bothering you.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Actually, I'm just...

SECOND MISSIONARY: We really won't take up much of your time.

BETTY TEMPLETON: I'm just waiting for a call...

FIRST MISSIONARY: We're all waiting, ma'am ... for the good Lord to call in his flock.

BETTY TEMPLETON: ... from the cable TV people. I'm just moving in. (dismissively) God bless.

(She closes the door in their faces as a moving truck pulls up.)

(The MISSIONARIES peep in the door window together, then we see them back on their bikes riding further down the street. They pull up into another driveway. An older model blue convertible is there, personalized Arkansas plate "LULU," and bumper stickers "Eat Right, Exercise, Die Anyway," and "Cleverly Disguised as a Responsible Adult." The stickers on the opposite sides as the one's on BETTY's car. They get the pamphlets, then go up to the door and knock. It is opened by a woman, LULU PFEIFFER, late thirties. She is wearing a blue and black shirt. Part of her curly red hair is in a ponytail on top of her head held together with a Betty Boop hairclip. We don't see her face.)

FIRST MISSIONARY: Good afternoon. I hope... we're not bothering...

(He stammers to a stop as he and his partner stare at her.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Yes?

SECOND MISSIONARY: You're... Weren't you...

FIRST MISSIONARY: Yeah, didn't we just...

LULU PFEIFFER: Didn't you just what?

SECOND MISSSIONARY: Speak to you.

LULU PFEIFFER: Excuse me?

FIRST MISSIONARY: We just spoke to a woman who...

SECOND MISSIONARY: ... could have been your twin.

LULU PFEIFFER: What are you talking about?

FIRST MISSIONARY: Yeah, just down the street-- she's just moving in-- your spitting image.

SECOND MISSIONARY: You're really not going to believe it when you see her.

(She slams the door in their faces. We see them through the peephole.)

FIRST MISSIONARY: Ma'am?

LULU PFEIFFER: (yelling from inside the house) Go away! Get out of here!

(Through the peephole, we see the two MISSIONARIES turn and look at each other. The FIRST MISSIONARY pushes his partners shoulder aggressively. The SECOND MISSIONARY pushes back. They begin punching each other. LULU PFEIFFER watches for a moment, then uncomfortably turns her back on the now bloody door and walks away. Full shot as they then begin beating the daylights out of each other, punching and rolling around in the grass in the front yard. After a moment, a police car arrives and the two COPS get out and try to break up the fight. The two MISSIONARIES punch the COPS and go for each other again.)

COP: Cuff him!

(The COPS again try to restrain the men. Fade to black.)

SCENE 2
KANSAS CITY, KANSAS
ONE DAY LATER

(A silver sedan is parked outside BETTY TEMPLETON's house. A tall dark-haired man and a short red-haired woman knock at the door. We don't see their faces. She answers the door. We now see her face. She is wearing pink and red.)

MULDER'S VOICE: Betty Templeton?

BETTY TEMPLETON: Yes?

MULDER'S VOICE: We're with the FBI. We'd like to ask about an incident-- a possible religious hate crime in your neighborhood.

BETTY TEMPLETON: I just moved in yesterday. I don't know anything about any incident.

SCULLY'S VOICE: Well, we have two young men in the car who say you do know something.

(Sitting in the back seat of the car are the two MISSIONARIES. Their faces are cut and badly bruised. One is in a neck brace.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Oh, my God. Those are the boys that were here yesterday. What happened?

MULDER'S VOICE: They were beaten to within an inch of their lives by each other after visiting the home of a woman living a few blocks over.

BETTY TEMPLETON: What woman?

SCULLY'S VOICE: A woman who, by both young men's accounts fits your description.

BETTY TEMPLETON: (walking out into the yard) She, uh... lives around here?

MULDER'S VOICE: Are you a practitioner of the occult, Miss Templeton? Wicca? Voodoo? Satanism? The black art of bodily bilocation?

BETTY TEMPLETON: Me? (chuckles nervously) No. You know what they say-- everyone has a twin out there somewhere.

(The dark-haired man and the red-haired woman look at each other. They are NOT our MULDER and SCULLY, but look very similar.)

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER: No, we don't know what they say.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Well, if there's someone who fits my description, why isn't someone talking to her?

WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY: We went over to the house, but it's empty. No one lives there.

MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER: Frankly, we're not even sure she exists.

(The blue convertible driven by LULU PFEIFFER passes by followed by a moving truck. They watch it pass. LULU PFEIFFER and BETTY TEMPLETON lock hostile gazes. The WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY and the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER look at each other. Without warning, she punches him twice. He blocks her third punch, and hits her back. BETTY TEMPLETON backs up and runs back into the house. The WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY hits the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER again. They fight and she knocks him to the ground. She kicks him in the stomach. As BETTY TEMPLETON watches from inside the house and the MISSIONARIES watch from inside the car, the two roll around on the ground. The MAN gets on top and hits the WOMAN, then the WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY looks like she knees him in the groin. She runs and gets in the car and starts it. The MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER recovers and runs to the driver's side window and grabs her. She drives off quickly, her partner dangling from the window. BETTY TEMPLETON covers her mouth at the sound of screeching tires and a crash.)



SCENE 3

(MULDER's office. MULDER is sitting at his desk running the slide projector. SCULLY stands next to him. Two slides of the silver sedan crashed against a tree. A man wearing an FBI jacket is in the picture.)

MULDER: This is an FBI fleet sedan from our Kansas City field office requisitioned by two seasoned agents there driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour by the female agent in a novel effort to kill her male counterpart. Now, you might think I'm going to suggest psychokinesis-- pk-- someone or something controlling the agents with remote, mind-bending power.

SCULLY: But it's not?

MULDER: Both agents sustained critical injuries. Their stories eerily similar ...

(Two slides of the WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY lying in full body cast in the hospital.)

MULDER: ... as if they temporarily lost control of their minds unable to alter their behavior.

(Two slides of the MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE MULDER also in full body casts.)

MULDER: You may think that I'm going to say it's past lives unresolved or fate, stalking the agents like an animal ...

SCULLY: ... but you're not.

MULDER: No, the interesting thing about these agents is they had worked together for seven years previously without any incident.

SCULLY: Seven years?

MULDER: Yeah, but they are not ... romantically involved if that's what you're thinking.

SCULLY: Not even I would be so farfetched.

(The next slide shows that the two agents are in the same hospital room, with their matching injuries.)

MULDER: You have any ideas, Scully, any thoughts?

SCULLY: What I'm thinking, Mulder, is how familiar this seems. Playing Watson to your Sherlock. You dangling clues out in front of me one by one. It's a game, and... and, as usual, you're, you're holding something back from me. You're not telling me something about this case.

MULDER: (finger to his mouth) Hmm...

SCULLY: Okay, so these agents were investigating something.

(MULDER chuckles.)

SCULLY: Something... much like what they themselves were almost killed by. Uh, something they came into contact with. Uh... Third party?

(MULDER, playing with her, holds up two fingers.)

SCULLY: Two third parties. Twins? Relatives? A doppelganger?

(MULDER shakes his head and taps his nose.)

SCULLY: (like she's playing Twenty Questions) A corporeal likeness that appears unbidden from the spirit world the sight of which presages one's own death or... a double, conjured into the world by a technique called bilocation ...

(MULDER stops teasing and looks up at her in awe as she continues on her roll.)

SCULLY: ... which in psychological terms represents the person's secret desires and impulses committing acts that the, uh, real person cannot commit himself ... or herself?

(MULDER smiles at her.)

SCULLY: Mulder, the slide, please.

(MULDER advances the projector to show a slide of the Kansas driver's license of BETTY TEMPLETON.)

SCULLY: (proudly claps her hands) Yes!

MULDER: (pouting) Don't go thinking I'm going to start doing the autopsies.

(SCULLY looks smug.)



SCENE 4
DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY

(LULU PFEIFFER, wearing a blue shirt, pulls up in front of Koko's Copy Center. She gets out of her blue convertible and enters the store. She finds TOM, the FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER. A "Help Wanted" sign is in the window.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Excuse me. Hi, I applied for the sales job you posted.

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Ah, yeah, I remember. How could I forget?

LULU PFEIFFER: Excuse me?

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Uh, there's a problem with your application as I recall, Miss...

(He looks at a folder.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Pfeiffer. Are you sure?

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Lulu Pfeiffer. Yes, you reside at 15527 Moreton Bay Street?

LULU PFEIFFER: Not any longer, I've moved.

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: You moved?

LULU PFEIFFER: Yes, and I don't have my new address yet.

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Actually, Miss Pfeiffer, that's what's sending up the red flag. You move a lot and there's also your employment history-- 17 jobs in 17 states in the past three years? You seem to have as many jobs here as you have addresses.

LULU PFEIFFER: I had a restless streak.

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Well, the copy business takes a motivated person.

LULU PFEIFFER: Oh, I'm an extremely versatile employee as you can see by my resume.

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: Well, what I can tell is you've left a variety of jobs: Mongolian barbecue chef, high-rise window washer, wild animal trainer, palm reader.

(All the machines around them start beeping.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Yes, but I am on a career path now.

SECOND CUSTOMER: Hey, what's going on here? All my copies are black!

THIRD CUSTOMER: My machine's going crazy.

FEMALE CUSTOMER: Who's running this place?

(The FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER turns in desperation to LULU PFEIFFER.)

FIRST KOKO'S MANAGER: I can start you immediately. There's a clean uniform in the employee washroom.

(LULU PFEIFFER beams as the MANAGER runs off to deal with the problems. Her expression sours as she sees the red convertible driven by BETTY TEMPLETON pull up outside the store. BETTY TEMPLETON looks at the address and checks the wanted adds in the paper she has with her. Just then, the harried MANAGER removes the "Help Wanted" sign from the window. Papers are flying behind him. BETTY TEMPLETON scowls and drives off.)



SCENE 5

(Another branch of Koko's Printing. BETTY TEMPLETON is talking to the SECOND KOKO's MANAGER, TIM.)

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: That's quite a string of positions you've had, Miss... Templeton. 17 jobs in the last three years.

BETTY TEMPLETON: I would've listed more but there wasn't any room left on your form.

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: 17's plenty, believe me.

BETTY TEMPLETON: I think you'll find my former employers will only give the highest personal references.

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: It's not your references, it's the jobs themselves. Mongolian barbecue chef, high-rise window washer, wild animal trainer?

BETTY TEMPLETON: I'm a highly versatile employee.

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: What guarantee do I have that you won't just up and quit tomorrow?

BETTY TEMPLETON: You have my personal word on it. I'm here in Kansas City to stay.

(The MANAGER nods, unconvinced.)



SCENE 6
PORCHERIE HOTEL
9:17 PM

(Old hotel. BERT ZUPANIC, a large, very strong looking man well into his forties, is in a room counting a lot of money into a briefcase. A giant neon "W" flashes behind him. There is a knock at the door..)

BERT ZUPANIC: Who is it?

MULDER: (voice) Mr. Zupanic, it's the FBI.

BERT ZUPANIC: (panic) Excuse me?

MULDER: (voice) It's the FBI, Mr. Zupanic. Open up.

BERT ZUPANIC: Give me a minute.

(Nervously, BERT ZUPANIC packs the money away and goes to open the door for MULDER and SCULLY.)

MULDER: Bert Zupanic?

BERT ZUPANIC: Yeah?

MULDER: We're hoping you can help us find the whereabouts of a woman we think you're familiar with, a Betty Templeton.

(MULDER holds up a photo.)

BERT ZUPANIC: I don't know no Betty Templeton.

SCULLY: Maybe you should take another look at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic. Five-foot three, red hair. Maybe I can jog your memory.

(SCULLY holds up a newspaper photo. It is of BERT ZUPANIC and either LULU PFEIFFER or BETTY TEMPLETON waving from a car in a Fourth of July parade. The car's banner says ZUPANIC.)

SCULLY: Are you still pleading ignorance, Mr. Zupanic? Is that not you in last year's Fourth of July parade?

BERT ZUPANIC: Yeah.

SCULLY: And who's that sitting next to you?

BERT ZUPANIC: Her?

SCULLY: Try Betty Templeton. We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic. She seems to have left town in a hurry.

BERT ZUPANIC: She did?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

BERT ZUPANIC: Didn't she used to live on Moreton Bay in a pink house?

SCULLY: Alderwood, blue house.

BERT ZUPANIC: (surprised) On Alderwood?

SCULLY: Mr. Zupanic, do you have any reason to be lying to us?

BERT ZUPANIC: No, sir. I mean, ma'am.

(MULDER nods.)

SCULLY: Thank you, Mr. Zupanic. I've no doubt we'll be in touch with you.

(BERT ZUPANIC closes the door and MULDER and SCULLY walk down the hall to the elevator.)

MULDER: You know what I'm thinking?

SCULLY: That Mr. Zupanic not only knows Betty Templeton and where we can find her but that he is hip to whatever she's into and that I should take a look at that house he mentioned on Moreton Bay Street while you go and find out from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly that he's clearly hiding about Betty Templeton.

MULDER: I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.

(The elevator opens and SCULLY enters it.)

SCULLY: Well, I guess that's why they put the "I" in the FBI.

(MULDER looks up quickly as he hears something down the hall. As the door closes on SCULLY, MULDER ducks out of sight. As MULDER watches, BERT ZUPANIC leaves his apartment and enters the elevator. Fast elevator. As soon as he is gone, MULDER then goes to the apartment door again.)



SCENE 7
FROGGY'S BAR

(Average bar. Bar glasses are stacked in a very stupid unstable triangle formation. BERT ZUPANIC enters with the briefcase full of money.)

JUKEBOX: "I'm going to be standing on the corner of 12th and Vine Going to be standing on the corner of 12th Street and Vine."

BERT ZUPANIC: Let me get a double, Freddie.

FREDDIE: I thought you're in training, Bert, my man.

BERT ZUPANIC: Would you just pour?

JUKEBOX: "Well, I might take a train
I might take a plane
But if I have to walk
I'm going just the same
I'm going to Kansas City,
Kansas City here I come."

(BERT ZUPANIC approaches BETTY TEMPLETON also sitting at the bar. She is still wearing her red and blue Koko's uniform shirt. He sits beside her. She looks pleasantly surprised.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Nice outfit.

JUKEBOX: "They got some crazy little women there."

BERT ZUPANIC: Freddie, fire in the hole. Seven and seven for the lady and make it stiff.

BETTY TEMPLETON: (amazed) Oh, my God. How did you do that?

BERT ZUPANIC: Do what?

BETTY TEMPLETON: (tipsy) How did you know my drink?

(He looks at her in shock.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: I feel like you're looking right through me. Like you're reading my soul like a book.

(She takes another sip. BERT ZUPANIC takes the drink out of her hand.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Maybe you've had enough of that. You are in trouble, aren't you?

BETTY TEMPLETON: I don't know. I could be. What kind of trouble are you looking for?

BERT ZUPANIC: You don't want to go home tonight, okay?

BETTY TEMPLETON: It just so happens I don't got a home to go to. Anyway... I'm Betty Templeton.

(She puts out her hand for him to shake.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Alderwood Avenue?

BETTY TEMPLETON: (pulls her hand back, freaked) My God.

(He laughs.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: I'm shaking.

BERT ZUPANIC: "Betty Templeton." Oh, that's perfect.

(BETTY TEMPLETON looks up as LULU PFEIFFER enters the bar.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: (whispering into BERT ZUPANIC's ear) I got to take care of...

(He chuckles. BETTY TEMPLETON and LULU PFEIFFER glare at each other across the room. Suddenly, the bar begins shaking, then explodes in violence. The stupid pyramid of glasses explodes and tables fall. LULU PFEIFFER leaves the bar, and the shaking stops.)



SCENE 8
PAT DEVINE'S KANSAS CITY AUDITORIUM

(Almost empty wrestling arena. A man is sweeping. SCULLY enters and hears two men laughing and talking. She looks around.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully!

(MULDER is casually sitting in one of the sections talking to an cigar-smoking, older African-American man, ARGYLE SAPERSTEIN. SCULLY walks up the stairs toward them.)

MULDER: I want you to meet a buddy of mine. It's Mr. Argyle Sapersteen.

SAPERSTEIN: (correcting MULDER) Stein.

MULDER: Saperstein, excuse me.

SAPERSTEIN: Ma'anish ta na.

[TD: Hebrew, I'm told it means "Yeah, so what else is new?".]

MULDER: This is my partner, Dana Scully.

SAPERSTEIN: Pleasure and an honor.

SCULLY: So I take it from your posture, Mulder, you've solved this case.

MULDER: Not solved it, but I have narrowed down the search for our perpetrator with the kind help of Mr. Saperstein here.

SCULLY: Narrowed it down to where?

SAPERSTEIN: (indicating the wrestling ring) Right down there.

MULDER: Our mystery woman is indeed involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic, the man we spoke to at his hotel, who will be fighting here two days hence with the mystery woman almost undoubtedly in attendance.

SAPERSTEIN: If it's the lady I'm thinking, she's not much to look at, but he says she brings him luck.

SCULLY: Bert Zupanic is a boxer?

SAPERSTEIN: A wrestler-- semipro.

SCULLY: So what? We wait around Kansas City for a couple of days until we can talk with this woman?

MULDER: Well, there's lots to do here, and the barbecue's second to none right, Mr. Saperstein? Plus Mr. Saperstein's going to show me some in-your-face, smack-down moves so I can quit getting my ass kicked so often, right? Oh, and there's an art exhibit that traces the influence of Soviet art on the American pop culture, right? Unless, of course you've already found Betty Templeton.

SCULLY: Well, finding Betty Templeton won't solve this case, Mulder. Not unless we find Lulu Pfeiffer.

MULDER: Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?

SCULLY: Our doppelganger who lived, until yesterday in a pink house on Moreton Bay Street, but she's not a manifestation, Mulder, she's real and so is the path of destruction that she's left in her wake. Though there seems to be no connection of any kind between these two women, Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer have traveled city to city across 17 U.S. States, one alternately trailing the other for the past 12 years and wherever they have been, mayhem has followed.

[CarriK: Ooops. Someone in continuity messed up. Betty was in the pink house and Lulu in the blue.]

SAPERSTEIN: Damn.

SCULLY: It's not just car accidents and fistfights, Mulder. It's house fires and explosions and even riots.

SAPERSTEIN: The lady knows her stuff.

(MULDER and SCULLY share a look. MULDER gets up to follow SCULLY.)

MULDER: Sholom alecheim.

SAPERSTEIN: Yeah. Yo' mama.

(MULDER and SCULLY glance back up at him, then leave the auditorium. SAPERSTEIN watch them go, then dials his cell phone.)

(BERT ZUPANIC's hotel room. Phone rings. BERT ZUPANIC is in bed with BETTY TEMPLETON. He wakes up and answers the phone.)

BERT ZUPANIC: (on phone) Hello?

SAPERSTEIN: (on phone) Where's my money?

BERT ZUPANIC: (on phone) I got it. I'm bringing it.

SAPERSTEIN: (on phone) Yeah, that's what I heard last night. Now you got the feds on your ass.

BERT ZUPANIC: (on phone) What?

SAPERSTEIN: (on phone) Good luck charm don't sound so lucky no more, Boychick. Maybe I should cancel the fight.

BERT ZUPANIC: (on phone) I'm bringing the money, okay? I'm bringing it.

SAPERSTEIN: (on phone) I'm having lunch at Froggy's. No money, no fight, Titanic.

(SAPERSTEIN hangs up.)

(BERT ZUPANIC sighs and hangs up also.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Are you in trouble or something?

BERT ZUPANIC: I'm just, uh... I got to be somewhere, okay?

BETTY TEMPLETON: Why? What time is it? Oh, God, I'm going to be late for work!

(She leaps out of bed and grabs her red and blue Koko's uniform. She pauses and leans down to kiss BERT ZUPANIC.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: You were incredible. Why do I find myself so wildly attracted to you, Bert Zupanic?

(He kisses her passionately.)

BERT ZUPANIC: You just can't help yourself, baby.

(He playfully pushes her to the bathroom. As she enters it, there is a knock at the door. BERT ZUPANIC opens it. It is LULU PFEIFFER in her Koko's uniform. She looks pissed. BERT ZUPANIC is stunned.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Where were you last night?

BERT ZUPANIC: Where was I?

LULU PFEIFFER: Yeah.

BERT ZUPANIC: Well...

LULU PFEIFFER: You said, "meet me for a drink."

BERT ZUPANIC: I-I...

LULU PFEIFFER: That's what you said.

BERT ZUPANIC: (defensive, covering) I was there and I was waiting on you.

LULU PFEIFFER: (jealous) Are you two-timing me, Bert?

BERT ZUPANIC: How can you say that? You're my good luck charm.

LULU PFEIFFER: Who is she?!

BERT ZUPANIC: "Who is she?"

LULU PFEIFFER: (crying and screaming) You do not want to get in the ring with me, mister!

(She bends down and looks under the bed.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Honey, listen. Come on, baby, there's nobody under there. You're acting crazy, sweetie!

(She finds a Betty Boop hairclip in the sheets.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Hey, I know this hairpin.

BERT ZUPANIC: Oh, I can explain that.

LULU PFEIFFER: (all affectionate, hugging him) You lovable lug, Bert Zupanic. I'm sorry, baby. This is mine.

(She jumps into his arms and kisses him.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Of course it is.

LULU PFEIFFER: I just get so jealous. You forgive me?

BERT ZUPANIC: I forgive you. I'm in training. You got to go to work. You're late.

LULU PFEIFFER: No. I'm just so wildly attracted to you, Bert Zupanic.

BERT ZUPANIC: Hey, listen, good looks and charm-- what's not to love, all right?

LULU PFEIFFER: There's a lot to love.

BERT ZUPANIC: I know. Go on.

LULU PFEIFFER: But you are...

BERT ZUPANIC: No, you have to go.

LULU PFEIFFER: Will you call me at least?

BERT ZUPANIC: You bet. I'm on the phone now, okay? Bye, baby.

(With a sigh, he finally gets her out the door and closes it. As BETTY TEMPLETON comes out of the bathroom, [Quick Shower!] we hear a very loud argument going on in the room above them.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Bert, did I hear voices?

BERT ZUPANIC: Voices? I didn't hear any voices.

(Above them, the arguing gets louder. Then gunshots. BERT ZUPANIC and BETTY TEMPLETON clutch each other protectively as several bullet holes appear in the ceiling.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Oh.



SCENE 9

(Froggy's Bar. The unstable pyramid of glasses is back. A country song playing on the jukebox. SAPERSTEIN is at the bar eating lunch. BETTY TEMPLETON, still in her Koko's uniform, enters.)

SAPERSTEIN: Where's "The Titanic?"

BETTY TEMPLETON: (confused) What?

SAPERSTEIN: Your boyfriend, the wrestler.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Wow, talk about moves. I can't believe it. We barely just met.

SAPERSTEIN: He's supposed to meet me, here.

BETTY TEMPLETON: He's coming here?

SAPERSTEIN: He'd better be, if he wants that fight Saturday night.

BETTY TEMPLETON: (happy nervous) I better go freshen up a little. I was just coming in for lunch.

(She heads to the restroom. BERT ZUPANIC enters the bar carrying the briefcase of money. He joins SAPERSTEIN.)

SAPERSTEIN: Zupanic, hey. Thought you were a no-show.

(BERT ZUPANIC chuckles and sets the briefcase on the bar.)

SAPERSTEIN: Talking to your girlfriend.

BERT ZUPANIC: My girlfriend?

(The bar suddenly begins shaking and rumbling.)

SAPERSTEIN: Holy sugar.

(The rumbling stops after a moment. LULU PFEIFFER, in her Koko's uniform, enters the bar. SAPERSTEIN stares at her.)

SAPERSTEIN: Now, how did she do that?

BERT ZUPANIC: Do what?

SAPERSTEIN: I just saw her. I swear, I just saw her go to the can.

BERT ZUPANIC: She... just went... to the can?

SAPERSTEIN: Ten seconds ago.

(BERT ZUPANIC goes over to LULU PFEIFFER and starts moving her out of the room.)

LULU PFEIFFER: What are you doing here?

BERT ZUPANIC: I have a business meeting. Why don't I meet you outside in the park?

LULU PFEIFFER: Uh, I was just going to get some lunch.

BERT ZUPANIC: Perfect, we'll have a picnic.

LULU PFEIFFER: A picnic? We never do that.

BERT ZUPANIC: Oh, yeah...

(He chuckles as he gets her out the door and closes it behind her, then heads back to SAPERSTEIN.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Now.

(BETTY TEMPLETON comes out of the bathroom and sees BERT ZUPANIC.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Bert?

(The rumbling starts again.)

BERT ZUPANIC: I have a little business to attend to, sweetie.

SAPERSTEIN: You got more than that to attend to.

(They look over to where LULU PFEIFFER has come back in.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Hey, Bert, I only got an hour...

(She stops as she sees BETTY TEMPLETON. The rumbling increases as the two women stare at each other, then the bar again explodes, the pyramid of glasses shattering. Some of the flying debris hits BERT ZUPANIC knocking him to the floor unconscious. BETTY TEMPLETON and LULU PFEIFFER leave through different doors and the rumbling stops. SAPERSTEIN takes the briefcase from BERT ZUPANIC and leaves.)

(Froggy's Bar. Later. MULDER and SCULLY have arrived. Everyone is in varying stages of shock and cleaning up. BERT ZUPANIC is still lying on the floor. He wakes up groggily as SCULLY feels his pulse in his neck.)

SCULLY: Mr. Zupanic?

BERT ZUPANIC: Hmm. What, uh... What happened?

SCULLY: Uh, there was an incident. You were struck by flying glass.

(BERT ZUPANIC looks around for his missing briefcase.)

MULDER: Did you lose something?

BERT ZUPANIC: Yeah. My good luck.

SCULLY: Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?

(He looks up at her.)

SCULLY: 'Cause they're the ones who caused this and they'll do it again if we can't find them. Where are they, Mr. Zupanic?



SCENE 10

(BETTY TEMPLETON's Koko's. MULDER enters and finds the MANAGER.)

MULDER: (showing badge) Excuse me. FBI.

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: Can I help you?

MULDER: Yes, I'm looking for...

(MULDER sees BETTY TEMPLETON working.)

MULDER: ... that girl.

SECOND KOKO'S MANAGER: Betty. This man's from the FBI.

(The MANAGER leaves them.)

MULDER: Betty Templeton?

BETTY TEMPLETON: I'm just getting off work. Could we maybe talk some other time?

(She starts to walk away. He stops her.)

MULDER: I think we both know why I'm here.

BETTY TEMPLETON: (angry) It's her fault!

MULDER: Lulu Pfeiffer.

BETTY TEMPLETON: She follows me around trying to ruin my life. I'm not going to let her ruin it this time. It's either me or her. I don't want to leave Kansas.

(She leaves the store. MULDER follows her up the stairs outside and takes out his phone and dials. BETTY TEMPLETON looks over her shoulder at him nervously as she heads for her red convertible.)

SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Scully.

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully. I found her at Koko's Copy Center.

(SCULLY is also at a Koko's, watching LULU PFEIFFER drive away in her blue convertible.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Betty Templeton?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's trying to ruin her life. She follows her wherever she goes.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's, too. And that's exactly what Lulu says about Betty, Mulder. Except she says that this is the end of the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.

MULDER: (on phone) That's exactly what Betty said.

SCULLY: (on phone) What's going on here?

MULDER: (on phone) I don't know, Scully. You're running this show. Why don't you tell me?

(BETTY TEMPLETON gets into her car.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I think that this is more than just physical proximity, Mulder. I think that these women have some kind of a psychic connection.

MULDER: (on phone) No (static), Sherlock. Hey, Scully, uh... where's Lulu?

SCULLY: (on phone) She just took off, Mulder. She left work and she drove away.

MULDER: (on phone) She wouldn't be driving a little blue convertible, would she?

SCULLY: (on phone) That's exactly what she's driving.

(At that moment, LULU PFEIFFER slows to a stop on the other side of the street. MULDER, phone still at his ear, stands between the two cars. The two women stare at each with hatred.)

MULDER: Oh, crap.

(Rumbling starts. A nearby manhole cover explodes upward and MUDLER is knocked to the ground. Bits of trash are suddenly sucked into the manhole, then MULDER feet first. The manhole cover slams back down, and the two women speed away in opposite directions.)



SCENE 11

(SCULLY arrives at BETTY TEMPLETON's Koko's Copy Center. She gets out of her car, looks around unsuccessfully for MULDER, standing on the now-closed, still smoking manhole where we saw MULDER disappear. She enters the store and goes to the MANAGER.)

MANAGER: Can I help you?

SCULLY: Uh, yes. I'm looking for someone. He was here speaking to an employee and, uh, I can't seem to reach him.

MANAGER: Tall guy, dark hair?

SCULLY: Yeah.

MANAGER: He left.

SCULLY: And you don't know where he went?

MANAGER: Couldn't say. However... I can tell you we have a two-for-one copy discount in effect.

(SCULLY smiles.)

SCULLY: How about Internet access?

MANAGER: Right this way.



SCENE 12
KANSAS CITY PENITENTIARY 7:32 PM

(A PRISON GUARD escorts SCULLY into a cellblock.)

SCULLY: Is he in there?

PRISON GUARD: Yeah. Sleeping.

SCULLY: Can you wake him up for me?

PRISON GUARD: (not thrilled) Sure you want to do that?

SCULLY: It's important.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: (yelling from a cell off screen) Will you two shut up or go away!

(SCULLY goes up to the cell indicated by the GUARD. The GUARD leaves.)

SCULLY: Mr. Danfous?

(ANGRY BOB rushes the bars, screaming at her. As a matter of fact, he screams all of his lines. He is about 60.)

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: The sound of your voice is like a jackhammer on my eardrums!

(Pause.)

SCULLY: (very pleasant, very forced smile) Mr. Danfous, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: (screaming) What's so special about you?!

SCULLY: It's an FBI title, sir.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: I know it is. I'm not stupid!

SCULLY: Mr. Danfous, if you'll let me explain why I'm here we might be able to get you to bed a little bit sooner.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: (sarcastic screaming) Ah, what a relief!

SCULLY: Mr. Danfous, through a lot of matching-up of documents that I have been able to compile on the Internet, and by comparing time and space and circumstance and by liberally applying the law of averages...

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: They could electrocute me quicker!

SCULLY: I believe that you may be the father of two daughters.

(Long pause.)

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: I'm no father!

SCULLY: Using documents filed by a sperm bank in Sparta, Illinois and by the mothers who may have been impregnated by your donation...

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: I Yankee Doodled into a plastic cup!

SCULLY: Well, be that as it may, sir, it is very likely that you are the biological father. And it is very important for their safety and for the safety of others that we get as much information as possible about your mother and your father and anything about your family tree that may be able to explain the reactions that are being caused by these two girls.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: A big, ugly dog lifted its leg on my family tree.

(SCULLY has no response for that one.)

ANOTHER INMATE: Make room for daddy!

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: Shut up, you fat ox!



SCENE 13

(BERT ZUPANIC's room. BETTY TEMPLETON comes down the hall and knocks. No response. She knocks harder. BERT ZUPANIC opens the door.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Hello.

BETTY TEMPLETON: You aren't answering your phone?

BERT ZUPANIC: I'm just screening my calls.

BETTY TEMPLETON: You sleep with me once and now you're avoiding me?

BERT ZUPANIC: I got... big trouble, baby. I got just one shot left at the big time. Just one.

BETTY TEMPLETON: But you got your match tonight. Your name's up on the marquee!

BERT ZUPANIC: (verge of tears) I've lost my financing. You're my good luck, baby.

BETTY TEMPLETON: I am?

BERT ZUPANIC: It was my good luck to meet you and if you could just... if you could help "The Titanic" find a way...

BETTY TEMPLETON: Find a way?

BERT ZUPANIC: They say I'm old. I'm washed up. All I want's a shot. If I don't get the money I'm gonna lose my chance.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Maybe I can.

(She kisses him, then goes back down the hall. BERT ZUPANIC closes the door and sits back down in his dark room, wallowing in his depression. Behind him through the window, the neon sign flashes. There is another knock at the door. He answers it. It is LULU PFEIFFER.)

LULU PFEIFFER: (angry) You're not answering your phone?

BERT ZUPANIC: Lulu?

LULU PFEIFFER: Someone else you were expecting? Well?

BERT ZUPANIC: Baby, I got trouble. I got big trouble.

(CUT TO: BETTY TEMPLETON breaking into the Koko's Copy Center and operating one of the machines. She begins running off high quality copies of $100 bills with the lid open. Camera rises up again and we see that LULU PFEIFFER is doing the same thing at her Koko's.)

(CUT TO: The still smoking manhole outside the other Koko's. The cover is slowly pushed aside and MULDER slowly pulls himself out. He looks a bit dazed.)



SCENE 14
KANSAS CITY PENITENTIARY
11:38 PM

(SCULLY is sitting at a table, still researching. Her phone rings. She answers it quickly.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on phone) Where have you been?

(MULDER is on his cell phone looking in the darkened window of the Koko's.)

MULDER: (on phone) Seeing a side of Kansas City few men have the privilege to see.

SCULLY: (on phone) What happened to you?

MULDER: (on phone) I got sucked into a storm drain. The more pressing question is what the hell happened to Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer?

SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, but I have been able to locate the nature of their connection. Both women are non-fraternal siblings from the same father.

MULDER: (on phone) You've located him?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. He's here in the state pen.

ANGRY BOB DANFOUS: (off screen) When is all this yammering gonna stop?

MULDER: (on phone) And he's given you insight?

(SCULLY gets up and goes to another area of the prison.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, the biggest thing that I can figure out right now is he's probably the angriest man in the world, Mulder.

MULDER: (on phone) Not as angry as those two women are going to be when they both realize they're in love with the one and only Bert Zupanic.

SCULLY: (on phone) They're both after him?

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, they're both in love with him. That's why they're both staying in Kansas City and they won't leave.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, if they're the reason it doesn't explain what's happening, what's causing this phenomenon or how we're going to make it stop.

MULDER: (on phone) Look, Scully, I don't know. You're the one who's supposed to have all the answers. Somebody's got to get to that fight and keep those two women apart or else this time the (static) is going to hit the fans.

(SCULLY is now in a different cellblock.)

INMATE: (seductively to SCULLY) Well, hi.

(SCULLy stares at the INMATE and hangs up. He is identical to BERT ZUPANIC.)

SCULLY: Mr. Zupanic?



SCENE 15

(Wrestling arena. It is just before the main event. The room is packed with, could it be X-Files fans? Everyone is yelling and cheering, and booing. In the background we hear the song, "Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come ...")

CROWD: Come on, Jimmy! Yay! Yeah!

(Two men are wrestling as BERT ZUPANIC, wearing a red wrestling outfit, walks dejectedly up the backstairs. SAPERSTEIN comes up to him.)

SAPERSTEIN: You said you'd have my money.

BERT ZUPANIC: I'll have it. I-I swear I will.

SAPERSTEIN: I'll call off the damn fight, Titanic. I'll have these people cursing your damn name.

BERT ZUPANIC: I'm telling you it'll be here, don't worry. I promise.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Bert! Bert. I got it.

(BETTY TEMPLETON comes running up the stairs holding a plastic shopping bag that has the Koko's label on it. She hands it to BERT ZUPANIC who looks inside. It is full of $100 bills. BERT ZUPANIC laughs, delighted and hands the bag to SAPERSTEIN.)

BERT ZUPANIC: How 'bout your buddy?

SAPERSTEIN: Let's get ready to rumble.

(SAPERSTEIN goes down to the ring as BERT ZUPANIC and BETTY TEMPLETON embrace.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Oh, baby. I knew you wouldn't let me down.

BETTY TEMPLETON: It's you and me. All the way.

(The bell rings. The other fight is over. The obligatory scantily clad girls are in the ring as the black-clad OPPONENT enters the ring. He is wearing a mask over his eyes. Looks like an executioner. The crowd begins booing. He tosses back his cape and yells, encouraging the crowd, jumping on the ropes and posing.)

SAPERSTEIN: (on the mike) Ladies and gentlemen, get out your seats and on your feets for our own hometown boy gone bad... Bert "The Titanic" Zuuu... panic!

(BERT ZUPANIC enters the ring, his red satin cape embroidered with "Titanic." The crowd goes wild. Heavy drumbeat music starts.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: (screaming) Titanic!

BERT ZUPANIC: Oh, yeah!

CROWD: Let's take 'em, baby! Let's take 'em, baby! Whoo! Whoo! Come on!

(BERT ZUPANIC and the OPPONENT talk trash to each other for a moment, then push at each other. The CROWD is wild. BERT ZUPANIC goes to the edge of the ring and smiles and points at BETTY TEMPLETON. She waves to him. The fight begins and the two men wrestle.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: (screaming and whistling) Whoo! Go, Titanic!

(In a very cool backlit shot, MULDER enters the arena and finds BETTY TEMPLETON.)

MULDER: Betty Templeton. My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI. Can you come with me?

BETTY TEMPLETON: I'm watching the fight.

MULDER: (firmly) Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.

(BETTY TEMPLETON sighs, then sees someone behind MULDER. MULDER turns around as LULU PFEIFFER enters the arena. She is wearing the same thing as BETTY TEMPLETON, except she has a blue shirt instead of pink.)

LULU PFEIFFER: I can't believe this. What are you doing here?

BETTY TEMPLETON: What are you doing here? I'm Bert's good luck.

LULU PFEIFFER: He's mine.

BETTY TEMPLETON: Over my dead body.

(The two women begin advancing on each other. MULDER looks at them for a moment, then puts BETTY TEMPLETON over his shoulder and begins carrying her out of the arena. She protests.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Stop it! Stop it! You're going down, lady! I'm going to kick your butt from here to Tuesday! Stick a fork in you, you're done!

(As they pass the ring, she grabs the corner post and calls up to BERT ZUPANIC who is still fighting.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Hi, baby.

BERT ZUPANIC: (surprised) Betty.

(MULDER is trying to pull her off the corner post.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Bert, keep it up! I love you, baby!

(LULU PFEIFFER also has run up to the corner post, holding up another Koko's shopping bag.)

LULU PFEIFFER: Bert. I got the money.

BERT ZUPANIC: Lulu?

LULU PFEIFFER: Kick his butt, Bert.

(SAPERSTEIN takes the bag of money from LULU PFEIFFER. The CROWD begins punching each other.)

BERT ZUPANIC: Lulu.

(MULDER pulls BETTY TEMPLETON free of the post and carries her further away. She stretches her arms back to him.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Bert!

(The fighting in the ring escalates, as does the fighting in the crowd. MULDER pauses and sets BETTY TEMPLETON down as he sees SCULLY enter with the BERT ZUPANIC-look-a-like, handcuffed, escorted by the PRISON GUARD. BETTY TEMPLETON stares at the look-a-like. LULU PFEIFFER comes up behind her, also staring.)

BETTY TEMPLETON: Oh, my.

LULU PFEIFFER: Oh, my God.

(All around them, the fighting stops, including the one in the ring. SCULLY smiles smugly at MULDER.)

BERT ZUPANIC: (confused) What?

(BERT ZUPANIC and his look-a-like see each other. Hate at first sight.)

BERT ZUPANIC: (growling) Why...

(BERT ZUPANIC leaves the ring to go attack the look-a-like who pushes aside the GUARD to get at BERT ZUPANIC. MULDER and SCULLY look at each other and realize that, truly, the static is about to hit the fan. The fighting breaks out between everyone. BERT ZUPANIC pushes MULDER aside to get to the look-a-like. Mayhem ensues.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16

(MULDER's office. SCULLY is running the slide projector. We don't see either of them yet.)

SCULLY: 50 million anonymous donations have been made to sperm banks across the U.S. Most have produced healthy offspring for single mothers or fertility-challenged couples while some of them have not.

(Two mug shot slides, one of BERT ZUPANIC and one of the look-a-like, both holding up prison numbers, both with bruised faces.)

SCULLY: Bert Zupanic and his non-fraternal biological sibling both small-time bank robbers, part-time pro wrestlers, both with too many idiosyncratic behaviorisms to list stood a 27-million-to-one chance of ever meeting but they did.

(Two slides of the two men fighting each other in the auditorium.)

SAPERSTEIN: (voice) Damn, those are some odds.

(Two mug shot slides of very bruised BETTY TEMPLETON and LULU PFEIFFER and three slides of them fighting, hairpulling, etc. Who took these pictures?)

SCULLY: Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer products of different mothers but the same father-

(Slide of ANGRY BOB.)

SCULLY: ... an angry drifter now doing time for counterfeiting-- chanced to meet 12 years ago, but couldn't seem to avoid each other's compulsively identical mannerisms, mannerisms attributable to their perpetually angry father.

SAPERSTEIN: Mm. What does it all mean?

SCULLY: I've been thinking hard about that, Mr. Saperstein. I would like to say it has something to do with balance in the universe, the attraction of opposites and the repulsion of equivalents, or that over time, nature produces only so many originals that when two original copies meet that the result is often unpredictable.

(We see MULDER, from the neck down walking toward a chair near SCULLY. His hand is in a brace. Her face is badly battered and bruised.)

SCULLY: If four should meet, the result is... well, suffice to say it's better just to avoid these encounters altogether and at all costs. I think Agent Mulder would agree with me.

(She looks over at her partner. MULDER's face is worse than hers, and his jaw is wired shut. He makes the only sound he can.)

MULDER: Mm-hmm. Mmmm.

(SCULLY smiles at him briefly. They are in pain.)

[THE END]


                                JE SOUHAITE



SCENE 1
CREVE COEUR, MISSOURI

(Self-storage facility. JAY GILMORE, a large balding man of about 40, is driving around the complex in a covered golf cart, something he probably does all day. He seems to be impressed with his power as the owner of this very important business. He speaks into a radio loudly and incessantly.)

JAY GILMORE: Anson? Anson, where are you, Anson? Anson, come back, Anson. Anson. Calling Anson. Where are you, Anson? Anson! Anson, calling Anson. Where are you, Anson? Anson! Where are you, Anson?

(ANSON STOKES, mid-twenties, is sitting in the shade of an empty storage unit looking through a catalogue of luxury yachts. He ignores the squawking radio beside him. The golf cart passes, then reverses and stops.)

JAY GILMORE: Anson! Get out here.

(ANSON STOKES reluctantly walks over to the golf cart.)

JAY GILMORE: I warned you about your attitude. Did you clean out 407? No... of course you haven't cleaned out 407. You've only had all damn morning. You think you're ever going to own any of those boats in that magazine the way you're going, huh? Do you think you're ever going to amount to anything? You can't even finish a simple job.

ANSON STOKES: A monkey could do this job, right, Jay?

JAY GILMORE: Well, you can't, so what's that say about you?

ANSON STOKES: (muttering under his breath) Oh, shut up.

JAY GILMORE: Excuse me? I didn't catch that. You clean out 407. You move out that deadbeat's stuff, and you do it now. And when I come back in an hour, it better be done.

(JAY GILMORE drives off in his little cart. ANSON STOKES, glares at him. He cuts the lock off of the storage unit 407 and opens the roll-up door. The unit is full of dusty and spiderweb covered furniture. He reluctantly starts to move a rolled up carpet. It moves and a sound comes from inside it. Surprised, he drops it, and grabs the lockcutters for protection. He cautiously unrolls the carpet. A dark-haired woman, thirties, dressed all in black is inside the rug. There is a small glittering jewel type thing at the corner of her right eyes. She lies still a moment, then her eyes pop open.)

(Later, JAY GILMORE arrives back at 407 on his golf cart. ANSON STOKES' radio is lying on the pavement.)

JAY GILMORE: Anson... Anson? Son of a... Anson. Anson!

(The storage unit is still full of furniture.)

JAY GILMORE: Aw, that's it, Anson. Do you hear me, Anson?

(JAY GILMORE is standing at the entrance to the storage unit, his back to us. With a muffled gasp, he raises his hands to his mouth in horror and turns around. Where his mouth once was is now just smooth, unbroken skin. He whimpers pitifully.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
9:22 AM

(X-Files office. MULDER is sitting at his desk looking through a file. JAY GILMORE is sitting across from him, his back to us.)

MULDER: Can I get you some coffee? Water? Anything?

(JAY GILMORE shakes his head. SCULLY enters the office.)

SCULLY: Morning.

(MULDER nods at her in a sort of  warning  way.)

MULDER: Morning.

(SCULLY mouths "Who's that?" to MULDER as she comes over to the desk.)

MULDER: Special Agent Dana Scully, this is, uh, this is Jay Gilmore.

(SCULLY stifles a scream, recovering quickly from the sight of JAY GILMORE's face. His "mouth" consists of raw flesh held together by stitches. It's really nasty. She forces a pleasant smile.)

SCULLY: Nice to meet you.

JAY GILMORE: Nice to meet...

(He can't make his mouth say "you.")

JAY GILMORE: Likewise.

(SCULLY crosses around the desk to stand beside MULDER.)

MULDER: Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri, the "Show Me" state.

JAY GILMORE: They told me you were the people to best understand my situ... My sit...

(He can't pronounce the "oo" sound.)

MULDER: It's okay. Uh, this is Mr. Gilmore's... situation. This condition came on very suddenly about a month ago.

(MULDER shows SCULLY the file with pictures of JAY GILMORE's mouthless face.)

JAY GILMORE: Anson Stokes-- he did this to me. I don't know how, I just... I know it was him.

MULDER: Anson Stokes is a former employee at the, uh, self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns. Uh, apparently, there was some bad blood between you two.

JAY GILMORE: He told me to shut up! (points at his "lips") Huh?!

MULDER: Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore was, uh... stricken...

(JAY GILMORE nods affirmatively.)

MULDER: Stricken... stricken, and Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found. He resurfaced several days later and the police wanted to question him. But he refused.

JAY GILMORE: Do you know what he said? He said they had nothing on him.

MULDER: Well, and to be fair, sir, they didn't-- they don't.

JAY GILMORE: They had to make me a whole new mouth. Do you think Blue Cross is going to pay for this? Uh-uh.

(He is so upset, he is stretching his new lips farther than he should.)

JAY GILMORE: I demand justice!

(He groans in pain, and presses a handkerchief to his weeping mouth.)



SCENE 3
MARK TWAIN TRAILER COURT
OLIVETTE, MISSOURI

(MULDER and SCULLY pull up in a beige car in front of a trailer park. As they get out of the car, they continue a "conversation.")

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, all I'm saying is...

MULDER: I know-- this may not be a crime and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it.

SCULLY: But there is a condition called microstomia-- "small mouth"-- which is, uh, it's brought on by the disease scleroderma and it's the overproduction of collagen and it can actually reduce a person's mouth to a tiny little opening.

(She indicates said little opening with her hands.)

MULDER: Yeah, but that takes months to develop, right? It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye. (puts his hand on her shoulder steering her toward the sidewalk) Gilmore's surgeons are stumped. They're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine.

SCULLY: (small grin) Well, there's always nasal aplasia-- the complete absence of a nose.

MULDER: That's a nose, Scully; we're talking mouth here.

SCULLY: Yeah, but what we're talking, Mulder, is medical-- physiological-- not criminal. Not as far as I can see.

MULDER: Well, maybe, but I still want to know why Anson Stokes doesn't want to talk to the police.

SCULLY: Mulder...

(They stop walking, and stare at the very large yacht sitting on the ground next to one of the trailers. Its flags flap in the breeze.)

SCULLY: That's a little... out of place, wouldn't you say?

MULDER: A little bit.

(Inside the trailer, ANSON STOKES is peeping out the window. He sees MULDER and SCULLY approaching.)

ANSON STOKES: (whisper) Aw, damn it. Leslie!

(LESLIE STOKES is his brother, a round faced gentle man in a motorized wheelchair with a little red flag sticking up out of the back of it.)

LESLIE STOKES: What? What is it?

ANSON STOKES: They're I.R.S. agents. They got to be. Listen, get rid of them, all right?

(With the yacht in the background, SCULLY knocks at the door of the trailer. It opens. No one is there. Then LESLIE STOKES reverses into the doorway.)

SCULLY: Hi. We're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes.

LESLIE STOKES: He's not here.

SCULLY: Well, do you happen to know when he's coming back?

(He shakes his head. She pulls out her badge.)

SCULLY: Well, we are, uh, Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.

LESLIE STOKES: (nervous) Oh, the boat's... the boat's not ours. The boat  I'm... we're just holding it for someone, and, you know-- they pay the taxes on it.

SCULLY: (yeah, buddy, whatever tone) Okay...

LESLIE STOKES: Anson's not here.

(He starts to close the door. MULDER holds it open.)

MULDER: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's your name?

LESLIE STOKES: Leslie Stokes.

MULDER: Oh, you're Anson's brother?

(MULDER looks in the house. The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN who was rolled up in the rug is standing near the kitchen looking bored idly playing with some kind of food canister. She is wearing sunglasses.)

MULDER: Hi, there.

(SCULLY leans in under MULDER's chin to see the WOMAN. Very cute.)

MULDER: We're not here to talk about the boat, Leslie. We want to talk to your brother about his former employer. Mr. Gilmore?

SCULLY: And the, uh... unfortunate condition that he's found himself in. Would you happen to know anything about that?

LESLIE STOKES: What, the mouth thing? Yeah, well, that-- you know, that's-that's just, uh, that's, like... chemicals.

SCULLY: Chemicals?

LESLIE STOKES: Yeah, you know, like, people store weird chemicals, well like... my brother one time, he smelled this weird smell? You know, he's just a guy with a meth lab, like in one of the storage units, so you know, that's actually probably something you guys should look into-- take a look into that... you know, I'm going to get going, so I'm going to go, okay?

(LESLIE STOKES closes the door quickly. MULDER and SCULLY turn away. MULDER nods his head thoughtfully.)

SCULLY: Okay.

MULDER: Now I see what's going on here.

(SCULLY stares at him. He smiles as his nod turns into a slow negative shake of the head. She gives a little laugh.)



SCENE 4

(MULDER and SCULLY open storage unit 407. They stand in the doorway.)

SCULLY: Well, according to Gilmore he was standing right where I am when it happened.

MULDER: Well, I don't smell any weird chemical smells. (looks at SCULLY's mouth) You still have both your lips.

SCULLY: Apparently, everything is left as it was.

(They take out their flashlights as they look around.)

MULDER: Hey... 1978. (he holds up an old calendar) It's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day.

SCULLY: Well, it's too bad, Mulder. Underneath all this dust, this furniture is really wonderful.

MULDER: Oh, well, you want to hit some yard sales while we're out here?

SCULLY: Mulder, this furniture is expensive, very expensive.

MULDER: What's your point?

SCULLY: My point is that, uh... there's a lot of money sitting around here and maybe something's missing.

MULDER: Like what?

SCULLY: I don't know-- jewelry. I mean, Anson Stokes opened up this storage unit and then he just disappeared.

MULDER: And winds up with the Titanic in his driveway?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. There's your crime: Theft.

MULDER: That still doesn't explain what happened to Gilmore.

SCULLY: Well...

MULDER: Hey, Scully, check this out.

(He shows her a picture of a balding, overweight Seventies playboy with a scantily clad girl on each arm.)

SCULLY: Ouch.

(A DARK-HAIRED woman is also in the picture. She looks bored.)

MULDER: This woman look familiar to you?

SCULLY: That's the woman from the trailer.

MULDER: That's the young- woman from the trailer. How many centuries now has disco been dead?



SCENE 5

(In the STOKES' trailer. LESLIE STOKES watches as his brother paces nervously. The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN takes off her glasses and channel surfs the TV. She handles the remote with some slight disgust. It is a cheap plastic replica of a well-endowed woman, sans head and legs. The up and down channel switches are on the nipples. What prop person found that thing?!)

ANSON STOKES: Two down. Two down, I got nothing to show for it.

LESLIE STOKES: You got the boat.

ANSON STOKES: And what the hell good is that? Huh? That thing is like a big... you know, big...

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: White elephant?

ANSON STOKES: What? I'm sorry. What does that mean?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: (patiently) It's a big expensive item that serves no purpose and is ultimately more trouble than it's worth.

ANSON STOKES: So what the hell did you give it to me for?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Because you asked for it.

ANSON STOKES: Fine. You know what? I can appreciate that. That's... but don't you think maybe you could've found some frickin' water to put it in?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You didn't specify water.

ANSON STOKES: I got to specify that you put a boat in the frickin' water? That is a given. Frickin' white elephant. I can't even pay the taxes on it.

LESLIE STOKES: Why don't you just, uh, use your last wish to get rid of it?

ANSON STOKES: You want me to put you in a home or something, maybe, right now? Because I just told you, Leslie, that I wasted two wishes, okay? And I am not... are you listening? I am not going to waste the third. All right? Come on. Come on. (He hits the TV power button, turning it off.) We got to concentrate here. Now, let me figure this out. Let me figure this out. Third wish, third wish, third wish, final wish. Hey, I'm just spit-balling here, all right? If I happen to say, "I wish," by accident, that does not count, not until I am absolutely ready, okay?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You could always give that guy his mouth back.

ANSON STOKES: Hey, all I said was that I wish Jay would shut the hell up. If you feel bad about what you did to him fix it on your own dime, okay?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: (sighs) It doesn't work like that.

ANSON STOKES: Whatever. Leslie, would you help me out here?

LESLIE STOKES: (sudden thought) Uh... Money. Wish for money.

ANSON STOKES: Yeah, okay, that's not bad. That's not bad, that's not bad, but don't you think maybe we should think of something that would, generate money instead of the, actually the money itself?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Brains? Talent? Hard work?

(ANSON STOKES looks at her with disgust.)

LESLIE STOKES: Uh... A money machine. Huh?

ANSON STOKES: That's not... but something better. Something better. Okay, but...

LESLIE STOKES: An infinite number of wishes?

ANSON STOKES: (looking hopefully to the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN) Okay.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Just three boys. Settle down.

ANSON STOKES: Damn it, this is hard.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You know, I have a thought. Granted, it's pretty obvious.

(She dramatically indicates LESLIE STOKES sitting in his wheel chair.)

ANSON STOKES: What? What, what, what?

(She indicates LESLIE STOKES' legs.)

ANSON STOKES: What?

LESLIE STOKES: What?

(She indicates LESLIE STOKES' legs again.)

ANSON STOKES: Seriously, what?

(In disgust, the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN gives up.)

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Oh, forget it.

(ANSON STOKES has a revelation.)

ANSON STOKES: I got it.

LESLIE STOKES: Yeah?

ANSON STOKES: I got it. I got it, I got it, I got it. Okay. Okay. Are you ready? Because I am ready. I am absolutely ready. Okay, here goes. I wish that I could turn invisible  at will.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: (dryly) You're kidding.

ANSON STOKES: No, no. This is perfect. Yeah, I could have an advantage that nobody else on earth can have. I can, um, you know, spy and learn secret information, pick up stock tips.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Sneak into a women's locker room.

ANSON STOKES: Not just that, okay? I'm talking about James Bond type stuff. You know?

(He holds up his hand like a gun. He is giggling excitedly.)

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Your wish is breathtaking in its un-originality.

ANSON STOKES: You don't have to like it, all right? You just have to do it. Right?

(Pause.)

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Done.

ANSON STOKES: My clothes are going to turn invisible, too, right?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You didn't specify clothes.

ANSON STOKES: I know, but... screw it.

(Very excited, he begins stripping off his clothes. He and LESLIE STOKES are laughing. When he gets to his pants, the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN turns her head.)

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Oh, God. Turn invisible please.

(ANSON STOKES does turn invisible, and apparently begins running around the room. LESLIE STOKES is delighted by what his brother can do.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) Yes! Oh, man, this is awesome! Hey. Hey, brother. Hey, Leslie? I'm over here. Oop, I'm over here. Can you see me?

(He "Whoops" with glee and runs out the front door and down the wheelchair ramp, then crashes into the trashcans at the base.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) Oof. Ow! Damn it.

(LESLIE STOKES rolls out onto the landing and sees the overturned trashcans.)

LESLIE STOKES: Anson, you all right?

ANSON STOKES: Yeah, I am. I can't see my damn feet. Look out, world! Here I come! Whoo-hoo!

(One of the cans is dented by ANSON as he gets up and runs down the sidewalk, tipping over other cans as he goes.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) I'm invisible! Invisible, baby! Whoo!

LESLIE STOKES: Whoo-oo!

(Inside, the DARK-HARIED WOMAN puts on her sunglasses.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) Yes! You can't see me, can you!

LESLIE STOKES: I...

(LESLIE STOKES laughs and cheers his brother on from the landing in front of the trailer. He wheels back into the trailer. The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN has disappeared.)

LESLIE STOKES: Hey, uh...?

(We now go to AnsonCam as he runs happily through the neighborhood. He tips several flowerpots over onto a car as he climbs over a wall, tips over a bicycle, then splashes through a mud puddle. A small group of pigeons are feeding on the ground. They scatter as ANSON STOKES runs through them.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) Hey, out of my way, birds.

(Across a busy street, he sees two attractive young women trying to replace the chain on a bicycle.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) Hello, ladies.

(He giggles and presses the "walk" button for the crosswalk.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice, lecherously) Yeah, here comes Anson. That's right. Come on, come on, come on. Change, change.

(The "walk" signal lights up and ANSON STOKES starts across the street. One of the girls stands up. She is wearing a very tight shirt.)

ANSON STOKES: (voice) All right, here we go. Need a little roadside assistance, do ya? (he chuckles) Well, not to worry. Here comes Anson.

(There is the sound of a very large engine. AnsonCam turns to the right just in time to see the truck ignoring the signal to stop, because obviously there is no one in the crosswalk. ANSON STOKES yells briefly, then splat. AnsonCam is no more.)



SCENE 6
4:36 PM

(Same street, later. A KID is riding his bicycle on the dirt along the side of the road. He suddenly hits an invisible "speed bump," and flips head over heels off the bike and out of frame.)

KID: Whooooaaa!!!

(SCULLY stands waiting in an autopsy bay. She has a rather pained look on her face. Two MORGUE ATTENDANTS wheel an "empty" stainless steel gurney into the room. They both look very uncomfortable.)

MORGUE ATTENDANT: Can we go now?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

(The two men leave. SCULLY looks skeptically at the neck prop on the gurney. She leans close and gingerly reaches out with a finger. It makes contact. SCULLY stares as she follow the line of what looks like a shoulder. Without standing up, she turns and runs to the desk in the corner of the room and finds a jar of yellow powder and a brush. She dips the brush into the powder and taps it where a face would be. The powder begins to define a closed eye. SCULLY taps the brush again and continues to cover the face. She gets a silly cute grin of excitement as more of the face is revealed. She is amazed.)

(Later, SCULLY has almost completely covered the body with the yellow powder. It is ANSON STOKES. MULDER has joined her. He is looking intently at the shoulder of the body.)

MULDER: I think you missed a spot here. I can see straight through to his ass.

(She comes over and dabs a bit of powder on the spot.)

MULDER: This is Anson Stokes, huh?

SCULLY: It is. His dental records are a match. He was found about half a mile from his house. He was probably hit by a car or a truck or... something.

MULDER: And he's invisible.

SCULLY: Yes, he is.

(MULDER and SCULLY beam down at the corpse. They look like two parents gazing upon the first artwork that their four-year-old brings home from pre-school.)

SCULLY: You know, Mulder, in the seven years that we've been working together I have seen some amazing things, but this? This takes the cake. It's... it's going to change the boundaries of science.

MULDER: It is amazing, but I don't think it has anything to do with science. Remember Mr. Saturday Night Fever?

(He holds up the picture that they found in the storage unit.)

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: I did a little background checking. His real name is Henry Flanken. He redefined the term "overnight success." In 1977, his net worth was $36,000, and in 1978 it was $30 million. Then there is the interesting way in which Mr. Flanken died.

SCULLY: How's that?

MULDER: Chronic morbid tumescence.

SCULLY: You don't mean what I think you mean?

MULDER: Sch-wing. On April 4, 1978, he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital with an extreme priapic condition. Apparently, he was quite the specimen. They had to raise the doorframe in order to wheel him into his hospital room.

(SCULLY winces.)

SCULLY: Well, what does any of that have to do with this?

(He holds up a blown-up image of the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN.)

MULDER: Well, I think our mystery woman is the link. About whom I can find no information whatsoever. I think she's responsible for all of this.

SCULLY: But how?

MULDER: I... I don't know. But... we need to talk to her.

SCULLY: Uh, I think that I should stay here with the body. I mean, I... you know, I don't think it's a good idea to leave him unguarded. You know, this is truly amazing.

(MULDER smiles at her, understanding.)

MULDER: Okay.

(He leaves, and SCULLY smiles and happily looks down at the body.)



SCENE 7

(Night. In the STOKES' trailer. MULDER is talking to a sad LESLIE STOKES. The yacht is still outside.)

MULDER: I'm very sorry for your loss.

LESLIE STOKES: Anson didn't suffer, did he?

MULDER: No, I don't think he suffered. The part about him being invisible-- that doesn't, uh, catch you off guard just a little bit?

LESLIE STOKES: Uh...

MULDER: Leslie, there was a woman here earlier. Where is she now?

LESLIE STOKES: She's, uh... she's gone.

MULDER: Uh, let me tell you where I'm going with this. I think that woman is a jinniyah. Are you familiar with that term?

LESLIE STOKES: No.

MULDER: It's the feminine for jinni-- as in a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore.

(LESLIE STOKES doesn't get it. MULDER starts humming the theme song to "I Dream of Jeannie." LESLIE STOKES joins in, grinning. He gets it now.)

MULDER: Yeah, except Barbara Eden never killed anybody. All right, now in Arabic mythology they speak of these beings that are composed of flame or air but take human form. They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes. They live in inanimate objects like a lamp or a ring. Is this beginning to sound familiar?

(LESLIE STOKES shakes his head.)

MULDER: Leslie, I believe your brother found just such an object in the storage facility, didn't he? He took possession of the jinniyah and he made some pretty outrageous requests, like Jay Gilmore's mouth and the yacht in the driveway.

LESLIE STOKES: Oh, wait, wait. You believe all that?

MULDER: I do. And, Leslie, for your own safety-- so that what happened to your brother doesn't happen to you-- I think you should hand over that object to me right now.

(LESLIE STOKES sighs, then moves his wheelchair over to a table. He hands MULDER a hexagonal metal canister with an ornate top. MULDER looks at it possessively.)

MULDER: (reassuringly) You're doing the right thing.



SCENE 8

(Short time later, LESLIE STOKES opens the door to the storage unit 407. He turns on a flashlight and sees the once again rolled up carpet.)

(Morgue. SCULLY is taking pictures of the yellow powder covered body with her Very Big Camera. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Hey, Scully, come check this out.

(SCULLY does not want to leave.)

MULDER: Come on, he's not going anywhere. Come on.

(MULDER waves at her to follow him out of the room. SCULLY pushes the body tray back into the wall.)

SCULLY: (happy whisper to the body as she closes the door) Bye.

(SCULLY {presumably} locks the cabinet door and joins MULDER at a computer terminal in another room. She is adorably excited, trying to be modest, yet already deciding which outfit she is going to wear when she graces the cover of next months issue of "Pathology Today.")

SCULLY: I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical. Can't wait to see their faces.

(MULDER smiles tolerantly and hands her the container that LESLIE STOKES gave him.)

SCULLY: What's this?

MULDER: It's not what I hoped it would be. Judging from the odor coming inside, I think it's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed.

(SCULLY sniffs the container and MULDER shuts the lid and brings up a screen on the computer.)

MULDER: But that's not what I wanted to show you. Recognize him?

(He shows her a black and white image of Mussolini on a speech platform.)

SCULLY: Benito Mussolini.

MULDER: How about her?

(The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN is also in the image. She looks bored.)

SCULLY: Your mystery woman. Or someone who looks a lot like her.

MULDER: Well, the computer says it is her. I ran her through Quantico's facial recognition software and couldn't come up with a match in the known felon database. Then I took a flier and checked with the image bank at the national archives. Voila.

SCULLY: Well, even if it is her, Mulder, what would she be doing with Mussolini?

MULDER: Or Richard Nixon, for that matter.

(He shows a video of Richard Nixon also on a platform. The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN stands behind him, looking bored.)

MULDER: I don't know. Except that they're both men who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it.



SCENE 9

(Same night. STOKES' trailer. With a kick, the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN finishes spreading out her rug in the middle of the floor. She looks less than delighted to be back in this room.)

LESLIE STOKES: See? I told you it'd look good in here. Nice rug. How do you breathe in that thing, huh?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Can we just get this over with, please? Three wishes. Go.

LESLIE STOKES: Okay. Don't rush me, all right? I want to do this right. Got to be smarter than Anson was.

(He looks wistfully at a framed picture.) LESLIE STOKES: Damn it, Anson.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Then, can I once again offer you a suggestion?

LESLIE STOKES: Hmm?

(She indicates his legs.)

LESLIE STOKES: What?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: This. Your disability? There was some tragedy involved here, I assume.

LESLIE STOKES: Yeah, well, yeah, it was pretty tragic, I guess. Me and Anson were playing mailbox baseball. (he chuckles) God, I miss that. And Anson's driving. I was leaning pretty far out the window there. Oh. (he laughs and indicates his wheelchair) You mean this?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

LESLIE STOKES: (realization) Yeah, you're right. I could wish for a solid gold wheelchair. Man, that'd be sweet.

(The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN is over it all.)

LESLIE STOKES: I see what you're saying but you know what? There's something I want more than that.

(He gazes at his brother's picture. It appears to be a prom photo of ANSON STOKES.)



SCENE 10

(Next morning. Morgue. SCULLY proudly leads the three MEMBERS OF THE HARVARD REASEARCH TEAM to the locked door in the morgue. She is delighted. This is her defining moment. This discovery is going to make her remembered as one of the most famous pathologists of all time. Even her father would have been proud of her at this moment.) SCULLY: You're not going to believe your eyes. I certainly didn't. You ready?

(SCULLY has unlocked the door. She opens it, and pulls out the tray. It is empty. She stares at it for a second, then nervously glances at the team behind her who are looking skeptically at each other.)

SCULLY: Uh, he's, uh... he's invisible... after all... Um...

(She laughs weakly, and puts out her hand to touch  nothing.)

SCULLY: He's in there.

(She reaches back further into the drawer. Nothing. Poor Scully.)



SCENE 11

(Trailer. LESLIE STOKES and ANSON STOKES, still covered in yellow powder, sit across form each other at the table. The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN is also in the room, bored as usual. Each of the men has a bowl of corn flakes, but only LESLIE STOKES is eating his. Flies buss around the merely animated dead body of ANSON STOKES. LESLIE STOKES stares at him, then turns to the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN.)

LESLIE STOKES: Okay. You know what? He's creeping me out. This isn't what I asked for. He's all weird and messed up.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: He's been hit by a truck. What did you expect?

LESLIE STOKES: I asked you to bring him back to normal.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You asked me to bring him back.

LESLIE STOKES: Okay, you know, the...

(LESLIE STOKES smells his bowl of cereal, then looks at ANSON STOKES.)

LESLIE STOKES: Now, he's starting to smell bad! Come on-- this isn't what I wanted! Look, he's got to at least be able to talk. Okay... You know what? That's my next wish. WISH NUMBER TWO: I wish Anson could talk.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: No, you don't.

LESLIE STOKES: Yes, I do and that's final. I wish Anson could talk.

(The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN sighs in exasperation.)

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Done.

(ANSON STOKES opens his mouth and begins one long, piercing scream, LESLIE STOKES and the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN both cover their ears.)



SCENE 12

(Morgue. The Harvard team is long gone. As MULDER looks inside the empty drawer, SCULLY sits despondently, her head in her hands.)

SCULLY: Oh, I should just shoot myself. Oh... I was so happy. I was so excited. What was I thinking? An invisible man?

MULDER: (her moral support  he's been here) You saw it. It was real.

SCULLY: I don't know what I saw, Mulder. I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands it was just too good to be true.

MULDER: I don't think that's why the body disappeared.

SCULLY: Why did the body disappear?

MULDER: I think it was the result of a wish being granted.

SCULLY: A wish? Whose wish?

MULDER: Well, who would want Anson Stokes back? I mean, really, really back.

SCULLY: His brother, Leslie.



SCENE 13

(In the trailer, ANSON STOKES is still screaming in horror. Finally it tapers off into a weak gurgle.)

LESLIE STOKES: Well, this is no good.

ANSON STOKES: (trembling, accusing) What did you do to me?

LESLIE STOKES: What? You're back from the dead, man. What kind of gratitude is that?

ANSON STOKES: What did you do to me?

LESLIE STOKES: I wasted two wishes on you. That's what I did.

ANSON STOKES: I can't feel my heart.

(LESLIE STOKES looks at the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN who smiles and shrugs.)

ANSON STOKES: I-I can't feel my blood. (coughs) I am yellow! I'm cold.

LESLIE STOKES: Screw this!

(ANSON STOKES shivers miserably.)

ANSON STOKES: I'm cold. I'm cold.

LESLIE STOKES: I wasted two wishes on you. And a perfectly good bowl of corn flakes.

(LESLIE STOKES rolls over to the thermostat and angrily adjusts it.)

LESLIE STOKES: There, I turned the heat up. Are you happy now? Huh? Are you happy? Is there anything else I can do for you there, buddy?

(In the kitchen, hands shaking, ANSON STOKES turns on the gas stove and breaks off the controller. He begins weakly trying to start kitchen matches.)

LESLIE STOKES: (yelling) What do you say? Maybe wipe your little yellow butt? Thanks for nothing.

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: You want to make your third wish, champ? I'd like to get out of here before the blowflies hatch.

LESLIE STOKES: Yeah, I tell you what-- my last wish is going to be for me, okay? It's going to be for me, you hear that, Anson? (yelling) I wasted two wishes on you and you don't even give a damn about that! All right... third wish. Uh... let's see, I could wish for, uh... I could wish for money. Not everybody wishes for money.

ANSON STOKES: (feebly trying to strike matches) It's so cold.

LESLIE STOKES: No, um... or there's the invisibility thing. (yelling) I guess that turned out pretty stupid huh? Anson? To be invisible! That was real smart, huh?

(Outside, MULDER and SCULLY arrive and start walking toward the trailer.)

LESLIE STOKES: Uh... X-ray eyes, maybe? No, that would be... hmm, like you said, solid gold wheelchair.

(The DARK-HAIRED WOMAN looks over at ANSON STOKES who keeps trying to strike a match. She looks a little concerned.)

LESLIE STOKES: Uh... wait, I got it-- legs!

(LESLIE STOKES beams. ANSON STOKES succeeds in lighting a match. At just that moment, MULDER and SCULLY are walking up to the trailer. It explodes violently. MULDER and SCULLY fall to the ground as debris rains around them. The last thing to fall is a rolled up rug. As it falls, we here a muffled "Ow" as it lands behind MULDER and SCULLY. They stare at it, then back at the destroyed trailer.)



SCENE 14

(An office in the trailer park. Out the window, we see fire trucks and other emergency personnel. Inside, MULDER is interviewing the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN.)

MULDER: Would you mind removing your eyewear, ma'am?

(She takes off her sunglasses revealing the small jewel-thing at the corner of her eye.)

MULDER: Ah. Do you have a name?

DARK-HAIRED WOMAN: Not for a long time now.

(MULDER looks at her intently.)

MULDER: How about if I call you Jenn? That's short for "jinniyah."

(SCULLY enters the room.)

SCULLY: The, uh... the fire department just recovered two bodies.

MULDER: Leslie Stokes and his brother, Anson.

SCULLY: Looks like it. And, uh, Anson Stokes is visible now. (disappointed) Of course.

(SCULLY turns to the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN, JENN.)

SCULLY: But what I'd really love an explanation for is how his corpse got from my locked morgue all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.

JENN: Ask him. He's got it all figured out.

SCULLY: I know what he'd say. He'd say that you're some kind of a jinni from 1,001 Nights or something like that and that you grant people wishes.

JENN: Well, there you have it.

MULDER: Well, one thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether you're a good jinni or an evil one. Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end.

JENN: That's the conclusion you've drawn? That I'm evil?

MULDER: Well, possibly evil. Possibly cursed. A curse to others.

JENN: The only thing you people are cursed with is stupidity. All of you. Everybody. Mankind. Everyone I have ever come into contact with without fail. Always asking for the wrong thing.

MULDER: You mean making the wrong wishes.

JENN: Yeah, it's always: "Give me money. Give me big boobs. " (indicates her crotch region) "Give me a big hoo-hoo. Make me cool like the Fonz." Or whoever's the big name now.

MULDER: You been out of circulation a long time.

JENN: So what? In 500 years, people have not changed a bit.

SCULLY: 500 years.

JENN: Granted, they smell better now generally speaking but human greed still reigns... shallowness... a propensity for self-destruction.

SCULLY: You're saying that you have been a firsthand witness to 500 years of human history.

JENN: I used to be human. I was born in 15th century France and then, one day, an old Moor came to my village peddling rugs and I unrolled one that an Ifrit had taken residence in.

SCULLY: (not believing a word) "An Ifrit."

JENN: A very... powerful class of jinni. He offered me three wishes. For the first I asked for a stouthearted mule. For the second, a magic sack that was always full of turnips...

(MULDER and SCULLY stare at her.)

JENN: Did I mention this was 15th century France?

MULDER: What was your third wish?

JENN: My third... I pondered for a great while. I didn't want to waste it. So, finally, feeling very intelligent I spoke up and I said "Je souhaite un grand pouvoir et une longue vie." "I wish for great power and long life."

MULDER: And thus became a jinni yourself.

JENN: Gave me the mark of the jinn... (points at the corner of her eye)  right there. It's forever. Sort of like a prison tattoo.

(SCULLY rubs her temples.)

JENN: I should've been more specific. So, am I under arrest?

SCULLY: I can't think of anything we have to hold you on. And, not surprisingly we don't have any evidence of any of this, so, uh... I think she's free to go.

JENN: No, I'm not. He unrolled me.

(Both women look at MULDER. His face slowly registers elation as he realizes what this means. Close up on his face.)

MULDER: I get three wishes.



SCENE 15

(MULDER's apartment. JENN is looking at the fish in the tank. He watches her, arms crossed.)

JENN: So your partner left the airport rather quickly. And I don't think she likes me very much.

MULDER: I don't think she knows what to make of you. I don't think I do either, really.

JENN: Well, you could always give up your three wishes. I'll disappear-- no hard feelings.

(She looks at him. He gives a little smile.)

MULDER: Mmmm.

JENN: I didn't think so. So, what's your first wish?

MULDER: Well...

(He thinks, then laughs.)

MULDER: What would your wish be if you were in my place?

JENN: I'm not you. It doesn't matter.

MULDER: But, I just... you know, I'd like to know.

JENN: I'd... wish that I'd never heard the word "wish" before. I'd wish that I could live my life moment by moment... enjoying it for what it is instead of... instead of worrying about what it isn't.

(MULDER smiles. Sounds of traffic outside.)

JENN: I'd... sit down somewhere with a great cup of coffee and I'd watch the world go by. But then again, I'm not you. So I doubt that's your wish.

MULDER: You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here. You say that most people make the wrong wishes, right?

JENN: Without fail. It's like giving a chimpanzee a revolver.

MULDER: This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain.

JENN: Could be.

MULDER: So the trick would be to make a wish that's totally altruistic. That's for everyone. So, um... I wish for peace on earth.

JENN: Peace on earth. That's it?

(MULDER is now concerned.)

MULDER: What the hell's wrong with that? You can't do it?

JENN: No. I can.

(Pause.)

JENN: It's done.

(MULDER is beaming happily. Then he realizes that all traffic sounds outside have disappeared. His face falls.)

MULDER: Oh, crap.

(He goes to the window and looks out the blinds. He runs outside. The street is full of empty cars and buses. He looks in a bus stopped at the corner of Market Street.)

MULDER: I guess I should have seen this coming! (concerned) Scully.

(He makes his way on foot to the FBI building and goes to his office.)

MULDER: Scully?

(No answer. He walks through the deserted hall in the building. Scattered files on the floor indicate where people may have been walking.)

MULDER: Hello? Hello?

(He goes to SKINNER's office. Also empty.)

MULDER: (applauding sarcastically) Very good. Jinni? Jinni, whatever the hell your name is...

(She is sitting in SKINNER's chair.)

JENN: Yes?

MULDER: What the hell is this?

JENN: It's what you asked for. Peace on earth. Listen.

(She exaggeratedly listens to the lack of sound.)

MULDER: You know damn well that's not what I meant.

JENN: You didn't specify.

MULDER: This has nothing to do with specificity. You don't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet just to effect a little peace on earth and goodwill towards men.

JENN: You didn't say goodwill towards men. So you expect me to change the hearts of six billion people? No religion in history has been able to pull that off. Not Allah or Buddha or Christ. But you'd like me to do that in your name? So... what? You can feel real good about yourself?

MULDER: (defensively) Did I say that? I didn't say that.

JENN: (clicking her tongue) Mm, how grotesquely egotistical of you. I bet you wish you hadn't made your first wish.

MULDER: Yes, I do, since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely. And another thing-- I think you've got a really horrible attitude. I guess that comes from being rolled up in a rug for the last 500 years.

(As MULDER rails at JENN we see SKINNER and several other agents now sitting in the conference area.)

MULDER: But we're not all that stupid. We're not all chimpanzees with revolvers. I think there's another possibility here and that's just that you're a bitch.

(JENN indicates that MULDER should look behind him. He does. JENN disappears.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Sir.

SKINNER: How did you get in here?

MULDER: (extremely embarrassed) Uh...



SCENE 16

(MULDER's office. MULDER is typing on the computer. JENN reads over his shoulder.)

(THE WISH: "Whereas, I have one wish left and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind, and whereas this wish contains great potential for the betterment of life as we know it, and that equal potential for grave danger, chaos, and mayhem, let effect, a world run amok, and whereas, I must cover all bases"

JENN: (reading) "Whereas, I have one wish left and desire to use it most effectively for the good of all mankind" yadda, yadda, yadda... "Here on this plane of existence..." Hmm... Hmm-hmm. What, are you a lawyer?

MULDER: Well, I have to be with you. I'm going to get this last wish perfect. I'm not going to leave you any loopholes. I'm not going to let you interpret this as an edict to bring back the Third Reich or to make everyone's eyes grow on stalks.

JENN: (sarcastically) Oh, geez. And I was so looking forward to that.

(SCULLY enters the office. She looks at him with concern.)

SCULLY: Skinner called me, Mulder. Is everything all right?

MULDER: You don't remember disappearing off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning?

SCULLY: No.

MULDER: Well, I guess everything's okay.

(SCULLY sighs and starts walking toward MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mul...

(She turns and looks at JENN antagonistically.)

SCULLY: Could you give us a minute, please?

JENN: Sure.

(JENN doesn't move from where she is leaning against the glass partition. SCULLY takes a few more steps toward MULDER, then not hearing anything else from JENN turns back around.)

SCULLY: Like today?

(JENN has disappeared.)

SCULLY: Wh  Where the hell did she go?

(MULDER does the "I Dream of Jeannie" arm cross and head boink.)

MULDER: Boink!

SCULLY: No... It's got to be hypnotism or mesmerism or  something.

MULDER: Scully, it is what it is. You examined an invisible body, remember?

SCULLY: I thought I did.

MULDER: (rolling his head in frustrated disgust) Oh!

SCULLY: Mulder, all right, say... say that you're right. Say this is what it is. Then what you're doing is extraordinarily dangerous. I mean, you even said that yourself.

MULDER: The trick is to be specific. To make the wish perfect. That way, everyone is going to benefit. It's going to be a safer world, a happier world. There's going to be food for everyone, freedom for everyone, the end of the tyranny of the powerful over the weak. Am I leaving anything out?

SCULLY: (wistfully) It sounds wonderful.

MULDER: Then what's the problem?

SCULLY: Maybe it's the whole point of our lives here, Mulder-- to achieve that. Maybe it's a process that one man shouldn't try and circumvent with a single wish.

(SCULLY hesitates a moment, then sighs and leaves the office. MULDER goes back to the computer and types. JENN appears behind him.)

JENN: You ready?

MULDER: Yeah, I'm ready.

(MULDER closes the program and turns off the monitor, then turns to face JENN. She smiles.)



SCENE 17

(MULDER's apartment. MULDER puts a videotape in his machine. The screen displays the FBI warning as he picks up a bowl of popcorn and crosses to sit beside SCULLY on the couch.)

MULDER: I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn. Uggh. It's un- American.

(SCULLY looks at the video tape case.)

SCULLY: Caddyshack," Mulder?

MULDER: It's a classic American movie.

(SCULLY slumps back against the couch and opens her Shiner Bock beer.)

SCULLY: That's what every guy says. It's a guy movie.

MULDER: Okay, when you invite me over to your place we can watch Steel Magnolias.

(SCULLY tosses her beer cap across the room and with a "clink" it lands in what ever it was she was aiming for. MULDER, having also opened a beer, tosses his cap in the same direction. SCULLY giggles into her beer as we hear the cap thud to the ground.)

SCULLY: So, uh... What's the occasion?

MULDER: I don't know. Just felt like the thing to do. Cheers.

SCULLY: Cheers.

(They tap bottles and take a sip of beer.)

MULDER: I don't know if you noticed but, um, I never made the world a happier place.

SCULLY: Well, I'm fairly happy. That's something.

(They smile at each other.)

ANNOUNCER MAN ON VIDEO TAPE WITH NO PREVIEWS: And now, our feature presentation.

SCULLY: So what was your final wish, anyway?

(MULDER looks at her for a long moment. All of her. Then he smiles happily and takes another swig of his beer as the Kenny Loggins movie theme starts: )

KENNY LOGGINS SINGING CADDYSHACK THEME:

Dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup
I'm all right...

CUT TO:



SCENE 18

(JENN is sitting in a coffee shop on a Washington, DC street. The jewel is missing from the corner of her eye. She watches people walking by the window. A WAITRESS sets a round coffee cup in front of her.)

WAITRESS: Here you go.

(JENN takes a sip. She looks very happy.)

[Fade to black]

[THE END]
                                  REQUIEM


SCENE 1
BELLEFLEUR, OREGON
PRESENT DAY

(Night. DETECTIVE MILES, whom we have not seen since Season 1, The Pilot, is riding in his patrol car in the small town of Bellefleur, Oregon. His lights are flashing, siren on. He listens as a report comes over the radio.)

DEPUTY RAY HOESE: (voice on radio) Unit four-- I got a fire out on the horizon. Something burning out here at the 20-mile marker.

DISPATCHER: (voice on radio) Unit four, confirmation of downed aircraft burning. All units, you've got a 10-13.

(DETECTIVE MILES looks a little nervous as he picks up his radio.)

DETECTIVE MILES: (on radio) Unit four-- this is Detective Miles. I'm coming right at you, Ray. Now, you wait for backup before you head out, all right? (no answer) Unit four-- come back, Deputy.

(There is no answer. The computer flashes, the digital car clock begins running backwards. DETECTIVE MILES has a frustrated, yet resigned look on his face. Suddenly, all power leaves DETECTIVE MILES' car. The dashboard goes out, the engine shuts off, the brakes do no respond, just as MULDER and SCULLY experienced on their visit in 1993. DETECTIVE MILES looks up as his vehicle slams into another patrol car sitting dark in the middle of the road. DETECTIVE MILES gets clumsily out of his car. His forehead is gashed. A large fire is burning in the forest nearby. He looks in the other car.)

DETECTIVE MILES: Deputy Hoese... Ray?

(A young balding man, DEPUTY RAY HOESE, is sitting collapsed in the drivers seat. His eyes are burned as if with acid. We can't tell if he is dead, or merely unconscious.)

DETECTIVE MILES: Oh, my God.

(He closes the door and steps in a small bubbling puddle of green goo that eats like acid at his shoe. He turns slowly to see what looks like the same man, DEPUTY RAY HOESE, staring at him.)

SCENE 2

(X-Files office. A bald, glasses-wearing, self-important, accountant-looking guy, SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT is sitting next to a large pile of files. He is running an adding machine tape.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Lariat car rentals. Totals...

(SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT looks at the total and whistles at the amount.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Would you like to see the figure?

(He hands the tape to MULDER who glances at it and hands it back.)

MULDER: Is that a lot?

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: A lot? Gas, expenses... the motel rooms alone. By FBI standards these numbers are out of control.

MULDER: (deadpan) We could start sharing rooms.

(Pause as SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT stares at MULDER, unamused.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: You're under evaluation. There has to be a point when we say no.

MULDER: You can't really compare what we do to other departments in the Bureau.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Right. This business with aliens.

MULDER: Well, there's more to it than that.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: But, at the end of the day you'd say aliens are your real focus.

MULDER: (defensive) That's the reason I got started, yeah.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: (looking at a file) Investigating your sister's abduction and the government conspiracy around it. Both of which have been resolved, correct?

MULDER: Nothing has been resolved exactly.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: (unsympathetic) In this case report here it's concluded your sister is dead as well as the men who took her. This is your handwriting here on the report, Agent Mulder?

(SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT shows MULDER the file. Again, MULDER glances at it.)

MULDER: Yeah.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: So, what exactly is left to investigate?



SCENE 3
PENAL COLONY
FORJ SIDI TOUI, TUNISIA

(Very crowded prison full of angry Arabic men yelling and whistling lasciviously as a WOMAN WITH NICE LEGS is led down the corridor by a PRISON GUARD. They stop at a cell. The PRISON GUARD yells in Arabic. KRYCEK, missing his prosthetic arm, shoulders his way to the front of the cell. Life has not been good to him this last year. He stares at the WOMAN. It is MARITA COVARRUBIAS, looking much better than we saw her last. Her blonde hair is longer and her face is clear. She looks at KRYCEK steadily.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Your release has been arranged.

KRYCEK: Marita Covarrubias. The last time I saw you, I left you for dead.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Alex, if it was strictly up to me, I'd leave you here to rot, too.

(The cell is unlocked for KRYCEK to exit.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: I see the money bleed out, but it just doesn't seem to make the results of your work any better. So many of the cases you investigate are left unexplained. Makes it hard to justify the expense.

SCULLY: So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: How would you measure it?

SCULLY: We open doors with the X-Files, which lead to other doors.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: (reading disdainfully from a file) Doors leading to... "A conspiracy of men who cooperated with alien beings to create human alien hybrids." So we could all become slaves of an alien invasion.

SCULLY: (directly) I believe that there was once a conspiracy. I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests, which gave me cancer and left me barren.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: But you don't believe in aliens?

SCULLY: I've seen things that I cannot deny.

KRYCEK: Who sent you?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: The Smoking Man. He is dying.

(Wet KRYCEK looks over at her sharply.)



SCENE 4

(Later. MULDER enters SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT's office. He is definitely not happy to be there.)

MULDER: You said you were finished.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Turned in my report and was asked to go over a few things.

(SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT indicates for MULDER to sit. MULDER remains standing.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: As you know-- the times we live in-- the world is changing fast.

MULDER: I'm missing your point.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: As I said, this is an evaluation, Agent Mulder to understand what you do. So, if you go forward, you can do so more responsibly.

(MULDER sits.)

MULDER: That sounds more like a threat.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Cost/benefit analysis. But, if you want the truth I really don't care one way or the other. You mostly record bizarre facts on bizarre cases. In other words, information gathering. Something, it seems to me you can easily do on the Internet.

MULDER: I can't do my job from an office, I promise you.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Nowadays, the most advanced space exploration is done sitting in an office, Agent Mulder. Why? It's just too damn expensive putting men in outer space.

MULDER: I'm not looking in outer space.

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Bringing us to the point. If you spend so much time and money looking for aliens, responsibly, you should narrow your search.

MULDER: To where?

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Wherever they are. It's not unreasonable. It's just a matter of reducing your vision.

(MULDER glares at SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT.)



SCENE 5
BELLEFLUER, OREGON

(Morning. An older model compact car pulls up beside the two wrecked police cars. Two young men, GARY and RICHIE get out and see DETECTIVE MILES, a nasty cut on his forehead coming out of the forest.)

RICHIE: Hey, you all right?

DETECTIVE MILES: What's the problem?

GARY: Isn't that your car, Mr. Miles?

DETECTIVE MILES: Yeah. A small accident. Everything's all right. What are you boys doing out here?

RICHIE: Well, uh, we heard there was a plane crash-- military jet fighter collided midair with a UFO.

DETECTIVE MILES: The Navy found their plane about three miles away. We've seen no evidence of any other crash.

RICHIE: But we heard a sheriff say he saw a fire burning off the highway at the 20-mile mark.

DETECTIVE MILES: There's nothing out here. No fire. No sign of fire. You boys go on home. There's nothing to see here.

(DETECTIVE MILES heads for his car. The two young men look into the woods.)



SCENE 6

(X-Files office. SCULLY is looking at the "I Want To Believe" poster. MULDER joins her. He looks sheepish.)

MULDER: I think I'm in big trouble.

SCULLY: Oh, Mulder, how many times have they tried to shut us down?

MULDER: Yeah, but I never actually assaulted an auditor before.

(SCULLY stares at him in surprise, but certainly not disappointed in him, and perhaps a little amused.)

SCULLY: Did you hurt him?

MULDER: I reduced his vision a little bit.

(The phone rings and MULDER answers it on speakerphone.)

MULDER: (into phone) Mulder.

MALE VOICE: (on phone) Agent Fox Mulder?

MULDER: (into phone) Speaking.

MALE VOICE: (on phone) My name is Billy Miles. I don't know if you remember me.

(It is BILLY MILES from the Pilot, seven years ago. He is seven years older.)

MULDER: Oregon, seven years ago. You had multiple abduction experiences. I'm here with Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (into phone) Billy, are you all right?

BILLY MILES: (on phone) Yeah. This may seem weird, me calling like this, but, um, I don't know where else to turn.

MULDER: (into phone) It happening again, Billy?

(In BILLY MILES's house we hear a door open and DETECTIVE MILES enters the house.)

BILLY MILES: (on phone) Yeah, but not to me this time.

(BILLY MILES hangs up unobtrusively as his father enters the room.)

(In the X-Files office, MULDER hangs up at the sound of the dial tone. SCULLY looks up at him.)

MULDER: (tempting) More alien abductions, Scully.

SCULLY: (thoughtfully) I don't know how we could possibly justify the expense.

MULDER: We'd probably turn up nothing.

SCULLY: Let's go waste some money.

(As they leave the office, SCULLY has a small smile. MULDER picks up his coat and follows her, also smiling.)

(Shot of a man and a woman walking up a flight of stairs which could be MULDER and SCULLY walking out of the basement, but it is actually  )



SCENE 7

(. KRYCEK and MARITA COVARRUBIAS walking up the steps of .)

THE WATERGATE APARTMENTS
WASHINGTON, DC

(MARITA COVARRUBIAS and KRYCEK arrive at one of the rooms in the hotel, #2645, they look at each other and knock. A blonde woman, NURSE GRETA, opens the door.)

NURSE GRETA: Hi. He's anxious to see you.

(MARITA COVARRUBIAS and KRYCEK enter the room. NURSE GRETA goes to a man in a wheelchair and turns him around. It is the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN. He is looking really bad. His face has no color and he has an artificial voice box installed in his throat. He smiles rather sickly at them. They look at him in horror.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I was worried about you, Alex.

KRYCEK: Cut the crap, old man.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: I heard about your incarceration.

KRYCEK: (angrily) You had me thrown in that hellhole.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: For trying to sell something that was mine, was it not? I hope we can all move forward... Put the past behind us. We have a... singular opportunity now.

KRYCEK: A singular opportunity?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (pitifully excited) There's been a crash in Oregon. An alien ship has collided with a military aircraft. Recovery is all-important. It's Roswell and Corona all over again-- 50 years later. It's our chance to rebuild the project.

(In the background, NURSE GRETA light a cigarette and gives it to CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN who puts it reverently into the inhaler apparatus of the artificial voice box and gratefully inhales the smoke. Ewwww. MARITA COVARRUBIAS and KRYCEK are also disgusted.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: How do you know someone hasn't already recovered it?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: It's never quite so easy.



SCENE 8

(Oregon woods. RICHIE and GARY are walking around. RICHIE is carrying some kind of Geiger counter/radiation detector thing and a large metal flashlight. Gary just has a flashlight. The readout on the counter is bouncing around, static is loud.)

RICHIE: I'm getting something here, Gary.

GARY: I told you, Richie.

(They walk in different directions. GARY walks into a clearing that looks eerily similar to the clearing in the Pilot episode. As he steps into the center of the clearing, he rises a few feet off the ground and his entire body begins shaking rapidly to the sound of an eerie, low-pitched vibration. Meanwhile, RICHIE is shining his flashlight around the clearing. He stares as the beam is distorted in the middle of the clearing.)

RICHIE: Hey, man. Look at this.

(No response.)

RICHIE: Gary! Gary?

(There is a bright white light behind a tree.)

RICHIE; Come on, man.

(RICHIE looks into the clearing, but GARY is gone. RICHIE's counter is off the scale and his flashlight begins glowing red hot. He gasps and drops it as it bursts into flame. RICHIE runs out of the forest.)



SCENE 9

(MULDER and SCULLY pull up in front of either the Sheriff's Department or the MILES' residence. Silver Lariat rental car, license plate, Oregon FAZ-203. They get out of the car as BILLY MILES comes to greet them warmly, shaking each of their hands.)

BILLY MILES: Agent Mulder and Agent Scully.

MULDER: Look who's wearing a badge.

BILLY MILES: I've never thought of myself as a cop but it's been three years now. My dad got them to fudge the psych qualifications.

(He touches his forehead. SCULLY notices BILLY MILES' wedding ring.)

SCULLY: You're married, Billy.

BILLY MILES: Uh, divorced. I live back with my dad now.

MULDER: You've never, um... have you ever been able to get over the abductions?

BILLY MILES: Well, I have. But, um, people haven't. No one really believes it. My dad still denies it ever happened-- that any one of us was taken.

MULDER: Does he deny that it's happening now?

BILLY MILES: There was a crash. A Navy pilot hit an unidentified aircraft outside of town. Now, the military found their jet but the other craft hasn't been recovered.

SCULLY: Why not?

BILLY MILES: It's our county and we're in charge of coordinating efforts but my dad has really been no help even though we have a deputy missing.

MULDER: You find the UFO and he won't be able to deny the truth.

BILLY MILES: I hope that's all it is.

(DETECTIVE MILES drives up in his dented patrol car. He opens the car with the outside handle, gets out and approaches the others suspiciously.)

DETECTIVE MILES: What's going on, Bill?

BILLY MILES: Just talking to some people you might remember, Dad, from the FBI.

SCULLY: Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.

(DETECTIVE MILES shakes MULDER's hand. He is not overly friendly.)

DETECTIVE MILES: What brings you folks out here? You're not thinking this incident's some kind of UFO?

MULDER: Crash of an unidentified craft.

DETECTIVE MILES: Well, I've been on with the FAA. You might want to follow up. Looks an awful lot like there was no crash at all.

(SCULLY and MULDER looks at him. BILLY MILES looks at the ground.)



SCENE 10

(MULDER and SCULLY follow DETECTIVE MILES and BILLY MILES to the crash site. They get out of their cars and look down at the road. A faded orange "X" is painted on the pavement. What's that white thing that landed on it? There are also two long fresh skid marks on the road.)

MULDER: Deja vu all over again.

DETECTIVE MILES: That was there already in case you're wondering at all about it.

SCULLY: I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago.

DETECTIVE MILES: What for?

MULDER: To mark an anomalous electrical disturbance-- the kind where time gets bent or goes missing or where your car loses power and dies in the middle of the road.

(MULDER and DETECTIVE MILES walk along the road while SCULLY goes to the side of the road.)

DETECTIVE MILES: These skid marks are mine.

MULDER: So, was the deputy's car up there sitting there without his lights on?

DETECTIVE MILES: Well, if they'd been on, I would have seen him.

MULDER: Good point.

(MULDER looks at the road. At the end of the skid marks is a hole in the pavement that looks like it was burned with acid. SCULLY has wandered off to the side of the road and found some shell casings.)

SCULLY: Detective? Did the, uh... deputy carry a .38?

(BILLY MILES comes over to her.)

BILLY MILES: .38 super. Why?

(SCULLY holds up one of the shells with a pair of tweezers.)

SCULLY: Three shells were discharged. I image they could have rolled from up there.

DETECTIVE MILES: What was he shooting at?

MULDER: Probably nothing.

DETECTIVE MILES: Nothing?

MULDER: (subtle sarcasm) Nothing's all you seem to find out here, Detective.

(SCULLY and BILLY MILES speak quietly as he holds open a evidence bag for her to drop the casings into.)

SCULLY: Was the missing deputy a good cop?

BILLY MILES: Yeah, sure, I guess.

SCULLY: Married? Single?

(DETECTIVE MILES notices them and calls over:)

DETECTIVE MILES: Bill! Come on over here with those!

BILLY MILES: (to SCULLY) Married. New baby.

(MULDER and SCULLY get into their car and drive off. BILLY MILES hands the bagged evidence to his father.)

BILLY MILES: You know, they only want to solve this.

DETECTIVE MILES: Get in the car, Bill.

(BILLY MILES gets in the car as DETECTIVE MILES opens the trunk. Inside the trunk is DETECTIVE MILES, eyes burned around the edges if by acid, or by exposure to the green blood of the aliens. He is either dead, or as CarriK believes, unconscious. DETECTIVE MILES tosses the evidence bag into the trunk and closes it again.)



SCENE 11

(HOESE house. MULDER and SCULLY knock at the door. TERESA HOESE, nee NEMMANS  the girl from the Pilot, the one who bled from the nose in the restaurant  opens it. Like BILLY MILES, she is seven years older.)

TERESA HOESE: Yes?

SCULLY: (showing her badge) Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese. We're with the FBI.

TERESA HOESE: Is this about my husband?

(MULDER recognizes her.)

MULDER: You're Teresa? Teresa Nemman?

TERESA HOESE: Yes.

MULDER: Seven years ago you came to Agent Scully and I for help. You were afraid of being abducted.

(She recognizes them.)

TERESA HOESE: Oh, my God.

(From inside the house, we hear a BABY crying. TERESA HOESE invites them in.)

TERESA HOESE: Please, come in.

(Short time later, MULDER and SCULLY sit facing TERESA HOESE as she holds her months old baby girl. Throughout the scene, SCULLY keeps glancing at the baby and MULDER keeps glancing at SCULLY.)

TERESA HOESE: I'm sorry... I sort of lost it when I realized who you were.

SCULLY: We, uh... we came to see if there's anything that you could tell us that might help to find your husband.

MULDER: We had no idea you were his wife.

TERESA HOESE: I don't know if it's important. Maybe I just hope it's not but Ray and I have a connection that's even deeper for us.

MULDER: He's an abductee, too?

TERESA HOESE: He kept it a secret from almost everyone. It doesn't make you real popular around here.

(The BABY on her lap cries. She quiets it by rubbing it's back.)

TERESA HOESE: His experiences were a lot more terrifying than mine. He was taken many times and tested. I have extensive medical records on him and photos of his scars. I'll get you the files.

(TERESA HOESE, I guess, sensing that SCULLY has been watching the BABY with affection, stands up and hands the BABY to her. SCULLY glances at MULDER, perhaps a little embarrassed, and then cuddles the child on her lap as TERESA HOESE goes in search of the files. SCULLY takes a rubber squeaky duck from the coffee table and shows it to the BABY.)

SCULLY: What do you see?

(The BABY refuses the duck, then takes it and squeezes it.)

SCULLY: What do you see?

(MULDER watches her wistfully as she begins singing softly a little off key:)

SCULLY: Once upon a time there was a little baby.



SCENE 12
BELLEFLUER, OREGON
8:07 PM

(MULDER's motel room. The room is very similar to that which he stayed in in the Pilot episode. Guess they rebuilt after the fire. He is lying on his bed looking at the files that TERESA HOESE gave them. Pictures of DEPUTY RAY HOESE, close-ups of the bruises on his wrists and elsewhere that he received during his multiple abductions. He looks up at a knock on his door.)

MULDER: Who is it?

SCULLY: (outside) It's me.

(MULDER opens the door. SCULLY, still dressed in a white blouse and slacks, stands in the doorway. MULDER is concerned.)

MULDER: What's wrong, Scully? You look sick.

SCULLY: I don't know what's wrong.

MULDER: Come in.

(MULDER draws SCULLY into the room and she sits huddled, shivering, on the bed. MULDER closes the door and goes to her.)

SCULLY: I, um... I was starting to get ready for bed and I started to feel really dizzy-- vertigo or something-- and then I just... I started to get chills.

(MULDER turns down the sheets and blankets on his bed.)

MULDER: You want me to call a doctor?

SCULLY: No, I just... I just want to get warm.

(SCULLY climbs onto the bed, pausing as MULDER takes off her shoes and drops them to the floor. She gets under the covers and MULDER tucks her in, then lies behind her and embraces her in a classic warm spooning cuddle. There is no shyness or hesitation. Both are very comfortable.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(Pause. MULDER holds SCULLY.)

MULDER: It's not worth it, Scully.

(Long pause.)

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: I want you to go home.

SCULLY: Oh, Mulder, I'm going to be fine.

MULDER: No, I've been thinking about it. Looking at you tonight, holding that baby... knowing everything that's been taken away from you. A chance for motherhood and your health and that baby. I think that... I don't know, maybe they're right.

SCULLY: Who's right?

MULDER: The FBI. Maybe what they say is true, though for all the wrong reasons. It's the personal costs that are too high.

(SCULLY begins to cry silently. MULDER whispers gently into her ear.)

MULDER: There so much more you need to do with your life. There's so much more than this.

(He gently strokes her face as she cries.)

MULDER: (whisper) There has to be an end, Scully.

(He softly kisses her cheek and leans his head on her shoulder. SCULLY clasps his hand and holds it near her mouth.)



SCENE 13

(Same time, outside the motel. KRYCEK is sitting in a car watching MULDER's hotel room. He is on his cell phone.)

KRYCEK: (on phone) In spite of a great deal of effort no one seems to be able to find this UFO of yours.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) Of course they can't.

KRYCEK: (on phone) You know why? 'Cause it's not here.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) It's there, Alex. I'm certain of it. Hidden in plain sight.

(NURSE GRETA finishes giving CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN a very graphic injection in his arm.)

KRYCEK: (on phone) You listen to me. If you're going to play games, the two of them, Mulder and Scully, they're going to beat me to it.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone, surprised) Are you saying that Mulder and Scully are there looking for the UFO?

KRYCEK: (on phone) They're looking for a missing deputy.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone) Well, they're looking for the right thing but in the wrong place.

KRYCEK: (on phone) You sent me looking for a ship.

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: (on phone, desperate) Find the deputy. Find the ship.



SCENE 14

(HOESE house. TERESA HOESE in a bathrobe comes down the stairs and sees a man wearing a deputy's hat standing outside the door.)

TERESA HOESE: Who is it?

(The MAN rattles the door handle.)

TERESA HOESE: Ray?

(Gratefully, she opens the door. It is DEPUTY RAY HOESE. She embraces his warmly. His response is superficial.)

TERESA HOESE: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I was so worried. I was so sure... what did they do to you this time?

(He looks at her.)

TERESA HOESE: Ray, talk to me.

(He looks at her. She backs away in terror.)

TERESA HOESE: You're not my husband.

(She runs upstairs. He follows at a slower, yet definite pace. As her rounds the landing, she whips around and stabs him in the chest with a kitchen knife, then recoils from the green fluid that oozes out of his chest. Her eyes are burnt from the fumes as she stumbles into the nursery where the BABY is crying loudly.)

TERESA HOESE: No! No!

(He follows her and picks her up and carries her screaming out of the room. The BABY wails.)



SCENE 15

(Next morning. MULDER and SCULLY arrive at the HOESE house. Crime scene procedures underway. SCULLY watches as the BABY is carried out by a DEPUTY. They find BILLY MILES.)

MULDER: What happened, Billy?

BILLY MILES: Teresa's gone. She's been taken, and they took her.

SCULLY: How do you know?

BILLY MILES: The door was open.

(They follow BILLY MILES into the house and upstairs. In the nursery, MULDER sees something and calls SCULLY.)

MULDER: Scully... the floor. What do you see?

(She looks at it.)

MULDER: The same thing as out on the road. You've seen it before.

(It is a patch of carpet that has been burned through, as if by acid. SCULLY looks at it, then up at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Yeah. I have. We both have.

(MULDER leaves the room.)

BILLY MILES: What is it?

SCULLY: It's a biological toxin emitted as a gas through the bloodstream.

BILLY MILES: From who?

SCULLY: From what is arguably an alien.

(SCULLY gasps and almost faints. BILLY MILES catches her and looks at her with concern.)

BILLY MILES: You okay?

SCULLY: Yeah.

BILLY MILES: You sure?

SCULLY: Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.



SCENE 16

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's apartment. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN takes a drag of a cigarette through his false voicebox. GRETA stands close by. MARITA COVARRUBIAS watches uncomfortably. She does not approve of the "treatment.")

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Thank you, Greta.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Why the trouble? To bring Krycek here and then toy with him?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Do you trust Alex, Marita?

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Then why bring him here at all?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: You misunderstand. I've great faith that Alex will find the ship. But if I told him how, he'd be... he'd be tempted to sell the information.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: And you're certain it's there?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: Oh, yes. But it won't be there forever. It's rebuilding itself.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: If he finds the ship, then what?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: To possess it is to possess the answer to all things. Every possible imaginable question.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: To God?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: There's no God, Marita. What we call God is only alien-- an intelligence much greater than us.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: They're coming here, aren't they?

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: They're only coming back.

(SCULLY comes out of the house and opens the passenger side door to join a silent MULDER. As she does, he opens his door and gets out.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(MULDER stops RICHIE as they notice he is leaving the area quickly. SCULLY joins him.)

MULDER: Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

RICHIE: I was just standing there. Is that against the law?

(BILLY MILES has joined them.)

MULDER: You know this guy?

BILLY MILES: Yeah. What are you doing, Richie?

RICHIE: They took him, Billy. They took Gary. He was just gone.

MULDER: Relax. Slow down.

RICHIE: They're out there. I don't care what your dad says, Billy.

BILLY MILES: My dad?

RICHIE: He was out there, too. He knows.

(BILLY MILES runs away.)



SCENE 17

(Oregon woods. RICHIE is leading MULDER and SCULLY to the area where GARY disappeared.)

RICHIE: I was shining my flashlight in the dark looking for the UFO and uh, the beam hit this spot in space-- like it bent the light.

MULDER: And then what happened?

RICHIE: Well, I yelled, "Gary!" And I looked... but he wasn't there, you know? He wasn't anywhere, man and then the flashlight got really hot and I dropped it. It's right around here somewhere.

(While MULDER talks to RICHIE, SCULLY has walked over to where we last saw GARY. As she steps into the center of the clearing, she also rises up and shakes impossible fast to the sound of an eerie, low-pitched vibration.)

(Meanwhile, RICHIE and MULDER find RICHIE's scorched flashlight.)

RICHIE: Oh, hey, here it is.

(MULDER realizes that SCULLY is not beside him.)

MULDER: Scully?

(He starts toward the clearing.)

MULDER: Scully?

(He sees her collapsed on the ground.)

MULDER: Scully.

(He gathers her gently into his arms, supporting her against his bent leg. She is very groggy and disoriented. He is very concerned.)

MULDER: You want some water?

RICHIE: What happened to her?

MULDER: Can you just get her some water?

(RICHIE goes to find some water. MULDER continues to hold SCULLY.)

SCULLY: I just... I just... I just hit the ground.

MULDER: Here, lie still.

SCULLY: Why is this happening to me?

MULDER: It's okay. It's okay.

SCULLY: What the hell's going on, Mulder?

MULDER: I don't know. But these aren't just random abductions, Scully. We've got to warn Billy Miles of that.

SCULLY: Warn him of what?

MULDER: These abductees aren't just systematically being taken. They're not coming back.



SCENE 18

(MILES' house. BILLY MILES enters his house cautiously and draws his gun.)

BILLY MILES: Dad?

(He holds his gun at his father.)

DETECTIVE MILES: Billy... what are you doing?

BILLY MILES: You stay where you are.

DETECTIVE MILES: Billy, it's me.

BILLY MILES: I said, stay where you are!

DETECTIVE MILES: Damn it, Billy, listen to me.

BILLY MILES: No. I don't know who you are but you are not going to take me.

DETECTIVE MILES: I'm your father. Are you going to shoot your father?

BILLY MILES: If you're my father... then why won't you believe me?

DETECTIVE MILES: I believe you, Billy. I just want it all to go away. Give me the gun, son.

(BILLY MILES lowers the gun and begins to cry. DETECTIVE MILES takes the gun. He morphs into the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER, then looks out the window where MULDER and SCULLY are driving up.)

MULDER: Billy?

SCULLY: Billy?

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. MULDER shakes his head.)



SCENE 19
TWO DAYS LATER

(X-Files office. MULDER is alone fully reclined in his chair tossing and catching a basketball. SKINNER enters the office.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: What's our punishment this time? Thumbscrews or 40 lashes? Come on in, Walter. Sit a spell. This could be the last time you take a trip down to these offices.

(He looks up at SKINNER and sets the ball on the desk.)

SKINNER: You went to Oregon.

MULDER: Guilty as charged. And if they're coming down on you for that, then I'm sorry. I truly am.

SKINNER: Fortunately, they think that I make a contribution to the Bureau.

MULDER: (bitterly) Oh well yeah, stick to a budget they say your making a contribution, but push the limits of your profession, and they say you're out of control.

SKINNER: You could bring home a flying saucer and have an alien shake hands with the President  what it comes down to Agent Mulder is  they don't like you.

MULDER: Well, we didn't bring home a flying saucer  or an alien.

SKINNER: Yeah  so I've been told.

(MULDER nods dejectedly. SKINNER waves his companions into the office. KRYCEK and MARITA COVARRUBIAS. MULDER waits about 1.263 seconds and starts for KRYCEK. SKINNER stops him, holding his arms forcefully. MULDER backs off.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder! I think you should listen to him.

KRYCEK: You've got every reason to want to see me dead. (SKINNER restrains MULDER again) But you've got to listen to me now. You have the singular opportunity.

MULDER: (challenging) Here or you want to step outside.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: Agent Mulder. CancerMan is dying.

(MULDER looks at SKINNER who walks away.)

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: His last wish is to rebuild his Project, to have us revive the Conspiracy. It all begins in Oregon.

KRYCEK: The ship that collided with that Navy plane. It's in those woods.

MULDER: There's no ship in those woods.

KRYCEK: Yeah, it's there. Cloaked in an energy field. Great, mops up the evidence.

MULDER: Who?

KRYCEK: The Alien Bounty Hunter. Billy Miles. Teresa Hoese, her husband. He's eliminating proof of all the tests. We're asking ourselves, we're asking ourselves, "Where are they?" They're right there. They're right under our noses. I'm giving you the chance to change that, to hold the proof.

MULDER: Why me and why now

KRYCEK: I want to damn the soul of that Cigarette Smoking Son-of-a-Bitch.

(SCULLY appears in the doorway to the office.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Slow pan of the office as MARITA COVARRUBIAS , KRYCEK, SKINNER and MULDER look at her.)



SCENE 20

(SKINNER's office. Conference area. The table is littered with papers, files and Chinese take-out containers. A most unlikely group is around the table. SKINNER, the LONE GUNMEN, KRYCEK, MARITA COVARRUBIAS, MULDER and a very uncomfortable SCULLY at one end of the table. He arms are crossed protectively.)

FROHIKE: What's amazing is that even the military satellites don't see it.

LANGLEY: But J.P.L.'S Topex Poseidon shows it only as waveform data.

BYERS: And here it appears simply as a microburst of transmission error on the European Space Agency's ERS-2.

SKINNER: In other words?

FROHIKE: In other words, you'd never know it's a UFO.

BYERS: If you didn't know what you were looking at or looking for.

LANGLEY: No wonder we couldn't see them.

KRYCEK: Listen, it is not going to be there forever.

MARITA COVARRUBIAS: As we all stand here talking it's rebuilding itself.

(SCULLY can't take any more and walks out of the office and paces the hall. MULDER follow her, closing the door behind him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, if any of this is true...

MULDER: If it is, or if it isn't I want you to forget about it, Scully.

SCULLY: (staring at him in disbelief) Forget about it?

MULDER: (firmly) You're not going back out there. I'm not going to let you go back out there.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

MULDER: It has to end sometime. That time is now.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Scully, you have to understand that they're taking abductees. You're an abductee. I'm not going to risk...

(He looks at her sadly, meaningfully, his voice breaking a little.)

MULDER: . losing you.

(She walks slowly into his embrace. They cling tightly to each other.)

SCULLY: I won't let you go alone.



SCENE 21

(Oregon woods. Next day? A Chevy Malibu LS, didn't see a Lariat sticker, parks. SKINNER pops the trunk and he and MULDER get out of the car.)

SKINNER: This is starting to feel like the snipe hunt I was afraid of.

(MULDER gets a backpack out of the trunk and starts off into the woods.)

MULDER: There's no such thing as a snipe, sir.

SKINNER: Hey, you know, my ass is on the line here, too, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: I know that.

(MULDER heads into the woods. SKINNER looks around, then follows.)



SCENE 22

(SKINNER's office. SCULLY and the LONE GUNMEN are still looking through files. SCULLY looks at one with concern.)

SCULLY: This just can't be.

FROHIKE: What are you looking at?

SCULLY: Medical records-- Billy Miles and other known abductees in Bellefleur, Oregon. They all experienced anomalous brain activity.

BYERS: Electro-encephalitic trauma.

SCULLY: Which is exactly what Mulder experienced earlier this year.

LANGLEY: I don't understand.

SCULLY: There was something out there in that field. It knocked me back. Because it didn't want me. Mulder thinks that it's me that's in danger of being taken.

FROHIKE: When it's Mulder who's in danger.

(SCULLY looks weak and disoriented.)

SCULLY: Scully?

(SCULLY faints. The LONE GUNMEN catch her as she falls.)

GUNMEN: Scully! Whoa! You okay? Oh, gee.

SKINNER: How's it supposed to work?

MULDER: Not exactly sure, sir. But, uh...

(He checks a readout on a handheld device.)

MULDER:  budgetarily, I'd say we're looking pretty good.

(While SKINNER is occupied setting up a laser, MULDER goes into the enter of the clearing. The lasers all end in red dots against something invisible. MULDER cautiously sticks his hand into the invisibility. It begins shaking impossibly fast. To the sound of an eerie, low-pitched vibration.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?!

(SKINNER looks up. There is no sign of MULDER in the clearing.)

SKINNER: Mulder!

(We see MULDER, motionless in the clearing. Behind him, SKINNER is calling for him in a distorted voice.)

SKINNER: Mulder! Mulder...

(MULDER is standing just outside a pool of very white light that we last saw SCULLY standing in the The Red and the Black, season 5. Inside the circle are all the Oregon abductees, DEPUTY RAY HOESE , TERESA HOESE, BILLY MILES, DETECTIVE MILES, et al. MULDER hesitates a moment, then steps into the circle also. They welcome him warmly. He looks up at he bright light above. He is wearing SCULLY's gold cross. From the woods, the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER also steps confidently into the circle. He and MULDER look at each other, perhaps with recognition of what they are to do. The white light gets brighter and the screen goes white.)

(From SKINNER's point of view, a bright white light is coming out of the sky, then fades enough for him to see that it is coming from the belly of a triangle shaped ship that turns and soars off into the night sky. SKINNER's face is awed and anguished.)

SKINNER: Mulder.



SCENE 23

(CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN's room. KRYCEK and MARITA COVARRUBIAS knock. NURSE GRETA lets them in. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN is staring out the window, devastated.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: We've failed, then. Perhaps you never meant to succeed. Anyway... the hour is at hand, I presume.

(KRYCEK begins to wheel CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN out of the room. NURSE GRETA moves to stop him, but is halted by MARITA COVARRUBIAS.)

NURSE GRETA: What are you doing?

KRYCEK: Sending the Devil back to Hell.

(KRYCEK wheels the CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN to the top of a flight of stairs.)

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN: As you do to Mulder and to me... you do to all of mankind, Alex.

(KRYCEK holds for a moment, then decisively pushes the man in his wheelchair down the stairs. CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN lies in a motionless, crumpled head at the foot of the stairs. KRYCEK and MARITA COVARRUBIAS descend the stairs and step over CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN on their way out of the building.)



SCENE 24

(SKINNER enters a hospital and makes his way to SCULLY's room. She is lying on a bed with a pensive look on her face. She is wearing a blue hospital gown. She is not wearing her cross, having given it to MULDER off camera.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Hi.

SKINNER: Hi. How you feeling?

SCULLY: I'm feeling fine. They're just running some tests on me.

SKINNER: Well... um...

(SKINNER's face twists in pain. He can't say it. SCULLY also looks about ready to cry.)

SCULLY: I already heard.

SKINNER: (voice breaking) I lost him. I don't know what else I can say. I lost him. I'll be asked... what I saw. And what I saw, I can't deny. I won't.

SCULLY: (crying) We will find him. I have to.

(SKINNER nods in understanding and starts out of the room. However, SCULLY isn't finished.)

SCULLY: Sir, um... there's something else I need to tell you. Something that I need for you to keep to yourself.

(He looks at her questioningly. She looks ready to either laugh or cry, but can't decide which.)

SCULLY: I'm having a hard time explaining it. Or believing it. But, um...

(Pause. A small inward smile of joy mixed with plenty of pain.)

SCULLY: I'm pregnant.

(SKINNER stares at her, speechless. She tries to smile. But through her tears, it comes out as a mixture of a laugh and a weak sob.)

[THE END]


                                   WITHIN


SCENE 1

(Sound of a rhythmic heartbeat. Lighting is very dim, fading in and out of black. We see glimpses of a figure moving slowly in a viscous greenish-yellow fluid. The heartbeat speeds up slightly as the light brightens. Either the fluid drains or the figure rises. It is MULDER. His eyes fly open and he gasps as an organic cord is pulled from his throat [just like the one he pulled out of SCULLY in the movie.] Quick cut from MULDER's shocked expression to SCULLY gasping as she wakes up abruptly in the hospital. She catches her breath and lies back down on the bed, her hand resting protectively on her abdomen.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]


SCENES FROM 7X22 REQUIEM:

CHRIS CARTER: Last season on the X-Files.

(The weasely auditor, SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT, conducting the interviews of MULDER and SCULLY.)

SPECIAL AGENT CHESTY SHORT: Gas, expenses-- by FBI standards these numbers are out of control.

SCULLY: I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests which left me barren.

MULDER: They're taking abductees. You're an abductee.

(RAY shaking in the alien force field.)

(ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER looking around the HOESE's house.)

(SCULLY is talking to SKINNER and the GUNMEN.)

SCULLY: There was something out there in that field. It knocked me back because it didn't want me.

(MULDER sticks his hand into the force field. It shakes.)

FROHIKE: You'd never know it's a UFO.

BYERS: If you didn't know what you were looking at.

(SKINNER in the field sheilding his eyes from the UFO light.)

(SKINNER at SCULLY's bedside in the hospital.)

SKINNER: I don't know what else I can say-- I lost him.

SCULLY: (crying) We will find him.

(MULDER in the light watching as the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER joins him and the abductees.)

SCULLY: I'm having a hard time believing it.

(SCULLY is on the verge of both happiness and despair.)

SCULLY: I'm pregnant.



SCENE 2

(SCULLY is looking at herself in her bathroom mirror. Music is minor and haunting, like Lorena McKennitt singing with an Indian influence. SCULLY contemplates her image. Her hair is still damp, her face shows no emotion and yet every emotion. Slowly, she buttons her black blouse from the bottom up. She is wearing her cross that as we ALL saw in Requiem, should be on Mulder wherever he is. Grrr. In slow motion, music underscoring, we see SCULLY walking through the halls of the FBI. She is in all black, 2-inch heels. She passes through the basement hallway into MULDER's office. Slow motion effect and music stop as she sees the four male agents in the office going through the desk and file cabinets. SCULLY is furious.)

SCULLY: What is this?! Excuse me. Can somebody please tell me what's going on here?

(One of the Agents, listed as AGENT TDB, whatever that is, responds.)

AGENT TDB: We're collecting material.

SCULLY: For?

AGENT TDB: For anything that might be pertinent to the manhunt.

SCULLY: What manhunt? Manhunt for who?

AGENT TDB: You're kidding, right?

SCULLY: Look, there's nothing. If you're looking for Mulder, you're wasting your time. Are you listening to me?

AGENT TDB: I'm not the man to talk to.

SCULLY: Well, then whose stupid idea is this?

(CUT TO: SCULLY entering SKINNER's office. SKINNER is on the phone. He is not happy with the conversation.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Yeah, well, somebody might have had the courtesy to tell me. (slams the phone down)

SCULLY: There are agents tearing apart Mulder's office who say they're part of an FBI manhunt.

SKINNER: I know. I heard. Believe me, this is not my idea. I just found out about it myself.

SCULLY: They're not going to find Mulder this way. You know that and I know that.

SKINNER: I told you last night, I will find him. I'm going to do that. Okay? Now, I want you just to cool out. I don't want you doing anything to upset your pregnancy.

SCULLY: Look, I don't understand. You are the Assistant Director. Who is going over your head on this?

SKINNER: (sarcastically) Our brand-new deputy director.

(His phone rings. The caller ID display indicates that it is A. KERSH EXT 562. SCULLY stares in disbelief at SKINNER.)

(Later SCULLY and SKINNER enter KERSH's old office. He is packing up items from his desk drawers.)

KERSH: A.D. Skinner, Agent Scully. Thanks for getting right over. I don't want to lose any time. We have one of our own missing and the only acceptable outcome is that we find him safe and alive. I'm sure the two of you agree.

SKINNER: That goes without saying, sir.

("Sir" was not an easy word for SKINNER to say.)

KERSH: Good. This comes at a stressful time, with my new appointment. But I'm thankful for your cooperation in the hunt for Mulder.

SCULLY: Our cooperation? With due respect, there aren't two people better qualified to be directing this action, sir.

KERSH: Right now, you and A.D. Skinner are the two primary witnesses to Mulder's disappearance. I want your statement taken asap.

SCULLY: You make us out to be suspects, sir.

(KERSH stares at her.)

SKINNER: Taken by who?

KERSH: My task force leader on this, Special Agent John Doggett. He's waiting to hear from you now.

(Emphasis on the word "now". SKINNER and SCULLY start to leave. KERSH takes off his glasses and faces them.)

KERSH: One more thing. Anything leaves this building about aliens or alien abductions or any other nonsense that might cast the Bureau in a ridiculous light-- hey, you can forget about looking for Agent Mulder. You'll both be looking for new jobs.

(KERSH puts his glasses back on and returns to his papers.)

KERSH: That's all.

(The door to the office closes and SCULLY and SKINNER leave and begin walking down the hall.)

SCULLY: I don't believe this.

SKINNER: This isn't about finding Mulder-- this is about Kersh covering the FBI's ass.

SCULLY: Why do I get the feeling they'd be happy if we never found him at all?

(They stop at a door and speak quietly.)

SKINNER: Look... I saw what I saw. I have to make a statement in there. I'm not going to tell them it didn't happen.

SCULLY: Well, you heard Kersh. They don't want the truth. You give them the truth, and they'll hang you with it.

SKINNER: They can hang me with a lie, too. I'm not going to sell Mulder out.

SCULLY: What good are you to Mulder if you give them the power to ruin your career?

(SKINNER has no answer.)

SCULLY: We will find him.

(They enter the Bullpen. The ALL BUSINESS AGENT, aka AGENT GENE CRANE, comes over to them.)

AGENT GENE CRANE: Assistant Director, you can come on back with me. Agent Scully, I'll ask you to please wait on the wall until we call you.

(He leads a reluctant SKINNER to a desk in the middle of the room. SCULLY sits wearily in one of the red chairs lining the wall. A MAN is already sitting two seats away. He is about 40. Ruggedly good-looking in a manly-man sort of way. This is a man's man. A guy's guy. This is not a man who would watch "Steel Magnolias" without a fight, no matter how much Shiner Bock beer was on hand. He is wearing an FBI badge, but it is twisted on his lapel, we can't see his name or photo. He looks at SCULLY as she sits, then gets up and crosses to a water cooler. SCULLY, her mind on other things, glances at him, but remains focused on SKINNER. A moment later he hands her a paper cup.)

THE MAN: Water?

(She looks up at him in surprise.)

THE MAN: It could be a wait.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY accepts the cup and takes a sip as THE MAN sits down again, and begins reading his file.)

THE MAN: (casually) Weren't you his partner? Mulder?

SCULLY: (not expecting the question) Yes.

THE MAN: I guess nobody's beyond suspicion on this thing.

SCULLY: Why are they talking to you?

THE MAN: (casually) Me? I knew Mulder back a bit. They're developing a working profile-- character background.

SCULLY: I'd say they have all the character profile they need on him.

DOGGETT: Certainly his reputation. I doubt we agents ever really truly know each other even our partners. Not at the end of the day. Their real lives, their friends, girlfriends, deeply personal things, issues.

SCULLY: I think I know Mulder as much as anybody.

THE MAN: Yeah, probably so. I always took the rumors with a grain of salt.

SCULLY: What rumors are those?

THE MAN: Well, you know.

(SCULLY doesn't know.)

THE MAN: Well, that, from the beginning he never felt a real trust with you, that you were ambitious.

SCULLY: Where'd that come from?

THE MAN: (short laugh) There are women here at the Bureau that he would confide in. I don't know if you knew that or not.

SCULLY: No. When was this?

THE MAN: I don't know, it's just talk. So, what do you think happened? To Mulder? What's your theory?

(SCULLY does not like this man. At all.)

SCULLY: What's my theory? My theory is you don't know Mulder at all. You never did.

(She reaches out and flips his badge over.)

SCULLY: "John Doggett." Kersh's task force leader. You might have just introduced yourself.

DOGGETT: Well, I was getting around to it.

(SCULLY stands and tosses the water in DOGGETT's face.)

SCULLY: Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett.

(She drops the cup. DOGGETT sits wetly stone-faced as she leaves the room, closing the door firmly behind her. Other AGENTS in the Bullpen who have been watching with interest, lower their eyes and go back to work.)



SCENE 3

(Scully's apartment. Later that evening. Hauntingly sad music is playing again. It is raining. A steady stream of water pours down the windows obscuring the view outside. SCULLY is sitting at her computer. She is running a check on DOGGETT's FBI file. His records show that he was born in Atlanta, Georgia; present assignment is as Special Agent Criminal Investigations. Camera zooms in to show:

Military History

1977-1983 - US Marine Corps
24th Marine Amphibious, 2nd Marine
Seargeant E-5

9/1/82-10/30/83 - Multinational Peacekeeping Force,
Lebanon Development

Work History

1987-1995 - New York Police Department
Detective, Fugitive Division, Warrant

1995 - Graduate, FBI Nationa; Academy, Quantico

1995 - Present - FBI, Special Agent, Criminal Investigations

While reading, SCULLY suddenly looks physically uncomfortable. She takes off her glasses and runs to the bathroom. As she throws up in the toilet, the camera focuses on the dripping faucet in the sink. After what CarriK suspects is the shortest and most delicately handled "morning sickness" bout in the history of women, SCULLY crosses to the sink, wets the washcloth which looks like it has already been used at least once this day, and wipes her face and lips. She looks at herself in the mirror.)

(Sound of a phone dialing. SCULLY is now back near her computer, phone in hand. An answering machine picks up.)

MRS SCULLY (voice on machine) Hi, this is Margaret Scully. Please leave a message.

(Beep.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Mom, it's Dana. I, uh... I'm sorry I haven't called you in a while. I've been busy with work and, um, with something ... else that I should probably tell you about in person. I mean, I don't even know if you're in town or if you're checking your messages. (her voice cracks, she is about to cry) But, um... but I really need to see you and talk to you. There's a lot of stuff that's going on with me right now and, um... and I just really need to talk.

(She is about to say more, but hears a click on the line.)

SCULLY: Mom?

(Another click. SCULLY hangs up and notices a figure outside through her window. A tall dark-haired man dressed in black is standing on the sidewalk outside her building. Angrily, she dials another number.)

(In the FBI Bullpen, DOGGETT answers the phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) John Doggett.

SCULLY: (on phone) You stay out of my business!

DOGGETT: (on phone) What? Who is this?

SCULLY: (on phone) You better have a court order!

DOGGETT: (on phone) For what? Who is this?

SCULLY: (on phone) How many phones are you tapping? How many agents are you doing surveillance on?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Is this Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you. You just answered all my questions.

(SCULLY hangs up the phone, then turns toward the door as she hears a creaking floorboard. She sees the shadow of someone standing outside her door. The shadow moves away. SCULLY gets her gun off of the table and leaves her apartment without closing the door. The hallway is empty. She goes down the stairs to the floor below her. A man is on the fire escape next to an open window. SCULLY aims her gun.)

SCULLY: Stop there! Right there! Now come on through the window nice and easy.

(MR COEBEN, 50ish, short and pudgy, climbs carefully back through the window. He is drenched. We last saw him in Orison when he let MULDER into SCULLY's apartment.)

MR COEBEN: Okay, I'm coming. It's me, your landlord. I started fixing the antennae on the roof, and...

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mr. Coeben. I'm sorry. There was a man. There was someone in the building. Did you see anyone?

MR COEBEN: Yeah, yeah, you know him, he works with you. Tall guy-- brown hair.

SCULLY: (almost speechless) Who? You... You don't mean Mulder?

MR COEBEN: Yeah, Mulder.

(SCULLY runs back to her apartment.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Are you in here?

(She looks into the kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. No one else is there. She turns back to her desk and gasps. He computer is missing. She picks up the detached power and phone cords in disbelief.)



SCENE 4

(Under the Haunting Music, SCULLY enters MULDER's apartment. His computer is also missing - a round dust-free space on the desk where the monitor used to be, a serial port cable lying forlornly. As SCULLY passes the bedroom door, she notices one of MULDER's blue dress shirts lying on the unmade bed. She picks it up and lies down on the bed, cradling the shirt in her arms. Her eyes drift closed and we cut to ...)

(MULDER in a really bad place. He is naked on some sort of metal table. His arms and legs are secured by means of metal rods that have been driven through his wrists and ankles. His head is held stationary with both a brace and six metal clips attached to his cheeks, three on each side, which stretch his skin in what looks to me a most uncomfortable manner. He is awake, a bright light above him seen through a sort of watery lens. A high-pitched whirring sound begins, and a mechanized double-pronged probe pushes itself into his nose. It probably blocks his nasal passages, because he opens his mouth. Another probe, this one with a spinning drill bit at the tip, appears. As it enters MULDER's mouth, a bright light attached to it flicks on. MULDER screams as the drill enters his soft palate.)



SCENE 5

(Late night. SKINNER and the GUNMEN are outside at a bank of large satellite dishes. The GUNMEN are showing SKINNER printouts.)

FROHIKE: It took some serious voodoo

LANGLY: Major satellite hacking.

BYERS: But we got your data.

SKINNER: What am I looking at?

BYERS: You're seeing real-time images right off the JPL Topex Poseidon.

FROHIKE: We're wired right into the dish.

BYERS: We're not able to find raw data with UFO activity on it.

FROHIKE: But Langly was able to hack into the data storage here and pull up something just as tasty.

BYERS: You're looking at UFO activity in the Pacific Northwest just prior to Mulder's abduction.

LANGLY: All these markers correspond with reported alien abductions. It's a regular shopping spree.

SKINNER: So Mulder's abduction...

FROHIKE: Was a UFO whistle stop on the way to the next pickup.

SKINNER: Where? Where's the UFO activity after Mulder's abduction?

BYERS: Like we said, we can't tell. Not from the data we're pulling down.

SKINNER: Look, if we can figure out where that ship was going, where it was gonna be, we've got a chance to find Mulder.



SCENE 6

(KERSH's office. Two other agents [movers?] are with him. DOGGETT enters.)

DOGGETT: Got a minute?

KERSH: Yeah, sure.

(The other two men leave the room. KERSH holds up a picture of a military aircraft. A young him is the pilot.)

KERSH: You fly, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Flying is for birds and baseballs. USMC, sir.

KERSH: In Vietnam we used to fly night sorties ten feet above the treetops. Before night vision, before fly-by-wire. 600 miles an hour and all we had was an idiot gauge and our wits. Guys used to say they only knew their altitude by the smell of the V.C. rice pots.

DOGGETT: You've come a long way, sir.

KERSH: Using all the same instincts. What can I do for you, Agent?

(KERSH goes to his desk)

DOGGETT: This task force-- the search for Mulder, I'm running it, right?

KERSH: You're the man in charge.

DOGGETT: No one else is involved? Someone out there acting under orders from another office?

KERSH: I think I'd know, Agent. What prompts the question?

(DOGGETT looks directly at KERSH.)

DOGGETT: My idiot gauge. My wits.

(DOGGETT begins to leave the office.)

KERSH: You got a chance to shine here, John. Stand in the spotlight. Show them all you're an ace.

(DOGGETT leaves.)



SCENE 7

(Next morning. MULDER's apartment. SCULLY is still asleep in MULDER's bed. She is still holding the shirt, but has rolled over to the other side of the bed. She hears footsteps and wakes up with serious bedhead. She looks around the room, then turns over and sits up facing the door. She is startled to see DOGGETT in the bedroom doorway.)

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

DOGGETT: (suggestively) I could ask you the same.

SCULLY: I came by to feed Mulder's fish.

DOGGETT: And then you got tired and decided to take a nap.

SCULLY: (angry) You've got a way about you, Agent Doggett. That might have worked with the NYPD but you're talking to a fellow FBI agent now and I'd appreciate some respect.

DOGGETT: Respect like you showed me over the phone? Give a little, get a little, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Who ambushed me with the phony chitchat about Mulder and then put a wiretap on my phone?

DOGGETT: That's B.S.

SCULLY: And now you're following me.

DOGGETT: I just came by to feed the fish.

(SCULLY enters the living room and crosses to the fish tank.)

SCULLY: What do you want to get on me, Agent Doggett? What is it you hope to find?

DOGGETT: I'm just trying to find Mulder.

SCULLY: You wouldn't know where to look.

(SCULLY is looking on the shelves for the fish food.)

DOGGETT: It's in the desk, middle drawer.

(Without looking at DOGGETT, SCULLY opens the drawer, gets the food and feeds the fish.)

DOGGETT: I know the answer, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I don't even know the question.

DOGGETT: What happened to Mulder? I know what you're gonna say or not because you think I'm the big bad wolf. Do you really believe it?

SCULLY: You think by talking in circles, I'm just going to get dizzy and-and blurt it out-- this so-called answer?

DOGGETT: That he was abducted by aliens?

SCULLY: (defiantly) You said it. I didn't.

DOGGETT: I guess I just find it hard to swallow that a scientist, a serious person, could buy that. Ever see an alien, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: You want me to go on record? I will go on record to say this; that I have seen things that I cannot explain. I have observed phenomena that I cannot deny. And that as a scientist and a serious person it is a badge of honor not to dismiss these things because someone thinks they're B.S.

DOGGETT: So you think he was abducted?

(SCULLY looks away.)

DOGGETT: I'm just trying to find him.

SCULLY: Then what are you doing here?

DOGGETT: (showing her a folder) Trying to figure these out. I found them in his desk there. Car rental receipts on Agent Mulder's Visa. (The receipts are from Lariat Rental Car) Four consecutive weekends in May. Same mileage each trip -- 370 miles, 375 miles... where was he going?

SCULLY: I don't know.

DOGGETT: Like I said, maybe you really didn't know your partner.

(SCULLY looks like she might say more, but DOGGETT's cell phone rings. He answers it.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) John Doggett. (pause) Agent Mulder at the FBI?

(He and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 8

(SKINNER walks down the crowded halls of the FBI and enters the Bullpen. All the Task Force is there, plus KERSH, DOGGETT and SCULLY.)

AGENT GENE CRANE: Assistant Director, follow me.

SKINNER: (wanting to talk to SCULLY) What's going on? What is this?

AGENT GENE CRANE: Mr. Skinner, right this way, please. You can talk with Agent Scully after we're done. (SKINNER looks at SCULLY hopelessly and follows him) Have a seat. (DOGGETT is standing next to SKINNER's chair, he stares down at him) Assistant Director, someone came into this office after hours and removed some material. Files. We don't know exactly what just yet.

(Camera moves to KERSH observing as SKINNER looks at him and at DOGGETT then back to CRANE.)

SKINNER: Who?

AGENT GENE CRANE: The office here is secured by a pass-card lock and whoever came in last night used the pass-card belonging to Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: You think Agent Mulder took the files?

AGENT GENE CRANE: We're wondering about Agent Mulder's state of mind. In your statement, (he flips through some papers) you said prior to his disappearance Agent Mulder had felt threatened by the FBI.

SKINNER: (knowing a trap is being laid) No, no. No, that's not what I said. I said he felt the X-Files were threatened by budget cutting.

AGENT GENE CRANE: Is there anything you're not telling us about Agent Mulder or his attitude? (no answer) Do you think he'd ever retaliate against the FBI?

SKINNER: (shaking his head) Agent Mulder was only after the truth.

KERSH: As are we, Assistant Director.

AGENT GENE CRANE: Agent Scully tells us she was home last night. We see from your phone log, you were here until at least after 10:00.

(SKINNER glares at him as CRANE hands over the phone log, a slight smile of disbelief on his lips. He reads the document and hands it back.)

SKINNER: You think I came in here last night using Agent Mulder's pass-card?

AGENT GENE CRANE: You were the last person to see Mulder. You and Agent Scully.

(Another AGENT whispers in DOGGETT's ear. Two TECHNICIANS wheel in a large object in a crate and begin opening it.)

SCULLY: (to DOGGETT) Skinner is telling the truth.

DOGGETT: I believe him. That still doesn't tell us who used Mulder's card to get in there.

SCULLY: You think it was Mulder?

DOGGETT: I showed you those car rental receipts. Well, now I find Agent Mulder's Visa was used two days ago in Raleigh, North Carolina.

SCULLY: Two days ago? By who? For what?

DOGGETT: Flowers. Automatic debit to a mortuary there.

SCULLY: (realizing, with relief) Mulder's mother is buried in Raleigh. That's the reason he was going every weekend.

DOGGETT: It's one reason. (He looks at the crate.)

(The crate is now open revealing a large tombstone with the heading "MULDER." under the heading:

William Mulder 1936-1995
Tena Mulder 1941-2000
Samantha Mulder 1964-1977

At the very bottom is a freshly carved "FOX MULDER, 1961-2000." SCULLY stares at the stone in shock.)

(FBI Bullpen. Haunting music. SCULLY is still staring at the tombstone, her hand covering her mouth. DOGGETT is on the phone standing by a desk a few feet away watching her. SKINNER enters and crosses to SCULLY. They speak quietly.)

SCULLY: I don't know what to think.

SKINNER: I don't believe it, Dana. It just doesn't make any sense to me.

(DOGGETT crosses to SCULLY and SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: All right. I got some light on this. Maybe you can help me out here, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: What is it?

DOGGETT: (handing her a file) Agent Mulder's medical records-- recent stuff, over the last year. Did you know about a medical condition? Either of you?

SKINNER: No.

DOGGETT: A year ago, Agent Mulder was hospitalized. Ring a bell? Something to do with his brain?

SCULLY: (reading the file) His temporal lobe.

DOGGETT: An undiagnosable condition, it says. Irregular brain activity.

SKINNER: All right, but he recovered. There was a full recovery.

DOGGETT: Was there?

SKINNER: (to SCULLY) You know Mulder; he would've told us if there was anything.

DOGGETT: Would he? Would he tell you about this? About his headstone?

SCULLY: (softly) Mulder was dying.

SKINNER: What?

SCULLY: It's all right here. For a year, he was going to doctors. There's a clear record of his decline.

DOGGETT: How well did you really know him? How far would Mulder go?

SCULLY: How far would he go for what?

DOGGETT: The truth-- his truth. Whatever it was he was trying to prove, how bad did he need to prove it?

SCULLY: It was his whole life.

SKINNER: What are you trying to say?

DOGGETT: That Agent Mulder found himself in a place none of us want to go. Life-threatened, work-threatened, and all for naught. Nothing proven. The effort in vain. No mark left. Unless he rolled the dice, took one big last chance to make it.

SCULLY: (hard to accept) You think that Mulder was here? That he broke in to steal those files?

DOGGETT: Broke into your apartment; stole your computer. Took his own computer. Gathering it up.

SKINNER: To what? To prove it?

DOGGETT: Or cover it up. Create doubt. (confidently) I get Mulder, I get him. I understand obsession, believe me. But the question is: how far would he go? I mean, so far as to stage his own disappearance?

SKINNER: (defiantly, to SCULLY) I know what I saw. I not going to sit here and listen to this. I watched it happen.

(SKINNER gets up and stands in front of DOGGETT)

(Flashback to the forest scene in Requiem, 7X22. SKINNER sees the bright light overhead and MULDER disappearing.)

SKINNER: Agent Mulder?!

(Present time. SKINNER looks shocked as he realizes what he just revealed to DOGGETT. DOGGETT is staring at him. SCULLY rests her hand subtly on SKINNER's jacket. SCULLY stands up and leans into DOGGETT, a pleading note in her voice.)

SCULLY: Please don't report that.

(SKINNER looks at her.)

DOGGETT: Don't know what good it would do me. Doesn't help me find Mulder.

(DOGGETT leaves. SCULLY places her hand on SKINNER's shoulder.)

SKINNER: No, it's not good enough.

(SKINNER turns away and leaves. SCULLY watches as DOGGETT picks up a phone and she turns to follow SKINNER.)



SCENE 9

(The office of the LONE GUNMEN. They are showing SCULLY marked maps.)

SKINNER: These are records of microburst activity. What we read is UFO activity since Mulder's abduction.

SCULLY: I think this is a waste of time.

SKINNER: No, it's not. Just look at them.

SCULLY: I'm looking, and what I'm seeing is activity all over the southwestern states.

SKINNER: That's right.

SCULLY: Mulder disappeared in the Pacific Northwest.

SKINNER: And if Mulder is on that ship, this is where he is now.

SCULLY: (disbelief) Here? In the Arizona desert?

SKINNER: This is what we have.

SCULLY: Okay. Say this is true ... then how do we even begin to start finding him?

(Long pause.)

LANGLY: Maybe with whoever it is they're looking to abduct next.

FROHIKE: Hey, we're only trying to help.

BYERS: We're only trying to find Mulder.

(SCULLY has stepped away, but now turns back to them, a look of surprise on her face.)

SCULLY: That's it. It just came to me.

SKINNER: What?

SCULLY: What you saw, why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona now-- it all makes sense.

(Under SCULLY's lines, we see DOGGETT at his desk. An envelope containing a file is slipped under the door. DOGGETT retrieves the envelope and opens it.)

SCULLY: Why do people refuse to believe in aliens and UFOs after all these years of sightings and eyewitness accounts? Why?

FROHIKE: Because there's no real proof.

SCULLY: Because, maybe, if there are aliens they're simply going around and they're... and they're removing all of the evidence before it becomes proof. This isn't Mulder who's going around and collecting this stuff. It's them.

SKINNER: Then why Arizona?

(DOGGETT opens the file numbered 1013-113.)

SCULLY: Because they are looking to find that which is not in my computer or Mulder's computer or in the files that were removed from the FBI. They are looking to find the whereabouts of good, hard proof. That in this case exists in a person, in a boy named Gibson Praise.

(In DOGGETT's file is a picture of young GIBSON PRAISE, last seen at the beginning of Season 6.)



SCENE 10

(FBI conference room. The scene begins in slow-motion as DOGGETT looks through a file and runs his hand through his hair. He gets up and the slo-mo stops. DOGGETT is handing out photocopies of GIBSON's picture to about 12 agents.)

DOGGETT: This photograph's a few years old but take a good look because the objective in this case has been reframed. Subject's name is Gibson Andrew Praise. A child prodigy, pint-sized chess champion who Mulder and Scully first investigated in 1997 after a failed attempt on the boy's life. His files were the ones we now believe were stolen from this office. In his investigation Agent Mulder came to believe the boy was experiencing abnormal brain activity. Unexplained activity. In his field notes here he says Gibson Praise could, and I quote "read people's thoughts."

(The other AGENTS chuckle.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder went so far in one report to claim that the boy may have alien physiology.

(More chuckling.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder may be looking for the boy who was last seen in Arizona. So maybe to find Mulder we first have to look for Gibson Praise.

(DOGGETT points his finger at someone out of the screen range. We see AGENT GENE CRANE stand up and turn around to speak to the other AGENTS.)

AGENT GENE CRANE: Let's go, people! Let's move!

(The AGENTS begin to leave. AGENT GENE CRANE comes over to DOGGETT with the picture.)

AGENT GENE CRANE: How do you want this handled?

DOGGETT: I want you to put that on every TV station, post office, and fax machine in Arizona and the southwest. I want to make that face famous.



SCENE 11

(Things have gotten worse for MULDER. He is still on the evil table. It looks like a man, possibly smoking, is watching from an overhead window. The light pops on again. The nose and mouth probes are gone. He looks really nervous. Another mechanized arm lowers toward him. It looks like an appendage for a BattleBot. A circular blade at the end begins spinning. MULDER screams as it cuts deeply into his chest and belly. Quick cut to ...)

(SCULLY gasps and jerks awake and reacts as if something is hurting her midsection. She gets her breathing under control. SKINNER, driving the SUV along a desert road looks at her with concern.)

SKINNER: You better? I need some navigation.

SCULLY: (gets herself together and looks at the map) How to start looking for a 12-year-old kid in the middle of the Arizona desert. Well, there aren't a whole lot of choices.

SKINNER: We got a turnoff coming up in five miles. I take it or keep going straight?

SCULLY: Gibson Praise was last seen here at a power plant about 60 miles outside of Phoenix. But all the satellite data shows activity here about 100 miles to the north.

SKINNER: What's out there?

SCULLY: Well, according to this map... a whole lot of nothing.

(Overhead view of the car. The shadow of a helicopter passes beside them.)

(DOGGETT is a passenger in the helicopter. He receives a call from another agent on the ground.)

AGENT GENE CRANE: This is Special Agent Crane calling for task force leader.

DOGGETT: Yeah, this is John Doggett.

AGENT GENE CRANE: Just confirmed a location on this kid. He's at a school for the deaf in a place called Flemingtown. Little dot on the map about 90 miles from where I am now. I just talked to the school principal there.

DOGGETT: Is the kid in school now?

AGENT GENE CRANE: Yeah, he lives at the school.

DOGGETT: All right, have the principal take him out of class and put him someplace where he can keep an eye on him until we arrive.

AGENT GENE CRANE: Got it. Gonna take me an hour, an hour and 15 to get there.

DOGGETT: All right, well, I'm going to see if I can cut some time off that.

(He indicates a new direction to his pilot.)

(SKINNER and SCULLY have stopped at a gas station. Gas prices $1.89, $1.99, $1.49. SKINNER enters the station. SCULLY looks out into the desert. She intently studies a transparent mirage-like disturbance near a cliff. SKINNER gets back into the car.)

SKINNER: It's a school 20 minutes from here.

(As SKINNER pulls back onto the road, SCULLY's attention remains focused on the area near the cliff.)

(In a school building, a TEACHER is signing to students. The PRINCIPAL is on the phone.)

PRINCIPAL: (on phone) Yes, sir, in his science class. Is it important enough to take him away from his studies? I'll go and get him right now.

(The helicopter lands at Flemington School for the Deaf. Inside, the PRINCIPAL leads GIBSON PRAISE out of the classroom. As he walks out the door, GIBSON PRAISE looks back at a girl in the room, THEA SPRECHER. They look at each other for a moment, then GIBSON PRAISE follows the PRINCIPAL. Outside, DOGGETT gets out of the helicopter and enters the school. SKINNER and SCULLY's SUV is approaching.)

(We see GIBSON PRAISE looking out the window as DOGGETT arrives. He's pulled away by an unseen hand. DOGGETT rushes into the school and flashes his badge at the PRINCIPAL.)

DOGGETT: Where's the boy?

PRINCIPAL: You're just going to have to slow down and explain a few things to us before we let you...

(He cuts him off and starts heading for an open doorway.)

DOGGETT: Is he down there?

PRINCIPAL: He's in my office.

(DOGGETT runs down the hall. SCULLY and SKINNER enter.)

SCULLY: Hi. Um ... we're looking for a boy named Gibson Praise.

PRINCIPAL: Now who are you?

(DOGGET comes running back up the hall.)

DOGGETT: Kid went out the window. (notices SCULLY and SKINNER) What are you doing here?

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

DOGGETT: Trying to find Mulder.

(DOGGET runs outside as the rest of his task force arrives by car.)

DOGGETT: Kid's on the move. Spread out!

AGENT GENE CRANE: The kid's on the loose! You have the photo! Move!

(The AGENTS all move.)

(Behind the building, GIBSON PRAISE is walking quickly and nervously. A scar on his head is obvious. He rounds the corner of a building and stops. He looks up in fear at a tall man wearing a grey t-shirt. We can't see the man's face.)

(Very short time later. Alone behind the building, DOGGETT notices small foot prints. He follows them to the corner of the building, then sees them accompanied by a larger pair of footprints heading off into the desert. He follows.)

(Pan across desert mountain range.)

(At the edge of a cliff we hear and see GIBSON PRAISE being led by a tall man in a gray t-shirt.)

GIBSON PRAISE: Let me go! Let me go!

(DOGGETT catches up to them and holds his gun on the man.)

DOGGETT: Let the boy go! Let him go, Mulder!

(The man is MULDER, but his face is blank and expressionless.)

In Memoriam
JIM ENGH
1961-2000

(SPECIAL NOTE: Jim Engh was a valued member of the production crew; he sadly died after being electrocuted while filming for this episode on a scaffold tower. Six other crew members were hurt in the accident. It sounds like they were filming the scene where Scully finds her landlord on the fire escape.)

                       WITHOUT



SCENE 1

ANNOUNCER: (Chris Carter?) Previously on the X-Files...

(Under KERSH's line we see scenes from last week, SCULLY looking at herself in the mirror, SKINNER looking up at the UFO that took MULDER in Requiem, SKINNER and SCULLY in KERSH's office.)

KERSH: You and AD Skinner are the two primary witnesses to Mulder's disappearance. I want your statement taken ASAP.

SKINNER: Taken by who?

KERSH: My task force leader on this, Special Agent John Doggett.

(DOGGETT is sitting in the bullpen just as SCULLY turns over his badge to read his name.)

(SKINNER is talking to the LONE GUNMEN.)

SKINNER: Look, if we knew where that ship was going we've got a chance to find Mulder.

(CUT TO: MULDER screaming as the mouth drill penetrates his soft palate.)

(SCULLY is with the GUNMEN and SKINNER having her "revelation.")

SCULLY: It just came to me... why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona. They're looking to find the whereabouts of a boy named Gibson Praise.

(DOGGETT looks at the picture of GIBSON PRAISE that was slipped under his door.)

(GIBSON PRAISE walks into one of the schoolrooms.)

(In Arizona, DOGGETT's irritating aide, AGENT CRANE, is on the radio to DOGGETT.)

AGENT CRANE: We've just confirmed a location on this kid. He's at a school for the deaf in a place called Flemingtown.

(DOGGETT hears the report, then we see him hurriedly enter the school.)

DOGGETT: (to the PRINCIPAL) Keep an eye out the window. (notices SCULLY and SKINNER) What are you doing here?

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

DOGGETT: Trying to find Mulder.

(Outside, GIBSON PRAISE is walking quickly away from the building. As he rounds a corner he stops and looks up in fear at a tall man in a gray T-shirt. We cannot see them man's face.)



SCENE 2

(Under SCULLY's voiceover, camera pans over the nighttime desert. A bright light illuminates a spot on the ground. A slowly rotating angular aircraft beaming the light from its belly hovers above the ground, stops several yards from the sand, then the light goes out and the craft shimmers into invisibility.)

SCULLY: (voiceover) We live in a darkness of our own making... blind to a habitant world all but unseen by us. A world of beings traveling through time and space imaginable to us only as flights of fancy. Who are these beings we dare to imagine but fear to accept? What dark work goes on inside their impossible machines... cloaked from us by invisible forces? If they know our secrets, why can't we know theirs?

SCENE 3

(Camera pans across the desert. At the edge of a cliff we hear and see GIBSON PRAISE being led by a tall man in a gray T-shirt.)

GIBSON PRAISE: Stop it! Please! Let me go! Stop it! Let me go! Let me go!

(DOGGETT catches up to them and holds his gun on the man.)

DOGGETT: Let the boy go! Let him go, Mulder!

(The man is MULDER, but his face is blank and expressionless.)

DOGGETT: Let him go, or I will be compelled to use my weapon. Now, I don't want to do that, Agent Mulder. I don't want to shoot.

("MULDER" casually releases GIBSON PRAISE's arm. GIBSON PRAISE runs away. "MULDER" walks few steps toward the edge of the cliff. DOGGETT follows.)

DOGGETT: Now, are you armed? Come on, damn it. This is just stupid, Agent Mulder. Don't turn this into a movie. Just tell me if you've got a gun. It's too hot for this B.S. (no response) All right, then, lie down. Lie down on the ground. Keep your hands out. Lay down on your belly there.

("MULDER" looks at the ground then back at DOGGETT. DOGGETT stares at "MULDER" who looks coldly back at him. "MULDER" begins walking backward toward the cliff.)

DOGGETT: For crying out loud, what are you doing? Agent Mulder, stay there!

(DOGGETT lowers his gin and runs toward "MULDER." The man who appears to be MULDER deliberately and calmly falls off the side of the 100 foot cliff and plummets to the ground below. Shocked, DOGGETT runs to the edge and looks down. "MULDER" is lying motionless on the desert floor. DOGGETT's AGENTS, including the irritating aide, AGENT CRANE, come running toward him.)

DOGGETT: He went over! Over the edge!

AGENT CRANE: Who?

DOGGETT: Mulder.

(They look down. "MULDER" is lying far below, unconscious, his arm and who knows what else, badly broken. Close-up on him. His eyes open and he draws in a sudden breath.)

(Later, on the desert floor at the base of the cliff. DOGGETT and his agents are investigating the scene. They look a little confused.)

FEMALE AGENT: I have no explanation...

DOGGETT: Right, I'll talk to Scully. You guys head back to the school.

(An SUV pulls up beside the other trucks. SKINNER is driving. SCULLY gets out of the passenger side and walks up to DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: Where is he? Where's Mulder?

DOGGETT: I don't know.

SCULLY: You don't know? I heard an agent say over the radio that you saw him.

DOGGETT: Oh, yeah, I saw him. I saw him back right off that cliff there and I saw him fall right over there.

SKINNER: Then where is he?

DOGGETT: He's gone.

SKINNER: Come on, he can't be gone.

DOGGETT: Yeah, he can't be, but he is.

(SCULLY goes over to where DOGGETT indicated. SKINNER looks back up at the huge cliff behind them. Then at DOGGETT.)

SKINNER: That cliff there? He fell from there? It's impossible... a fall like that.

DOGGETT: A cop sees things. A man drops five stories, dusts his head off and goes back to work. An old lady gets shot point-blank in a Chinese restaurant, plucks the slug out of her egg foo yung. But even if Mulder survives this, what he does then is too much. You got your point of impact there where Agent Scully is standing... clear and identifiable. And a set of tracks here leading down to the wash. Look at these tracks. What do you see?

(SKINNER looks down at the tracks.)

DOGGETT: Mulder was running.

(SCULLY walks over to them.)

SCULLY: (confidently) It wasn't Mulder.

DOGGETT: That's the one thing I'm sure of.

SCULLY: It may have looked like Mulder, but it wasn't Mulder.

DOGGETT: I told you I knew Mulder. Okay, maybe I didn't know him that well. But I know who it was up there, and it was Fox Mulder.

SCULLY: I'm sure it did look like Mulder, and you have every reason to believe that it was him... but it was not Mulder. (she looks at SKINNER, then back to DOGGETT) I told you that I've seen things... things that I can't explain. Well, I have seen what looks like a man  transform into another man.

DOGGETT: What looks like a man, but who's not a man?

(SCULLY sighs and looks at SKINNER again.)

DOGGETT: So, what is he?

SCULLY: You don't want to know.

(SCULLY begins walking away.)

DOGGETT: He's not a man? What the hell is he? Hey, don't turn your back on me.

(DOGGETT's voice stops SCULLY and she turns back to him.)

DOGGETT: (reasonably) I'm asking you a legitimate question.

(SCULLY looks at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: He's alien.

(DOGGETT looks to SKINNER, then back to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: He's a bounty hunter.

DOGGETT: Looking to collect a bounty on...?

SCULLY: On Gibson Praise... because he's part alien. He's a human anomaly.

DOGGETT: So, this alien bounty hunter... he disguised himself as Mulder to come out here and grab the boy?

SCULLY: (avoiding eye contact) To take him back to his ship... where we believe Mulder is.

DOGGETT: You know, Agent Scully... you're, uh, you're starting to remind me a lot of Agent Mulder yourself.

(DOGGETT goes to his truck.)

SCULLY: Well then, you explain it to me.

(DOGGETT ignores her and leaves. SCULLY and SKINNER are left together.)

SKINNER: If it's true or possible, what you're saying-- that there's someone like this out there, this bounty hunter-- he could just become anyone. You, me, any damn one of us.

SCULLY: I think that it is true. And possible. And wherever Mulder is right now... he better damn well be smiling.

(She glances up at the sky, then walks away from SKINNER.)



SCENE 4

(Back at the Flemingtown School. All the teachers, faculty, and students are outside, surrounded by the FBI agents.

SECRETARY: Is this authorized?

(The fleet of SUVs pulls up. DOGGETT gets out of the passenger side of the lead vehicle.)

AGENT MOSLEY: Right. They're here.

DOGGETT: Any sign of him? Mulder?

AGENT CRANE: Not according to these people. We went through the school.

(Together, they look at the faculty and students. One of the students, THEA, looks back at them.)

DOGGETT: You're better than this.

AGENT CRANE: Sir?

DOGGETT: He's got to be here somewhere. Let's search the school again.

(Inside the school, "MULDER" enters an empty lab. He looks down at his broken arm. With his other arm he sets the broken arm correctly, then with a smile morphs into the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER. Nice cold-faced work by Duchovny. A moment later, DOGGETT enters the lab and discovers  )

DOGGETT: Hello?

( the PRINCIPAL of the school.)

DOGGETT: Sorry, I thought you were... I thought they cleared you out of here.

(The PRINCIPAL nods silently. AGENT CRANE enters.)

AGENT CRANE: Find something?

DOGGETT: (looking at the PRINCIPAL) No. Let's keep looking.

(DOGGETT and AGENT CRANE leave the room and join the team outside again. AGENT CRANE exits the building on the radio.)

VOICE ON RADIO: Administration building is clear.

AGENT MOSLEY: (on radio) Copy, check it again.

(SKINNER and SCULLY are together near the cars.)

SKINNER: What I want to know is how Doggett got out here. How did he even know where we were going?

SCULLY: I don't know. But he's going to turn this place upside down looking for the wrong person.

SKINNER: What happened to Gibson Praise?

SCULLY: Well, whatever happened to him, he's long gone. Wherever he is, he's three steps ahead of us.

(SKINNER nods to the girl, THEA, who is getting on a bicycle at the edge of the property. As she rides off, SKINNER looks at AGENT CRANE as he comes out of one of the doors of the building behind them.)

SKINNER: Don't look now but we've got a pair of eyeballs on us. Just start walking, I'll be right behind you.

(SCULLY and SKINNER walk around the corner of the building beside them. AGENT CRANE runs after them. As he round the corner, he finds only SKINNER. SKINNER firmly commands the man's attention. Scully is nowhere in sight.)

SKINNER: Can I talk to you for a minute?

(CUT TO: SCULLY is following THEA through the desert. Not bad for a fair woman with no water in 3-inch heels following a teenager on a bicycle. SCULLY loses sight of the girl. She stops, shades her eyes and looks around. She steps on something that makes her look down. It is flexible and echoey. She uncovers a sand covered wooden trapdoor with a rope. Inside the area beneath the trapdoor, SCULLY finds GIBSON PRAISE, sitting, and THEA.)

GIBSON PRAISE: (accusing) You shouldn't have come here.

GIBSON PRAISE: You shouldn't have come. You'll lead them to me.

SCULLY: I'm here to protect you, Gibson.

(SCULLY sighs deeply as she comes closer to the children.)

SCULLY: I know you know that's the truth. I know you know my thoughts.

GIBSON PRAISE: I know they took the man you work with  Mulder. And now, they've come to take me.

SCULLY: (coming closer, gentle) The only reason they want to take you, Gibson  is because you're a special boy. They want to take you because of what you are.

(THEA's voice is intelligible, but her pronunciation is that of someone who has been deaf all her life. She signs along with her words as she speaks to GIBSON PRAISE. There is an old Oklahoma license plate on the wall behind him - #00-0000.)

THEA: I'm sorry. I didn't know that someone was following me.

GIBSON PRAISE: My friend Thea knows. She's the only one at school I've told. She says the FBI is looking for me, too. She's afraid for me.

SCULLY: She has a right to be afraid. We don't know who to trust now.

(GIBSON PRAISE winces and looks down at his leg. SCULLY lifts the cloth covering the nasty wound.)

GIBSON PRAISE: I fell when I was running away.

SCULLY: I think you might have broken it, Gibson.

GIBSON PRAISE: If they find me, they'll take me. I know it. I've always known it.

SCULLY: I'm going to make you a splint, Gibson, okay? I can set your leg, but, uh... I'm going to need a car to get you out of here. (SCULLY rises and breaks off a couple of pieces of wood from a crate.) I'm going to come back for you. I promise. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you.

GIBSON PRAISE: You said that to me once before.

(Guilty, SCULLY looks away from him and begins splinting his leg.)



SCENE 5

(Bright lights. They are headlights. At the school. Night. DOGGETT is still directing the agents around him. Agents are getting into trucks and driving away, continuing the search for GIBSON PRAISE and MULDER. A cell phone rings. AGENT MOSLEY, a young efficient agent, answers it.)

AGENT MOSLEY: (on phone) Yeah?

(AGENT MOSLEY listens, then hands the phone to DOGGETT.)

AGENT MOSLEY: Deputy Director, for you.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah, this is John Doggett.

KERSH: (on phone) Agent Doggett, I'm getting reports from Arizona...

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yes, sir.

KERSH: (on phone) ...That you found Agent Mulder.

DOGGETT: (on phone) I'm afraid somebody jumped the gun on that. I saw him, sir, but I...

KERSH: (on phone, threatening) What do you mean, you saw him? What the hell is going on out there?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Well, we're 'round the clock here. I've got local SAR, a rolling ground cordon and an eye in the sky. We're on top of the situation.

KERSH: (on phone) How does the FBI find a man and then lose him in the middle of the desert? 'Cause I'd like to know. (pause) Agent Doggett, are you there?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah. I heard the question.

KERSH: (on phone) I put you in charge out there, Doggett. Now do the damn job.

(DOGGETT clicks the phone off dejectedly. He looks over at SKINNER, still dressed casually. SKINNER is, well, smirking. DOGGETT is offended.)

DOGGETT: This amuse you? I amuse you?

SKINNER: No. It just made sense to me. How you found your way out here. Who led you to Gibson Praise.

DOGGETT: You think I was spying on you?

SKINNER: No, but I think our new Deputy Director was. You're being made a pawn in a rigged game.

(DOGGETT looks at him a moment, then indicates for SKINNER to walk apart with him. Two manly-men talking about manly things.)

DOGGETT: All right, you've painted me the picture, now put it in a frame.

SKINNER: All right. You've got a good rep, Agent Doggett. You don't compromise, you don't quit. You're a damned good FBI agent-- best of the best. Lot of guys put you in the Director's chair one day. Which is why you've been set up to fail. There's no amount of search and rescue or rolling cordons or eyes in the sky that are going to turn up Mulder. It's just the wrong approach.

DOGGETT: It's not a question of approach. It's the only approach I got.

SKINNER: The only way you're going to find Mulder is to give into the truth. To listen to Scully. But even then... say you did find him, even then you lose. You put anything about aliens or UFOs or alien bounty hunters in your report... Kersh will ruin you. I'm betting that was his plan.

(Long pause. DOGGETT stares at SKINNER, then raises his voice to be heard by the five or so agents lounging around another truck.)

DOGGETT: Is Agent Scully here? Where's Agent Scully?

(AGENT MOSLEY snaps into action and pulls out his radio.)

AGENT MOSLEY: (on radio) I need someone who's with Agent Scully to put her on a radio. Someone... with Agent Scully.

(CUT TO: In the dormitory building, AGENT LANDAU looks around the agents around him. He sees a man come out of the bathroom.

AGENT MOSLEY: (voice on radio) Anyone got a twenty on Agent Scully? Is anyone out there with her?

(When AGNET LANDAU looks back toward the man walking toward him, he now sees SCULLY.)

AGENT LANDAU: (on radio) I'm with Agent Scully.

(CUT TO: Outside at the trucks.)

AGNET MOSLEY: Then who's this?

(MOSLEY looks up at someone walking toward them from the desert. It is SCULLY, looking tired. She did just spend a few hours in the desert.)

AGENT LANDAU: (voice on radio) Go for Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (reacting to the three men staring at her) What?

(DOGGETT doesn't take his eyes off of SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: Give me the radio.

(MOSELY hands DOGGETT the radio.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) You're with Scully?

(CUT TO: Dormitory. AGENT LANDAU is still with the WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY.)

AGENT LANDAU: (on radio) Right across the room from her.

(CUT TO: Outside with the trucks. SCULLY is suspicious.)

SCULLY: From who? From me? Where?

DOGGETT: (on radio) What room? Where are you?

(CUT TO: Dormitory.)

AGENT LANDAU: (on radio) Bunkhouse. We're in the dorm.

(CUT TO: Outside.)

SCULLY: Tell him to hold her. Tell them not to let her out of his sight!

(SCULLY begins running toward the building. The others follow.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Hold Scully. We're coming to you.

(CUT TO: Inside the dormitory. AGENT LANDAU approaches the WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY as she walks away from him.)

AGENT LANDAU: Agent Scully--

(The WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY grabs AGENT LANDAU by the neck. She only uses one hand. It looks pretty painful. He can't breathe and blood is drawn as he chokes. Her face shows no emotion, just like MULDER on the cliff earlier with GIBSON. She lets go and runs through the crowd of agents as SCULLY, DOGGETT and the others burst into the dorm.)

SCULLY: Hey!!

(They all chase the WOMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE SCULLY, catching only glimpses.)

SCULLY: There she is. Do you see her?

(SCULLY sees her go into the bathroom. As SCULLY runs to the door, she stops when she sees her reflection in the door mirror. She stares at herself for a moment. AGENT CRANE comes out of the room.)

SCULLY: Where did she go? Did you see her?

AGENT CRANE: No.

SCULLY: She ran right back here. I saw her.

(SCULLY looks back at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: You saw her.

(DOGGETT doesn't answer. SCULLY goes over to AGENT LANDAU who is wounded and gasping for breath on the floor. SCULLY begins trying to treat him.)

SCULLY: Agent... Can you breathe?

(AGENT LANDAU looks up at her and begins heavy panicked breathing. SCULLY backs away out of concern for the man.)

SCULLY: He thinks it was me. He thinks that I did this to him. (to DOGGETT) How is that possible?

(SCULLY looks around at everyone in the room.)

SCULLY: It's someone in this room.

(SCULLY walks away from them all. Camera focuses on THEA staring at someone. Cut to this person's hand covered in blood, then pan up to reveal that it is AGENT CRANE, DOGGETT's assistant. THEA, nervous, backs away and leaves the room.)



SCENE 6

(Shot of invisible alien ship in the desert. We see MULDER on the alien operating table through a blurred camera lens. His face is still stretched by the clamps. His eyes fly open.)

(CUT TO: GIBSON PRAISE waking up suddenly in the underground bunker.)

GIBSON PRAISE: (gasping) Mulder!

(GIBSON PRAISE gasps for breath.)



SCENE 7

(Siren wails as an ambulance arrives and AGENT LANDAU is wheeled out into it. DOGGETT watches. SCULLY watches, then head down, heads toward one of the trucks. SKINNER follows her.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully. Where are you going?

(SCULLY ignores him and gets into the truck and locks the door. SKINNER comes to the window.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

(SCULLY feels frantically under the floormat. SKINNER holds up the car keys for her to see.)

SKINNER: (calmly) Get out of the car.

(SCULLY looks at him, then gets out the passenger side.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully!

SCULLY: Who are you?

SKINNER: Who am I?

(SCULLY pulls her gun on SKINNER. A second later he pulls his on her.)

SCULLY: Drop your weapon and turn around.

SKINNER: I won't turn around.

SCULLY: Just do it! I know how it works-- kill shot to the back of the neck.

SKINNER: Scully, you're pointing your weapon at a friend.

SCULLY: Turn around, or I'm going to assume that you're not who you say you are.

SKINNER: Scully, it's me! Skinner!

(Long pause. SKINNER lowers his weapon and turns around.)

SKINNER: I can prove it. I know your secret-- who else knows it?

SCULLY: (still pointing the gun) Okay... then tell me.

SKINNER: You tell me. How do I know it's you?

(SKINNER suddenly turns and takes SCULLY's weapon from her hands. They both breathe heavily.)

SKINNER: I don't like pointing guns at pregnant women any more than I like them pointing guns at me.

(Tense moment, he hands her gun back to her.)

SKINNER: This has gone too far, Scully.

SCULLY: No. That's what's wrong here. It hasn't gone far enough. I need those car keys.

SKINNER: And what do you think you're going to do?

SCULLY: (tearing up) Look, we are being hampered here by the FBI, by John Doggett, by doubt, by our own mistrust. Whatever it is, it is working... as long as we let it.

SKINNER: You told me Mulder wouldn't allow it. Wouldn't let me ruin my career over this. Over him. But what about you, Scully? I mean, my god, you've got even more at stake.

(SCULLY's voice is cracking. She is barely holding back tears.)

SCULLY: I-I can't take the chance that I'm never going to see him again.

SKINNER: Mulder could just come walking out of the dark-- we don't know.

SCULLY: Look... we've got one last chance here waiting for us out there in the desert-- Gibson Praise. It may just be who gets to him first.

SKINNER: Get in the car. I'll drive.

(With SKINNER driving, they leave in the SUV. THEA(?) watches them go.)

(Later in the desert, flashlights in hand, SCULLY and SKINNER get out of the truck and go to the trapdoor.)

SCULLY: Gibson!

SKINNER: He's not down there.

SCULLY: I told him to stay here. He was supposed to stay here. (yelling) Gibson! (she sees something a few yards away) I found him.

(They run toward GIBSON PRAISE sitting on the desert floor staring at a section of the desert.)

SCULLY: Gibson. What are you doing out here? Why didn't you answer me, huh?

GIBSON PRAISE: (weakly) He's here. I hear him.

SCULLY: (glances up at SKINNER) What are you talking about?

GIBSON PRAISE: Mulder. He's somewhere out there.

(SCULLY feels his forehead.)

SCULLY: He's got a really bad fever. I think his leg might be infected.

SKINNER: All right, we got to get you to the hospital, okay, buddy?

GIBSON PRAISE: (to SCULLY) You're so close now.

(SKINNER has crossed over to GIBSON PRAISE and gently lifts the boy into his arms.)

SKINNER: I'll carry you. Put your arm around my neck. Watch your legs.

(As SKINNER heads back to the truck, he realizes SCULLY is not following. She is looking off into the desert.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: You take him to the hospital.

SKINNER: What about you?

(SCULLY doesn't answer or look back. SKINNER takes GIBSON PRAISE onto the truck.)



SCENE 8
MacLAREN REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER
12:48 AM

(SKINNER, still carrying GIBSON PRAISE, enters the emergency area of the hospital.)

SKINNER: I got a boy here who needs emergency medical attention.

(Hospital personnel place GIBSON PRAISE on a gurney.)

(Later, GIBSON PRAISE is resting in a hospital gown in a room. He is sleeping, but then his eyes fly open in panic. SKINNER approaches with concern.)

SKINNER: What? Are you okay? What's wrong?

(GIBSON PRAISE's focus is on the chairs outside the open door. SKINNER looks. No one is there.)

SKINNER: It's okay, Gibson, lie down. Lie down.

(GIBSON PRAISE's panic increases. When Skinner looks back at the door, THEA is there. She enters. Her face is cold and emotionless. GIBSON PRAISE looks at her in terror as she closes the door.)



SCENE 9

(Nighttime desert. SCULLY, alone, is walking across the sand, flashlight in hand. Mystical woman's chanting voice music from Within is playing.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(Her call is one of desperation. She wants an answer, but deep within she knows one is not forthcoming. She walks several more fruitless paces.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(No answer. She looks around. Nothing. She is alone. Despondent. Then, far above, she sees a bright light getting closer. She looks up it in hope and awe.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(More mystical chanting music.)

(SCULLY still looking up at the light. More mystical chanting music, then it blends into the sound of helicopter blades as we see that the light from the craft is not the flickering circular form we saw in the teaser, but the image of a police search light. The police helicopter lands, and DOGGETT gets out and crosses to SCULLY. She is bummed, to say the least but still defiant.)

SCULLY: For someone who claims he's not following me, you sure have a knack.

DOGGETT: Hey, you're where the action is.

SCULLY: What does that tell you? That I'm crazy or that I'm right?

DOGGETT: Wandering around in the desert in the dead of night, you call it.

SCULLY: You say you want to find Mulder but you won't do what it takes. You're afraid that I'm right.

DOGGETT: I'm not afraid of anything. Except that maybe Mulder's got even you believing in this crap now.

SCULLY: You've seen this crap for yourself now. How do you explain what took place today?

DOGGETT: Let me ask you something hypothetically. Now, if you were to find him out here or this ship or this alien bounty hunter, what would you do then?

SCULLY: I know what Agent Mulder would do. He'd do whatever it took.

DOGGETT: You mean lie. Like you've been lying to me. And flout orders like you've done every step of the way on this thing. Is that what it takes, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Give a little, get a little, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: You knew where the kid was, you knew where the kid was and you wouldn't tell me-- why?

SCULLY: What kid? I don't see any kid.

DOGGETT: You're lying to me again! Assistant Director Skinner took him from here to the hospital.

(Pause. She steps closer to him.)

SCULLY: How do you know that?

DOGGETT: There's one thing I know for sure in this case and that's that Mulder is after this boy Gibson Praise. Why? It beats the hell out of me. But when he goes after that kid, my men are going to be waiting for him.

SCULLY: Your men... followed Assistant Director Skinner?

(She sighs and begins walking back toward the helicopter. DOGGETT runs after her.)

DOGGETT: Hey, where you going? Agent Scully, where you going?

SCULLY: Your men are at the hospital?

DOGGETT: They got it controlled. Nobody goes in or out of that building without them knowing about it.

SCULLY: How do you know that they're your men?

(DOGGETT follows SCULLY. They get into the helicopter and it lifts off. As it does, we see the shimmering of the invisible UFO only a few feet away. Inside, MULDER is still on the evil table, fully conscious. Something is definitely over his crotch. He is apparently aware that SCULLY is nearby.)

MULDER: (yelling) Scully! Scully!



SCENE 10

(Inside the hospital. SCULLY and DOGGETT enter. Other agents are in the waiting area.)

SCULLY: Where's the boy?

AGENT CRANE: Door at the end of the hall, with AD Skinner.

SCULLY: Are you certain about that?

AGENT MOSLEY: Why don't you get yourself a visual in the exterior window. The night nurse has been checking the boy every 20 minutes-- he's fine.

AGENT CRANE: We have hospital personnel going about their business. We're just laying back, waiting for Mulder.

SCULLY: Yeah, every minute that you wait, that boy's in danger. He's exposed.

AGENT MOSLEY: No one's getting past us, Agent Scully. No one's gotten past us.

SCULLY: You believe that, Agent Doggett?

(Long moment as DOGGETT looks at SCULLY. Then, decisively, he crosses down the hall to GIBSON PRAISE's room. SCULLY follows, taking out her gun. DOGGETT looks at her questioningly.)

SCULLY: (sarcastically, yet serious) Hey, if something tries to rip your throat out, I got you covered.

DOGGETT: (knocking loudly at the door) A.D. Skinner... this is John Doggett.

(He opens the door. The room is empty.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is this? What the hell is going on?!

(SCULLY runs back out of the room toward the agents.)

SCULLY: There's no one in that room.

(SCULLY begins looking in other rooms and stairwells.)

SCULLY: I'm looking for a patient, a boy, 12 years old. He may still be in this building.

(In GIBSON PRAISE's room, DOGGETT's agents have joined him. DOGGETT looks at the window. He is clearly frustrated.)

DOGGETT: The window doesn't even open. How's a grown man and a boy get out of the room except by that door?

(DOGGETT looks up at the dropped ceiling.)

(SCULLY enters another room. The bathroom door opens. It is SKINNER.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully.

(SCULLY pulls her gun on him. They speak in hushed tones.)

SKINNER: It's okay, I've got him. Gibson.

SCULLY: How did you get here? How did you get him out of that room?

SKINNER: We went up through the ceiling. I don't know who to trust.

SCULLY: Where is he?

SKINNER: He's right here. They're going to find him.

(CUT TO: DOGGETT looking up under the dropped ceiling in GIBSON PRAISE's room. His flashlight finds an unconscious SKINNER, his eyes badly wounded.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY slowly crossing to where "SKINNER" has indicated. She sees GIBSON PRAISE through a window. He sees her and violently shakes his head. As she is about to react, "SKINNER" grabs her around the throat and flings her across the room where she crashes into a glass wall. GIBSON PRAISE runs into the room to help. He distracts "SKINNER" long enough for SCULLY to grab her gun and shoot him through the throat.

(Out in the hall, DOGGETT and his agents, guns drawn are approaching her location.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully!

(In the other room, "SKINNER" has fallen to the ground and (glasses and all) morphed into the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER as green fluid bubbles through the bullet wound. Then, as SCULLY and GIBSON PRAISE watch, he dissolves into toxic green fluid. DOGGETT and the other agents enter. He first looks at SCULLY, then at the nasty green fluid at his feet. Does he lose his first pair of shoes to green slime.)

DOGGETT: An agent needs help!

(He crosses to SCULLY and lifts her into his arms, resting her against his leg. She begins to cry, and embarrassed covers her eyes.)

DOGGETT: (yelling out the door) I said an agent needs help!

(SCULLY continues to cry, hand over her face. DOGGETT holds her as best he can. GIBSON PRAISE stand nearby. Only DOGGETT and GIBSON PRAISE stay with her as she cries.)



SCENE 11

(DOGGETT is in KERSH's office. KERSH is looking at hospital images from the case.)

KERSH: The best I can say is it's lucky it all happened at a hospital.

DOGGETT: Very lucky, yes, Sir.

KERSH: I assume the hazardous materials or chemicals which caused this must have been medical.

DOGGETT: That has not yet been determined, sir.

KERSH: So much here is undetermined... as remain the whereabouts of Mulder. But some of your  facts... like "a man falls from the cliff and disappears..." "An agent has his throat crushed by an assailant who vanishes into thin air." This reads like a piece of pot-boiled science fiction.

DOGGETT: You mean it reads like an X-File. But that's what you intended, wasn't it, Sir? When you assigned me to the case.

KERSH: I'll ask the questions, John. You just give me some damn answers. (hands him the file) Don't come back until you do.



SCENE 12

(SCULLY's hospital room. SCULLY, badly bruised, is asleep. She wakes up as a get- well card with rainbows and butterflies is placed in her hand. She looks at the card, then at DOGGETT sitting next to her.)

DOGGETT: My dad always said it's not who wins or loses... it's who takes the worst beating that counts.

SCULLY: That supposed to cheer me up?

DOGGETT: I thought so. But then I never did get to see your opponent.

SCULLY: And you never will. You still don't believe me.

DOGGETT: What I don't believe is how long they're keeping you here.

SCULLY: Oh, it's just some things they have to check out... make sure of.

DOGGETT: Well, I've got some things I thought you'd want checked out. A.D. Skinner is in stable condition, resting comfortably and awaiting diagnosis and further study. Ditto Agent Landau, his throat. Gibson Praise is right now a ward of the state but I asked for special protections, as I assumed you would yourself.

SCULLY: What are you doing here, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Keeping you apprised of the case.

SCULLY: That's not your job.

DOGGETT: It is, actually. And officially. I'm... assigned now to the X-Files.

(SCULLY does not take this well. DOGGETT looks down and begins to leave the room.)

DOGGETT: Whatever you and I may differ on, I'll find him, Agent Scully.

(With SCULLY staring after him, DOGGETT exits.)

(CUT TO: MULDER lying on the very uncomfortable table. As the camera pans around him, we see six ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTERs with stoic expressions step up to surround him.)

[THE END]

                                PATIENCE


SCENE 1
BURLEY, IDAHO
3:08 AM

(Dark and stormy night. Creepy music. An older (1950s?) style car, looks like a hearse, pulls up in front of an even older spooky old rural house with a weathervane in the shape of a bat, pointed west. An even older (late 60's) dour-looking gentleman, TALL GEORGE, gets out of the car. He is dressed in a suit. Sound of thunder. He goes up the porch steps and enters the house. Sound of creaking steps as he makes his way through the dark house.)

QUICK CUT TO:

(Upstairs: an ELDERLY WOMAN in bed hears the creaking and wakes up suddenly. She gasps for breath.)

ELDERLY WOMAN: Land sakes, George, what are you trying to do?

(He opens the bedroom door.)

TALL GEORGE: (very deep voice) I was trying to be quiet.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Quiet? I smelled you on the stairs. 39 years, I'm still surprised that embalming fluid of yours doesn't wake the dead.

TALL GEORGE: (morbidly) Didn't wake old Zeke McPherson tonight, God rest his soul.

ELDERLY WOMAN: Well, you go outside and take those clothes of yours off so I can rest mine.

(He smiles and pauses.)

ELDERLY WOMAN: George!

TALL GEORGE: (resigned) I'm going, Tahoma, I'm going.

(Reluctantly, TALL GEORGE goes back downstairs and out onto the porch. He begins removing his suit. Just as he drops his trousers, he notices something above him.)

TALL GEORGE: What the hell? What the hell is that?

(Thunder crashes and a flash of lightening illuminates a figure hanging from the porch rafters. The eyes of the human-like, bat-like creature open. TALL GEORGE steps back in horror, but is tripped up by the pants around his ankles. The BAT THING flies at him and he begins screaming.)

CUT TO:

(TAHOMA, GEORGE's wife in bed. She hears the sounds and gets out of bed and goes out to the porch to investigate.)

TAHOMA: George?

(Sounds of the BAT THING growling and feeding. She recoils in horror at the sight of the BAT THING's bloody feast. She screams as it turns and attacks her. On the roof, the weathervane swings in the wind.)

SCENE 2

(X-Files office. Sad music. SCULLY is alone. She picks up and holds MULDER's desk nameplate thoughtfully. Just as she is about to put it away in the middle desk drawer, she hears male voices cheerfully making their way down the hall.)

MALE AGENT 1: (voice) So, this is where the bad kids are banished to.

MALE AGENT 2: (voice) Put me down here I'd probably cook up a lot of crazy ideas, too.

(Sound of the men laughing. They come around the corner into the doorway, DOGGETT leading. They stop when they see SCULLY. Uncomfortable pause. DOGGETT is holding a cup of coffee. He wasn't expecting to see her.)

SCULLY: Good morning.

DOGGETT: Morning. (to the men) Um... I'll catch you guys later.

(The other two leave silently. DOGGETT joins SCULLY in the office.)

DOGGETT: Some friends... they're just curious.

SCULLY: I'm not here to be a curiosity, Agent Doggett. I'm here to work.

DOGGETT: I am, too, Agent Scully. I've been here all weekend and early this morning went over every X-File in the cabinet there. Just left to get some coffee.

(He holds up his Styrofoam cup. SCULLY blinks, perhaps a little surprised.)

SCULLY: Well... do you have any questions?

DOGGETT: (understatement) Just a few. Maybe first you could tell me where your area is here and uh. where mine's going to be.

SCULLY: This is my partner's office, Agent Doggett. You and I will just be using it for a while.

(Pause while she sets MULDER's nameplate down firmly on the desk. DOGGETT gets the message.)

DOGGETT: So, where do we get started?

(SCULLY starts the slide projector. DOGGETT turns out the overhead light. Blocking- wise, the rest of the scene plays identical to the office scene in The Pilot 1x79, except this time, SCULLY is running the projector. First slide is probably of TALL GEORGE. We can't see it.)

SCULLY: Homicides: Two  in Idaho. White male, 62, undertaker by profession, he was killed on his front porch about ten feet away from his wife.

(She advances the projector to the next slide.)

DOGGETT: Holy god.

(It is a close-up of TALL GEORGE's face and neck, torn and bloody. DOGGETT winces as he examines it.)

SCULLY: Cause of death was blood loss from numerous deep wounds  from bites. Any thoughts, any questions?

(DOGGETT walks closer to the image.)

DOGGETT: "Bites"?

SCULLY: On his head torso and hands. Two of his fingers are missing... eaten off.

(SCULLY seems to enjoy "testing" DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: By what, an animal?

SCULLY: These were murders. The, uh, bites on his wife appear to be human.

(She advances to the slide of the dead woman.)

DOGGETT: (disturbed) I've seen some violent crimes, I mean, some seriously screwed up stuff, but, uh... this is extreme. Is there demonstration of motive?

SCULLY: Not according to local P.D.

DOGGETT: Is there any pattern, uh  ritual or anything?

(SCULLY shakes her head.)

DOGGETT: I have to admit, Agent Scully, I'm at a loss.

SCULLY: Well, that's a good place to start.



SCENE 3
BURLEY, IDAHO
11:18 AM

(TALL GEORGE's house. Hearse is still in the driveway. Full crime investigation underway. SCULLY and DOGGETT [DOGGETT driving] pull up in their blue Idaho rental car and get out. They are met by the Detective in charge. DETECTIVE YALE ABBOTT is a large red-haired man.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: You the folks from the FBI?

SCULLY: Yeah.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Yale Abbott, Cassia County Sheriff's.

SCULLY: Hi. Agent Scully. This is Agent Doggett.

(DETECTIVE ABBOTT shakes SCULLY's hand politely, then turns his back on her, focusing all of his attention on the manly man, DOGGETT. If it were MULDER with her, this would not seem odd. SCULLY shifts uncomfortably, and looks around his shoulder.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: We like to think we can handle our own problems around here but a couple hotshots up in the county seat seem to think this is beyond us. Not that we don't appreciate your coming out all this way to give us a hand.

DOGGETT: Well, I hope we can. I have to admit I'm a little baffled by what I've seen.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Oh, really?

SCULLY: Understand, Detective, that we've seen cases like yours regularly on our unit. Agent Doggett has only just been assigned to the X-Files.

(DETECTIVE ABBOTT turns to her, his attitude condescendingly polite.)

SCULLY: I can assure you that there's nothing baffling about human bite marks.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Well, that's just what I was getting around to, ma'am. We're not so sure now that these bites are human.

(He leads them up to the porch.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: The bodies were discovered by neighbours, so there was contamination of the general crime scene. My boys did a real damn good job of separating the various shoe prints and pulling these. Come on over.

(He shows them a dusted animal-like footprint with four toes.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Right there, see that?

DOGGETT: What is it?

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: It's not human, I know that.

SCULLY: It's not quite animal, either.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: There's only four toes.

SCULLY: That's not an unheard of birth defect. Uh, no more rare than polydactylism.

(Both men look at her, then at each other.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: What did she just say?

DOGGETT: I assume she means it could be human.

(DOGGETT looks to SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: Is that a fair assumption?

(SCULLY stands, as do the men. She is irritated.)

SCULLY: I say that assumption is the problem here. A strange print is found and immediately the most important piece of evidence is just thrown out to try and force an explanation. Maybe this print can help explain those bite marks.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: How?

SCULLY: I'm not quite sure yet.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: (sarcastically to DOGGETT) She's not quite sure yet.

(DOGGETT doesn't like DETECTIVE ABBOTT's tone, but is reluctant to defend SCULLY too strongly.)

DOGGETT: Well, I have to say I've worked a lot of homicides but if the victims laid out here for any time at all in a setting like this, it'd be pretty remarkable if they didn't attract animals.

(Pause.)

SCULLY: (quietly frustrated) I think that post-mortem predation is definitely a consideration here, but I only see one print and if it were an animal there would be numerous prints all over here and in the yard.

(They turn to the deputies and technicians standing in the yard. Sheepishly, the DEPUTIES look down at their feet and begin carefully stepping aside, searching for any clues they may have inadvertently contaminated.)

SCULLY: You agree, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: I'm going to go take a look around.

(DOGGETT goes into the house. While DETECTIVE ABBOTT speaks, SCULLY looks up at the porch rafters. One of the beams is deeply scored as if by large claws.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: You know I got two old folks in the morgue mauled beyond recognition. I have no motive to go on, no intent. There's not one shred of evidence that cries out for a human explanation, yet you stand there telling me flat out that what we're looking for is a man. Thanks for everything, Agent Scully. We'll take it from here.

(He starts to leave.)

SCULLY: I'm sure your explanation will mollify all those hotshots down at the county seat, Detective and relieve any general anxiety about what this thing might be  but only until it strikes again. And one more thing: I never said that what you're looking for is a man.

(He leaves. DOGGETT calls to SCULLY from inside the house.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

(She joins him at the foot of the stairs.)

DOGGETT: Is that a second print?

(On the bottom step is another footprint like the one on the porch.)

SCULLY: It could be but I'm not sure if it tells us anything.

DOGGETT: Well, maybe there's no prints in the yard because whatever made these didn't go through the yard. It came through the house.

SCULLY: Well, if anything, I'd say this print leads up the stairs.

(DOGGETT goes upstairs and looks under the bed.)

DOGGETT: Think I've got another partial here.

(Really interesting shot from under the bed of DOGGETT crouching and SCULLY from the knees down as she steps beside him.)

DOGGETT: You know, there is a more obvious explanation.

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

DOGGETT: The more basic answer is what we're dealing with here is simply a man. A psychotic killer with a deformed foot. You're familiar with the principle of Occam's Razor?

SCULLY: Yeah. You take every possible explanation and you choose the simplest one. Agent Mulder used to refer to it as "Occam's Principle of Limited Imagination."

SCULLY: Unless you have a simple explanation as to how a killer with a deformed foot leaves a print only every 25 feet.

DOGGETT: No.

SCULLY: Or to what he'd even be doing up here.

DOGGETT: I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out just like you are.

(DOGGETT tries to open the bedroom window. It is painted shut. SCULLY goes into the small closet. All dark suits and white shirts. She looks up.)

SCULLY: (softly) Agent Doggett.

(He joins her in the closet. They both look up at the open hatch to the attic. Creepy music. DOGGETT gets a chair. SCULLY stands on it, then he boosts her up into the attic.)

SCULLY: Dark up here.

DOGGETT: What do you see? Agent Scully?

(DOGGETT stands under the hatch making no move to join her in the dark attic. He looks a little nervous. Very funny.)

SCULLY: Right now, not a heck of a lot.

(DOGGETT hauls his manly self up into the attic with her. SCULLY is looking at a partially shaded window. She tries to open the shade, but it doesn't cooperate.)

SCULLY: If there was anything up here it might have gone out that window.

(DOGGETT pulls a small Mag-Lite out of his pocket and turns it on.)

DOGGETT: You ever carry one of these?

SCULLY: (pause, dryly) Never.

(They both begin looking around the attic. DOGGETT spots two mutilated fingers on an old table. They are slimy, bloody, and in the shape of a vee.)

DOGGETT: "V" for victory.

SCULLY: What?

DOGGETT: You said the male victim was missing two fingers? Well, how did the fingers get up here?

(SCULLY looks at the fingers and reacts to the smell.)

SCULLY: Well, from their smell, I'd say they were regurgitated. Recently.

DOGGETT: By what?

(SCULLY looks up at the attic rafters and sees some deep gouges in the wood.)

SCULLY: I saw those on the porch, too.

DOGGETT: Looks like, to me... I don't know. Like it was... it was...

SCULLY: Hanging there?



SCENE 4
MCKESSON RESIDENCE
3: 18 PM

(A LITTLE OLD LADY, MRS. MCKESSON opens the attic window of her house and picks up an old photo album, dusts it off, and sits down to look through it. The name "Ariel" is on the front of the album. She sobs sadly as she looks at the baby pictures on the first page. Unfortunately, also in the attic with her is the BAT THING. It is hanging from a rafter. Its eyes open. MRS. MCKESSON gasps as she hears it growl. It flies at her and she screams.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 5
CASSIA COUNTY MORGUE

(SCULLY dressed in scrubs pulls a sheet over the body of TALL GEORGE and takes off her latex gloves. She looks tired.)

DOGGETT: You're still here.

SCULLY: Yeah. Well, I was waiting for some lab results and then I wanted to take another look at the body.

DOGGETT: Why? What did you find?

SCULLY: Nothing that will allay anyone's fears about what killed this man or his wife.

DOGGETT: "What"? You mean "who" killed them.

SCULLY: Well, to be honest, what I found here leans more towards an animal explanation. The, uh, scratches on the body match the four-toed prints that we found. And the bites have fang-like tears. What I thought were marks left by human molars are now inconclusive because of enzymes that were found in the bites which are clearly inhuman- - anticoagulants which  are found solely in the saliva of bats.

DOGGETT: Bats.

SCULLY: Yeah. I can't exactly explain it but I realize that I owe the Detective an apology.

(SCULLY looks like she would rather eat her own toenail clippings before apologizing to DETECTIVE ABBOTT.)

DOGGETT: Well, I'm not so sure about that. Montana headline circa 1956. The story's the same as what you told me.

(He shows her an old newspaper. The Montana Press Telegram. "Hunters kill Human Bat!" Three men are proudly holding a dead BAT THING creature between them as they might hold a deer.)

SCULLY: (reading) "The creature was taken to the county coroner who confirmed it was neither man nor animal."

DOGGETT: Two days later, the county coroner was disemboweled by something with sharp teeth and four-toed claws. Something that ate several body parts and regurgitated them elsewhere.

SCULLY: Did they ever find it?

DOGGETT: Five men died or disappeared and then the killing stops. Doesn't say why. But 44 years later it appears that it's back and killing again.

CUT TO:

(MCKESSON attic. MRS. MCKESSON lies dead and bloody. With a growl, the BAT THING hops into view and snarls menacingly, then hops out of frame again.)



SCENE 6
MCKESSON RESIDENCE
5:51 PM

(Later that day. DETECTIVE ABBOTT's team and DOGGETT and SCULLY are investigating the attic. Latex gloves on hands, [definitely not Mulder!] DOGGETT examines deep scratches on the window sill. DETECTIVE ABBOTT joins him.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: You see those marks, right? And the ones over here on the rafter?

(DOGGETT looks at similar marks on the rafter.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: If you ask me, those look like claw marks. I don't care what kind of a savage he is, what did this isn't human.

DOGGETT: Well, if I may speak for Agent Scully, I think we're both prepared to concede that point, Detective.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Then you know what this thing is?

DOGGETT: I've got a newspaper article I want to show you.

(SCULLY is coming up the attic stairs.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett...

DOGGETT: (pulling out the article) A rather strange account from 1956

SCULLY: I found something. A photo album. I think it's our first break on this case.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: What is it?

(SCULLY has the photo album that MRS. MCKESSON was looking at. It is bagged in plastic.)

SCULLY: The victim's daughter-- Ariel-- her dead body was pulled from the river here last week.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: I got that call. Had to come tell Mrs. McKesson the bad news. You trying to say there's some kind of connection?

SCULLY: Well, you not only told her mother that her 62-year-old daughter was dead but that her body had been horribly and inexplicably burned. A daughter who, by the way, she hadn't even seen in over 40 years. Since 1956, to be exact-- which is the date your article says those first killings started.

(DOGGETT glances at his newspaper article.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Do you see the connection?

DOGGETT: I'm not, uh... sure where you're going with this, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: The daughter is the connection.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: How is that?

SCULLY: I don't know exactly but these killings only started up since her burned body has been found.

(DETECTIVE ABBOTT stares at SCULLY in disbelief.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Honest to god. You just jump at whatever explanation is the wildest and most far-fetched, don't you?

SCULLY: Well, I suggest that you jump at it, too because her body may have been burned for a reason and you're going to want to exhume it in order to find out why.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: You want me to dig up a dead body when I have real people out there whose lives are in real danger?

DOGGETT: Hey...

(DOGGETT steps between DETECTIVE ABBOTT and SCULLY. He speaks softly to DETECTIVE ABBOTT. DETECTIVE ABBOTT doesn't looks pleased, but he glances from DOGGETT to SCULLY, then leaves without a word. SCULLY watches him go, then turns her attention to DOGGETT. She is not happy.)

SCULLY: What did you say to him?

DOGGETT: (uncomfortable, avoiding eye contact) Well, I told him to dig up the body. Isn't that what you wanted?

SCULLY: What else did you say to him?

DOGGETT: Well, I told him that you were  um  a... leading authority on paranormal phenomena and who are we to argue with an expert.

SCULLY: Look, I am not an expert. I am a scientist who happens to have seen a lot. I am just making a leap here.

DOGGETT: Well, I am sure you have your reasons.

SCULLY: Look, so, so, what, you told him to exhume the body when you don't even necessarily believe me yourself?

(DOGGETT sighs.)

DOGGETT: I told you I spent the weekend looking through that cabinet full of X-Files and I saw how pretty much every X-File broke-- with a leap. Now, maybe I'm just an old- fashioned cop but I don't take leaps. In my experience leaps only get people killed.

SCULLY: Well, I'd say that you're taking a pretty big leap believing in that article... about a human bat.

(She looks at him directly. He nods and walks away.)



SCENE 7

(Unknown location. Old barn-type of building full of small bats. A man with kerchief almost completely covering his face enters. He is carrying a small wire cage. He walks over to where several small bats are hanging upside down. They squeal as he grabs two of them and gently places them in the cage. He leaves the barn and goes to a nearby rustic cabin and enters. He closes the front door on which is nailed the body of a dead bat.)



SCENE 8
CASSIA COUNTY CEMETERY
10:23 PM

(Foggy graveyard. Night. Spooky. DETECTIVE ABBOTT pulls up near a gravesite where two GRAVEDIGGERS are removing a coffin. He gets out his car and goes to them.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: I don't know how you do it. Called the judge's order in a half ago. You guys are fast.

GRAVEDIGGER 1: Yep, we're really fast when someone's done most of our work.

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: What are you talking about?

GRAVEDIGGER 1: (spits) We got out here, somebody had already dug up the box. All we had to do was haul it out. I don't know what they were using but they scratched up the wood on the lid real good. See?

(The lid of the coffin is deeply gouged.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: Let's get this down to the morgue. I think the sooner, the better.

(The GRAVEDIGGERS carry the coffin to their truck, load it in, then drive away. DETECTIVE ABBOTT continues to look around. He notices something in a large hole of a tree trunk. It is the BAT THING. The BAT THING opens its eyes and looks at DETECTIVE ABBOTT.)

DETECTIVE ABBOTT: God!

(DETECTIVE ABBOTT begins running away. The BAT THING launches itself after him  a single leap carrying it several yards. It lands on DETECTIVE ABBOTT and begins attacking. DETECTIVE ABBOTT screams and manages to get away for a moment, but the BAT THING's next leap catches him again and we hear DETECTIVE ABBOTT screaming and the BAT THING feeding. That's what happens when you mess with Scully, bud.)



SCENE 9
1:07 AM

(Morgue. SCULLY, in scrubs, watches as DETECTIVE ABBOTT's body is wheeled in. CLOCK INDICATES THAT IT IS 1:07 AM. She looks up as DOGGETT enters. The SHERIFF'S DEPUTY sticks his head in and addresses DOGGETT.)

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY: I want a word with you.

(DOGGETT glances at SCULLY, then follows the SHERIFF'S DEPUTY into a room with several other deputies. They look rather hostile.)

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY: Look, we listened to you. The Detective listened to you. We could have been out hunting this thing down, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: You should be doing that now.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY: Now? Now's too late for the Detective, isn't it? Look, we don't need you telling us what to do or your partner. She's the one responsible for this.

DOGGETT: Nobody's responsible for this except for whatever did it.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY: Look, I don't care who she is or what she is, she's not touching that body. We don't need her far-out theories. She's not welcome here.

(The DEPUTIES leave the room. DOGGETT rejoins SCULLY in the morgue.)

SCULLY: What happened to the lynch mob?

DOGGETT: You hear all that?

SCULLY: I heard enough.

DOGGETT: Things have taken a little turn.

(He pulls the sheet over the body.)

SCULLY: I don't think so, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Well, you can think what you want but I think this looks bad for the FBI.

SCULLY: It was unavoidable.

DOGGETT: How do you figure that?

(SCULLY uncovers a badly burned female body on another table.)

SCULLY: This is the body pulled from the river. She died of natural causes-- congestive heart failure-- but her body was only burned afterwards.

DOGGETT: By who, and why burn it?

SCULLY: Well, obviously to cover something up.

DOGGETT: Yeah, but what?

SCULLY: That's what I still don't know.

DOGGETT: Look, we know what we're looking for. We should be out there looking for it. We're not going to catch it standing here speculating.

SCULLY: Look, it kills like an animal, but with purpose. It stalked the detective for the same reason that it stalked the old woman and the undertaker. Each of those victims had had contact with this burnt body. The undertaker prepared it. Her mother ID'd it and the Detective got the call when she was found.

DOGGETT: Well, who else would have had contact with it?

SCULLY: The, uh, man who found her in the river. (looks at the file) A, uh, Myron Stefaniuk.

DOGGETT: Stefaniuk?

SCULLY: Yeah.

DOGGETT: One of the hunters in the photo in 1956 was Ernie Stefaniuk.

SCULLY: There's an address in his file. I hope we're not too late.



SCENE 10
SLADE RIVER
6:58 AM

(An old man, MYRON STEFANIUK, is kneeling beside the riverbank hauling in a rope/raft contraption between the main shore and the shore of an island in the middle of the river. He stops and stands as DOGGETT and SCULLY pull up beside him and get out of their car.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Stefaniuk?

SCULLY: Myron Stefaniuk?

(MYRON STEFANIUK looks at them warily.)

MYRON STEFANIUK: That's me.

(SCULLY looks relaxed. DOGGETT, being the manly man he is, has one hand resting casually on his gun.)

SCULLY: (relieved sigh) Good. Sorry. You gave us a bit of a scare. We went to your home up the road and we couldn't find you.

MYRON STEFANIUK: Why would that scare you?

DOGGETT: Well, sir, we work with the FBI and we have reason to believe that your life may be in danger.

MYRON STEFANIUK: I'm in danger?

SCULLY: Well, we're investigating some murders, sir, that we believe may be connected to the burnt body that you found recently.

MYRON STEFANIUK: I fished it out of the river. What have I got to do with anything?

DOGGETT: Well, we're not saying for sure that you do.

SCULLY: It may just be your connection to the body.

MYRON STEFANIUK: There is no connection. I just fished it out of the river.

SCULLY: Well, sorry, sir, but that may be enough.

MYRON STEFANIUK: It's nonsense. Leave me alone.

DOGGETT: Ernie Stefaniuk. Lived in Montana in 1956. Do you know him?

(This stops MYRON STEFANIUK. He slowly turns back to them.)

MYRON STEFANIUK: Ernie was my brother.

DOGGETT: He was one of three hunters that killed a man that was half animal.

MYRON STEFANIUK: Please! That was a long time ago.

DOGGETT: Do you know where we can find him to talk with him, sir?

MYRON STEFANIUK: My brother's dead. That thing killed him.

DOGGETT: Well, I have a newspaper story that says your brother disappeared.

MYRON STEFANIUK: That was 40 years ago. Leave it alone! Leave me alone!

(Upset, MYRON STEFANIUK gets into his old pickup and drives away.)



SCENE 11
4:28 PM

(Later, SCULLY and DOGGETT are sitting in their car watching MYRON STEFANIUK through binoculars. He is filling five gallon gas cans from a tank in his yard with a plastic siphon.)

SCULLY: You know, we've been out here for nine hours. The only thing this man seems to be in danger of is terminal loneliness.

(DOGGETT chuckles at her joke.)

SCULLY: (depressed) Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is all just a... a grand coincidence and we're wasting our time out here.

DOGGETT: You were so sure before.

SCULLY: Yeah, I was sure of the facts as I had deduced them scientifically. Maybe I'm... I'm trying to force them into shape. Maybe I'm manufacturing a theory.

DOGGETT: Well, what happened to taking a leap?

SCULLY: Maybe I'm just trying too hard.

DOGGETT: To do what? To be Mulder?

(She thinks seriously about that.)

DOGGETT: You know, I'm not Oxford educated. About all I know about the paranormal is men are from Mars and women are from Venus. But I don't think you're wrong, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: What makes you say that?

DOGGETT: Well, I'm no Fox Mulder, but I can tell when a man's hiding something. Myron Stefaniuk fishes a woman out of the river who's been gone for 40 years. He has a brother he hasn't seen in over 40 years. A brother who just happened to hunt down some kind of creature over 40 years ago.

SCULLY: Well, what does he have to hide?

DOGGETT: Well, that's what I'm hoping this good cop work is going to show us.

(SCULLY raises her binoculars again. Inside the barn, MYRON STEFANIUK loads the last of the gas cans into the back of his truck which full of other supplies also. He closes and locks the tailgate, then pushes the large sliding doors of the barn open. As he gets into the truck, starts the engine and drives away, the camera pans up to show the BAT THING hanging from the rafter. It's eyes open.)

(Short time later, MYRON STEFANIUK places the gas cans on the raft and begins hauling them across to the island in the middle of the river.)



SCENE 12
BIRD ISLAND
9:17 PM

(Night. DOGGETT is rowing a small boat toward the island. SCULLY is in the stern of the boat, flashlight in hand.)

DOGGETT: You there!

SCULLY: Stop right there!

(The MASKED MAN we saw earlier collecting bats has been getting supplies from the raft. He runs back into the woods.)

SCULLY: I see him.

(Gun out, SCULLY leaps out of the boat and follows. DOGGETT is a few steps behind and has to splash through the water.)

SCULLY: Stop where you are! Put your hands up and out! Now, turn around, slowly.

DOGGETT: Are you Ernie Stefaniuk? Are you Ernie Stefaniuk?

MASKED MAN: (terrified, gasping) Yeah.

(DOGGETT pulls down the mask. The old bearded man turns away from the light.)

(Later, they are in his cabin. DOGGETT looks at the bat nailed to the door.)

ERNIE STEFANIUK: How's a man supposed to live when his fear becomes obsession? You'd do the same thing. Who wouldn't who wanted to live?

DOGGETT: You never left the island?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: 44 years-- I wouldn't dare knowing it was out there. That it could come back for me.

DOGGETT: You know something about it? About what this thing is?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: I know on the evolutionary ladder bats are real close by the apes and just as we came from the apes so might a man, sprung from a bat. To live and hunt like a bat but with the cold-blooded vengeance of a man.

SCULLY: Even if that were true, sir, how could it possibly find you out here on an island?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: I needed to cut off all contact. Communication could be only one-way. My brother helped me. (holding back tears) And then there was my wife.

DOGGETT: It was her body your brother pulled in.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: (crying) She gave up everything to be with me. I forbade her to tell her mother. 44 years on six acres of island, she made only one demand. To be buried in consecrated earth. She was a Catholic her whole life. (breaks down crying)

(SCULLY and DOGGETT look at each other.)

SCULLY: Mr. Stefaniuk... it's killed four people. All of whom would have had traces of your scent through various degrees of contact with your wife's body.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: My brother?

DOGGETT: Your brother's okay, Ernie.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: But he had contact with Ariel's body. It'll come after him, too.

SCULLY: He's all right. We spoke with him earlier today.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: Today? Today, he might have been fine but this thing hunts likes a bat. It only attacks at night.

(DOGGETT and SCULLY look at each other. They both start for the door.)

DOGGETT: Stay here. Stay with him.

(SCULLY looks reluctant, but she stays. Manly man leaves.)

(DOGGETT goes back down to the boat and picks up the oar floating in the water. The BAT THING jumps out of the woods and lands on DOGGETT. It screams as they wrestle in the water. DOGGETT manages to fight it off in a frenzy of water and wings, but then he sinks under the water, unconscious.)

(Inside the cabin. SCULLY and ERNIE STEFANIUK wait. SCULLY is looking out the window.)

ERNIE STEFANIUK: I still don't understand.

SCULLY: What's that?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: How'd you find me out here?

SCULLY: We followed your brother.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: No, I mean who figured it out?

SCULLY: I was sure that what we were looking for was something other than a man. Uh, the detective who was running the case didn't believe that, and...uh,  he's dead.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: But your partner, he believed it?

SCULLY: I think he does now.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: So it was you who figured it.

(SCULLY is not comfortable taking the credit for this.)

SCULLY: Well, I  I made the connections but it was Agent Doggett that got us out here.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: You ought to be wishing he hadn't.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: The moment you stepped foot here... You're marked now, you know that.

SCULLY: Sir, I'm here to protect you.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: And how are you going to do that? You thought of everything... Except that.

SCULLY: Well, this thing, Mr. Stefaniuk is  uh  still flesh and blood. It can be killed.

ERNIE STEFANIUK: What do you think? It's just going to come walking through the door, there? It's waited 44 years. It'll wait out there as long as it takes until you can't stand it anymore. How long can you wait, huh? A lifetime? To live in fear like this, a young woman-- are you prepared to sacrifice family, children and spend your life terrorized by a monster?

(A loud beeping sounds from a monitor on the table. They move toward it. It displays a radar sweep.)

SCULLY: What is that?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: (nervous) It's ground radar. The sensor's set at ten feet high. Anything big enough to set it off is coming in through the trees.

(They hear a thumping on the roof. SCULLY draws her gun and points it at the roof. She fires through the roof nine times, then five more times.)

SCULLY: You hear it?

ERNIE STEFANIUK: No.

(SCULLY puts a new clip in her gun.)

SCULLY: Maybe I got it. Maybe I killed it.

(She opens the door and looks out. She sees nothing.)

SCULLY: If you've got a gun, get it.

(She closes the door and goes outside and looks up at the roof. She sees nothing.)

(Inside the cabin, ERNIE STEFANIUK loads an old shotgun with shaking hands. He starts as a stick of firewood rolls out of the fireplace. He looks at the fireplace in terror.)

(Outside, SCULLY continues to look around.)

(Inside, ERNIE STEFANIUK, slowly peers up the chimney. He sees nothing and steps back. He turns to the BAT THING right behind him.)

(Outside, SCULLY hears him scream and sees a shotgun blast explode through the roof. She runs back inside and sees the BAT THING attacking ERNIE SETFANIUK. It looks up at her, its mouth bloody. SCULLY fires five shots into its back. It flies out of sight. As SCULLY looks for it, she is startled by DOGGETT's entrance.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

(The BAT THING flies at DOGGETT knocking him to the ground. DOGGETT fires eleven shots at it as it flies away, screaming. SCULLY helps him up.)

DOGGETT: You okay?

SCULLY: Yeah. I'm okay. But you're not, Agent Doggett. I got you.

(SCULLY gently helps DOGGETT lie down and begins checking his injuries. DOGGETT loses consciousness. SCULLY looks up into the trees at the sound of the BAT THING screeching defiantly at her.)



SCENE 13
TWO WEEKS LATER

(X-Files office. SCULLY is alone. She picks up MULDER's nameplate again. DOGGETT enters. As a manly man, he has fully recovered from his wounds.)

DOGGETT: Sorry I'm late. I received a fax up in my old office from Ernie's brother, Myron Stefaniuk.

SCULLY: He's alive? Where is he?

DOGGETT: He doesn't say. He sent this from a small storefront business just across the state line in Wyoming. He's gone into hiding.

SCULLY: Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Believe it?

SCULLY: That this thing is still out there and someday it's going to come after us?

DOGGETT: (not ultra-confident) I'm pretty sure I hit it, Agent Scully. Pretty sure you hit it, too. The guys upstairs were making some noise about this case-- about what's in our field report.

SCULLY: Yeah. You'll get used to it.

(She picks up the nameplate again.)

SCULLY: I, uh... I never had a desk in here, Agent Doggett but I'll see that you get one.

(DOGGETT is surprised, not sure what she is saying.)

DOGGETT: All right.

SCULLY: And I just want to say, um... thank you for watching my back.

DOGGETT: Well, I never saw it as an option. I'm sure you don't either.

(They look at each other a moment. DOGGETT crosses over to a file cabinet and begins looking through it. SCULLY looks at the nameplate again, opens the desk drawer, pauses, then places it inside and closes the drawer.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
SEVIER DESERT
JUAB COUNTY, UTAH
12:36 AM

(Old, perhaps abandoned bus stop on a little used highway in the middle of the desert. Definitely not a twenty-four hour type of place. A soft wind blows an old sign under which is an old telephone booth and a bench. CarriK's tape is bad, name on the sign looks like "Bus Stop  Roadrunner Bus Lines." A young man, HANK GULATARSKI, early twenties, dressed for comfort and life on the road, is looking around the place, waiting. He has a wrapped package and a dufflebag. He takes a pill, puts on his walkman, and gets some change. He walks to the old phone booth nearby. Looks like he makes a call, then he hangs up and checks to see if he got his money back. As he checks his watch, he hears a large vehicle approaching. He quickly runs out of the booth.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Hey, now we're talking.

(He retrieves his bag and the package and begins waving them at the bus that is approaching.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Hey. Right here, man, right here!

(The bus does not slow. He waves the bag and package harder.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Hey, come on! Stop, you son of a...

(The bus passes him, then slows and stops. HANK GULATARSKI runs to the front door and boards the bus. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER is a large woman, 40ish.)

HANK GULATARSKI: You know, you got, like, highway hypnosis or something. You didn't see me standing there, yelling, waving?

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER glances at him, then looks straight ahead.)

HANK GULATARSKI: You better watch that.

(HANK GULATARSKI enters the body of the bus. It is almost full. All the passengers are awake. No one takes notice of the new guy. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER closes the door, and drives away. HANK finds the one open seat. It is next to an older woman. She doesn't acknowledge him. He stores his bag overhead, then sits and puts his Walkman on and closes his eyes. Near the front of the bus, a DISABLED MAN, around 30, is sitting beside a kindly looking OLDER GENTLEMAN. The DISABLED MAN turns around and looks intently at HANK. A moment later, the FEMALE BUS DRIVER stops the bus again. HANK, irritated, takes off his headphones.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Oh, come on. What now?

(Led by the DISABLED MAN, everyone begins getting off the bus silently. They gather in front of the bus.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Where's everybody going?

(No one answers. His seatmate exits the bus also.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Is, is the toilet broken? What?

(HANK is the last one off of the bus. They are only a short distance from the bus stop. The others have all surrounded the DISABLED MAN who got off of the bus first with the aid of crutches and leg supports. The DISABLED MAN, assisted by the OLDER GENTLEMAN, kneels down on the ground.)

HANK GULATARSKI: Can someone please tell me what's going on here?

(The DISABLED MAN looks toward HANK. Suddenly, the FEMALE BUS DRIVER grabs a large rock nearby and knocks out the DISABLED MAN. She continues to hit him as other riders pick up rocks and begin calmly stoning the DISABLED MAN to death. We hear his groans, but he does not resist. HANK stares on in horror. He backs up a few steps and trips and falls. The others turn toward HANK and begin walking slowly to him.)

HANK GULATARSKI: No!

(The others surround him. He begins screaming.)

HANK GULATARSKI: No! No!

SCENE 2
SEVIER DESERT
JUAB COUNTY, UTAH
11:17 AM

(SCULLY, tight white t-shirt, olive dress shirt, and dark blazer, is alone at the area near the same bus stop we saw before. She looks at the many footprints in the sand, including the scrape of the crutches. With a digital camera she takes a picture of what looks like a round bloodstain about the size of a human head. A few feet away, she finds a hand-sized rock with a few ounces of white gooey stuff on it. Still wet. Must be a humid day in the desert. She pulls out a latex glove and transfers the substance to an evidence bag. She checks her cell phone. No service.

SCULLY: Damn.

(SCULLY sighs. She calls from the old phone booth. Phone rings.)

(DOGGETT answers the phone in the X-Files office. Looks like he has been using MULDER's desk.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) John Doggett.

SCULLY: (on phone) Hey, it's Scully. Good morning.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Good afternoon. I've been trying to reach you.

(He sounds a little pissed. She sounds a little guilty, but unrepentant.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, actually, I'm out of town. I'm  north of Sugarville, Utah, roughly.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Utah? What are you doing there?

SCULLY: (on phone) The, uh, local coroner wants a consultation on a murder victim.... a man who was found beaten to death in the desert. Apparently, his corpse shows some anomalous characteristics.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Anomalous? How?

SCULLY: (on phone) From what they're telling me, he is a, uh, 22-year-old backpacker who was last seen by his family about six months ago in perfect health. However, his body is now showing advanced signs of osteoporosis, arthritis, and kyphosis of the vertebrae. In other words, he's got a spine of a 90-year-old woman.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Sounds anomalous, all right. You didn't need me to tag along?

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, it was just a, uh, a simple consultation... and, uh... he called me over the weekend and I figured I wasn't going to bother you.

(Pause.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Well, if there's anything I can do from here

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, actually, there might be, if you don't mind. Somewhere in our files... there is a, uh, an unsolved murder case.

(She looks at the bag of goo.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Unfortunately, I , uh, don't remember any of the particulars like where or when it took place but I do remember that there were some glycoproteins found at the crime scene.

(DOGGETT has never heard the word "glycoproteins" in his life.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) "Glycoproteins."

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, mucous... But it was, uh, unable to be identified, and seeing as how you, uh, recently read through all of our files I thought maybe it would ring a bell with you.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Well, I don't have a great memory for mucous... but I'll be happy to look.

(SCULLY smiles. The bus approaches and passes SCULLY, making it very difficult for her to hear DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Remember anything else? Are you still there? Agent Scully? Agent Scully?

(The bus has passed. SCULLY watches it.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Do you remember anything else?

SCULLY: (on phone) No, no, no, just, uh, just mucous. Look, when you find that file, will you fax it over to the Juab County Sheriff's office? That's the best place to reach me. My cell phone doesn't seem to be working out here.

DOGGETT: (on phone) All right, you got it.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you.

(SCULLY hangs up and steps out of the booth to watch the bus turn left onto a small side road a half mile away. About where she found the goo.)

(Later, SCULLY in her rental sedan is traveling along the small desert road. She arrives at a small collection of rundown houses and buildings. No sign of the bus, or any other functional vehicles. She pulls up in front of the gas station and gets out, map in hand. [She is driving a silver Impala.] A sign in front asks "Missing a Hubcab?".)

SCULLY: Hello?

(No answer. She honks the horn. Still no answer. She closes the car door, sighs, and spreads the map out on the hood. She appears to be way southwest of Salt Lake in the middle of nowhere. Behind her, we see the GAS STATION MAN step into view.)

GAS STATION MAN: How you doing?

(SCULLY turns to face him, startled, but quickly composed.)

SCULLY: Good  thanks. I, uh, I was wondering. A bus came through here a little while ago. Uh, do you happen to know where it might have gone?

(The GAS STATION MAN is young, country accent. A crude bandage is wrapped around a nasty looking wound on his right hand.)

GAS STATION MAN: Well, I was around back.

SCULLY: Do you know what's up that road?

GAS STATION MAN: Eventually it'll get you to Salt Lake... I mean, if you're not in too much a hurry.

SCULLY: Uh, can I ask what happened to your hand?

GAS STATION MAN: Aww I was changing the blade on my bow saw. It's kind of gross.

(SCULLY inspects the wound with concern and interest.)

SCULLY: Yeah. There was a, uh, murder out here last week about 15, 20 miles off the state road. Did you, uh, did you hear about it?

GAS STATION MAN: Yes, I did. It's scary.

SCULLY: Yeah. Well, you're going to want to wash this out. Put some iodine on it. You don't want it to get infected.

GAS STATION MAN: You sound like my mother.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, I also sound like a doctor.

GAS STATION MAN: (interested) Medical doctor?

SCULLY: Yeah. Can you sell me some gas?

GAS STATION MAN: Oh. Oh, I'd love to... but I'm all out. See, the tanker was supposed to be here yesterday but... well, I'm hoping for this afternoon. How low are you?

SCULLY: I got a... quarter tank, I think. I'll make it. It's all right.

GAS STATION MAN: I'd feel awful bad if you didn't. Hang on.

SCULLY: Thanks.

(She looks at the map some more. He runs back behind the station and returns with a large gas can.)

GAS STATION MAN: Should be enough in here to tide you over.

SCULLY: Oh, that's great. Thank you.

GAS STATION MAN: Do me a favor. Don't go telling people that I'm giving away free gas back here.

(He opens her gas tank and begins pouring in the contents of the can.)

SCULLY: Where is "here," exactly? 'Cause I can't seem to find this town on the map.

GAS STATION MAN: Oh, we're not really a town. Just a... just a few like-minded people trying to keep the modern world at bay.

(He finishes pouring and closes the tank.)

GAS STATION MAN: You're good to go.

SCULLY: Thank you very much.

(SCULLY gets in the car, starts the engine and drives back the way she came. The GAS STATION MAN watches her go.)

(CUT TO: GAS STATION MAN opens a door into a bedroom.)

GAS STATION MAN: Help is coming.

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER is in the room. She acknowledges the GAS STATION MAN, then turns back to a man lying on the small bed. The man is shivering as if from a high fever. It is HANK GULATARSKI. He does not look well.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY in her car, perhaps a few miles away. The car engine sputters, then stalls. She rolls to a stop. All gauges on the dashboard look all right.)

SCULLY: Okay.

(She gets out.)

(Later. Jacket over her arm, SCULLY arrives on foot back at the gas station. She looks tired and more than a little pissed off. She confronts the GAS STATION MAN who is sitting on the porch of the station.)

SCULLY: Hey. Excuse me. You put something in my tank that killed my engine.

GAS STATION MAN: (all innocence and concern) What?

SCULLY: Where's that gas can? I'd like to see it, please.

(SCULLY, followed by the very nervous GAS STATION MAN, walks over to the gas can that he used to fill her tank earlier. She pours some of the remaining contents into her hand and holds her hand to her face.)

SCULLY: That's water. I barely even smell any gasoline.

(The GAS STATION MAN also smells the contents.)

GAS STATION MAN: Oh, God, you're right. I'm sorry. I... I left it out. (looks at the tiny nozzle opening) It must have gotten rain in it.

SCULLY: Oh, and it rains a lot here, does it? Seeing as how it's basically the desert.

GAS STATION MAN: I'm really sorry.

SCULLY: Yeah. I'm going to use your phone.

(Mad!SCULLY starts into the station.)

GAS STATION MAN: I don't have one.

(SCULLY turns and faces him, clearly disbelieving.)

SCULLY: You don't have a phone. So how did you call up the tanker that was supposed to come here yesterday?

GAS STATION MAN: There's a phone up the street. Mr. Milsap's place. He'll help you out.

(SCULLY goes up the street to an old house. She enters through the screen door. No sign of anyone.)

SCULLY: Hello? Hello?

(Looking up at the top of the stairs, she sees the kindly OLDER GENTLEMAN who we saw earlier on the bus next to the DISABLED MAN. He is MR. MILSAP.)

SCULLY: Hi.

MR. MILSAP: Hi.

SCULLY: Mr. Milsap?

(He comes down the stairs.)

MR. MILSAP: Can I help you?

SCULLY: Yes, I hope so. My, uh, car has stalled up the street and I was wondering if I could use your phone.

MR. MILSAP: Sure. It's in here.

(SCULLY picks up the phone in the room, starts to dial, then sets it down again in disgust.)

SCULLY: The line's dead.

MR. MILSAP: Oh, no. Let me see.

(He takes the phone from her. Surprise, surprise, it is indeed dead.)

MR. MILSAP: Damn phone company. They're updating the lines, so the service gets interrupted. It'll come back on.

SCULLY: How long?

MR. MILSAP: Ten minutes... two hours... I could say, but I'd just be guessing.

(SCULLY gives him a "Yeah, right," look and follows the phone cord to the wall. It is plugged in.)

MR. MILSAP: You're welcome to wait here. I could even give you a room if you like. This was a boarding house.

SCULLY: I won't be here that long.

(She stands and looks directly at him. She does not trust this kindly man.)

SCULLY: What the hell is going on here?

MR. MILSAP: Sorry?

SCULLY: I get the distinct impression that somebody doesn't want me to leave.

MR. MILSAP: (defensively) I don't know anything about that.

SCULLY: A bus came through here about an hour ago. Where did it go?

MR. MILSAP: A bus?

SCULLY: Don't tell me you didn't see it.

MR. MILSAP: (chuckle) Oh, I think I'd have known if a big bus came through. (intensely serious, almost desperate) Are you sure I can't help you out with a room?

(SCULLY turns and walks out of the house. MR. MILSAP follows.)

MR. MILSAP: It's 18 miles to the state road. Another 20 to Sugarville.

(SCULLY, halfway down the porch steps, rests her hand for a moment on her abdomen. Very subtle.)

MR. MILSAP: You don't want to walk it.

(SCULLY sighs looks down the street, then notices a WOMAN walking quickly into one of the houses. She follows quickly.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. Ma'am, excuse me. Ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am.

(The WOMAN goes into the house. SCULLY follows onto the porch and knocks at the door.)

SCULLY: Hello? Ma'am, I need some help.

(She tries the door. It is locked. No answer. She goes to the window and looks inside. The WOMAN and several other people are standing in a circle in the room reading from what looks like the Bible. They glance up at SCULLY's knocks on the window.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(The people in the room turn away again, ignoring her. Mismatched lawn furniture in the yard. SCULLY crosses over to another house. MR. MILSAP is watching her. She knocks at the door.)

SCULLY: Hello?

(She looks through the dustcovered window. She sees another group of people in a circle. They ignore her. She sighs and looks back up at MR. MILSAP.)

(CUT TO: Later that night. SCULLY is in an upper floor room in MR. MILSAP's house. It is lit only by candle and oil lamp. She nervously checks her weapon, and sits tensely on the white iron bed, gun in her hand. The camera pans across her curtained windows. Out in the dirt street, we see all the residents of the town silently carrying oil lamps. They are all heading to the house.)



SCENE 3

(SCULLY's room, next morning. She is asleep. A knock at the door causes her to jerk awake. She grabs her gun off of the bedside table and points it steadily at the door, ready for action.)

MR. MILSAP: (voice, from outside the door) Doctor, can I speak to you? It's... it's an emergency.

(SCULLY holds the gun at the door for a moment regaining her composure. She goes to the door and opens it cautiously. MR. MILSAP looks contrite.)

MR. MILSAP: I'm sorry to bother you. There's a man downstairs that needs help. Please.

(SCULLY and MR. MILSAP enter the room where the FEMALE BUS DRIVER is watching over HANK GULATARSKI. HANK is convulsing. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER is holding him down. SCULLY runs to the bedside and takes the FEMALE BUS DRIVER's place.)

SCULLY: Let go. Don't hold him down.

(HANK GULATARSKI continues to convulse. SCULLY tucks a pillow under his head to keep him from hurting himself.)

SCULLY: How long has he been seizing?

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: (flustered) Uh, three... four minutes.

SCULLY: It's okay. You're all right. You're okay.

(He calms. She looks at HANK GULATARSKI with concern.)

SCULLY: What's his name?

MR. MILSAP: He's a stranger. He needed help.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Wha... what's wrong with him?

SCULLY: He had a grand mal seizure. As far as I can tell, he's in status. It's a continuous seizure state. He doesn't smell like acetone, which would indicate that he's hyperglycemic and  uh  he doesn't appear to have any head injuries. He could be epileptic and just ceased taking his medication.

(SCULLY turns him over and sees a gaping bloody wound on his lower back. She looks up at the FEMALE BUS DRIVER and MR. MILSAP.)

SCULLY: How did this happen?

(They act like they don't know as they both shake their heads. SCULLY doesn't buy it.)

SCULLY: Uh-huh. At any rate, we need to get him to a hospital. Immediately.

(MR. MILSAP and the FEMALE BUS DRIVER look at each other. SCULLY looks to MR. MILSAP.)

SCULLY: I assume that your phone's still not working.

MR. MILSAP: Sorry.

SCULLY: Well, do you or one of your "friendly" neighbors happen to have a car?

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: No one here has a car.

SCULLY: No cars?

MR. MILSAP: (helpfully) We could send someone to the state road on foot. All right? We could get them to bring back help.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: (hopefully) In the meantime, please, anything you can do for him.

(SCULLY nods and sighs.)

SCULLY: All right, do you... um  do you have any Karo syrup? Any corn syrup?

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER goes out of the room. SCULLY turns back to HANK. MR. MILSAP watches SCULLY.)



SCENE 4

(DOGGETT is calling from the X-Files office.)

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Joab County Sheriff's office, Sheriff Ciolino speaking.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah, hi, this is Agent John Doggett with the FBI. I have some material my partner, Agent Scully, requested. What's your fax number there?

(SHERIFF CIOLINO is in his office in Utah.)

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Agent Doggett, uh, when's your partner going to get here, by the way? The murder victim's family's waiting for us to turn the body over.

DOGGETT: (on phone, concerned) Agent Scully's not there? She's supposed to be there yesterday.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Yes, sir, that was our understanding.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Sheriff, could I trouble you to send a car out? Agent Scully is- in Utah. She called me yesterday somewhere north of Sugarville.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) You got it. I'll get someone right out there.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Okay, thanks. I'll be in touch.

(DOGGETT thinks a moment then makes another call.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Danny, hi. This is John Doggett. I need YOU TO TRACE A CALL FOR ME. IT CAME TO THIS OFFICE YESTERDAY ABOUT 1:30 in the afternoon.



SCENE 5

(In HANK's room. SCULLY is pulling old phone cord off the wall. She holds the cord against the antenna of her cell phone. Still no service. She sighs. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER is spooning syrup into HANK's mouth.)

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Am I doing this right?

SCULLY: Yeah, you can hold off now.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Nothing's happening.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, but, uh... I'm just winging it here. I mean, raising his blood sugar only helps if his condition is brought on by hypoglycemia, but this could be the result of any number of things.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: So what do we do?

SCULLY: Well, I'm afraid that I have done all that I can do  unless you know how to get ahold of diazepam or phenobarbital other than the nearest hospital  which is where we should be, of course.

(HANK begins gasping and regaining consciousness. SCULLY sits beside him.)

SCULLY: Hey, hey. Can you hear me? How are you feeling?

HANK: (weakly) Okay.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: (delighted) Thank God. Thank God. We were all so scared. (SCULLY looks up at her in disbelief.)

HANK: I think I just need rest.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: (to SCULLY) We should leave him alone.

(HANK grabs SCULLY's arm)

HANK: Can, uh, you stay?

(SCULLY looks at the FEMALE BUS DRIVER.)

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: I'll go tell everybody.

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER leaves SCULLY and HANK alone.)

HANK: Are you a doctor?

SCULLY: Yes. I am.

HANK: Thank you. For, uh, helping me.

SCULLY: Well, I'm not sure if I've actually done anything. In fact, I don't even know, uh, I don't even know what's going on with you right now. Do you know what your name is?

HANK: Um

SCULLY: You don't remember do you? How about how you got here?

(He doesn't answer.)

SCULLY: What about these people who have taken you in? Do you know anything about them?

HANK: Um, they, uh, take good care of me?

SCULLY: Yeah, I'll say they take very good care of you. The sun seems to rise and set on you as far as they're concerned. In fact, they seem to have stranded me here in order to nurse you back to health.

HANK: What  why would they do that?

(SCULLY glances back at the door to see if the coast is clear.)

SCULLY: A murder took place about 20 miles from here. A man was stoned to death. His head was so badly crushed, that they couldn't identify him from his teeth. Now it looks like upwards of a dozen people may have participated due to the footprints at the crime scene, but it's a very tight knit group of people who would murder together. A cult, in a word. And I'd say that these people qualify.

HANK: What are you? Detective?

SCULLY: FBI. And I need to get you out of here, but I don't know how. Okay, do you think that you can you walk?

HANK: I don't know. Kind of weak.

(He starts to weakly rise.)

SCULLY: I understand.

(She starts to help him out of bed.)

SCULLY: Hang  hang on a second. Just let me look at something, okay?

HANK: Mmmm?

SCULLY: All right.

(SCULLY looks at the wound on his lower back. She compresses the wound. Fluid bubbles out. HANK gasps.)

HANK: That thing hurts! Maybe you shouldn't do that. (He gasps in pain as she squeezes.)

SCULLY: Hold on, hold on.

(She gasps as she sees something moving along his lower spine. She presses on it. He begins convulsing again as it moves up his spine, then he relaxes. SCULLY takes out a pair of medical forceps-clippers, and reaches into the wound and clips onto something. She snips off a piece. He grunts. The rest of whatever it is crawls back up HANK'S spine. SCULLY holds up the still quivering hunk of flesh in her forceps and stares at it. It twitches like the back half of a severed worm.)



SCENE 6

(X-Files office. Phone rings. DOGGETT is printing out a missing persons, information needed picture of HANK. He answers the phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Doggett.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) It's Ciolino. We checked out the number you gave us. It's a pay phone a half-mile from the crime scene.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Agent Scully must've just come from there when she called me.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Looks like. We're sorry. Still no sign of her.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Are you canvassing? Talking to NAVIS?

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Well, we would but there's no one to canvass. We're looking at a pretty desolate area. There's really nobody out there.

DOGGETT: (on phone) All right, listen. You got help coming your way from our Salt Lake City office. I'm heading out there, too. There's a new angle we need to be looking at.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) What's that?

DOGGETT: (on phone) That pay phone. Before Scully's call to me, the last call was placed on it was four days earlier, the night of the murder.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) Yeah?

DOGGETT: (on phone) It was placed to a Juliette Gulatarski. Of Fort Collins, Colorado. She tells me it was her brother Hank. He was on his way for a visit. Said he was stuck in the desert, but would be there in two days.

(DOGGETT looks at the missing persons image he printed out of HANK. HANK is 5'10".)

DOGGETT: (on phone) He never showed.



SCENE 7

(Back in HANK's room. SCULLY, the FEMALE BUS DRIVER and MR. MILSAP are still watching over HANK. A damp cloth is on his head.)

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Something's happening.

SCULLY: He's coming to. Hey. Can you hear me? How are you feeling?

HANK: (weakly) I'm alive. And that's a start.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Oh, praise God.

MR. MILSAP: Praise Him. Praise Him.

(SCULLY seems uncomfortable with the open display of religious fervor.)

HANK: What's wrong with me?

(No one answers.)

HANK: I just need some rest. She can take care of me.

(MR. MILSAP and the FEMALE BUS DRIVER leave the room. SCULLY closes the door.)

SCULLY: It's lucky they're still listening to you for the time being.

(SCULLY rewets the cloth for his head.)

SCULLY: This... wound in your back... it seems to be a point of entry for a parasitic organism that has taken up residence along your spine. Now, this is something that I am completely unfamiliar with.

HANK: Oh, boy.

SCULLY: I don't know how far this extends or how to get it out of you without harming you.

HANK: Does that mean I'm dying?

SCULLY: You will die if we cannot treat you properly. Now, these people don't seem to want to let you go. I think that they put this thing inside of you.

(HANK looks upset.)

SCULLY: Now, I have no idea what the motives of these people are-- whether it's some bizarre religious activity-- but they killed the last person who was in your condition and I'm afraid that they're going to try and kill you, too.

HANK: This is a lot to take in.

SCULLY: No kidding.

HANK: What are you going to do?

SCULLY: I'm going to try and get us the hell out of here.

(She looks out the window.)

SCULLY: These, uh... people tell me that they have no cars. I don't believe them. They've got to have transportation hidden around here somewhere.

(She opens a window.)

SCULLY: I'm going to go take a look around, okay?

HANK: You're not going to be gone long, right?

(SCULLY thinks a moment takes her gun out of the holster.)

SCULLY: You know how to use a gun?

HANK: Pretty much.

(She gives him her gun.)

SCULLY: I'll be back soon.

HANK: The sooner the better.

(She climbs out the window.)

(There is a knock at the door. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER and MR. MILSAP enter.)

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Where did she go?

HANK: She says I'm dying.

(MR. MILSAP and the FEMALE BUS DRIVER look at each other.)

HANK: We need another swap.



SCENE 8

(Juab County Sheriff's office. DOGGETT arrives in a rental sedan. SHERIFF CIOLINO is there as well as the FBI agent, MAYFIELD. Manly men.)

DOGGETT: Sherriff? Agent John Doggett.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: You made good time.

DOGGETT: Good to know you.

BRIAN MAYFIELD: (shaking hands) I'm Brian Mayfield, Salt Lake office. We're at your disposal.

DOGGETT: (shaking his hand) Appreciate it.

(They enter the office.)

DOGGETT: Sheriff, does this wound look familiar?

(He shows him a picture of a lower back wound.)

SHERIFF CIOLINO: It's the victim in our morgue. Where'd you get it?

DOGGETT: That's not your murder victim. That's a photo of a John Doe found off a West Texas highway in 1991.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: Our guy has the same wound.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I thought you were going to say that.

(DOGGETT tosses down three more crime scene photos along with his lines.)

DOGGETT: Arizona, '93. New Mexico, '97. Nevada, '99. All four victims had their brains beaten out and were dumped in remote areas. All four cases are unsolved.

MAYFIELD: How'd you run these down?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully had me track down this first one. It noted glycoproteins at the crime scene which is what she found. This same wound kept showing up. These murders range throughout the southwest, zigzagging all over the desert. The more remote the better.

(DOGGETT walks over to the map of the area on the wall. He taps the map near where the one red pushpin is placed on the map.)



SCENE 9

(The pushpin flashes into a maglite beam. SCULLY, maglite in hand, looks through a barn's peephole, then enters the barn and looks around. She finds the bus. The letters MCI are on the front. As she investigates the exterior of the bus, HANK enters. He has a crutch on his arm. He stumbles weakly into the barn.)

SCULLY: Hey. How'd you...?

(The others enter the barn and surround SCULLY and HANK.)

SCULLY: You had me convinced.

(She runs, then grunts angrily as the other grab and restrain her.)

SCULLY: (yelling) I'm a Federal Agent! At this moment, the FBI is searching for me!

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: They won't find you.

MR. MILSAP: Talk to her.

(HANK is leaning on the arm braces.)

HANK: Your life... is about to take a wonderful turn. You're going to become a part of something much, much greater than you are. (smiles) You're going to be... so loved.

MR. MILSAP: Amen. Amen.

ALL: Amen. Amen.

(HANK kneels down. MR. MILSAP nods and smiles at the FEMALE BUS DRIVER. She smiles back. She raises a hammer above her head and brings it down with great force on HANK's head.)

SCULLY: No! Ahhh!!! You son of a bitch!

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER proceeds to bash HANK to death with the hammer as the others chant. Blood splatters the side of the bus.)

MR. MILSAP: Amen!

SCULLY: You just murdered him!

ALL: Amen!

MR. MILSAP AND ALL: Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen! Amen!

ALL: Amen!

(HANK is dead. The FEMALE BUS DRIVER reaches into HANK's body, removes an infant sized organism from HANK's spine and begins walking toward SCULLY with it. It is squirming and slimy, like a really big nasty slug. It has some sort of horns or teeth at one end.)

SCULLY: No. No! I'm pregnant! No! No, don't do this! I'm going to have a baby!

(They come closer.)

SCULLY: No! Don't do this! No! I'm going to have a baby!

(They turn her around and expose her lower back as the FEMALE BUS DRIVER approaches with the organism. Not a pleasant scene at all.)

SCULLY: No! No! No! No!



SCENE 10

(Night. SCULLY is tied spread-eagled, stomach down, to the bed. The others watch her. She is groaning in pain. Some of the groans are really low. Sound almost male. Maybe looped in post-production?)

SCULLY: What did you put in me?! I'm going to get every last one of you bastards!

MR. MILSAP: No.

(SCULLY pants and groans.)

MR. MILSAP: You'll love us. You'll protect us. You'll teach us, make us better than we are. We're taught not to envy, but I do envy you so. That you'll soon be one with him.

SCULLY: Him?! That thing in my spine is a "him"?!

(We see the circular wound on her exposed lower back, and the lump moving slowly up her spine. She yells in pain MR. MILSAP places his hand tenderly on SCULLY's swollen back.)

MR. MILSAP: Please. This is such a wonderful, wonderful thing... for you... and your unborn child. That last man just wasn't a suitable tabernacle. The thing of it is there's always the chance that your body won't fail him... that he'll be in you forever.

(SCULLY groans and struggle. Car headlights illuminate the window.)

SCULLY: Help! Help! Help!

(The FEMALE BUS DRIVER shoves a cloth in her mouth. MR. MILSAP closes the window.)

(Down on the street, DOGGETT gets out of his car. MR. MILSAP and the FEMALE BUS DRIVER come to greet him.)

DOGGETT: Good evening.

MR. MILSAP: Good evening. You lost?

DOGGETT: Well, I may be. I'm way the hell off the main road, that's for sure.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: Can we help you?

DOGGETT: Yeah, I hope so. I'm, uh... looking for this woman. Have you seen her?

(DOGGETT unfolds and shows them a picture of SCULLY.)

MR. MILSAP: No.

FEMALE BUS DRIVER: No.

MR. MILSAP: Can't say I have.

(In her room, SCULLY, tied to the bed, manages to tip over one of the oil lamps with her foot. The room is set on fire. She screams, muffled, as the GAS STAION MAN who had been looking out the window, attempts to put out the flames.)

SCULLY: Help! Help!

(BACK DOWN ON THE STREET:)

DOGGETT: She would have been driving a rental car like mine. You sure she hasn't been through here?

MR. MILSAP: No. We get so few visitors we remember each one pretty well.

DOGGETT: All right. Thanks for your time.

(MR. MILSAP and FEMALE BUS DRIVER start back to the house. SCULLY is still trying to scream.)

SCULLY: Help! Help!

(DOGGETT drives out of sight, then dials his cell phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Sheriff, this is Doggett.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) I'm reading you, Agent Doggett. Where are you?

DOGGETT: (on phone) 20 miles off the state road, just north of the crime scene. Some kind of outpost. It's on your map. I'm getting a definite vibe from it. Just talked to a guy who had a gun in his pocket and I don't mean he was happy to see me.

SHERIFF CIOLINO: (on phone) I'll send everybody I've got.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Hurry. I can't wait for you.

(DOGGETT gets out of the car and runs back to the town.)

(In SCULLY's room. SCULLY is still tied to the bed, groaning. The GAS STATION MAN is watching her. He doesn't hear DOGGETT enter.)

DOGGETT: Hey.

(The GAS STATION MAN turns his face to DOGGETT who promptly punches him unconscious. DOGGETT crosses over to SCULLY. He sees the wound on her back.)

DOGGETT: What in the hell...? Agent Scully...

(She groans.)

DOGGETT: God all mighty. Agent Scully. Agent Scully.

(AGENT SCULLY gasps. He removes the gag.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Get me the hell out of here.

(He unties her hands and feet.)

DOGGETT: Can you walk?

SCULLY: I don't know. How far is your car?

DOGGETT: It's about a half a mile up the road.

SCULLY: I know something closer.

(He carries her to the bus in the barn. He sets her down in the front of the bus, whips off his jacket and then crawls under the steering column and begins messing with the wires.)

SCULLY: Can you hot-wire it?

DOGGETT: (manly confidence) Can I hot-wire it? Gone in 60 seconds, Jack. I'm going to strand these lunatics.

(She groans.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully... talk to me.

(The slug thing in her back is moving further up her spine. Looks incredibly painful.)

SCULLY: You got to cut it out. Cut it out. Oh... Oh... Now it's going to come to my brain.

(She sounds like a woman in labor.)

SCULLY: (screaming) Cut it out of me now!

(She clamps her hand on her neck to keep the thing from moving into her head. DOGGETT pulls out his pocketknife and hesitates, watching it move. He looks up to see the others entering the barn. They begin hammering at the windows of the bus. DOGGETT moves behind SCULLY again. She screams again.)

SCULLY: Aah! Just do it, Doggett!

(As the people continue pounding and banging outside and SCULLY screams, DOGGETT takes his pocketknife and cuts into SCULLY's neck. He has to dig around in her upper back with the knife to get hold of the thing. In one of the most disgusting X-Files moments ever, he pulls the squirming slug thing out of her spine. As he does, the others are breaking the bus windows. DOGGETT stares at the thing in revulsion, then throws it to the back of the bus and shoots it three times. MR. MILSAP has stepped on the bus, SCULLY's gun in hand. DOGGETT turns his gun on MR. MILSAP. MR. MILSAP lowers the gun as he realizes the thing is dead.)

MR. MILSAP: Why?

(MR. MILSAP is devastated. DOGGETT holsters his gun and wraps his jacket around SCULLY. He picks her up and carries her out of the bus and through the now silent group of people. Down the street, we see the flashing lights of the police. DOGGETT carries SCULLY toward them. He head hangs limply.)



SCENE 11
BYU MEDICAL CENTER
PROVO, UTAH
ONE WEEK LATER

(SCULLY's hospital room. SCULLY is packing things from the closet into a small suitcase. She is wearing a scoop necked brown sweater that doesn't get in the way of the large bandage on the back of her neck. DOGGETT knocks at the open door and enters.)

DOGGETT: Ready to go?

SCULLY: Yeah, I'm ready to go.

DOGGETT: Grand Jury convenes today. All 47 cult members are sticking together. They're not offering up much defense other than that they're being persecuted for their religious beliefs.

SCULLY: They believe they worshipped Christ. That that thing was the Second Coming.

(Uncomfortable pause.)

SCULLY: Look, I, uh... I wanted to apologize. I  I left you out of this case, and that was a mistake on my part. It was almost a fatal mistake.

DOGGETT: It was. You screwed up.

(SCULLY takes the reprimand.)

SCULLY: And I won't do it again.

DOGGETT: I appreciate it.

(SCULLY picks up her bag. Without hesitation, DOGGETT takes it from her hands and carries it out of the room. SCULLY nods to herself and follows.)

[THE END]

                               INVOCATION



SCENE 1
WEBSTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
DEXTER OKLAHOMA
SEPTEMBER 21, 1990

(Elementary school playground. A school festival is going on. First shot is an aerial view of a large five-armed wheel centered around a pedestal that is turning slowly as each of the five ponies hitched to the arms walk clockwise. Each has a child on it's back. A MAN is supervising the "ride." The tune of the lullaby, All the Pretty Little Horses is underscoring the scene. It is a hauntingly beautiful song, minor. Nearby, a seven year old blonde boy, BILLY UNDERWOOD, is swinging in the playground area.)

BILLY: Mom! Watch me!

(His mother, LISA UNDERWOOD, is about 11 1/2 months pregnant. She is standing about 20 feet away, hands resting on her enormous belly, and talking to a friend. She glances up at BILLY's voice.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Okay, Billy!

(She smiles and returns to her conversation. A dark-haired, morbid looking teenage boy is watching BILLY.)

BILLY: Mom! You're not watching!

(LISA UNDERWOOD continues laughing with her friend.)

BILLY: Mom!

(Camera is moving in slow motion. The TEENAGE BOY moves closer and looks at the cartoon dinosaurs on the back of BILLY's book bag. Amid the crowd of people in the playground we see BILLY swing into and out of view again, then just the empty swing seat swings into view. Finally, LISA UNDERWOOD looks back up. BILLY is gone.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Billy?! Billy?

(She walks over toward the swings.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Billy! Billy!

(Every parent's worst nightmare has happened. Clutching her belly tightly, she keeps looking, her voice growing more and more panicked.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Billy! Billy! Billy!

(No Billy. Nearby, the TEENAGE BOY holds the dinosaur book bag a moment, an odd look on his face, then drops the book bag to the ground and walks away. LISA UNDERWOOD, now crying and screaming, continues helplessly looking around the playground for her son.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: My little boy... My Billy... Billy! Billy!

SCENE 2
WEBSTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
DEXTER OKLAHOMA
TEN YEARS LATER

(Same elementary school is letting out for the day. LISA UNDERWOOD drives up in a minivan and gets out. On her way into the school, she sees a 10 year old dark-haired boy, JOSH UNDERWOOD. She is surprised to see him.)

JOSH: Mom!

LISA UNDERWOOD: Hi. Josh. I was just coming in. They know you're supposed to wait.

(JOSH is not happy about the situation.)

JOSH: They're looking for you.

LISA UNDERWOOD: Who? Who's looking for me? Hey, what is it?

JOSH: Go look, Mom.

(Near the playground, LISA UNDERWOOD sees a group of teachers and school staff. They are all staring at her. She slowly walks to them.)

PRINCIPAL: Mrs. Underwood, we tried to call you. You must've already left.

LISA UNDERWOOD: What is everyone staring at? What is going on?

(The school staff parts to reveal a small blonde boy swinging on the same swing set we saw in the teaser. We see him from behind. LISA UNDERWOOD stares at him in shock, then slowly goes to him.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Oh... Billy?

(The boy gets off of the swing and turns to face her. It is BILLY, still seven years old, dressed in the same clothes. His face is serious. He just looks at her.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: My beautiful boy. Billy? Oh... Oh... Oh...

(Softly crying, she kisses his cheek and hugs him. BILLY is looking at JOSH over her shoulder. JOSH watches, not sure what to think.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: (crying) Oh, Billy.



SCENE 3
DEXTER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
11:02 AM

(In an observation room, SCULLY is examining BILLY. DOGGETT is watching and listening to them through the glass window. He is holding the ten year old "Missing" flyer of BILLY.)

SCULLY: I'm just going to shine this light in your eyes, okay? You're doing great. See? Nothing to it.

(SCULLY turns and looks at DOGGETT through the window. SHERIFF SANCHEZ joins DOGGETT at the window.)

DOGGETT: He won't speak?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: No, not even to his parents.

DOGGETT: Are they here, his parents?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Oh, they've been here around the clock. I took his prints... It's him. Boy should be a teenager by now, but look at him. Explain to me how that can be.

DOGGETT: I can't say, Sheriff. I'm just here to find out who took him.

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: I talked to everyone at school and no one saw him come back or how. The boy just come out of the blue.

(SCULLY comes out of the room and closes the door. Down the hall, two DEPUTIES are carrying boxes.)

DOGGETT: Are those the case files?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Oh, yeah. Plenty more where those came from. There's lots of files. There's just not much in them. We never even had a suspect.

DOGGETT: (pointing) Have them set them over there, would you.

(SHERIFF SANCHEZ steps away to direct the DEPUTIES.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Set those on that table.

SCULLY: (speaking quietly to DOGGETT) Okay. Well, what we've got here is a healthy seven-year-old boy who was born 17 years ago.

DOGGETT: And a healthy boy who won't speak.

(LISA and DOUG UNDERWOOD come down the hall to SCULLY and DOGGETT.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Excuse me? Are you finished with Billy?

SCULLY: Mr. and Mrs. Underwood?

LISA UNDERWOOD: Um, you're with the FBI...

SCULLY: Yes. I'm Agent Scully, and this is Agent Doggett. We are, uh, investigating this case.

LISA UNDERWOOD: (smiling with delight, looking toward BILLY) It's a miracle, isn't it?

(SCULLY and DOGGETT look at each other. He steps away.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Underwood... whatever your son has been through, it has somehow affected his physical condition.

LISA UNDERWOOD: So we've been told by every doctor here. We just want to take him home. After ten years, can we do that?

(DOGGETT takes a large paper evidence bag from one of the file boxes.)

DOGGETT: Not yet. I want to talk to him first.

(SCULLY is surprised. DOGGETT goes into the room with BILLY and closes the door. SCULLY and the parents watch through the window.)

DOGGETT: How you doing, Billy? My name's John. I'm gonna have a seat over here, is that okay? Is that all right?

(DOGGETT sits at the table. BILLY doesn't say anything, just keeps drawing the same symbol on a piece of paper with a black magic marker.)

DOGGETT: Billy, I want you to know that you're not alone. I've talked to lots of other boys and girls who've been hurt just like you. Sometimes when they talk about it the hurt starts to go away. You want to talk about it, Billy?

(No response. SCULLY and the UNDERWOODS are watching.)

DOGGETT: You know, maybe you think bad things happened to you because you've been a bad boy... but I'm here to tell you, that's not true. The bad guy is the one who took you away and it's up to you and me to get the bad guy. See, 'cause as big and tough as I am, I can't do it alone. I need your help. Can you tell me about him, Billy? What's his name? What did he look like?

(No answer. DOGGETT opens the evidence bag and sets the backpack with the dinosaur design on the desk.)

DOGGETT: You remember this, don't you, Billy? Would you like to have that back?

(BILLY reaches for the backpack. DOGGETT takes it away again.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: What is he doing?

(SCULLY is at a complete and embarrassed loss for words.)

SCULLY: Uh...

DOGGETT: All I want is his name.

(LISA UNDERWOOD angrily enters the room and picks up BILLY and the backpack.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Who the hell do you think you are? He's only a little boy.

(She carries him out of the room.)

SCULLY: Mr. Underwood...?

(DOUG UNDERWOOD follows his wife out of the hospital. SCULLY goes to confront DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: You think this is a game?

DOGGETT: A serious game; one we have to win.

SCULLY: Have you really worked kid cases before, Agent Doggett? Child abductions?

DOGGETT: I worked the child abduction task force. I know the horror stories, but this kid can help us.

SCULLY: This isn't just a horror story. This is a biological impossibility.

DOGGETT: Well, that's your area of expertise. I just want to put the person who did this out of business. Billy just didn't show up. He got away or was let go. And if he can talk, he can tell us by who. Or he can look at photos in the files and point to the man who did this so this doesn't happen to some other little boy.

SCULLY: You are ignoring the fact that he is still seven years old.

DOGGETT: Failure to thrive. Isn-isn't that the term? I mean, aren't there diseases that delay puberty and so on?

SCULLY: I told you... he's not sick.

DOGGETT: Good. Then he can talk.

(DOGGETT turns his back on her and walks away, closing the door behind him.)



SCENE 4

(The UNDERWOODS pull up outside their nice suburban house in their minivan. LISA UNDERWOOD gets out and opens the right-side sliding door. BILLY looks at her.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: We're home, honey. Safe at home.

(DOUG UNDERWOOD opens the other sliding door.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: I'm going to go pay the sitter, Doug. You bring Billy in.

(DOUG UNDERWOOD watches his wife go to the house. BILLY stares at his father. DOUG UNDERWOOD is uncomfortable. He unfastens BILLY's seatbelt.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Are you glad to be home, Billy?

(Inside the house, we see the backyard through a pair of glass doors. There is a playhouse and JOSH is playing ball with a dog.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: A lot's new here, son. You have a younger brother now. Josh. See that big dog out there with him? That's Sparky.

(BILLY shows no interest, just stares at JOSH.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Would you like to go play with him?

(DOUG UNDERWOOD starts to open the door. SPARKY THE DOG sees BILLY standing behind the sliding glass doors, and runs up barking ferociously, snarling, and trying to get to BILLY.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Sparky, stop it! Get down! What's gotten into you? Sparky! Sparky, hey! What's going on?

(JOSH is looking at BILLY.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Hey! Knock it off!

(More barking and growling. LISA UNDERWOOD comes to them.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: What's the matter, Doug?

DOUG UNDERWOOD: I don't know. The dog just went off... Sparky, what is wrong with you? Come on, let's go.

(LISA UNDERWOOD holds onto BILLY as DOUG UNDERWOOD grabs SPARKY THE DOG by the collar and drags him off into the yard. LISA UNDERWOOD turns to BILLY and holds him comfortingly. BILLY doesn't seem upset.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Honey, it's all right. He just didn't recognize you, that's all. He's a nice dog, Sparky. He just doesn't realize that you're part of the family.

(BILLY is not looking at her. He and JOSH are staring at each other.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: But you are, Billy and we're just so glad that you're finally home.



SCENE 5
DEXTER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
9:48 PM

(DOGGETT is reading files in an office. SCULLY enters the room and closes the door.)

SCULLY: You going to sleep here, too?

DOGGETT: What time is it?

SCULLY: I spoke with the doctors who treated Billy. I looked at his charts.

DOGGETT: And what, did you find something?

SCULLY: Yes and no. What showed up is that Billy is the same boy who was taken ten years ago.

DOGGETT: We know that.

SCULLY: No. I mean the same- boy. He has no cavities. He has no tooth decay. He still has four baby teeth that he's never lost. He had a routine blood test six weeks before he disappeared in 1990. His cell counts, his enzymes, his hormone levels, they are all exactly the same as they were ten years ago.

DOGGETT: Now how can that be possible?

SCULLY: It's medically impossible.

DOGGETT: So, what's the punch line? Where are you saying he's been?

(Pause. SCULLY looks down for a moment, deciding how to phrase her next words.)

SCULLY: There are  X-File cases that describe similar paranormal findings. Alien abductees who came back with anomalous medical stats.

DOGGETT: You know, these words: "Anomalous," "supernatural," "paranormal..." They purport to explain something by not explaining it. It's lazy.

(He drops the file on the table and turns away from her.)

SCULLY: I'm not saying that I can explain it, Agent Doggett, but this is definitely not normal.

(DOGGETT gets another file.)

DOGGETT: I went back to the witnesses at the crime scene the day Billy vanished, to this guy, Ronald Purnell.

(DOGGETT shows SCULLY a mugshot of the teenager we saw in the teaser, RONALD PURNELL. #DSDJ-91 850, about 66 inches tall.)

DOGGETT: He was detained, questioned and dismissed as a suspect.

SCULLY: What's your interest in this guy?

DOGGETT: He's a high school dropout, convicted of possession, arson, and shoplifting since 1990.

SCULLY: These are juvenile records. These are sealed by the court, Agent Doggett. We're not supposed to have these.

DOGGETT: And we're at a standstill here.

SCULLY: (angry) Yeah, and you're breaking the law.

DOGGETT: Look, I want to catch this guy, Agent Scully, whatever it takes.

(Tension in the room.)



SCENE 6
UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE
10:14 PM

(Barking outside. Inside, LISA UNDERWOOD is tucking BILLY into bed in his old room, apparently. His eyes are closed.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: We love you so much, Billy. It's so good to have you back-- to be tucking you in. Sleep tight.

(She turns out the light, leaves the room, and closes the door. Immediately, BILLY sits up. Creepy music. BILLY goes out into the hall and listens to his parents arguing in their bedroom.)

[CLOSED CAPTIONING ALSO HAD:

LISA UNDERWOOD: He's asleep.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Billy or Josh?

LISA UNDERWOOD: Both, but I meant Billy.]

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Of course you did.

LISA UNDERWOOD: What is that supposed to mean?

DOUG UNDERWOOD: It means that you're blind to what's going on here, Lisa.

LISA UNDERWOOD: Ten years we prayed for this. Every night we prayed to God.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: I prayed for our son. That is not the boy I knew, Lisa.

LISA UNDERWOOD: What do you expect him to be? They told us this will take time.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Even Josh is afraid of him.

LISA UNDERWOOD: He is nothing to be afraid of.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: I wish I could believe that.

LISA UNDERWOOD: How can you sit here and say these things to me? I thought this would make us both so happy.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING ALSO HAD:

DOUG UNDERWOOD: We should have tried to get more answers. We were too quick to pull him out of the hospital.

LISA UNDERWOOD: We weren't quick enough, Doug.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: For all we know he may need some kind of medical attention.

LISA UNDERWOOD: Don't try to make this sound like you're concerned for Billy. It's sickening.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: What I'm concerned about is this family. Something is wrong with him, Lisa.

LISA UNDERWOOD: He is our son!]

(BILLY turns away from their room and walks down the hall. He is holding a large hunting knife. He opens JOSH's bedroom door, enters, and closes the door behind him. Crayon drawings, including one of JOSH's name, decorate the door.)



SCENE 7
BAKER COUNTY, OKLAHOMA
7:42 AM

(Rundown trailer in a grassless barnyard. DOGGETT arrives in his rental sedan and gets out of the car. Oil drill in the background.)

DOGGETT: Anybody in there? Hello? Ronald Purnell?

(No answer. An old beige rusted and dented car pulls up in the yard. Unseen by DOGGETT, a woman in her 40's, MARCIA PURNELL, peeks out one of the windows of the house. RONNIE PURNELL, now in his twenties, is driving the car. He looks just as moody and depressed as before. DOGGETT goes to the car window.)

DOGGETT: Ronald Purnell?

RONNIE PURNELL: Yeah.

DOGGETT: Can I talk to you?

(RONNIE PURNELL avoids eye contact.)

DOGGETT: Can you come out, and we can have a conversation?

(RONNIE PURNELL reluctantly gets out of the car. He is wearing clothes that are too big for him.)

RONNIE PURNELL: Is this about my probation?

DOGGETT: It's about a little boy named Billy Underwood. You know that name? Ring a bell?

RONNIE PURNELL: (looking down) No.

DOGGETT: It does to everybody else in this area. He vanished from a school fair you were at ten years ago.

(RONNIE PURNELL looks uncomfortable.)

DOGGETT: You remember him now?

RONNIE PURNELL: Yeah. I remember him.

DOGGETT: You think he'd remember you?

RONNIE PURNELL: Me?

DOGGETT: You. Your face.

(RONNIE PURNELL chuckles humorlessly and shakes his head.)

RONNIE PURNELL: You're a trip, man. You know that?

DOGGETT: This has nothing to do with you being stoned or violating your probation. All I'm asking is that we go see Billy. See what he says.

(DOGGETT opens the passenger door of his car. RONNIE PURNELL stares at him in confusion.)

RONNIE PURNELL: See what he says where?

DOGGETT: Where? Wherever. Wherever you want. I'll make sure he's there.

RONNIE PURNELL: You're not making sense, Dude. Just leave me alone.

(RONNIE PURNELL goes into the house. DOGGETT watches him go, then slowly gets back into his car. He sits a moment, then takes out his wallet and pulls out a fairly new looking picture of a smiling little boy, perhaps eight years old. The boy looks very similar to DOGGETT. DOGGETT sighs. [CarriK: Credits listed a LUKE DOGGETT.] )



SCENE 8

(UNDERWOOD house, next morning. LISA UNDERWOOD enters BILLY's room. The door is not completely closed, and the bed is empty. Death music from Swan Lake is playing.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Billy? Honey, are you here?

(She goes into JOSH's room. He is still asleep. There is a bloody hunting knife sticking up out of the mattress very close beside JOSH. LISA UNDERWOOD screams hysterically, waking up JOSH.)

JOSH: What?! What are you doing?!

(He jumps up as she runs to him.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Joshey! Oh, my god! Are you hurt?

JOSH: No.

(There is blood on his nightshirt.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: You're bleeding.

JOSH: Mom!

(She points at the knife.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Where did that come from?

JOSH: I don't know.

(They both turn and see BILLY standing in the room, staring at JOSH.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: (gently) Billy. Billy... Billy, honey... what are you doing here?

(JOSH stares at BILLY, clearly freaked out.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Please, Billy, answer me.



SCENE 9
DEXTER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL
11:09 AM

(SCULLY and DOGGETT are looking at the bagged, bloody knife held by SHERIFF SANCHEZ.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Just got word back from the lab. Ran the blood twice and no doubt about it. It's the little boy's.

DOGGETT: But I thought you said he wasn't cut.

(DOGGETT takes the knife.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: No. You're misunderstanding. It's the other son I'm talking about, Billy-- the boy who was kidnapped.

DOGGETT: That doesn't make any sense.

SCULLY: No. Billy wasn't cut either.

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: No, but he definitely handled the knife. His prints are on it.

DOGGETT: Where did he even get it?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: His father's never seen it before. He's no hunter. Never cleaned an animal, which is about all a knife like that's good for... except for killing, of course.

SCULLY: Well, I hate to say this  but I think that the best thing for Billy and his family is if he's removed to an institution under the observation of people who are experienced in these things.

DOGGETT: You mean, remove him? Take him away? After all his family's been through?

SCULLY: This is not a normal child, Agent Doggett, and this is not a normal act.

DOGGETT: You make it sound like he's possessed. Call the exorcist. He's a kid-- a kid who's been through who knows what kind of hell. Give him a chance. How do you know he's not trying to communicate something?

SCULLY: And what's the message?

(DOGGETT has no answer.)

SCULLY: Yes, he's a kid, Agent Doggett, you're right. He's a kid who materialized out of thin air, unaged. Do you not somehow recognize how strange this is?

(DOGGETT looks back down at the knife. A simple five-armed symbol is engraved on the handle of the knife.)

DOGGETT: Did anybody notice this? This symbol?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Yeah. Yeah, uh, I was going to mention that to you 'cause it's... uh kind of weird.

DOGGETT: Weird how?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Well, like I told you, we tried everything to find that boy, and who abducted him went so far as to bring in a police psychic ten years back-- came up with that very same symbol.

DOGGETT: Well, how exactly did he come up with it?

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: She. Sharon Pearl. Couldn't say how it came to her.

SCULLY: I've seen this symbol before, too.

DOGGETT: You have?

(SCULLY goes into the observation room. She picks up the sheet of paper that BILLY was drawing on and holds it up against the window for the men to see. It is covered with many small copies of the same symbol.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: I'll be damned.



SCENE 10

(BILLY's bedroom. LISA UNDERWOOD is dressing him. He stands still, not resisting, just staring at her. "All the pretty little horses" is playing.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: We love you so much, Billy. Whatever happened... we want to put it behind us. Be a family again. And if you could help us to understand what you're going through, we could move forward.

(She finishes dressing him and reaches for him. For the first time, he tries to pull away, resist.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: No, we're just going to go see a doctor, someone you might want to talk to. We're coming right back.

(She picks him up and carries him tenderly out of the room and down the hall.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Nothing's going to happen. Mommy won't let anything happen to you.

(JOSH opens his door a crack to watch them leave. BILLY stares at him.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Billy, I just want you to get the help you need so we can all live here together and be happy. Okay? Come on, sweetie.

(As they go down the stares, JOSH sighs, closes the door, and goes to the window where he can look down at the driveway where DOUG UNDERWOOD is getting the minivan ready. LISA UNDERWOOD leads BILLY outside and DOUG UNDERWOOD sighs as he buckles BILLY into the back seat. LISA UNDERWOOD is watching from the other side of the van.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: (slightly irritated) I'll take him, Doug. If it's such a strain on you.

(DOUG UNDERWOOD closes one of the cars sliding doors and looks up to JOSH's window. LISA UNDERWOOD closes the other sliding door and joins her husband in front of the car.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Look, if you think a shrink can give us some answers, fine. I just don't want this to ruin our other son's life in any way.

(He gets in the minivan and starts the engine. When he looks over his shoulder to back out of the driveway, BILLY has vanished from his seat.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Billy? Billy?

(Billy is not in the van. DOUG UNDERWOOD gets out of the van and he and LISA UNDERWOOD begin calling for him.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Where's Billy?

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Billy?

(THEY CONTINUE CALLING HIS NAME AS: )

(Upstairs, JOSH turns from where he was looking out the window. BILLY is standing right behind him.)

JOSH: (screaming) Dad!

QUICK CUT TO:

(PURNELL's trailer. MARCIA PURNELL is following her son out of the house.)

MARCIA PURNELL: I don't want no more trouble here, Ronnie. Whatever you're doing, you do it somewhere else.

RONNIE PURNELL: You ever get off your lazy ass to do anything but hassle me?!

MARCIA PURNELL: Watch your mouth. I got company coming and he won't take your lip.

RONNIE PURNELL: Who?

(An old pick-up drives up to the house. A truly revolting man, CAL JEPPY, is driving. He is about 50, balding, thick red-brown mustache and goatee. Probably smells bad and doesn't brush his teeth often. RONNIE PURNELL is not happy to see him.)

RONNIE PURNELL: You tell him to stay out of my face.

(CAL JEPPY gets out of the truck and walks swiftly toward RONNIE PURNELL as RONNIE PURNELL avoids his gaze and tries to get away.)

RONNIE PURNELL: Get away from me.

(CAL JEPPY corners him and begins taunting him.)

CAL JEPPY: Where you going, weirdo? Hey. Hey. You steal those clothes off a fat man.? Or'd... you just shrink? Hmm?

(RONNIE PURNELL tries to get past him, but CAL JEPPY blocks him.)

MARCIA PURNELL: (smiling) Hey, you going to get your butt in this trailer, traveling man?

(CAL JEPPY finally lets RONNIE PURNELL get around him, then he walks over to MARCIA and they begin the redneck mating ritual.)

CAL JEPPY: Yeah. All depends on, uh... what you've got in mind. Hmm?

(They kiss. Eww.)

BOTH: Mmm.

(They laugh and she squeals as he slaps her behind and chases her into the house. RONNIE PURNELL walks into the woods nearby. He finds a spot on the ground next to a large twisted stump, and, with effort, pulls out a small shovel hidden under the leaves. He begins digging. Only a few inches below the surface, we see that he has uncovered a small skull.)



SCENE 11
UNDERWOOD RESIDENCE
5:53 PM

(The living room of the UNDERWOOD house. As SCULLY and DOGGETT watch, a woman, SHARON PEARL, about 40, is testing a handheld tape recorder.)

SHARON PEARL: ( on tape ) Testing, one, two, three...

(DOUG UNDERWOOD comes over to SCULLY and DOGGETT. He is quietly frustrated.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: This is great. Now, I've got a psychic sitting in my living room who's going to tell me what's wrong with my son.

SCULLY: I understand your misgivings, Mr. Underwood, but perhaps you can look at this as just another avenue.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: An avenue to what?

DOGGETT: We're going to solve this case, Mr. Underwood. We're going to find out who did this to your son.

DOUG UNDERWOOD: And then what? What am I left with? A kid who stabs knives into his brother's mattress? You don't know the half of it. He gives everyone but his mother the creeps with that stare of his.

DOGGETT: I just know that this is going to tear you apart. It's going to tear your family apart. And you can't let it. You've got to save them from the damage this can do.

(JOSH comes down the stairs.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: I'll be happy to save what I can. Come on, Josh. Let's go.

(DOUG UNDERWOOD leaves the house with JOSH.)

SHARON PEARL: (looking at her watch) Is this going to happen?

DOGGETT: Shouldn't you be telling us that?

(SHARON PEARL smiles.)

SHARON PEARL: You're no doubt confused, Agent Doggett. I take psychic readings not see through walls.

(LISA UNDERWOOD brings BILLY downstairs.)

LISA UNDERWOOD: Sorry to keep you waiting.

SHARON PEARL: Mrs. Underwood. I'm Sharon Pearl. I consulted on your son's disappearance back in 1990.

(LISA UNDERWOOD nods. SHARON PEARL kneels down to BILLY's level.)

SHARON PEARL: And you're Billy?

(She looks at him. Her warm friendly expression shifts to shock, then horror.)

SCULLY: Ms. Pearl? Are you okay?

SHARON PEARL: (voice trembling) There are very powerful forces at work here. Working through this boy. Drawing him to his brother. I feel this force...

(She lets go of BILLY's hands and stands.)

SHARON PEARL: I feel this force...

(SHARON PEARL tears her eyes away from BILLY and looks straight at DOGGETT.)

SHARON PEARL:  coming through you. You lost someone just like Billy.

(SCULLY looks at DOGGETT in surprise. Suddenly SHARON PEARL begins convulsing and speaking gibberish.)

[CLOSED CATIONING: SCULLY: Call 9-1-1.]

(SCULLY and DOGGETT run to where SHARON PEARL has fallen onto the couch.)

DOGGETT: What's happening to her?

[CLOSED CAPTIONING:

SCULLY: She's having a grand mal seizure.]

(SHARON PEARL's forehead begins to swell. The skin ripples into the five-armed symbol. She seems to be in agony.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(SCULLY and DOGGETT look at each other, then back at the woman.)

(PURNELL trailer. As RONNIE PURNELL comes out of the woods and gets into his car, CAL JEPPY comes out of the house. He is wearing a brown sleeveless shirt and drinking a beer. He looks pretty relaxed. Eww.)

CAL JEPPY: Hey, Fartknocker.

(RONNIE PURNELL tries to start his car engine. It won't turn over. CAL JEPPY leans in the car window.)

CAL JEPPY: Where are you going in such a big hurry? Hmm? What's the matter? Got something in your ears?

(CAL JEPPY sticks his finger in RONNIE PURNELL's ear. RONNIE PURNELL flinches and avoids looking at him.)

RONNIE PURNELL: Don't .. don't touch me, Cal.

CAL JEPPY: Oh, listen to him. No wonder he wears them baggy britches. Our Ronnie's a big man now.

(He takes a swig of the beer.)

CAL JEPPY: Your old lady said the cops came and talked to you. Hmm?

(In a sudden burst of violence, CAL JEPPY smashes the beer bottle against the side of the car and holds the edge of the broken neck against RONNIE PURNELL's head.)

CAL JEPPY: I am talking to you, not the side of your head. Better mind your Ps and Qs, Jones. Or I'm going to tell them what you did to that little boy. I'm going to tell them what you got buried out there in the woods.

(RONNIE PURNELL slowly turns to look at him. CAL JEPPY stabs him with the bottle right behind his left ear. RONNIE PURNELL gasps in pain and puts his hand to his head as MARCIA PURNELL looks out the front door.)

MARCIA PURNELL: What's going on with you two?

CAL JEPPY: Talking about cars.

(CAL JEPPY "affectionately" slaps the hood of the car and RONNIE PURNELL's shoulder, then walks back to the house as RONNIE PURNELL gets the car started and drives away quickly, tires spinning in the dirt.)



SCENE 12

(Night. Outside the UNDERWOOD house later. An ambulance is pulling away. LISA UNDERWOOD leads BILLY back into the house. SCULLY joins DOGGETT in their car.)

SCULLY: Well, they've got her stabilized and it looks like she's going to be okay... if you're at all curious about her condition.

DOGGETT: I'd be more curious if I believed it.

SCULLY: Believed what?

DOGGETT: The act.

SCULLY: You think that was an act?

DOGGETT: It's pretty standard fare, isn't it? Float a few choice revelations, as if they came from on high, roll around on the floor.

SCULLY: You saw that symbol appear on her forehead.

DOGGETT: It's a damn good trick. Don't ask me how she does it.

(SCULLY takes out the tape recorder and pushes play. We hear the recording of SHARON PEARL speaking gibberish. DOGGETT does not want to hear it.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, please.

SCULLY: No. I think you want to hear this.

(More gibberish.)

SCULLY: Now listen to it backwards.

(She pushes the reverse button. A garbled singing plays.)

VOICE: (singing) When you wake 

DOGGETT: What was that?

VOICE: (singing)  you shall have 

SCULLY: It's a child singing.

VOICE: (singing)  all the pretty little horses...

SCULLY: Lyrics.

(SCULLY hums the tune along with the voice.)

VOICE: (singing) Hush-a-bye, don't you cry... go to sleep, little baby...

SCULLY: You hear that, under the noise? Now...

(SCULLY looks back down at the recorder. DOGGETT notices RONNIE PURNELL's car pull up across the street.)

DOGGETT: What's he doing here?

(RONNIE PURNELL stops his car in front of the house. As he is looking at the house, a small hand touches his shoulder. RONNIE PURNELL turns and stares in shock at the calm face of BILLY.)

RONNIE PURNELL: Get away from me.

(RONNIE PURNELL starts to get out of the car, but DOGGETT has come up to his window.)

DOGGETT: (knocking on the window) Ronnie, open up the car!

(DOGGETT also sees BILLY sitting in the passenger seat. Panicked, RONNIE PURNELL starts the car and drives away.)

DOGGETT: Ronnie. Ronnie, stop the car!

(DOGGETT, ala Terminator 2, begins chasing the car.)

DOGGETT: (yelling) Agent Scully, he's got Billy!

(SCULLY slides over to the driver's seat and circles the block to cut off RONNIE PURNELL on a side street. They screech to a halt. SCULLY gets out of the car, gun ready.)

SCULLY: Get out of the car! Now!

(He does, hands up. DOGGETT catches up with them, and roughly turns RONNIE PURNELL against the car.)

DOGGETT: Don't move, Ronnie.

(DOGGETT sees that BILLY is no longer in the car.)

DOGGETT: Where's Billy?

SCULLY: I thought you said Billy was in the car?

DOGGETT: Where's Billy?

(RONNIE PURNELL doesn't answer. DOGGETT gives him a small shove, and then turns away angrily.)



SCENE 13
DALE'S FOOD AND GAS
9:17 PM

(DOUG UNDERWOOD starts filling up the gas tank. JOSH is waiting in the car.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: I'm going to go pay. You want anything?

(JOSH shakes his head.)

DOUG UNDERWOOD: Josh, are you okay, buddy?

(He nods. DOUG UNDERWOOD goes into the station. JOSH's sits up eagerly as he sees a man leading a saddled pony to a horse trailer next to another pump.

JOSH: Dad, can I...?

(Dad can't hear. JOSH can't wait. He's ten years old and it's a pony! He gets out of the van and goes over to the trailer.)

JOSH: Mister?

(The pony has already been loaded into the trailer. No sign of the man. JOSH looks through the slats on the side of the trailer.)

JOSH: Pony, hey, pony. Hey, there you are.

(He reaches his arms through the slats.)

[CLOSED CAPTIONING:

JOSH: are you in there? Is it okay if I pet you? Hey, there you are. Come here, pony. Come here, boy. I'm just going to pet you, okay? Come on. ]

(Suddenly, JOSH's body slams up against the side of the trailer as his arms are grasped from within. The front of the dusty trailer advertises "Cal's Pony Ride-Along" and has the five-armed symbol as the central motif. JOSH screams as the pickup truck pulls the trailer and him away.)

JOSH: Help! Help!



SCENE 14

(Sheriff's office. DOGGETT watches as SHERIFF SANCHEZ books RONNIE PURNELL. DOGGETT is pacing impatiently.)

SCULLY: Count to ten, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: He took Billy.

SCULLY: (sighs) He couldn't have.

DOGGETT: How are you going to back that up with Billy now missing from his home?

SCULLY: By the certain knowledge that not five minutes earlier, I saw him enter his home with his mother.

DOGGETT: I saw him! I saw Billy riding in the car with Ronnie. Why else would Ronnie take off like he did?

SCULLY: It's impossible, Agent Doggett, like everything else about this case. Like how Billy can be in his home one minute and then in Ronnie's car the next. Everything about this case is impossible.

DOGGETT: This kid is the key, Agent Scully. I've been saying that from the beginning and I'll say it now.

(SHERIFF SANCHEZ opens the door.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: Agent Doggett, Agent Scully, I got bad news on top of worse. Josh, the Underwood's other little boy, has disappeared.

(They both look at him.)

SHERIFF SANCHEZ: I'm not joking, not even close. I got the parents out here now. Come on.

(SCULLY follows SHERIFF SANCHEZ into another room where the UNDERWOODs are waiting, worried. DOGGETT calls after her.)

DOGGETT: I've got to talk to this kid, Agent Scully. I'm absolutely sure.

(SCULLY gives him a look, then turns to the parents.)



SCENE 15

(RONNIE PURNELL is escorted into an interrogation room.)

DOGGETT: Have a seat, Ronnie.

RONNIE PURNELL: (sitting) I know what you're going to ask... but I got no answer.

DOGGETT: Well, there can be only one answer, right? I mean, why else did you go to the house? You went there for Billy, to get him back.

RONNIE PURNELL: No.

DOGGETT: You had him in your car.

RONNIE PURNELL: I don't know how he got there.

DOGGETT: Then why go to the house at all?

RONNIE PURNELL: Because I didn't believe you.

**(RONNIE PURNELL has a flashback of BILLY at the fair swinging and calling to his mother, "Mom!" He sees himself standing next to the swing, something hidden in his palm, maybe the knife?)**

DOGGETT: You didn't believe what? What's so hard to believe, Ronnie?

RONNIE PURNELL: You said I could talk to him.

DOGGETT: (cop mode) You needed to talk to him. After all those years, you couldn't live without him. You wanted him back. All those years, Ronnie. All those years. Where'd you keep him?

**(Another flashback, this of himself looking a BILLY, bound and gagged, perhaps under the slatted floor of a barn.)**

RONNIE PURNELL: Man, you don't understand.

DOGGETT: You were sorry you let him go.

RONNIE PURNELL: (voice starting to tremble) No, I... I couldn't let him go.

**(Flashback of himself using the knife through a metal grate to cut the rope binding BILLY's wrists together. He is singing softly to him in the voice we heard on the tape. "When you wake you shall have all the pretty little horses." He looks over his shoulder in fear at someone entering the barn.)**

DOGGETT: Who else knew about him? Your mom?

RONNIE PURNELL: No.

DOGGETT: Where'd you keep him?

RONNIE PURNELL: I didn't.

DOGGETT: What did you do to him?!

RONNIE PURNELL: I didn't do anything. I took care of him. I-I sang to him... you know, so he wouldn't be afraid.

DOGGETT: (pause, then gently) Afraid of who? Who was he afraid of, Ronnie? Somebody else involved? Somebody else make you do it? He take that other kid, too? Billy's brother? He take him?

(RONNIE PURNELL looks worried.)

DOGGETT: You're afraid of him, too, aren't you? You're a victim, just like those other kids. Is that right? You... me, Billy. This is our chance, man. What's his name?

(RONNIE PURNELL hesitates, his lips moving, almost ready to speak.)



SCENE 16

(Later that night, PURNELL trailer yard. Overhead shot of the five-armed pony walker we saw ten years ago. The horse trailer is parked outside the barn. Police cars arrive. DOGGETT and SCULLY get out of their car and run to the barn door.)

DOGGETT: FBI! Cal Jeppy! Come out!

(They enter the barn and find JOSH, bound and gagged under the floorboards. Together, they open a trapdoor and metal grate to free the boy.)

DOGGETT: All right. It's okay, Josh. You're okay. We're not going to hurt you.

(SCULLY looks out through the slatted side of the barn and sees CAL JEPPY running toward the wooded area.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett... He's on the run.

(Leaving SCULLY with JOSH, DOGGETT runs out of the barn and after CAL JEPPY. He yells to the backup officers.)

DOGGETT: He's in the woods!

(The others follow DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Watch your fire! There may be another boy!

(Gasping, CAL JEPPY runs through the woods. DOGGETT, flashlight in one hand, gun in the other, catches up with him.)

DOGGETT: Down on your knees!

(Panting, CAL JEPPY obeys.)

DOGGETT: Hands in the air! Where's the kid?!

CAL JEPPY: He's in the trailer.

DOGGETT: Other kid!

CAL JEPPY: There's no other kid.

DOGGETT: Billy Underwood!

CAL JEPPY: (terrified, confused) There's no other kid.

(DOGGETT turns and looks behind him. BILLY is standing there, a few feet away. DOGGETT turns back to CAL JEPPY and the other officers arriving.)

DOGGETT: Get this man in cuffs! Read him his rights! The kid's over...

(DOGGETT turns to show them where BILLY is. BILLY is gone. As the other officers cuff CAL JEPPY, DOGGETT walks over to where he saw BILLY standing a moment before. He looks down at the ground and stares at the small exposed skull that RONNIE PURNELL uncovered earlier.)



SCENE 17

(Next morning. Area is taped off with crime scene tape. The simple melody of "All the Pretty Little Horses" is heard. DOUG and LISA UNDERWOOD are looking at the little crude grave. DOUG UNDERWOOD is softly crying. DOGGETT watches them a moment, then crosses to join SCULLY a few yards away. They speak quietly and urgently.)

DOGGETT: I don't believe it.

SCULLY: Okay, the clothes, the age and condition of the bones, the location of the grave. There is no doubt that that is Billy Underwood's skeleton that is in that grave.

DOGGETT: We spent time with this boy. Doctors took Billy's blood. You examined him yourself. Now, I can't accept it. I can't believe we're asking them to.

SCULLY: I know, but the forensic evidence is going to come out, and what then? What if I'm right?

DOGGETT: Well, what then, Agent Scully? What we do? We move on, let it go, case closed?

SCULLY: Look, I know where you are with this. I have been there. I know what you're feeling-- that you've failed and that you have to explain this somehow. And maybe you can.

DOGGETT: Not if that's Billy's body, I can't.

SCULLY: But maybe that's explanation enough. That that's not Billy's brother lying in that grave, too. That that man who did this is never going to be able to do it again. Isn't that what you wanted, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, don't ask me to believe that this is some kind of justice from beyond the grave.

SCULLY: All I'm saying is that maybe you succeeded... whether you're willing to see that or not.

(Lullaby melody again. She holds his gaze for a moment, then walks off alone into the woods. DOUG UNDERWOOD wipes his face and stands up from the grave. He and his wife embrace each other tightly. DOGGETT watches them silently.)

ALL THE PRETTY LITTLE HORSES

Hush-a-bye, don't you cry
Go to sleep my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horses.
Dapples and Grays
Pintos and Bays
All the pretty little horses

Way out yonder, down in the meadow
Poor little baby crying, "Mama."
Birds and butterflies, flutter round your eyes
Poor little baby crying, "Mama."

Hush-a-bye, don't you cry
Go to sleep my little baby.
When you wake, you shall have
All the pretty little horses.
Dapples and Grays
Pintos and Bays
All the pretty little horses.

[THE END]
                                         REDRUM



SCENE 1

(Close-up of a complete spider web, a small spider sitting in the middle. A radio sounds from a distance.)

RADIO ANNOUNCER VOICE: Good morning. It is Friday, December 8, and you're tuned in to WXOP, Baltimore's news radio serving all of Maryland and the greater Chesapeake Region, 24-7. We've got your Friday morning trouble spots: A two-car pileup with a fatality, on the 97 at...

(Camera focuses on the face below it. The face belongs to an African-American man, about 40, MARTIN WELLS. He is wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and lying on a prison bunk. There is a fresh scar on his right cheek. He sits up in confusion and touches the wound gingerly. A buzzer sounds. The automatic door to his cell slides open and a TALL GUARD enters.)

TALL GUARD: It's time.

(The GUARDS lead MARTIN WELLS down a hallway. SCULLY and DOGGETT are waiting at the end of the hall. They both look tense. MARTIN WELLS recognizes DOGGETT.)

MARTIN WELLS: John!

DOGGETT: Press got word you're taking him out the Groves Street exit. It looks like Woodstock out there.

SCULLY: I suggest you postpone the transfer. We can get him out later once the crowd disperses.

MARTIN WELLS: Transfer me where?

TALL GUARD: No, they'll camp out for days. We're going ahead with it.

MARTIN WELLS: John. John, what is going on?

(The door is opened and the GUARDS begin leading MARTIN WELLS to a prisoner transfer truck. Reporters and news crews surround them.)

REPORTER: Mr. Wells! Mr. Wells! Why did you do it?

DOGGETT: All right, back up! Back up. Give him some room. Come on, clear out. Back up.

(MARTIN WELLS recognizes an older AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAN at the edge of the crowd and calls out to him hopefully.)

MARTIN WELLS: Al!

(With hatred in his eyes, the older man, AL CAWDRY, pulls out a gun and points it at MARTIN WELLS.)

DOGGETT: Down! Weapon!

(Everyone falls to the ground, but it is too late for MARTIN WELLS. AL shoots and hits MARTIN WELLS in the chest. The GUARDS wrestle AL to the ground. SCULLY presses her fingers to MARTIN WELLS' neck to monitor his pulse.)

SCULLY: (sound distorted) Somebody call a medic!

(Sound of heartbeat. Everything in MARTIN WELLS' perspective slows. Heartbeat slows. He looks at SCULLY'S wristwatch, time, 8:20, 44 seconds, date, the 8th, and his eyes close. The watch stops. Heartbeat stops. Then the watch begins moving backwards.)

SCENE 2

(Black screen.)

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7 8:23 AM

(MARTIN WELLS wakes up again on the prison bunk. The scar on his cheek looks fresher than it did in the scene from the teaser. Remembering, panicked, he feels under his t-shirt for a bullet wound. Nothing. He looks up and sees the spider just beginning to spin her web. The buzzer sounds and the door slides open. SCULLY and DOGGETT enter.)

MARTIN WELLS: John...

(SCULLY and DOGGETT are all business. SCULLY holds up an evidence bag containing a key card.)

SCULLY: Do you recognize this, Mr. Wells? Have you seen it before?

MARTIN WELLS: Um... yes. Who are you?

(DOGGETT has no patience for the man who seems to know him. MARTIN WELLS is very confused.)

DOGGETT: Don't even  Martin.

MARTIN WELLS: John, what am I doing here? I'm in this cell, I don't know where I am or how I even got here and everyone's acting like...

DOGGETT: I swear to God, on top of everything else, do not play this with me. I will not be party to some half-assed, 11th-hour insanity defence.

MARTIN WELLS: What? John 

DOGGETT: (furious) It's time to start telling me the truth!

(MARTIN WELLS stares at DOGGETT, confused. SCULLY is uncomfortable.)

SCULLY: This key card, Mr. Wells... you do recognize it. Is that correct?

MARTIN WELLS: Yes, it's the swipe card that they use at the apartment building. For all I know, it's mine.

SCULLY: It is yours. It was found in the dumpster behind the Strand Hotel.

DOGGETT: You tossed it there, didn't you? You had just enough time to drive to Baltimore and commit the murder.

MARTIN WELLS: Wait. Murder? What murder?

DOGGETT: (accusing) Then drive back to DC. Toss the key card. That way, you could claim it was stolen. Make it look like you spent your whole night watching pay- per-view in your hotel room. Right?

MARTIN WELLS: Please...

(He looks to SCULLY.)

MARTIN WELLS: What murder? What is he talking about?

DOGGETT: Well, maybe this will jog your memory, buddy.

(DOGGETT ruthlessly holds up a colour photo of a young African-American woman, brutally slashed to death with a knife. MARTIN WELLS recoils from the photo in horror, dissolving into tears, hand over his mouth.)

MARTIN WELLS: Vicky. My wife. This isn't happening. This is not happening.

(DOGGETT backs away, not sure what to think of WELLS. The TALL GUARD enters the cell.)

TALL GUARD: Court van is waiting.



SCENE 3

(Black Screen.)

BALTIMORE CIRCUIT COURT
10:12 AM

(Courtroom. MARTIN WELLS is led through the courthouse in chains and orange jumpsuit. He is seated with a young defence lawyer, JANET WILSON.)

JANET WILSON: All right... dignity. That is your strong suit. Play it. Don't lower your eyes. It makes you look guilty.

JANET WILSON: Now, we drew Judge Kinberg. What's your relationship with him?

MARTIN WELLS: Benjamin?

JANET WILSON: First-name basis. Excellent.

BAILIFF: All rise.

(All stand. As if out of habit, MARTIN WELLS is one of the first to stand.)

BAILIFF: I would remind the members of the gallery to turn off all cellular phones and paging devices. Hear ye, hear ye. That all who have business before this court in the State of Maryland draw near and be heard.

(MARTIN WELLS sees the man who shot him in the teaser sitting in the gallery. AL glances at him, then looks away.)

MARTIN WELLS: (softly) Al?

JANET WILSON: What?

MARTIN WELLS: He shot me.

JANET WILSON: Who? Your father-in-law? What are you talking about?

BAILIFF; Circuit court, Department 6-B is now in session, the Honourable Benjamin Kinberg presiding. Thursday, the seventh day of December.

MARTIN WELLS: Thursday? It's not Thursday.

JANET WILSON: Shh!

MARTIN WELLS: (insistent) It's Saturday. Yesterday was Friday and...

JANET WILSON: Today is Thursday. There's no court on Saturday. You know that. (concerned) Martin, do you feel all right?

(JUDGE pounds gavel.)

JUDGE KINBERG: Case Number 8ABX03: District v. Martin Wells. Charge of first- degree murder.

(MARTIN WELLS winces.)

JUDGE BENJAMIN KINBERG: The defence has requested a hearing on bail?

JANET WILSON: (standing) Yes, your Honor, we have. As I'm sure you'd agree, Mr. Wells' status as a prosecutor makes him a target. The court puts his life in danger by keeping him in custody.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY CARTER: Your Honor, I have the assurances of the Baltimore Department of Corrections that Mr. Wells' safety while in custody is not a concern.

JANET WILSON: Furthermore, as your Honor will certainly agree, Mr. Wells is an upstanding citizen and a respected member of the Maryland Bar, held in high esteem by all his peers.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY CARTER: Your Honor, with cold calculation, Martin Wells brutally stabbed his wife in their own home. He poses a threat to the public and should be denied bail.

(She holds up a bloody evidence document.)

JANET WILSON: He doesn't pose a threat to anyone, your Honor and he has two small children who need him at home.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY CARTER: Why? Because their mom's not around.

JUDGE BENJAMIN KINBERG: (warning) Ms. Carter. (he looks at MARTIN WELLS) Martin, I can't tell you how sorry I am to see you on that side of the aisle. I hope you'll forgive me when I do exactly what you as a prosecutor, would demand. Bail is denied. I will, however order Mr. Wells transferred to a more secure facility in the interest of his safety.

MARTIN WELLS: Transferred? No, Ben. You can't do that. I can't be transferred.

(MARTIN WELLS stands and walks urgently toward the bench. He points back toward AL sitting in the gallery.)

MARTIN WELLS: He'll kill me.

JUDGE BENJAMIN KINBERG: Martin.

MARTIN WELLS: Tomorrow morning-- if today is really Thursday-- then tomorrow is Friday, and that's when he's going to do it. He's going to shoot me as I'm being transferred.

JUDGE BENJAMIN KINBERG: Bailiff.

(Two OFFICERS grab MARTIN WELLS.)

MARTIN WELLS: You don't understand! It'll happen! It'll happen! Judge, listen to me! Ben, it'll happen! He's going to kill me! Ben!

(The OFFICERS drag MARTIN WELLS out of the courtroom.)



SCENE 4

(Interrogation room. MARTIN WELLS is sitting at one side of the room in an orange prison jumpsuit. SCULLY and DOGGETT enter.)

SCULLY: Mr. Wells, we understand that you had an interesting morning in court. What is it that you'd like to speak with us about?

MARTIN WELLS: You're John's partner?

(DOGGETT is irritated.)

DOGGETT: For god sakes, Martin. Agent Scully. You know that. You met her yesterday.

MARTIN WELLS: Yesterday?

DOGGETT: Yeah. Yesterday. Wednesday.

MARTIN WELLS: Wednesday?

SCULLY: Are you saying that you don't remember? What is the last thing that you do remember?

MARTIN WELLS: Being shot by my father-in-law.

DOGGETT: You're wasting our time.

(DOGGETT starts to leave, but turns again to listen to MARTIN WELLS. MARTIN WELLS focuses mainly on SCULLY.)

MARTIN WELLS: Listen. I don't know what I experienced. But what if it was a premonition? A glimpse of the future. I mean, you do hear about these kind of things.

SCULLY: Yes... You do.

(SCULLY is reluctant to believe, but is open to the possibility. She sits down.)

SCULLY: Mr. Wells, this shooting aside is there anything else that you remember before that?

MARTIN WELLS: Um... I was in DC... uh... for a sentencing hearing. I was staying at the Strand Hotel like you said.

SCULLY: That was three days ago, Mr. Wells. Are you telling us that you don't remember anything else? Not the murder of your wife?

MARTIN WELLS: No.

(DOGGETT doesn't believe a word.)

DOGGETT: Out of the blue. Charged with murder. You wake up one morning and you can't remember a damn thing. Martin, you haven't offered us one scrap of evidence to support your story. Now, as your friend, I'm going to listen to anything you have to say, but I will not be lied to.

MARTIN WELLS: I'm not lying to you. You're talking to me about key cards. I'm sitting in a jail cell. I don't understand any of this. But I did not... kill Vicky.

SCULLY: If you truly don't remember... then how can you be certain that you didn't?

(MEARTIN WELLS considers this in surprise and fear.)



SCENE 5

(Later. MARTIN WELLS is sitting on his cell bunk. He has flashbacks of broken glass flying back into shape, VICKIE gasping in fear and pain, and a bloody knife rising. He blinks back to the present. He leans back against the wall, despondent. He sees the spider walking across her almost finished web. In a fit of rage, he tears down the web and stomps the little spider to death.)



SCENE 6

(Later, in a visitation room, he sees two young girls being led through the hall of the jail. An Hispanic woman, TRINA, their nanny, is with them. They all have visitor's passes. He smiles happily and kneels to the floor, his arms open.)

MARTIN WELLS: Courtney! Haley! Hey, guys! Oh! It's so good to see you.

(The girls, about 4 and 6, look at the floor and don't run to him. MARTIN WELLS is confused and hurt.)

MARTIN WELLS: Wh...?! Come on! Come on, give Daddy a big hug.

TRINA: Hug your father, ninas.

(Obediently, the girls go to be hugged. He holds them tightly.)

MARTIN WELLS: Mmm...

(He looks up at TRINA.)

MARTIN WELLS: How are they holding up?

TRINA: (tears in her voice) Good. Good, Mr. Wells. They want to know when you're coming home.

(MARTIN WELLS looks at his daughters.)

MARTIN WELLS: Oh. See, um... Daddy has some things that he has to do-- very, very important things. That's why I have to be here right now, but then, guess what? (smiles) I'll be coming home.

(The older girl, COURTNEY looks at the floor.)

COURTNEY: Grandpa says they won't let you come home.

(MARTIN WELLS is shocked and saddened by this. He hugs his girls close again.)

MARTIN WELLS: Oh...

(MARTIN WELLS has another flashback of the glass reforming, Vickie gasping, and of a broken strand of pearls bouncing up. He comes back to the present with a start. He looks up at TRINA.)

MARTIN WELLS: Trina, I need you to get me something out of the apartment-- something from the girls' room.



SCENE 7

(The defence lawyer, JANET WILSON, enters MARTIN WELLS' interrogation room. A guard lets her in.)

JANET WILSON: Thank you.

(She hands him a pastel stuffed bear and closes the blinds. She is uncomfortable.)

JANET WILSON: Why didn't you mention this to me before the bail hearing?

MARTIN WELLS: I hadn't even met you before the bail hearing.

(She stares about him, confused. MARTIN WELLS digs through the animal's stuffing and pulls out a hidden camera recorder.)

MARTIN WELLS: Nanny-cam.

JANET WILSON: Oh, Martin, I wish you'd talked to me about this before. I really don't know if this is a great idea.

MARTIN WELLS: This tape may have the murderer on it.

JANET WILSON: Whatever happens to be on that tape you know that I am an officer of the court. I have to share this with the prosecution.

MARTIN WELLS: You think I'm guilty?

(She starts to answer. He waves her silent.)

MARTIN WELLS: Let's... let's clear this up right now. Here. My apartment.

(She joins him to look at the small viewfinder window. He is playing it in fast reverse. Police investigators are coming and going rapidly.)

MARTIN WELLS: That... That's the girls' room and this must be the police investigation. What time did the  murder occur?

JANET WILSON: The official report has the Police arriving at your apartment at 6:20AM Monday morning. Your key card was used at 4:17.

MARTIN WELLS: Which means the killer is somewhere in-between.

JANET WILSON: Wait. There's your wife.

(MARTIN WELLS swallows his emotion at the sight of VICKIE running her hand tiredly through her hair as she leans against the door of the girls' room late at night.)

MARTIN WELLS: Um... we must have missed something. Right there.

(He rewinds and fast forwards again through the police footage. Just before the police arrive, he stops at a figure in the doorway. The figure is familiar.)

JANET WILSON: Martin, that's you.

(JANET WILSON walks away. MARTIN WELLS stares at the image of himself for a moment, then lowers the camera.)



SCENE 8

(Morning. The sounds of a prison wake MARTIN WELLS up. He rubs his head and rises. He looks at the bunk above him. There is no cut on his face. The spider is crawling around, looking for the best place to build her web. The door slides open. The TALL GUARD steps into the cell.)

MARTIN WELLS: (defiantly) I'm not going.

TALL GUARD: How's that?

MARTIN WELLS: I told you. This is the day. If I go, I'll get shot. You cannot transfer me.

TALL GUARD: I don't plan to. Your lawyers want to see you.

(MARTIN WELLS is led into an interrogation room where his lawyer, BRENT TUFELD, 50's, is waiting for him. He is speaking quietly to JANET WILSON.)

BRENT TUFELD: There's my favourite client. Martin, you holding up all right?

(They shake hands.)

MARTIN WELLS: Brent, uh... I've been better.

BRENT TUFELD: We're going to beat this thing. Guaranteed. Martin, I have here one of the finest criminal defence specialists in the country. I want you to meet...

(MARTIN WELLS turns to JANET WILSON.)

MARTIN WELLS: We met. I've been thinking all night about the tape and I don't see you having to turn it over to the prosecution.

JANET WILSON: I'm sorry?

MARTIN WELLS: I obviously showed you that tape in a good faith effort to clear my name, not as an admission of guilt.

JANET WILSON: (confused) Um... Mr. Wells, I'm Janet Wilson. I don't think we've met.

(MARTIN WELLS stares at JANET WILSON.)

BRENT TUFELD: Martin, what is all this about a videotape?

MARTIN WELLS: The... Nanny-cam tape.

(JANET WILSON looks to TUFELD.)

MARTIN WELLS: (to TUFELD) That's why you're here, right?

BRENT TUFELD: I'm here to introduce you to your new attorney.

MARTIN WELLS: (to JANET WILSON) We met yesterday at the bail hearing. Don't you remember?

BRENT TUFELD: Martin, the bail hearing is set for tomorrow.

MARTIN WELLS: What day is this? What... day of the week... is this?

BRENT TUFELD: Wednesday. Wednesday the sixth.

MARTIN WELLS: Yesterday you told me it was Thursday. The day before that it was Friday. (realizing) It's backwards. Everything's going backwards.

(The LAWYERS are confused and concerned.)

BRENT TUFELD: Martin, I think we should have you speak to someone. You're under a hell of a lot of stress. Being locked up in this cesspool really doesn't help.

JANET WILSON: We can have you out of here by tomorrow afternoon. The prosecution's case is weak to say the least. They have no physical evidence tying you to the crime scene.

BRENT TUFELD: Plus, they don't have the key card that was used to access your apartment building.

MARTIN WELLS: (breathing sharply, to himself) The key card...

JANET WILSON: (confidently) Without it, they've got nothing.



SCENE 9

(Prison exercise yard. Several prisoners are playing basketball. A large African American prisoner sees MARTIN WELLS walking through the yard. He leans down and whispers something to an evil looking HISPANIC MAN who is lifting weights. The HISPANIC MAN takes notice. A YOUNG BLACK MAN, SHORTY, sees the look and teases MARTIN WELLS.)

SHORTY: Oh, yeah. (laugh) Somebody likes you, my brother.

(MARTIN WELLS is not amused.)

SHORTY: (sarcastically) Come on, man. I'm just messing with you. What, you ain't got no sense of humour, Counsellor?

MARTIN WELLS: Do I know you?

SHORTY: No, you don't know me. Damn sure put me in here, though.

(MARTIN WELLS recognizes him.)

MARTIN WELLS: Possession with intent. And concealed weapon.

SHORTY: Mm-hmm. That concealed weapon was a pipe wrench. I was on my way to my baby's mama's house to unstick the Pepsi caps from out her garbage disposer, but I told you all that! "Concealed weapon" added six months to my sentence, man. You remember my name?

MARTIN WELLS: (avoiding his eyes) No, I don't remember your name. All I needed to know about you was that you broke the law.

SHORTY: I broke the law. Well, then, I guess that makes you "Wife Killer, Esq."

(MARTIN WELLS turns to face him, angrily. SHORTY laughs without humour. MARTIN WELLS walks away through the yard. As he passes a table where some prisoners are playing dominoes, a GANGBANGER hits him from behind, making him knock the dominoes to the ground. One of the DOMINO PLAYING GANGBANGERS glares at MARTIN WELLS.)

DOMINO PLAYING GANGBANGER: Yo! Pick 'em up you stumbling bitch.

ANOTHER PLAYER: Come on.

(Reluctantly, MARTIN WELLS kneels down and begins picking up the dominoes. He turns to see the HISPANIC MAN beside him. There is a spider web tattoo on one of his hands in which he is concealing a blade. MARTIN WELLS falls back and screams in pain as the SPIDER-MAN slashes him across the face. MARTIN WELLS rolls on the ground and cries in agony as the other prisoners walk around him, the code of silence in full effect.)



SCENE 10

(Interrogation room. MARTIN WELLS, fresh cut on his face, greets DOGGETT and SCULLY as they enter. DOGGETT winces at the sight of the cut.)

DOGGETT: Aw, geez, Martin. Your face.

MARTIN WELLS: It's all right. Appreciate your coming to see me. Agent Scully, I especially wanted to talk to you.

(SCULLY shakes his hand.)

SCULLY: It's nice to meet you. I'm sorry it's not under better circumstances.

MARTIN WELLS: This is the day we meet... something is happening to me... something I need to try to explain to you, to you both. I'm moving backward in time. Every morning I wake up, it's the day before. For me, yesterday was Thursday, the day before that was Friday, only it's all new to me. Every single morning I wake up, I can only remember what's happened the following day.

(SCULLY thinks about it.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, would you mind taking a closer look at his injuries, maybe check his scalp?

MARTIN WELLS: I know this all sounds crazy. But I'm telling you the truth. This cut, for instance. It was on my cheek when I woke up yesterday. I woke up this morning, it wasn't there. But then this afternoon I got cut. I killed a spider in my cell yesterday. First thing this morning, I woke up, it's back again. Because it happened the day before. I haven't actually killed it yet.

SCULLY: Mr. Wells, are you saying that you don't remember the day that your wife was murdered? I'm talking about two days ago, Monday.

MARTIN WELLS: No, I don't... remember it, because for me, it hasn't happened yet.

SCULLY: You do realize that you're not going to be able to prove this, right? I mean, if, uh... if tomorrow is really the day before today, then we won't have had this conversation.

DOGGETT: Oh, for crying out loud.

SCULLY: It means you're going to have to tell us all over again.

DOGGETT: Yeah, well, uh... make sure I skip that freaking meeting.

(In disgust, DOGGETT leaves the cell.)

SCULLY: Mr. Wells, let's say that, that all this is true. Why do you think it's happening?

MARTIN WELLS: I don't know. There has to be a reason.

SCULLY: What reason?

MARTIN WELLS: Something... I'm meant to understand? Although I don't know what it could be.

SCULLY: Maybe you already have the answer within you.

(SCULLY leaves and the door closes. MARTIN WELLS considers.)



SCENE 11

(JANET WILSON stands outside MARTIN WELLS' cell as he prepares to open a thick file that has been delivered to him through the door. She is worried about him.)

JANET WILSON: I'd really prefer to stay while you do this. Martin. I can take you through the chain of evidence.

MARTIN WELLS: I think I've done this before, thank you, Ms. Wilson.

(Reluctantly, she leaves. MARTIN WELLS opens the file on his wife's murder. SHORTY, broom in hand, walks by the cell.)

SHORTY: Mmm-hmm, looking for some loopholes, huh? Yeah, man, get yourself out of here. They just praying that you find that one little technicality so they can let you go.

MARTIN WELLS: I'm not looking for technicalities.

SHORTY: Well, what are you looking for, brother?

MARTIN WELLS: The truth.

SHORTY: The truth? (laughs) You better stick to the technicalities! The truth is going to keep you in here and make you somebody's bitch, that's what the truth's going to do. So put on that engineering hat, Casey Jones, because you've got a whole lot of trains to be pulling...

(He laughs and imitates train whistle and chugging as he walks away.)

SHORTY: The truth!

(Breathing heavily, MARTIN WELLS pulls out the photos of the murder. He sobs as he forces himself to look at the images of his dead wife.)

(Flashback of the glass reforming, blood seeping back into his dead wife, the bloody knife held by a man with a spider web tattooed on his hand.)

MARTIN WELLS: (gasping through his pain) I know who did it.



SCENE 12 (Black Screen)

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5
8:42 AM

(MARTIN WELLS wakes up disoriented on a couch in a modestly nice house. He has sheets and a pillow. He see that the TV is on, but muted. He rushes to the remote and turns the volume up. A news report, WKPZ, channel 9 is showing footage of MARTIN WELLS, eyes down, being taken away in the back of a police car.)

TV REPORTER: ...claims he arrived home from a business trip to discover the body of his wife in their living room. Apparently, Wells is now in seclusion at the home of a friend. Baltimore police are giving no indication whether he is a suspect in the murder or if there are indeed any suspects at this time. However, Channel 9 News has learned police are focusing their investigation on the whereabouts of an electronic key card, much like this one. The card in question belongs to Martin Wells. It was used by the killer to enter the Calvert House apartment building through the garage entrance. Wells claims no knowledge of the whereabouts of his key card...

(DOGGETT enters the front door holding two styrofoam cups of coffee. He is such a manly man that he won't even make coffee. He hands one to MARTIN WELLS.)

DOGGETT: Not something you want to wake up to.

TV REPORTER: ...and suggests it may have been stolen.

(MARTIN WELLS clicks the sound off again.)

DOGGETT: How you feeling?

MARTIN WELLS: Disconnected from reality, but I guess I'd better get used to it. Oh, um... thank you. I assume you... let me spend the night here, right? Thank you.

DOGGETT: Like I said, no problem.

(MARTIN WELLS begins putting on his shoes.)

MARTIN WELLS: So that makes today... Tuesday, the day after the murder. John... I know who did it now.

(DOGGETT sits and stares at him, perhaps surprised at how calm and rational MARTIN WELLS is.)

DOGGETT: You know who killed Vicky?

MARTIN WELLS: Mmm. Latino, maybe 40, five-ten, 185 pounds. He's got a tattoo of a spiderweb on his left hand.

DOGGETT: Martin, last night you told me you had no idea who did this.

MARTIN WELLS: Yeah, now I do. Well, trust me. I mean, I-I don't know his name but you can find him in the Baltimore city lockup. Call them. They can ID him based on what I just told you.

(DOGGETT goes to the kitchen phone and calls. MARTIN WELLS turns the volume back up. AL CAWDRY, the father-in-law, is now begin interviewed.)

AL CAWDRY: I just want to say my daughter was an exceptional person... (pause) ...One who was loved by everyone who knew her.

TV REPORTER: Sir, have the police identified any suspects in your daughter's death?

AL CAWDRY:: They're not telling us much.

TV REPORTER: What about rumours that your son-in-law is the prime suspect? What are your thoughts on that?

(AL CAWDRY begins to cry, and cannot answer.)

TV REPORTER: Reporting from the Calvert House Apartments this is Brian Blakeley. Back to you in the studio.

(MARTIN WELLS lowers his own eyes in pain, and turns the volume down again as DOGGETT hangs up and come back to the living room.)

DOGGETT: No prisoner fitting that description has been processed in the past 36 hours.

MARTIN WELLS: He's in there. He's got to be there.

DOGGETT: Sorry, Martin, he's not.

MARTIN WELLS: It must be too soon. He must not get arrested until later today-- Tuesday. That's how he could have been with me in lockup on Wednesday.

DOGGETT: Martin, you have seriously lost me. If you're trying to admit something to me or to yourself, I want you to just come out with it.

MARTIN WELLS: There's a reason all this is happening. Maybe I already have the answer.

DOGGETT: Well, how's that?

MARTIN WELLS: There's something in my apartment that you need to see, John.

(DOGGETT is sceptical.)



SCENE 13

(Black Screen.)

CALVERT HOUSE APARTMENTS
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
11:18 AM

(Very nice, expensive high-rise apartment. DOGGETT and MARTIN WELLS enter.)

DOGGETT: Where is it?

MARTIN WELLS: Uh, the girls' bedroom, right there.

(While DOGGETT goes to look in the room to the left, MARTIN WELLS slowly walks into the living room. Crime scene investigators have left their marks all over the place. MARTIN WELLS looks down at the shattered coffee table. In flashback, he sees the murder in reverse. The glass and table reassemble as VICKY rises screaming, pearls rising, bloody knife descending. He is jerked back to the present as DOGGETT enters carrying the stuffed animal containing the NannyCam.)

DOGGETT: Is this it?

(Later, the DOGGETT and MARTIN WELLS watch the tape on a small TV/VCR monitor.)

MARTIN WELLS: My daughters were at their grandparents'... thank god. Their bedroom door was open with a clear view of the front hallway. The nanny-cam is motion-activated so it should have caught anyone coming in or out of the house.

(Police investigators come and go quickly as the tape rewinds. DOGGETT stops it when MARTIN WELLS appears in the door.)

MARTIN WELLS: There I am. Nobody else on the tape between my wife and the police. I don't understand it.

DOGGETT: I'd say this makes you look more innocent than guilty. Look, there-- in the mirror...

(DOGGETT points to a bright reflection in the dresser mirror.)

DOGGETT: ...the sun. Your wife comes home before the murderer enters the building AT 4:17 AM. Her time of death is fixed shortly after that, well before sunrise. You came home later... when the sun was already up.

MARTIN WELLS: The killer turned off the tape.

DOGGETT: The only question is how?

MARTIN WELLS: There's a remote control for the nanny-cam. It's in a drawer by the front door but nobody else knew about it except for... Vicky... and me.

DOGGETT: Are you sure about that?

(MARTIN WELLS thinks.)



SCENE 14
TRINA GALVEZ RESIDENCE
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
12:36 PM

(Small house on a lower income residential street. MARTIN WELLS knock at the door. DOGGETT step up and pounds much more forcefully on the door. Oh, so manly!)

DOGGETT: FBI! I saw your curtains move. I know you're in there.

(TRINA, the nanny for MARTIN WELLS' daughters nervously opens the door, the security chain still in place.)

TRINA: M-Mr. Wells, I...

MARTIN WELLS: Trina, you knew about the Nanny-cam, didn't you? You told the killer about it. You must have given him my key card, too.

TRINA: Mr. Wells, I-I-I wasn't even there that night.

(DOGGETT has placed his palm against the center of the door. He unholsters his gun.)

DOGGETT: First thing you're supposed to say is: "What nanny-cam?"

(DOGGETT kicks the door open. TRINA screams and falls back. The HISPANIC SPIDERWEB MAN was standing behind the door holding a knife. He falls to the floor and DOGGETT punches him and restrains him. DOGGETT holds the tattooed hand up for MARTIN WELLS to see.)

DOGGETT: Is this your guy?

(MARTIN WELLS nods.)

TRINA: (crying hysterically) I'm so sorry, Mr. Wells. He said he'd hurt my family. He made me give him your key card.

(MARTIN WELLS won't look at her. TRINA sobs. MARTIN WELLS stares at the man on the floor.)



SCENE 15

(Police station. MARTIN WELLS watches through a window as DOGGETT interviews the SPIDERWEB MAN. DOGGETT comes out of the room.)

DOGGETT: His name is Cesar Ocampo. He's got a full sheet-- assault and narcotics. He knows the drill. He's a clam.

MARTIN WELLS: We'll have Trina's testimony against him.

DOGGETT: Or maybe we won't. He's got her so scared we can't count on her.

MARTIN WELLS: John, let me go in and talk to him. Please.

(DOGGETT stares at MARTIN WELLS.)

DOGGETT: He says he only wants to talk to you.

(MARTIN WELLS enters the interrogation room.)

MARTIN WELLS: Why?

CESAR OCAMPO: You don't know? You got my name, my record, and you can't figure it out?

MARTIN WELLS: Cesar Ocampo-- I don't know you. I never prosecuted you.

CESAR OCAMPO: Hector Ocampo, my brother.

MARTIN WELLS: What was the charge?

CESAR OCAMPO: Possession with intent. $50 worth of rock. It was his third strike, remember?

MARTIN WELLS: Yeah, I remember. I did my job.

CESAR OCAMPO: You sent him up for life!

MARTIN WELLS: I did my job! I do it ten times a week every week of the year... and for this, my wife was murdered? You take away my dignity, my reputation, my life, because your dirtbag brother is where he belongs?!

CESAR OCAMPO: Brady V. Maryland. Hey, you know what I'm talking about. Brady V. The State of Maryland. Prosecution's got to turn over exonerating evidence. You had the word of three people that wasn't Hector's rock. It was in a jacket that wasn't even his, left beside him in the club. You knew that. You knew that and you suppressed the evidence.

MARTIN WELLS: Are you trying to tell me that your brother is not a drug dealer?

CESAR OCAMPO: My brother was a busboy when you sent him up. He had two strikes on him. He wasn't dealing no more. You sent him up for who he used to be... and 'cause it was easy. You broke the law.

(MARTIN WELLS considers.)

MARTIN WELLS: I tell you what we'll do. You're going to be convicted of my wife's murder one way or another. Plead out now and I'll look into your brother's case. Maybe I'll find a way to recommend a reduced sentence. Time served. You want justice? So do I.

CESAR OCAMPO: My brother is dead. Hung himself in a jail cell a couple weeks ago.

(DOGGETT: opens the door to the interrogation room.)

DOGGETT: Martin... A word.

(MARTIN WELLS looks back at CESAR OCAMPO, then follows DOGGETT back into the hall. Two other investigators are waiting.)

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, Martin. I tried to talk them out of it, but they think they have a case.

HOMICIDE DETECTIVE: Sir, turn around, please.

(The HOMICIDE DETECTIVE begins cuffing a resigned MARTIN WELLS and leading him away.)

HOMICIDE DETECTIVE: Martin Wells, you are under arrest for the murder of Vicky Wells. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney.

(DOGGETT watches them go.)



SCENE 16
MONDAY, DECEMBER 4
STRAND HOTEL
WASHINGTON, DC
2:07 AM

(Dark hotel room. MARTIN WELLS wakes up suddenly. He rubs his face, looks around the room. Remains of room service sit near the bed. Clock reads 2:08. MARTIN WELLS picks up the phone and dials.)

MARTIN WELLS: Come on, honey, pick up.

(Ringing continues. MARTIN WELLS is getting more frantic.)

MARTIN WELLS: Pick up!

VICKY WELLS: (voice on phone) Hey, there.

(At the sound of her voice, MARTIN WELLS sighs in relief.)

MARTIN WELLS: (on phone) Vicky...

(He tenses again when he realizes that it is the machine.)

VICKY WELLS: (voice on phone) This is the Wells' residence, home of Martin, Vicky, Courtney and Haley. We can't come to the phone right now. So, please leave a message.

MARTIN WELLS: (on phone) Honey, this is Martin. Pick up the phone. Vicky, pick up the phone. Pick up the phone!

(He lowers the phone to his lap.)

MARTIN WELLS: It's not 4:00 yet.

(He holds the phone to his mouth again.)

MARTIN WELLS: Vicky, please, when you get this, get out of the apartment, go to your parents' house and wait for me to call. I'm on my way back to the city.

(He hangs up and goes to leave the hotel.)



SCENE 17

(Later. MARTIN WELLS knocks loudly at DOGGETT's front door. DOGGETT, having just woken up, turns on a table lamp and opens the door. He is wearing what looks like a Marine or FBI dark t-shirt. A dog barks from a yard nearby.)

MARTIN WELLS: John, I need your help.

DOGGETT: Martin?

(He lets MARTIN WELLS in and shuts the door.)

MARTIN WELLS: Vicky's going to be murdered inside of two hours.

DOGGETT: (confused) Vicky? You mean your wife?

MARTIN WELLS: I called the Baltimore police but I can't tell if they thought I was a crank. I need you to call them. Now, I can describe the suspect, his name... everything.

DOGGETT: Well, how do you know all this?

MARTIN WELLS: I haven't got time to explain it. You wouldn't believe it anyway.

DOGGETT: Now, Martin, you see, now, that's a bad sign because it's two-something in the morning. I haven't seen you in three years. You got to give me something more to go on.

MARTIN WELLS: This is all happening for a reason. I... I'm being given a second chance.

DOGGETT: A second chance to do what?

MARTIN WELLS: I prosecuted a man named Hector Ocampo. I suppressed evidence. See, he was innocent of the crime he was charged with.

DOGGETT: Martin, anything you say to me...

MARTIN WELLS:  you have to report. (impatient) I put him away, he died in prison, his brother wants revenge, and it is as simple as that.

DOGGETT: You could be disbarred for what you're telling me. You could go to prison, lose everything; do you understand?

MARTIN WELLS: I understand that I can save Vicky.

DOGGETT: Hold on a minute.

(DOGGETT picks the phone up and dials. He watches as MARTIN WELLS runs back out the door.)

(MARTIN WELLS gets into his car and drives rapidly on wet streets through the dark city. He arrives at the apartment building in Baltimore. Several flashing police cars are sitting out front. Panicked, MARTIN WELLS runs upstairs to his apartment. He sighs in relief. Everything is intact. Two COPS are in the living room.)

MARTIN WELLS: You got here in time.

LEAD COP: Are you Martin Wells?

MARTIN WELLS: Yeah.

(MARTIN WELLS looks around the apartment.)

MARTIN WELLS: Vicky? Vicky?

LEAD COP: There's nobody here. We checked. What exactly are we looking for?

MARTIN WELLS: My wife's going to be attacked here tonight. It happens... the killer's going to use my key card to enter at 4:17.

LEAD COP: It's 4:20 now.

MARTIN WELLS: I don't understand. Where is she?

LEAD COP: Tell you what. We'll take a few sweeps through the neighbourhood... keep our eyes peeled. We're a phone call away if you need us.

(The two COPS leave. MARTIN WELLS thinks a moment, then presses one of the speed dials on the phone.)

MARTIN WELLS: Come on. Come on!

AL CAWDRY: (on phone) Hello?

MARTIN WELLS: (on phone) Al, it's Martin.

AL CAWDRY: (on phone) Martin? What time is it?

MARTIN WELLS: (on phone) Al... (he clears his throat)  is-is Vicky there?

AL CAWDRY: (on phone) No. The kids are here. Vicky left hours ago.

(MARTIN WELLS looks up in fear at the sound of someone at the door.)

AL CAWDRY: (on phone) Isn't she home yet?

(The doorknob moves.)

AL CAWDRY: (on phone) Martin?

(MARTIN WELLS hang up the phone. [CARRIK: Why not just leave the connection open?] He gets a chef's knife from the kitchen and stands behind the front door. It opens and he raises the knife threateningly. VICKIE screams. He lowers the knife in relief. She gasps as they calm down.)

VICKY WELLS: Martin, you scared the hell out of me!!

(He hugs her tightly.)

VICKY WELLS: Honey, why aren't you in DC? What the...

MARTIN WELLS: Where have you been?

VICKY WELLS: I-I got a flat on the way back from my... Honey, you're scaring me. What's wrong?

MARTIN WELLS: We're in trouble. We have to get out of here right now.

VICKY WELLS: What?!

(MARTIN WELLS turns to lead her out of the apartment, but stops when he sees the knob moving again.):

MARTIN WELLS: (whisper) Vicky! Get in the bedroom. Lock the door. You call the cops and don't come out till I say it's over.

(She doesn't understand, but lets him push her back toward the bedroom. He turns off the light and closes the door behind her.)

(MARTIN WELLS cautiously makes his way back to the front door. It is half open. No sign of who ever has come in. He slowly walks to the girls' bedroom. It is empty. He walks back into the living room. CESAR OCAMPO attacks him from behind and MARTIN WELLS drops the knife. The two men fight. CESAR OCAMPO knocks MARTIN WELLS to the ground then kicks him viciously as MARTIN WELLS futilely tries to get to his knife. VICKY WELLS has come out of the bedroom. She screams.)

VICKY WELLS: Oh, my god, Martin!

(CESAR OCAMPO grabs the knife and runs toward VICKY.)

VICKY WELLS: Martin! No!!!

(CESAR OCAMPO grabs VICKY, breaking her necklace. The pearls fall as he knocks her to the floor, shattering the coffee table. She screams. MARTIN WELLS is badly hurt. He can only watch as CESAR OCAMPO picks up the knife and prepares to slit VICKY's throat.)

MARTIN WELLS: No!

(VICKY looks desperately at MARTIN WELLS.)

VICKY WELLS: Martin!

(MARTIN WELLS can do nothing.)

VICKY WELLS: Martin!

MARTIN WELLS: (desperately screaming) No!

(Sound of two gunshots. CESAR OCAMPO falls to the floor revealing DOGGETT, gun out, standing in the doorway. SCULLY enters behind him. VICKY is sobbing. She and MARTIN WELLS grasp hands and then cling desperately to each other.)

(SCULLY kneels down and checks CESAR OCAMPO. The prognosis is not good.)

DOGGETT: You said something about a second chance. Was this it?

(MARTIN WELLS nods. VICKY sobs. MARTIN WELLS looks at SCULLY's Omega watch. It is stopped at 4:39:52. Date is the 4th. As he watches, it begins ticking forward again.)



SCENE 18
MARYLAND STATE PENETENTIARY
THREE MONTHS LATER

(Clock reads 12:16. MARTIN WELLS is sitting in a prison cell staring at the wall.)

MARTIN WELLS: (voiceover) The passage of time in prisons is not in a cell of brick and mortar but in one of hopes dashed and tragedies unaverted. How precious, then, the chance to go back only to discover that in facing the past you must face up to yourself... that exiting the prison of time doesn't free you from the prison of your own character... one from which there is no escape.

[THE END]


                                     VIA NEGATIVA


DUE TO SOME GRAPHIC VIOLENCE, VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

Global TV in Canada ran the following warning at the opening and after each commercial break:

THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM IS INTENDED FOR A MATURE AUDIENCE. VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.



SCENE 1

(A man, mid-thirties, AGENT JAMES LEEDS, is asleep in the driver's seat of a parked car on a neighborhood street across from a large older house. Another man, AGENT STEDMAN, taps on the window. AGENT LEEDS wakes with a start, then rolls down the electric window.)

AGENT STEDMAN: (accusing) Damn, Jim, you fell asleep? We're on a stakeout, man.

AGENT LEEDS: I guess... I don't know.

AGENT STEDMAN: What happened over there?

AGENT LEEDS: (still waking up) What are you talking about?

AGENT STEDMAN: The house, man. Front door's wide open. How long you been out?

(AGENT LEEDS has no answer, amazed at his own unprofessional actions.)

AGENT STEDMAN: We'd better check it.

(AGENT LEEDS gets out of the car and together they cross over to the dark house.)

AGENT STEDMAN: The light's out. The door's open. I don't like this.

(They go up the steps to the front door, flashlights in hand.)

AGENT LEEDS: Looks like they all left.

(They look down at the hallway and see what look like bloody footprints leading into the house.)

AGENT STEDMAN: I'm not so sure.

AGENT LEEDS: This can't be.

(The house number looks like 737? 237? There is a large painted image of a blue eye over the door. With guns and flashlights, they cautiously enter the house. AGENT LEEDS enters a large dormitory style room where there are two long rows of twin beds, perhaps 14 in all. On each, a person is lying dead. A huge vertical bloody gash is in each of their foreheads. Blood soaks the sheets.)

AGENT LEEDS: Oh, God. Stedman!

(AGENT STEDMAN joins him in the doorway to the room.)

AGENT STEDMAN: They're all dead.

(They hear something in another part of the house. Silently, AGENT STEDMAN proceeds down the hall while AGENT LEEDS looks further into the room. Alone, AGENT STEDMAN walks toward the stairs. We see a MAN standing a few feet behind him, a large decorative axe hanging at his side. AGENT STEDMAN turns quickly to face him.

CUT TO:

AGENT LEEDS, still in the room with the beds looks up at the sound of two gunshots. He runs out into the hall and looks down. AGENT STEDMAN lies dead, a large bloody gash in his forehead. He kneels down to look at his partner, then looks up at the MAN who is now standing beside him. The MAN has an extra eye in the middle of his forehead. AGENT LEEDS stares at the MAN in horror as the MAN swings the axe at AGENT LEEDS' head.)

SCENE 2
FALLS CHURCH, VIRGINIA 3:26 AM

(Nice little picket fence, two-story bungalow. Lovely place for two FBI agents to finally settle down and raise a fa  Oh, darn. It's DOGGETT's house. He is asleep in his nice manly bed. He wakes and answers the ringing phone on the bedside table.)

DOGGETT: (on phone, sleepily) Yeah.

(SCULLY is calling him from a pay phone in a hospital corridor. She speaks quietly.)

SCULLY: (on phone) It's, uh, it's Agent Scully. I'm sorry to wake you.

DOGGETT: (on phone) What's up?

SCULLY: (on phone) I got a call about 20 minutes ago from Assistant Director Skinner. He has a situation.

DOGGETT: (on phone) What is it?

SCULLY: (on phone) An Agent is dead. Um, Skinner had him surveilling a religious cult in Pittsburgh. And all the followers are dead, as well.

DOGGETT: (on phone) What happened?

SCULLY: (on phone) He's having difficulty determining that.

(DOGGETT picks up his watch and sighs as he looks at the time.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) I'll pick you up.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry, Agent Doggett. I can't go.

DOGGETT: (on phone, concerned) Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) Um, something unexpected has come up.

DOGGETT: (on phone) You all right?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

(She doesn't sound fine.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Will I see you later?

SCULLY: (on phone) Uh, as soon as I can.

(SCULLY hangs up the pay phone. DOGGETT looks at the phone a moment, then hangs up. In the hospital, a NURSE approaches SCULLY.)

NURSE: Miss Scully? The doctor wants to see you right away.

(SCULLY looks nervous and tired as she follows the NURSE.)



SCENE 3

(Later that morning. DOGGETT arrives at the crime scene. A van marked "County of Allegheny" passes him. He shows his badge through the windshield as he drives up close to the front door of the house. Photographers from the press are everywhere. He gets out of the car and is met by SKINNER. SKINNER is wearing latex gloves.)

SKINNER: Where's Agent Scully?

DOGGETT: Running late. What do we have?

SKINNER: One of our men doing routine surveillance on a cult group-- the Ibogan Temple. We had a tip they were trafficking narcotics. Nobody suspected anything like this.

(SKINNER leads DOGGETT over to a parked sedan. DOGGETT looks in the opened door and sees the body of AGENT LEEDS. There is a large bloody gash in his forehead.)

SKINNER: Agent James Leeds. Six-year veteran of the Bureau, father of two. Patrol cop found him. Car was locked from the inside.

(DOGGETT sits on the running board and looks closely at the body.)

DOGGETT: Nobody saw or heard anything?

SKINNER: No.

DOGGETT: This couldn't have happened here.

SKINNER: Blood splatter on the seat says it did.

DOGGETT: It's too narrow. There's no room to swing the weapon. Besides, it doesn't make any sense. The gun's still holstered and the key's in the ignition. Even if he fell asleep...

(DOGGETT sighs and stands up from the car.)

DOGGETT: This is damn weird.

SKINNER: It gets weirder.

(SKINNER leads him into the house and to the dormitory bedroom. The coroners are in the process of removing the bodies.)

SKINNER: These people were all killed the same way as our guy. All 20 cult members dead from a single deep wound to the forehead.

DOGGETT: Is this every member?

SKINNER: Except one. Their leader, Anthony Tipet, is missing.

(In an adjoining room, they look at a desktop shrine. There is a framed photo of the MAN we saw in the teaser, ANTHONY TIPET. No eye in the middle of his forehead.)

SKINNER: Tipet was a convicted murderer who claimed to have found God. We didn't think we were dealing with an apocalyptic cult. We've seen this kind of thing before. Jonestown, Heaven's Gate.

(DOGGETT looks closely at a block of something on the shrine. It is crudely engraved with the image of an eye.)

DOGGETT: I don't care how devoted they were. These people wouldn't just lie here and let their leader bash their brains in. I got to figure at least one of them would have had a problem with that.

SKINNER: It's something I've considered. I'm running tox tests on all the bodies for drugs.

DOGGETT: Does that include our man in the car?

(SKINNER looks at him. Pause. AGENT GENE CRANE, last seen in 8x01 and 2, approaches them.)

AGENT CRANE: A.D. Skinner? We're still unable to locate Agent Stedman.

DOGGETT: Angus Stedman?

SKINNER: Leeds' partner, do you know him?

DOGGETT: Where'd you look?

AGENT CRANE: He wasn't checked into the same motel as Leeds. He's not answering his cell or his pager.

DOGGETT: Did you check his condo?

AGENT CRANE: His condo?

DOGGETT: Yeah, Stedman's from Pittsburgh. He keeps a condo here that belonged to his folks.



SCENE 4

(Later, with SKINNER and a LANDLORD, DOGGETT knocks loudly at a condo door, #5.)

DOGGETT: Angus Stedman, it's John Doggett.

(There is no answer. The men are concerned. Manly concern, that is. DOGGETT backs away for the LANDLORD who unlocks the door. The chain keeps the door from opening more than a few inches. DOGGETT and SKINNER look at each other. They pull their guns and DOGGETT busts open the door and they enter. Pretty good teamwork. LANDLORD hangs back in the doorway.)

SKINNER: Doggett.

(They find the body of AGENT STEDMAN lying in his bed, dead. He has, you guessed it, a large bloody gash in his forehead.)



SCENE 5
OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR 2:18 PM

(KERSH's office. Very nice office. Lots of leather, nice wood, and patterned carpet. Wow. The Deputy Directors have it good. DOGGETT, AGENT CRANE, a SENIOR AGENT, SKINNER, and KERSH are watching a rough video of ANTHONY TIPET preaching to a small group of his followers.)

ANTHONY TIPET: (on videotape) The body is but clay... a shell made by God to hold the twin aspects of the Holy Spirit: Light and dark. If we have the courage to see into darkness we see into God... free of the clay which confines us.

(SKINNER pauses the video.)

SKINNER: Anthony Tipet served 12 years for the bludgeoning death of his wife. After his release, he became a minister preaching a hybrid of evangelical and eastern religions. He claimed a higher plane of being could be reached by the Via Negativa-- the path of darkness-- the plane closer to God. Once reached, it would let the spirit travel unhindered. Tipet believed hallucinogens would lead him to this plane-- specifically compounds of the bark of an African tree... the Iboga.

SENIOR AGENT: You're saying all these people were so stoned on this bark they just let their leader kill them?

SKINNER: We found no trace of the drug in the blood of any of the victims.

KERSH: I don't understand. How in the hell did Tipet manage to slaughter all these people?

DOGGETT: Tipet was paranoid but nothing indicates he was ready to take the lives of his own people or our men.

KERSH: This is our one and only suspect. Are you telling me he didn't do it?

DOGGETT: Whoever did this left not even a trace how: No prints, no forensic evidence whatsoever. Agent Leeds' sedan, the cult house, Agent Stedman's condo were all locked from the inside.

KERSH: That's impossible.

SKINNER: Unless Tipet took the drug and succeeded. Unless his consciousness was there but his body was somewhere else.

(Pause.)

KERSH: The X-File explanation. I take it this theory comes from Agent Scully?

(His tone of voice when he says the "theory" could also apply to several four-letter words in the English language.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully has yet to reach any conclusions, sir.

KERSH: That's the problem. I'm not hearing conclusions from either one of you. If this man has reached a higher plane then explain to me why 22 people are dead including two FBI Agents. Now I want to hear what you're going to do about it.

(Meeting is over. SKINNER and DOGGETT leave the office and start walking down the hall. DOGGETT is not happy.)

DOGGETT: If I'm working this case, I'd appreciate a heads up before you tell the Deputy Director any more science fiction stories.

SKINNER: Hey, I don't have another explanation.

(DOGGETT pushes the elevator call button.)

DOGGETT: Those guys in there are right. This whole story doesn't make a damn bit of sense.

SKINNER: I'm supposed to give those guys in there answers, Agent Doggett. You're supposed to help me do that.

(The elevator arrives and DOGGETT gets on.)

DOGGETT: Tipet's on the run. Find him, and we just might.

(Elevator doors close.)



SCENE 6
HILL DISTRICT
PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA

(ANTHONY TIPET, sans extra eye, walks to a street-side telephone booth. Night. He is approached by an older HOMELESS MAN.)

HOMELESS MAN: Spare change?

ANTHONY TIPET: I don't have anything. Sorry.

HOMELESS MAN: Now, come on, man. I know you got something 'cause I hear it jingling in your pocket.

(ANTHONY TIPET grabs the HOMELESS MAN roughly by the coat and holds him against the booth. He stares deeply into the man's eyes.)

ANTHONY TIPET: You don't want to know me.

(He lets the frightened HOMELESS MAN leave, then drops money into the phone and dials.

CUT TO:

A dimly lit lab. There are rats in cages and a geeky-looking young man, ANDRE BORMANIS, at a desk. The phone rings. ANDRE BORMANIS looks at it nervously, but does not answer it. The answering machine picks up. There is no outgoing message.)

ANTHONY TIPET: (at phone) Pick up the phone, damn you. Pick up the damn phone! You did this. You ... did this. God help you, Andre. I can't.

(ANTHONY TIPET hangs up. ANDRE BORMANIS puts his face in his hands for a moment, in despair. He picks up a petrie dish containing several wrapped razor blades. He takes the paper off of one of them, bends over the table and wincing, begins cutting his forehead.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: (in pain) Ah!

(From the reflection on the table, we see blood begin to drip from his forehead.)



SCENE 7
10:22PM

(FBI Headquarters. DOGGETT is looking through a file. SKINNER enters and hands him another.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett. Coroner's report.

DOGGETT: (reading) Victims all killed by a single blow from an axe blade, six to eight inches long.

SKINNER: These photos of wound patterns don't match up to any known make or manufacturer.

DOGGETT: This fit the description?

(DOGGETT shows SKINNER a copy of a page from a book. There is a picture of a large decorative axe like the one we saw used in the teaser.)

DOGGETT: It's a ceremonial axe used over a thousand years ago to cleave the skulls of unbelievers. This was required reading for Tipet's followers.

SKINNER: Is this our weapon?

DOGGETT: No, sir. It's on permanent display in a Calcutta museum.

SKINNER: Another dead-end.

DOGGETT: Like everything else in this case.

(DOGGETT sighs and rubs his head. He speaks quietly to SKINNER, a note of frustration in his voice.)

DOGGETT: I'm a good investigator but you know as well as I do I'm not the Agent that should be investigating this case.

SKINNER: Agent Scully can't be here.

DOGGETT: You spoke to her?

SKINNER: Tonight. She told me to tell you she's fine. She's taking some personal time.

DOGGETT: I've got 22 people dead, and she's taking personal time?

(Angry, DOGGETT picks up the phone. SKINNER immediately takes it from him.)

SKINNER: You're not listening to what I'm telling you. Do your best without her.

(SKINNER firmly hangs up the phone and walks away.)

(Back on the Pittsburgh street, the HOMELESS MAN is sleeping next to the phone booth. He wakes up at the sound of footsteps.)

HOMELESS MAN: Spare change? I'll take whatever you got.

(He looks up and sees ANTHONY TIPET. ANTHONY TIPET is pale and has the third eye in his forehead. The HOMELESS MAN is understandably freaked out. He stumbles to his feet. The sidewalk below him turns liquid, like quicksand or wet cement, and he begins sinking into it. He falls and sinks to his neck. Only his head is exposed. ANTHONY TIPET raises the axe.)

HOMELESS MAN: Ah, no! No!!

(ANTHONY TIPET swings the axe down at the HOMELESS MAN's head.)



SCENE 8
4:07 AM

(Back at the Doghouse. DOGGETT, at home, is looking at the police report on ANTHONY TIPET. His mugshot number is CD-8740367. His eyes and hair are brown, complexion light, no physical scars, medium build, height 5'8", no alias, address  Rt. 4 Drew, WY. He answers a knock at the door. It is SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: Sir?

SKINNER: I think we caught a break. A homeless man was found dead in Pittsburgh two hours ago. I had them e-mail me some digital photos.

DOGGETT: Any witnesses?

(DOGGETT looks at the images of the dead HOMELESS MAN. There is a gash in the forehead. He is not buried in concrete.)

SKINNER: A man fitting Tipet's description was ID'd using the pay phone earlier in the night.

DOGGETT: So we got something?

SKINNER: No. There's no concrete evidence against him. There's no fingerprints, no hair and fiber.

[TD: "Concrete evidence"? A groaner from Skinner, gotta be a first!]

DOGGETT: You got the guy at the scene.

SKINNER: There's nothing to link him to the murder itself, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Well, I'm supposed to believe this guy doped his way into another plane of reality? That his spirit is going around killing people?

SKINNER: All right, just suppose... suppose that this drug finally did what Tipet said it would. That his spirit could be in one place while his body was in another.

DOGGETT: Then tell me why he's doing it. If he's looking for God, why is he killing people? Just 'cause I'm assigned to the X-Files you want me to think like Scully or Mulder would. You got the wrong guy. I need facts, not wild ideas.

SKINNER: All right. Then consider this one. I had Pittsburgh P.D. check the log at that pay phone.

(SKINNER hands him a sheet of paper with phone records on it.)

11.              412 555 4344    MK Stone
12.   06:23pm    412 555 5131    321 Club
13.   07:30pm    412 555-3272    At the Top
14.   08:43pm    421 555-4367    Ridders
15.   09:23pm    412 555-5671    Pitts Taxi
16.   10:12pm    202 555-9212    Andre Bormanis
17.   10:16pm    412 555-5671    Tambers

DOGGETT: 10:12 PM, a call was placed to one Andre Bormanis.

SKINNER: He's a convicted drug dealer that served time with Tipet. That number's a DC area code.



SCENE 9
SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON, DC
4:54 AM

(DOGGETT and SKINNER pull up to a house on a dark and foggy street. They get out and knock at the door. We see a man's eye looking through the peephole, then DOGGETT and SKINNER through the peephole.)

DOGGETT: FBI. Open up.

(ANDRE BORMANIS slowly opens the door for them. He has the same look in his eyes that CarriK would get in college after nine cups of coffee to get through all-night paper writing marathons. He also has a freshly healed "X" carved into his forehead.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Bormanis? Andre Bormanis?

ANDRE BORMANIS: Doctor Bormanis.

DOGGETT: (showing badge) Agent Doggett. Agent Skinner. Can we have a word with you?

(They follow him into the lab. ANDRE BORMANIS goes over to where he is working with some bubbling beakers.)

SKINNER: You always up at this hour, Dr. Bormanis?

ANDRE BORMANIS: It's when I dissect my rats. Neighbors can't hear 'em screaming.

(SKINNER and DOGGETT do not find this amusing.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: That's a joke.

(SKINNER and DOGGETT look at each other.)

SKINNER: You spoke to Anthony Tipet earlier this evening.

ANDRE BORMANIS: My machine picked up. I-I-I missed the call.

SKINNER: What did he want?

(No answer.)

SKINNER: We need to find him, Dr. Bormanis. This man may have murdered 23 people.

(DOGGETT, looking around, spins the blade on a table saw. It seems a little out of place in the lab. ANDRE BORMANIS is nervous.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: Twenty-three? You-you said... twenty-two.

SKINNER: Another man died tonight.

ANDRE BORMANIS: (shaking his head) I'm not doing anything illegal here. I... I just... I just made him stuff.

(He is putting pills into a petrie dish.)

SKINNER: You mean drugs. You supplied Anthony Tipet with drugs, isn't that right?

ANDRE BORMANIS: Hallucinogens were Tipet's way into the depths of the soul, the heights of consciousness, planes of being that our feeble brain chemistry cannot begin to imagine.

(Cool shot of DOGGETT with a backlit, spinning fan behind him. SKINNER looks at the "X" on ANDRE BORMANIS's forehead.)

SKINNER: Is that why you cut yourself? Or is that the, uh... mark of the initiated?

ANDRE BORMANIS: It's a protection. At least I hope it is. Nobody took the trips but Tipet. See, only his mind was strong enough.

DOGGETT: You know, I can't tell, doctor, whether you admire Tipet or you're afraid of him. Those people he killed last night, did they admire him, too?

(No answer. DOGGETT takes a large white pill from ANDRE BORMANIS's hands.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: What are you doing?

DOGGETT: Taking you in for questioning.

ANDRE BORMANIS: On what charges? I just... I just... explained it to you.

(DOGGETT begins handcuffing him. ANDRE BORMANIS struggles, panicking.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: Ah! Don't! Look...

(He picks up and tries to swallow another of the pills, but DOGGETT restrains him.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: I need that!

(Short time later. ANDRE BORMANIS, still struggling, is tossed into a jail cell by an OFFICER.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: (screaming) No, please! Ugh! Don't-don't leave me! Please!! Don't leave me!

(The OFFICER leaves, and ANOTHER OFFICER closes and locks the outer gate to the cells. DOGGETT looks through the gate for a moment, then turns and walks down the hall. Camera quality is odd, almost slow motion. He turns a corner and starts down another hall. He looks down and sees bloody shoe prints leading down the hall, and follows them slowly. He looks up and stares at ANTHONY TIPET hovering about 3 feet off of the ground in a lotus meditation position. All three of ANTHONY TIPET's eyes open and he looks directly at DOGGETT. DOGGETT again looks down at the floor. He lifts his foot and sees that the bloody footprints are his own. Again, he looks at ANTHONY TIPET, then down at his hands. He is now holding SCULLY's bloody, severed head, her blue eyes half open and sightless. He drops the head in horror.)

[TD: And I dropped my jaw! Way cool and very freaky stuff, I vote this one of the Top Ten Best Scenes on the show to date. Spooky!]

SKINNER: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT wakes abruptly, very disturbed by his dream. He is sitting on a bench in the police station. SKINNER is holding his own cell phone out to him.)

SKINNER: It's Agent Scully.

(DOGGETT takes a moment to catch his breath, then takes the phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Skinner told me about the case. I know that you covered for me. You didn't have to do that.

DOGGETT: (on phone) It's all right.

(SCULLY is still in the hospital, and is wearing a hospital gown.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I appreciate your discretion.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah, well, it's easy to be discreet when you don't know what's going on. Are you okay?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm fine. Skinner says that you're on the clock on this thing. You need to get your rest.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah, I just grabbed a few winks.

SCULLY: (on phone) I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder's. I think they'll be able to help.

DOGGETT: (on phone) I appreciate all the help I can get.

SCULLY: (on phone) Doggett, you're a good agent. Trust your instincts.

(DOGGETT hangs up. SKINNER walks back over to him.)

SKINNER: Lab tests showed that the drug that Bormanis was cooking up was some kind of a super amphetamine. Legal or not, no one's ever seen it before. Do you think it was intended for Tipet?

DOGGETT: He wants it for himself. He doesn't want to go to sleep.

SKINNER: Doggett?

DOGGETT: I want to talk to him... now.

(In the jail cell, ANDRE BORMANIS wakes up to the sound of distant rodent sounds. He looks around nervously. He gets off of the cot and sees ANTHONY TIPET with three eyes standing just outside the bars of the cell.

CUT TO:

DOGGETT and SKINNER at the outer chain-link gate to the cells.)

DOGGETT: Can we get this gate open? Get it open now!

(An OFFICER begins to open the outer gate.

CUT TO:

Inside the cell, ANDRE BORMANIS backs up in fear as dozens of rats begin running through the bars and into his cell.)

ANDRE BORMANIS: Ugh!

(Lots and lots of rats.)

[TD: He, he, indeedy, lots of 'em, yuck!]

ANDRE BORMANIS: Ugh!

(He falls to the floor and the rats cover him, biting and swarming. A couple of them start chewing on his neck. He screams in agony.)

CUT TO:

DOGGETT and SKINNER arrive at the cell. No rats. Just ANDRE BORMANIS lying on his cot, apparently asleep.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett, what is it?

DOGGETT: Open it up.

(The OFFICER opens the cell and DOGGETT and SKINNER enter. ANDRE BORMANIS is dead, his face and neck bloody, eyes open and staring. Creepy music with whispering voiceover sounds.)



SCENE 10
FBI HEADQUARTERS
5:02 PM

(Basement. As DOGGETT comes down the stairs, he hears voices coming from inside MULDER's office.)

BYERS: ...stories that belong to Mulder and Scully, not us.

LANGLY: Come on, Byers. We have a right to information.

BYERS: It's not our information.

FROHIKE: How many times have we saved Mulder's butt?

LANGLY: How many times have we saved Scully's?

BYERS: I'm telling you, these files are theirs. They're private.

(DOGGETT opens the still nameplateless door and sees FROHIKE looking through the file cabinet. LANGLY is spinning around in MULDER's chair playing with something he has suspended over his head, and BYERS is standing nearby. They do not notice DOGGETT.)

[TD: Took me a minute to figure out what Langly was doing as well. He's lining up a pencil and shoots it at the ceiling when they notice Doggett in the doorway. A nod to "Chinga" *sniff*]

FROHIKE: And I'm telling you Mulder wouldn't mind. We practically solved half these cases for him.

LANGLY: Yeah, Byers, quit your whining-- nobody likes a crybaby.

BYERS: Agent Scully asked us to give our assistance not to go through her f-files.

(BYERS notices DOGGETT in the doorway.)

FROHIKE: Like she's going to care.

LANGLY: Yeah, right.

DOGGETT: Can I help you gentlemen?

(They all notice him now.)

BYERS: You must be Agent Doggett. I'm ... John Byers. (they shake hands) Uh, these are my associates Melvin Frohike and Richard Langly.

(They wave lamely at him from behind the desk.)

[TD; Richard?! Damn, he was supposed to be Ringo. Wait a sec, Ringo Starr's real name was Richard Starkey, neato.]

DOGGETT: You're the guys Scully told me about. Mulder's friends?

BYERS: (smiling proudly) Yes, that's us.

DOGGETT: You publish the "Lone Gunman" newspaper?

FROHIKE: (pleased and proud) Our reputation precedes us.

DOGGETT: Yeah. Read Mulder's files.

FROHIKE: Well, then you know how badly you're going to need our help.

BYERS: We've reviewed your case as Agent Scully asked.

LANGLY: Mondo bizarro. No offense, man, but you're in way over your head.

DOGGETT: What help can you give me?

FROHIKE: Hit the lights.

(The lights are turned off and the slide projector is turned on. An image of a pyramid with an eye is displayed on the screen.)

FROHIKE: Are you familiar with this image?

BYERS: In the renaissance it represented an all-seeing god.

LANGLY: That's why our Founding Fathers put it on the dollar bill.

(Next image is the same that DOGGETT saw engraved in the cult house.)

BYERS: We believe its meaning here relates to eastern religion, uh, belief in the third eye or what the Hindus call the Sahasrara.

DOGGETT: A third eye?

FROHIKE: We all have a third eye. If we could open it, we'd see a new reality, one closer to God. At least that's what Kesey told me on the bus back in '64.

LANGLY: You were not on the bus with Kesey in '64.

FROHIKE: Hey, I got the pictures to prove it, my longhaired friend.

LANGLY: Before or after you partied with the Stones at Altamont?

FROHIKE: Don't be a boob, Altamont was in '70s.

LANGLY: Whatever.

(The next image is of a large blue eye, the same as above the door of the cult house. DOGGETT looks at it closely, ignoring their bantering.)

DOGGETT: I see where you guys are going with this. Tipet believes he opened his third eye.

BYERS: Yes, exactly.

DOGGETT: But the placement of the wounds on his victims could suggest he's trying to destroy theirs.

BYERS: Yeah. That could be.

DOGGETT: But if he's moved closer to God, why kill him? And how?

FROHIKE: We don't know why. But we might tell you how.

(They turn the lights back on.)

FROHIKE: You've heard of MK Ultra?

BYERS: The CIA mind control project started in the '50s.

LANGLY: They gave LSD to a bunch of people to see what would happen. Didn't bother telling them first.

FROHIKE: They understood the power of hallucinogens to harness the mind.

DOGGETT: Tipet was the one on hallucinogens, not his victims.

BYERS: The CIA invested millions trying to create psychic assassins, failing where Tipet has evidently succeeded.

FROHIKE: Reaching a drug-induced higher consciousness using his mind as a weapon against his victims.

LANGLY: The assassin makes his victims think they're being hit by an axe.

BYERS: Or any number of nightmares.

FROHIKE: They believe it... it happens.

DOGGETT: What if Tipet could invade his victims'... consciousness in their sleep? I mean, that's why you'd be afraid to fall asleep, right? If you thought your nightmares might come true?

(The GUNMEN stare at DOGGETT, then glance at each other.)

BYERS: You believe that?

DOGGETT: No... but if Tipet does... he'll need more drugs... to keep killing.

(DOGGETT puts on his suit coat and leaves the room, closing the door behind him.)

FROHIKE: That's not bad for a beginner.



SCENE 11
SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON, DC
5:39 pm

(DOGGETT pulls a Bureau sedan up in front of ANDRE BORMANIS's building. From inside, ANTHONY TIPET watches covertly as DOGGETT and SKINNER get out of the car. DOGGETT and SKINNER enter and look around the lab.)

SKINNER: Doggett, someone's been here.

(Rats, now out of their cages, run past DOGGETT's feet. They both draw their guns at the sound of mechanical whirring. They see ANTHONY TIPET, only two eyes at the moment. He is leaning over the now rapidly spinning table saw we saw DOGGETT notice earlier.)

DOGGETT: Anthony Tipet. Anthony Tipet! Step away from the saw.

ANTHONY TIPET: You don't understand.

SKINNER: Just step away from the saw.

ANTHONY TIPET: I didn't want this to happen... but I can't stop it.

(ANTHONY TIPET looks meaningfully at DOGGETT.)

ANTHONY TIPET: He understands. He saw what can happen-- what will happen... unless I stop it.

(Indecisive, DOGGETT lowers his gun. Suddenly, ANTHONY TIPET slams his forehead down on the saw and screams in agony. DOGGETT's face is spattered with blood as he and SKINNER leap forward to pull ANTHONY TIPET away from the saw.)



SCENE 12
WASHINGTON NATIONAL HOSPITAL
6:07 PM

(ANTHONY TIPET is unconscious on a gurney being wheeled through the hospital emergency ward. A bloody compress is held on his forehead.)

ER DOCTOR: I want a stat trauma panel with full tox, EKG, and metabolic profile. Keep that compress on his head.

(A NURSE approaches DOGGETT with a clipboard. She is the same NURSE who spoke to SCULLY earlier in the episode.)

NURSE: Agent... this man needs to be admitted. You need to sign him in.

(The desk phone rings. She answers it.)

NURSE: This is Nurse McCaslin. Yes, Dr. Johnson's on the third floor. All right.

(Under her conversation, DOGGETT glances through the names on the clipboard. He takes out his pen and is about to fill in ANTHONY TIPET's information. He pauses and looks back at an earlier page on the clipboard. Third down on the list is the entry, "Dana Scully, time admitted - 4:10 AM for Acute Abdominal Pain." She is in room 1102. DOGGETT goes up to another ward and to room 1102 and slowly opens the door. SCULLY is asleep. She is hooked up to a few monitors, but doesn't look too bad. He looks at her silently for a moment.)



SCENE 13

(KERSH's office. DOGGETT enters. KERSH and SKINNER are already there.)

KERSH: Come in, Agent Doggett. A.D. Skinner was telling me you could shed light on the reason for Tipet's suicide attempt.

(DOGGETT enters and speaks cautiously.)

DOGGETT: Yes, sir, um... "Via Negativa"-- the path of darkness. Tipet believed he reached it. Uh, he believed that the drugs took him inside the subconscious minds of anyone he knew... (sighs) ... making the most horrific, irrational dream imagery of their nightmares come true. That's why he tried to kill himself to make it stop.

(KERSH stands up from the table, claps DOGGETT on the shoulder in a friendly manner, then sits at his desk. The meeting is over.)

KERSH: Excellent job, gentlemen. Have your reports on my desk 0900.

DOGGETT: Case isn't over yet, sir.

(He looks at SKINNER for confirmation. SKINNER looks away.)

KERSH: A.D. Skinner tells me our suspect's lying hospitalized in a coma and now, you're saying it's not over?

DOGGETT: We have no murder weapon... no forensic evidence. Unless we accept Tipet's own beliefs which you yourself characterize as preposterous...

KERSH: It's over, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: We have no way of explaining how he killed any of these people.

KERSH: (firmly) I said it's over, Agent Doggett. I don't need every "I" dotted or every "T" crossed to know that we've got our man.



SCENE 14

(Night. SCULLY's answering machine in her apartment.)

SCULLY'S ANSWERING MACHINE: This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message. (beep)

(DOGGETT is at home.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Agent Scully, I think we caught the guy who did it. But it... it still it... it just doesn't add up. (sigh) It's the damnedest thing I ever saw. I know that this sounds strange, but there's a, there's a... part of me says what if... what if this guy was right? What if I shouldn't have let him die? I'm not making a whole lot of sense. Maybe I just need some sleep. If you get this message... and feel up to it... you give me a call.

(He hangs up. In the wall mirror he sees his own reflection and that of ANTHONY TIPET, three eyes, standing behind him. He turns, and no one is there. He turns off the light and walks up the stairs. Standing near the foot of the stairs, we see a man holding the axe.)



SCENE 15

(DOGGETT slowly wakes up in his bed. Early dawn light is on his face. Slightly weird music and camera motion again. As he looks in the mirror to put on his tie, he is startled to see an extra eye in the middle of his forehead. It blinks with his other two eyes. A moment later, the extra eye is gone. He stares at himself again for a moment, very disturbed.)

(Later, that morning, he enters SKINNER's ASSISTANT's office. She looks up as he moves toward her.)

DOGGETT: Is the Assistant Director in?

(Just then, SKINNER and AGENT CRANE come out of SKINNER's office.)

SKINNER: That'll be great. Thanks.

AGENT CRANE: John. Excellent work out there, John. Just excellent.

(AGENT CRANE clasps DOGGETT on the shoulder and leaves.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett.

(SKINNER looks at DOGGETT who has a confused expression. He leads him into the inner office. DOGGETT stares at SKINNER, then looks away. SKINNER closes the door.)

SKINNER: Is something wrong?

(DOGGETT is breathing heavily, looks back at SKINNER, moisture forming in his eyes. Not good on the Manly Man Meter. Long pause.)

DOGGETT: I'm not sure... I'm awake.

SKINNER: (rationally) You think this is a dream? I mean, you standing here talking to me? All those people out there?

DOGGETT: Last night I dreamt Tipet was inside my house holding an axe. I thought I woke up this morning. I thought I was awake, but-but then...

SKINNER: Uh... What do you want me to do, pinch you? You're already awake.

DOGGETT: Stedman and Leeds must have experienced the same thing... all Tipet's victims. Everything seemed real but it was a dream... a dream that ended in their deaths.

SKINNER: Anthony Tipet is in a coma, never to regain consciousness.

DOGGETT: (afraid) He knows me now. He can enter in my dreams.

SKINNER: Listen to me. You've had a tough couple days. You're tired. Go home, get some rest.

(DOGGETT leaves the office and walks down the hall. He bumps into someone's elbow and keeps walking. He gets on the elevator and goes from the 4th floor to the 2nd. No one else is in this hallway, otherwise it is identical. The same muffled voices are heard in the background. He walks partway down the hall, then turns and looks back to see the elevator disappear into darkness giving the illusion of infinity. When he turns to look back down the hall, the other end of the hall disappears into darkness also. Out of the darkness, he sees ANTHONY TIPET slowly walk toward him. ANTHONY TIPET has three eyes, but he is keeping all of them closed. As the two men speak, their voices are distorted, as if played in reverse, then reversed again.)

ANTHONY TIPET: She's going to die.

DOGGETT: I'm not going to let you do that.

ANTHONY TIPET: I'm sorry. I'm not going to kill her.

(All three of his eyes open.)

ANTHONY TIPET: You are.

(DOGGETT covers his face with his hands. When he lowers them, we see that he is in SCULLY's apartment building hallway. He walks to her door and it opens itself. Inside, a slow blue light fades in and out at the rate of about once every three seconds. He looks down at his hands which are covered in blood. The following scenes are what we see as the light fades in and out. Really spooky.

DOGGETT enters the apartment and walks through SCULLY's living room. The front door closes itself behind him.

He looks at his bloody hands again.

He is now holding the axe.

He looks at her bedroom door.

He enters her bedroom.

He sees her asleep in her bed.

He raises the axe over her.

We see the shadow of the axe on her face.

He struggles with himself.

He swings the axe back down to his side.

He turns the blade of the axe toward himself.

He winces and swings the blade up.)

SCULLY'S VOICE: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT wakes abruptly. He is in his bed. SCULLY is standing next to him. It looks like dawn.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Hi.

DOGGETT: How'd you get here?

SCULLY: Your door was unlocked.

DOGGETT: You just saved my life, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I just woke you up, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Tipet's in my dreams. If you hadn't woken me up just now...

SCULLY: Anthony Tipet is dead. I got the call from Skinner on my way over here. He never regained consciousness.

(Pause.)

DOGGETT: Are you okay?

SCULLY: I seem to be, yes.

DOGGETT: Well, if you need some more time off...

SCULLY: No. I'm, um... I'm back at work now. That must have been some nightmare you just had.

DOGGETT: Tipet thought he'd find God by looking in the darkness inside himself.

SCULLY: You don't think he succeeded?

DOGGETT: In my dreams, I see... I saw terrible... violent images that... scared the living daylights out of me. These things are a part of me. I can't deny that, but... maybe... maybe they didn't come from me.

SCULLY: Then where'd they come from?

(DOGGETT has no answer.)

SCULLY: It was a bad dream, Agent Doggett, but that's all it was.

(DOGGETT does not seem comforted.)

[THE END]


                                    SUREKILL



SCENE 1
WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS
8:34 PM

(Empty city street. Night. A man, CARLTON CHASE, runs to a payphone. He's watching his back and out of breath.)

CHASE: Pick up. Pick up the phone. Look, I don't know what that bitch told you but I'm solid. She's lying to you. Check her right-hand desk drawer. It's all there, the whole story. Pick up, man. Call him off. Hey, let's talk about this, alright. Give me a chance to explain.

(CHASE sees shadow of person around the corner, heading his way. He panics and drops the phone and runs off. A man walks around the corner. CHASE is still running. He trips and falls and is hurt. He sees a police station across the road and runs to it.)

(CUT TO: Police station. There are two officers sitting at the desk. CHASE enters.)

CHASE: Help me. Somebody wants to kill me.

OFFICER: Who wants to kill you?

CHASE: Please help me.

(CHASE starts bolting the door.)

OFFICER: Hold on, don't do that, guy. Now, you calm down.

(Officer grapples with CHASE.)

CHASE: Please, you've got to stop him. He's out there. We have to get him before he gets me.

(CHASE sees other Officer's gun and grabs for it. Both Officers grab him.)

OFFICER #1: Hey, get off.

OFFICER #2: Take him down! Take him down!

(They wrestle CHASE to the floor.)

CHASE: Let me go. (Shouting) He's going to kill me!

(They take CHASE to a cell. CHASE feels the walls, goes to the door where OFFICER #1 is standing looking in through the cell window.)

OFFICER #1: Take it easy. Relax, now. Settle down.

CHASE: No. This isn't enough. I'm not safe in here.

OFFICER #1: Hey, buddy, you've never been safer in your life, OK? Just relax.

CHASE: He can get me in here.

OFFICER #2: I'll go call Social Services.

OFFICER #1: Right.

CHASE: It's not enough. He can get to me.

(There's a splat and the cell window is suddenly covered in blood. Close up on OFFICER #1 who looks very shocked. He sees CHASE'S head slide down through blood to the floor.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(Later on inside the Police Station, SCULLY is holding up a lateral-view skull X-ray, obviously from CARLTON CHASE.)

SCULLY: They've identified it as 9mm pistol ammunition, teflon-coated armour-piercing. Single round. He was shot, there's no doubt about that.

DOGGETT: Well, I assume the million dollar question is how. (DOGGETT opens the cell door.)

(We see they are at the crime scene, DOGGETT inside the cell, SCULLY outside.)

SCULLY: Yeah. Well, what do we know about the victim?

DOGGETT: (DOGGETT looks down at his notepad.) CARLTON CHASE. Aged 39. Well-to-do realtor. Single. Lived in the area all his life. Nothing but parking tickets on his record. Came tearing in here last night saying someone was going to kill him.

SCULLY: He was right.

DOGGETT: Except I don't see any bullet holes in the walls.

SCULLY: Looks to have entered through the top of his head.

(SCULLY is looking at the X-ray in the light. An officer approach down the hallway.)

OFFICER: Agents, thanks for coming down so quick. Al Trugero. (The officer introduces himself.)

(The officer is carrying a stepladder.)

DOGGETT: John Doggett.

OFFICER: Nice to met you.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

OFFICER: Agent.

SCULLY: Hi.

OFFICER: I'd appreciate any help you can give us. We've got this much figured out so far.

DOGGETT: The bullet came through the airvent.

(The Officer is climbing the stepladder.)

OFFICER: Yeah, that's how it's lookin'. There's a little burr on this louver right here where the bullet passed through. You can barely see it, but it's there. So, I'm thinking this is where the killer hid. He somehow crawled into this ventilation system and from here he had a clear line of sight to shoot Chase below.

DOGGETT: Did anyone hear a gun shot? Seems pretty likely you'd hear one even with a silencer - it's going to echo through the duct-work.

SCULLY: What's directly above this?

(CUT TO: Inside the ventilation system. DOGGETT and SCULLY are looking around with flashlights.)

OFFICER: I don't understand. How could someone make that shot from here?

(SCULLY looks up and sees a hole. We see a fine beam of light coming through the hole)

SCULLY: He didn't make it from here. Can I use your pencil?

OFFICER: Sure.

(SCULLY pokes the pencil up through hole.)



SCENE 3

(Police Station Rooftop. SCULLY climbs a ladder onto the rooftop, followed by DOGGETT. She walks over to the pencil which is sticking up through the roof. The Cop appears at the top of the ladder.)

SCULLY: Captain! (Holding up the pencil.) We're going to need your crime scene investigators up here.

OFFICER: You got it.

DOGGETT: So, lucky shot?

SCULLY: Very. But this victim here stated that he was going to be killed just moments before he was shot, which doesn't sound lucky at all.

DOGGETT: Guess I can't argue with that.

(DOGGETT notices something, and bends down.)

SCULLY: What have you got there?

DOGGETT: (Using his pencil to collect a piece of fabric into an evidence bag.) An old Godfather trick. Wrap a towel around a pistol, muffle the sound. The killer was up here all right. So how in hell did he make that shot?

SCULLY: Well, there's thermal imaging technology which can pick up body heat through walls. Maybe that's what allowed him to aim.

DOGGETT: We field-tested that in the Marines. Weighs close to 90 lbs. Has to be cooled with liquid nitrogen. I can't quite see somebody lugging it up that ladder we just climbed. Either way, the rooftop of a police station? It's a pretty ballsy place for a hit.



SCENE 4

(A station wagon drives up to a warehouse building. A young woman gets out. Camera pans up to show the building's sign - AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators. It also has a comic-effect rat and mousetrap logo.)

(CUT TO: Inside the warehouse. The room is filled with drums, spray canisters and tubing. The woman goes into an office and sits at a desk. She's looking at today's newspaper, the headline reads "Local Realtor Murdered: Mysterious Death While in Custody of Police". She clicks on the answering machine and hears the message left by Carlton CHASE when we saw him in the teaser.)

CHASE: (On answering machine) Pick up. Pick up the phone. Look, I don't know what that bitch told you but I'm solid. She's lying to you. Check her right hand desk drawer, it's all there. The whole story...

(She looks very concerned. She presses the erase button on the machine, and gets up and unlocks the desk drawer and pulls out a cashbox, which she unlocks. She opens it and finds it empty. As she locks and replaces it she is startled by DWIGHT.)

DWIGHT: (Standing in the doorway) What are you doing.

TAMMI: My, um, printer cable was loose.

DWIGHT: And that's more important than coffee? (She looks away) Any messages?

TAMMI: No.

DWIGHT: Well, the light's blinking. Looks like a message to me. (long pause) You gonna play it or what? Stupid ain't cute damn you, I don't care what your momma says.

(TAMMI reluctantly presses the play button on the machine)

ANSWERPHONE MESSAGE: Yeah, I got like rats, again. I need you to get them all this time. 1806 Brook Valley Turnpike. Last name Allesandre. You've been here before.

TAMMI: DWIGHT.

DWIGHT: Yeah, I got it.

(DWIGHT goes towards his office and TAMMI follows him.)

TAMMI: No. Look. Did you hear the news this morning? About Carlton Chase? (pause) I thought it was pretty scary.

DWIGHT: Try and get Randall on the phone.

(DWIGHT goes into his office and shuts the door. TAMMI goes back to her office, picks up the phone and dials while looking at the photo of CHASE in the paper. Then she sees someone outside the office door. It's the mystery man from the teaser.)

TAMMI: Randall. Your brother wants to see you.

(RANDALL leaves. TAMMI sinks down into her chair and puts her face in her hands.)

(CUT TO: Outside, RANDALL is emptying a bin into a dumpster. He looks into the dumpster at dead rats. He picks up a fence post and pauses. We see a rat moving amongst the bodies. RANDALL strikes down with the post.)

DWIGHT: RANDALL! You avoiding me? Tammi told you I wanted to talk to you, right? You wanna tell me what happened last night?

(RANDALL is uncommunicative. His mouth is moving as though he is muttering something.)

DWIGHT: Look, Randall, I'm not mad at you necessarily. But I need to know exactly what happened. Any time you decide to do something without telling me first, you could get us both into trouble.

RANDALL: I saw him stealing.

DWIGHT: Carlton stealing from me?

RANDALL: Yeah.

DWIGHT: He was skimming. So, where's the money that he was skimming?

(RANDALL doesn't reply.)

DWIGHT: You see, the thing of it is, Randall - you get the money, then you do your thing. It's a simple equation. That's what I'm talking about when I say you need to talk to me first. It'll probably be OK but in the future let's keep the communication lines open. One hand talks to the other, right?

(RANDALL smiles gratefully. He nods to DWIGHT.)

DWIGHT: I brought you a sandwich. Meat loaf the way you like it. Go on, take it, it's got ketchup.

(DWIGHT gives the sandwich to RANDALL. RANDALL looks at DWIGHT.)

RANDALL: Going out tonight?

(DWIGHT smiles and nods.)



SCENE 5
CHASE REAL ESTATE
9:17 AM

(SCULLY and DOGGETT enter CHASE's office.)

DOGGETT: The police station's less than a mile from here.

SCULLY: Chase ran it on foot. He said that somebody was after him. This is probably where it all started.

(They look around. SCULLY looks through papers on a desk.)

SCULLY: Oh.

DOGGETT: What's that?

SCULLY: CHASE did a lot of business with an exterminating company called Triple-A-1 Surekill. Six jobs in one month.

DOGGETT: I didn't know that was a requirement of selling a house.

(DOGGETT goes into an inner office. The lights are still on. He sees a gun and bullet casings on the floor. He picks one up using a pencil.)

DOGGETT: Agent!

(SCULLY comes in.)

DOGGETT: It's a 45. The bullet that killed Chase at the police station was a 9mm.

(DOGGETT switches off the lights. Sunlight streams in through many bullet holes in the walls.)

DOGGETT: You know, Elvis used to do this to his hotel rooms.

SCULLY: (Looking around) I think Carlton Chase did this.

DOGGETT: So who was he shooting at? If it was someone in this room, he damned sure would have hit 'em.

SCULLY: Unless it was someone outside.



SCENE 6
1310 SOUTH MAIN STREET
11.32 PM

(Night. We can see a street of warehouses, with jets of steam billowing from the ground.)

(CUT TO: Inside warehouse - we see a group of men. DWIGHT enters. Men point guns at him.)

DWIGHT: Evening.

MAN 1: What? You lost?

DWIGHT: Nope. I think this must be the place.

MAN 1: You a cop?

DWIGHT: Hell, no. No, your secret's safe with me fellas. But I will be taking that money off your hands, and the dope.

MAN 1: Oh, you're funny. Now, you know what? Chris Rock is funny. And you? You're just dead.

(DWIGHT puts his hands up as the men holds their guns on him.)

MAN 2: Nah, cap his ass.

(DWIGHT points his right index finger at one of them.)

DWIGHT: Bang.

(We hear a silenced gunshot and the man falls.)

DWIGHT: (He turns) Bang.

(Another gunshot. Another man falls.)

DWIGHT: (He turns again) Bang.

(Another gunshot. A third man falls. The door opens. RANDALL enters with a gun wrapped in cloth which is burning. He starts to unwind the cloth ...)



SCENE 7
1310 SOUTH MAIN STREET
8:07 AM

(Crime scene, with lots of police officers. SCULLY is looking through holes in the wall. DOGGETT is on his cellphone.)

DOGGETT: Thanks.

(DOGGETT ends his call and walks up to SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: So which kind of shooting was this? Lucky, coincidental, or some third alternative?

SCULLY: Well, it's precision marksmanship, that's for sure. These holes line up perfectly with the three victims behind there, which tells me that the shooter was standing right here behind this wall.

DOGGETT: Consequently he wouldn't be able to see what the hell he was aiming at.

SCULLY: Unless he could see. The light our eyes can register is only one small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Other wavelengths from infra-red to gamma have other properties. X-rays, for instance, can pass through solid objects.

DOGGETT: Walls, for example. So, you saying this guy used some kind of X-ray machine.

(SCULLY looks at DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Wait, you, you're not saying this guy has X-ray vision?

SCULLY: I am *remarking* that these wavelengths exist and the only thing that is stopping us from seeing them, if you will, is the biochemical structure of our eyes. I am *conjecturing* that if this structure was somehow different we'd have the ability to see things that we don't.

DOGGETT: (DOGGETT leans in towards SCULLY and whispers.) Call in Clark Kent.

SCULLY: OK, so you explain it.

DOGGETT: Well I can't so I'm sticking to what I do know.

SCULLY: Which is?

DOGGETT: This was a drug rip-off. Furthermore, it's the fifth drug rip-off in this area for the past two months. This guy's making a living capping local drug dealers.

SCULLY: And how does a dead real estate agent figure into that?

DOGGETT: Now, that I don't know - yet, but I did find out one more thing. Sulphuryl fluoride.

(SCULLY stares at DOGGETT.)



SCENE 8

(A money counting machine is counting bills in TAMMI's office. DWIGHT enters and leans on the desk. There's a long pause.)

DWIGHT: Got a moment to see me in my office?

TAMMI: Dwight. I need to get this to the bank.

DWIGHT: That can wait.

(RANDALL, under the hood of a car, watches DWIGHT and TAMMI go into DWIGHT's office. In the office, TAMMI starts undressing. We see RANDALL staring towards the office.)

TAMMI: Can't you tell your brother to get some lunch or something at least? He's practically right outside the door.

DWIGHT: I'll keep the noise level down if you will.

(RANDALL is staring at the office door.)

TAMMI: I always feel like he's watching me.

DWIGHT: How's he watching you now?

(Close up on RANDALL's face. He hears something outside and starts to walk away. SCULLY and DOGGETT enter the warehouse.)

SCULLY: Hello?

DOGGETT: Anybody here?

(Office door opens. DWIGHT comes out.)

DWIGHT: Yeah.

DOGGETT: Agents Doggett and Scully. FBI.

DWIGHT: Dwight Cooper. What can I do for you?

(DOGGETT takes out some papers and shows them to DWIGHT.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Cooper, do you recognize these?

DWIGHT: Well I don't recognize much anything except shapes. Tammi! Tammi! Come look at these for me.

(TAMMI comes out of office, tucking in her blouse. SCULLY notices this.)

DWIGHT: I got bad peepers. Legally blind since birth. (to TAMMI) These look familiar?

TAMMI: These are ours. Last month's billings for Mr. Chase.

DWIGHT: Oh. Carlton. He was one of my best clients. I sent him a ham every Christmas till he finally told me he was a Jew. (he laughs out loud) He was a nice guy.

DOGGETT: We found some evidence at a crime scene. A piece of fabric on which we found traces of a chemical - sulphuryl fluoride.

SCULLY: It's an insecticide used only by licensed exterminators.

DWIGHT: Yeah, it's good stuff. We use it. Along with about 200 other outfits in Central Mass.

DOGGETT: You've done time, haven't you?

DWIGHT: Yeah, a long time ago. Now my brother and I are actually members of the Worcester Chamber of Commerce, if you can believe that one. (laughs again) Anything else?

DOGGETT: Yeah, why did Carlton Chase call this office 14 minutes before he was murdered?

(DWIGHT looks puzzled. He looks at TAMMI.)

SCULLY: 8:34p.m. We found a call to your office billed on Mr. Chase's calling card. It was made from a payphone not far from where he was murdered.

DWIGHT: Wow. I don't know what to tell you. We are all gone home by that time and there wasn't any message on our machine.

DOGGETT: All right. We'll be in touch if we have any further questions.

(DOGGETT and SCULLY leave. TAMMI starts walking back to her office.)

DWIGHT: Tammi. What do you know about that? About Carlton calling here.

TAMMI: He, I guess he must have left a message.

DWIGHT: Well, what did it say?

TAMMI: I didn't hear it. I was reaching for the play button and I hit the erase button by mistake. I should have told you. I was just afraid that I lost us some business maybe.

(DWIGHT flicks on a cigarette lighter about 6 inches from TAMMI's face.)

DWIGHT: Come here, baby.

(He pulls TAMMI towards him and holds the lighter close to her face, peering at her eyes.)

DWIGHT: You know I can't see worth a damn. That's when I have a look at your eyes. The eyes are the windows of the soul. They tell you everything you need to know about a person. So tell me, are you lying?

(DWIGHT is staring straight at TAMMI. TAMMI is staring at the flame.)

TAMMI: I'm not, Dwight.

(DWIGHT stares closely at TAMMI's eyes, holding the lighter very close to her face. TAMMI is very uncomfortable. Then he flicks the lighter off.)

DWIGHT: That's all I needed to know.



SCENE 9

(A computer monitor is showing the police record for DWIGHT. We see he's about 5'10".)

DOGGETT: Dwight Cooper. Arrested in 1986.

(DOGGETT is sat in front of the computer; SCULLY is standing behind him.)

SCULLY: For Grand Theft Auto.

DOGGETT: Right. How does a legally blind guy steal a car?

(DOGGETT looks quizzically at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: I assume he had a partner doing the driving.

DOGGETT: The brother he mentioned - Randall Cooper.

(DOGGETT types on the keyboard. Monitor shows another police record, this time for RANDALL.)

DOGGETT: They were arrested together. Although Randall apparently didn't serve much time.

SCULLY: They share the same birthday. (beat) They're twins.

DOGGETT: They ain't twins. Twins never rat each other out.

SCULLY: Well, maybe there's someone in that office who will.



SCENE 10

(Night. Exterior shot of an apartment block.)

(CUT TO: Inside TAMMI's apartment. She looks out the window and sees a shadow of a man projected onto the opposite wall. She closes the window and drops the blind.)

(Camera pans right, across outside of the building to the next door apartment. Through the window we see RANDALL looking left in the direction of TAMMI's apartment.)

(CUT TO: close up on RANDALL's face.)

(CUT TO: Camera taking RANDALL's POV through the intervening walls and rooms into TAMMI's bathroom where she takes off her bathrobe.)

(CUT TO: RANDALL's face, reacting when he sees TAMMI's naked back.)

(CUT TO: TAMMI who half turns, seeming to feel she's being watched.)

(CUT BACK TO: RANDALL's face.)

(This sinister shot reminds DrWeesh of Donnie Pfaster from episodes Irresistable and Orison.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11
7.44 AM

(Outside AAA-1 Surekill office. TAMMI drives up. Hurries in to her office. Unlocks desk drawer and takes out cashbox. Suddenly there's DWIGHT in the doorway with RANDALL behind him.)

DWIGHT: Hey, Tammi, you're in early.

(DWIGHT comes in and holds up keys.)

DWIGHT: Know you accidentally left your car running? You must have been in a real hurry to get in here to make the coffee. (looks at cashbox) What you got there? Can I see? (grabs cash box)

DOGGETT (offscreen): Dwight Cooper? FBI!

(SCULLY and a police officer pass by the office door. DOGGETT enters.)

DOGGETT: Dwight Cooper. Warrant to search. Have someone read it to you.

DWIGHT: What the hell are you looking for?

DOGGETT: Evidence relating to the murder of Carlton Chase, at all.

(DOGGETT notices the cashbox)

What's in the box?

DWIGHT: You got me.

(DOGGETT takes the box.)

DOGGETT: What's the combination?

TAMMI: I don't remember.

DOGGETT: So much for the easy way.

(DOGGETT picks up a screwdriver and levers the box open. TAMMI looks scared, but it's empty - she looks shocked.)

DWIGHT: You owe me for that. You know, I run a clean business here. You're not going to find anything that's going to say otherwise.

(SCULLY enters office.)

SCULLY: I wouldn't be so sure. Can you explain these, Mr. Cooper?

(SCULLY is holding a pile of folders - they have "Chase Building" written on them.)



SCENE 12

(Police Station interview room. Inside DOGGETT is interviewing DWIGHT.)

DOGGETT: You want to tell me about these invoices?

(CUT TO: SCULLY outside in the corridor looking through the window at them. Then she walks into the next interview room where RANDALL is seating.)

SCULLY: OK Randall? Let's talk about your exterminating company. There's just the three of you, right? You and your brother and Tammi Peyton?

(RANDALL just stares ahead.)

SCULLY: So, how is it that your little company billed over $700,000 to Chase Realty last year?

(RANDALL continues to stare.)

SCULLY: Seven hundred thousand. That's a lot of dead rats. I think that you and your brother and Carlton Chase were in a whole other business together.

(RANDALL shakes his head. SCULLY looks from RANDALL to the wall between this room and the one DWIGHT and DOGGETT are in.)

(CUT TO: other interview room.)

DOGGETT: You know, I gotta get into the bug business. I had no idea you could make so much dough killing things that creep around behind walls.

(DWIGHT glares at DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: You are quite the entrepreneur.

DWIGHT: I'm just a regular Joe. Providing a public service.

(DOGGETT smiles, DWIGHT smiles. Camera pulls back to RANDALL - showing what he sees - DWIGHT facing him, mouthing words.)

SCULLY: Randall?

RANDALL (somewhat robotic): I'm just a regular Joe. Providing a public service.

(SCULLY looks at RANDALL then at the wall then back at RANDALL.)

SCULLY: Is that what your brother just said to Agent Doggett?

(SCULLY moves in front of RANDALL and looks closely at him.)

SCULLY: (Quietly, whispering at times) You know why I said that, don't you? Because somehow you can see through that wall. You can see your brother behind me and you can read his lips. I don't know what gives you the ability but I know how you use it. You shoot drug dealers from places where they can't see you and then you and Dwight rob them. That's how you make all that money, isn't it?

RANDALL: No. We're exterminators.

SCULLY: Yeah. You certainly are. And talking to you now, I think that the whole thing is Dwight's idea. It's time to be your own man, Randall. It's time to think for yourself.

(RANDALL reacts slightly to this.)

(CUT TO: Outer office. TAMMI, SCULLY and DOGGETT go into interview room 1.)

(Outside DWIGHT sits down next to RANDALL.)

DWIGHT: You tell them anything?

RANDALL: No, I said what you said.

DWIGHT: Well, we got a problem. It needs to be taken care of.

(CUT TO: interview room with SCULLY, DOGGETT and TAMMI.)

TAMMI: I just keep the books.

DOGGETT: You keep the books and a whole lot of blood money going through that office. Now, come on - we're supposed to believe you didn't know what was going on - the drug rip-offs, the murders?

TAMMI (upset): I don't know about anything of that. DWIGHT doesn't tell me anything. I just book the cash receipts. I don't ask where they're from. I know not to ask.

SCULLY: Look. Here's where I get confused and I am hoping that you can help me out. Carlton Chase.

DOGGETT: We think Chase was Dwight's fence. He sold the drugs your boss stole. Together they had a good thing going, so why was CHASE killed? Seems like bad business.

SCULLY: Unless the reason wasn't business. (TAMMI looks at SCULLY.) Unless it was personal.

TAMMI: Am I under arrest?

(DOGGETT sighs, looks at SCULLY who shakes her head.)



SCENE 13

(TAMMI's apartment. Night. TAMMI returns and sees the shadow outside her window as before.)



SCENE 14

(Police station. SCULLY is sitting at a desk. DOGGETT enters and shows SCULLY a piece of paper.)

DOGGETT: Tammi Peyton's phone records. Found something interesting.

(SCULLY looks at the paper.)

SCULLY: Calls to Carlton Chase.

DOGGETT: All of 'em late night. What you want to bet they weren't discussing escrow accounts.

(CUT TO: Corridor outside TAMMI's apartment - she goes into the next apartment door and sees RANDALL standing looking out the window.)

(CUT BACK TO: Police Station.)

SCULLY: So Dwight Cooper learns that something's going on between his girl friend and Carlton Chase.

DOGGETT: And he kills him, or he orders him killed assuming Randall's the trigger man.

(SCULLY's and DOGGETT's dialogue continues over scene of RANDALL's apartment. TAMMI approaches him.)

SCULLY: Maybe not.

DOGGETT: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Maybe Dwight's not the one who's jealous.

(CUT BACK TO: TAMMI and RANDALL. RANDALL turns to look at TAMMI.)

TAMMI: I know it was you. You still need help Randall.



SCENE 15
WORCESTER BUS STATION
2:23 PM

(TAMMI's station wagon pulls up outside the bus station. TAMMI and RANDALL are sitting inside.)

TAMMI: Well I made a reservation for the three o'clock bus. You gonna wait for me? It's right over there The Big Sky Express. Be back right after I get the money. I know you took that book to protect me from Dwight. (pause) I need my book, Randall. I can't get my money without it.

(RANDALL draws book out from inside his jacket and gives it to TAMMI. TAMMI looks through it - it's a cash book with various sums, plus a key on string.)

TAMMI: I'll be back in half an hour, OK? I'll meet you by the bus. (RANDALL looks uncertain.) Randall, you know I'm coming back, you saved me from Carlton. I owe you. (RANDALL starts to get out the car.) Randall? I'll meet you by the bus.

(RANDALL gets out the car and TAMMI drives off. RANDALL wanders over to the bus.)



SCENE 16

(TAMMI's apartment. We see a Big Sky Country picture on the wall.)

(DOGGETT and SCULLY enter. )

SCULLY: Clothes are gone. Tammi left in a hurry. Maybe she thought someone was after her.

DOGGETT: If someone's after you, you don't pack, you leave with what you're wearing.

SCULLY: You think she planned to go?

DOGGETT: I do. The question is where.

(DOGGETT picks up TAMMI's phone.)

SCULLY: Who are you calling?

DOGGETT: Whoever Tammi called last.

(DOGGETT picks up and *69s the phone. It's an automated voice system for a bus company.)

AUTOMATED MESSAGE: Welcome to Concordia Bus Lines. Our menu options have changed. For Reservations, Press 1.)



SCENE 17

(Outside a branch of the Craddock Marine Bank. TAMMI leaves the bank carrying a large holdall. She gets in her car and is then surprised by DWIGHT in the back seat. He holds gun to her head.)

DWIGHT: Tammi.

TAMMI: Dwight!

DWIGHT: Is this what you had in your secret box? A safety deposit key. You certainly got a lot of my money in there.

TAMMI: Dwight.

DWIGHT: Shut up and drive! Drive!

(CUT TO: Bus station)

(The Big Sky Express Bus leaves. RANDALL watches it from a distance then turns to leave. As he does so, 3 police cars arrive.)



SCENE 18

(Inside the AAA-1 Surekill Office. DWIGHT is looking at TAMMI's cash book through a magnifying glass.)

DWIGHT: This is how you did it. You kept two sets of books. You've been ripping me off for months. There's $100,000 difference here. Explains why you were in such a hurry the other morning.

TAMMI: Dwight!

DWIGHT: Shut up! Randall should have killed you, not Chase. Or maybe you and Carlton were working together.

TAMMI: It wasn't like that. When Carlton found out about the money he blackmailed me. He made me (pause) do things.

DWIGHT: Aww. I bet you put up a big fight. Now, wait a minute, if Carlton wasn't stealing from me then why did Randall kill him?

TAMMI: Dwight. You don't understand.

DWIGHT: No, no, no. I do understand. My brother was sweet on you. He killed Carlton because he knew what was going on between the two of you.

(DWIGHT grabs TAMMI and pushes her towards the door.)

TAMMI: No! No!

(RANDALL enters.)

DWIGHT: (to RANDALL) Where the hell you been? Mmm? I got something for you to do.

(DWIGHT drags TAMMI away.)

DWIGHT: Randall, get over here.

(DWIGHT pushes TAMMI into her office. He takes out a gun.)

TAMMI: Dwight, no!

DWIGHT (to RANDALL): Take it.

(DWIGHT puts the gun into RANDALL's hand.)

DWIGHT: She ripped us off, Randall, and you knew it.

TAMMI: No, Randall.

DWIGHT: What did you think? That the two of you were going to run off into the sunset together? She used you. Look at me, Randall (he grabs RANDALL's face with his hand). I am the one who loves you. Not her. Not anybody else, because we're blood, that's thicker than anything. (he lets go of RANDALL) I'm going to walk away now. I'm going to think hard about how I can forgive you. (DWIGHT lights a cigarette) You know what you gotta do.

(DWIGHT walks out of the office.)

TAMMI: Randall. You're not going to do this.

(RANDALL winds cloth around gun.)

TAMMI: Randall. Please.

(RANDALL and TAMMI move around the office so RANDALL is now opposite the door.)

TAMMI: I was coming back for you.

(He continues wrapping the gun in the cloth.)

RANDALL: No, you weren't.

(RANDALL takes aim towards TAMMI.)

TAMMI: RANDALL! No!

(RANDALL fires. The camera follows the trajectory of bullet, through walls, outside, straight into DWIGHT's forehead.)

(Cut to RANDALL. He drops the gun.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 19

(Inside the Police Station. SCULLY looks through a window into the interview room where RANDALL is sitting.)

DOGGETT: (Standing with SCULLY) Agent, has he said anything?

SCULLY: No. A County DA came in and he declined representation. Aside from that, he's been uncommunicative.

DOGGETT: The A.P.B. on Tammi Peyton is a wash so far. The Bureau in Montana is on alert.

SCULLY (contemplatively): He watched her every day. Wherever she was. A man who could look at anything in the world and he chooses her. He must have seen something in her that she could not see herself.

DOGGETT: Well if you're suggesting he could see into her heart, Agent (SCULLY looks at DOGGETT) you are out of FBI territory on this one. (Pause) I'll be out front.

(CUT TO: Interview room. The camera closes in on RANDALL. It then moves through the walls and any intervening objects to show what he's really looking at, in another room - a computer screen displaying TAMMI's photo and police record.)

[Fade to black]

[THE END]


Between the "Executive Producer" credit and the rest, the following notice appeared:

                                    SALVAGE



SCENE 1

(A woman, NORA PEARCE, mid thirties, is in her living room with CURTIS DELARIO, a few years older. He is looking sadly at a picture of her with another man.)

CURTIS DELARIO: It's just senseless. A man so young as Ray... It's God's cruel trick, Nora.

NORA PEARCE: Don't go blaming God, Curt. You and I know what killed Ray.

(She is sad, but in control of her emotions.)

CURTIS DELARIO: Oh... We don't know anything for sure.

NORA PEARCE: How does a 41-year-old man just... wither away and die?

CURTIS DELARIO: If any of us knew that we'd have done something about it. Maybe it was just his time.

(NORA PEARCE refuses to be comforted, her mind already made up.)

NORA PEARCE: He was a young man when he went over, Curt. Ray got sick because he fought in the Gulf.

CURTIS DELARIO: Now, don't go there, Nora. You just make it worse for yourself. The doctors never said...

NORA PEARCE: They never said! That's right. My husband's dead and no one knows why. Maybe I have to find out myself. They're going to pay for Ray's death-- whoever's to blame.

CURTIS DELARIO: No one's to blame. You're just upset. You need a good night's sleep.

NORA PEARCE: I don't want to sleep, I just...

(She begins crying.)

CURTIS DELARIO: You just want Ray back. (she nods) We all do.

(We see that someone is standing outside watching them through the window. Closed captioning has CURTIS say to NORA: "Get some rest. See you tomorrow, okay?" We follow as CURTIS DELARIO leaves the house. He pauses a moment as if he feels someone watching him, then dismisses it. He gets into his car, starts the engine and drives away. In the car, he starts to light a cigarette, then suddenly slams on the brakes as a MAN steps out into the road. In some pretty cool SFX, the car's hood splits around the immovable figure of the MAN. After the glass stops shattering, CURTIS DELARIO, his face cut and bleeding from the wreck looks up at the MAN who is seemingly unharmed and looking at CURTIS DELARIO with hatred.)

CURTIS DELARIO: Ray?

(CURTIS DELARIO screams as the MAN, RAY PEARCE, smashes the already cracked windshield with his fist, then reaches in and grabs him by the head.)

SCENE 2
MUNCIE, INDIANA
8:07 AM

(Next day. Through the blood-smeared, broken windshield of the car we see SCULLY looking at the damage to the hood of the car. Area is now a crime scene. A wrecker is preparing to haul away the damaged car. DOGGETT, who was talking to the local authorities, joins her where she is standing in the now v-shaped hood area..)

DOGGETT: Car's registered to a Curtis Delario, local address. So far, he's been unreachable.

SCULLY: Well, it's highly unlikely that wherever he is he feels like picking up the phone this morning.

DOGGETT: Muncie PD ran some calculations. Based on the distance traveled, the length of the skid marks, they estimate the car was going at least 40 when it impacted the object, which, according to their math would require something 4,300 times the density of steel to cause the damage we're looking at.

SCULLY: Hmm. It's interesting, isn't it? I mean, uh... in light of the evidence.

TOW TRUCK MAN: Hey, watch yourself.

(The wrecker pulls the car up onto its bed. SCULLY looks down and sees the imprint of two large shoes on the pavement. She kneels down for a better look.)

SCULLY: From their size and shape, these look like men's shoes.

DOGGETT: I hope you're not suggesting that what this car hit was a man, Agent Scully, because there's no way.

SCULLY: Well, these impressions in the asphalt look pretty fresh to me.

DOGGETT: I admit to the coincidence but you know as well as I that if a man were here he'd be splattered from here to tomorrow and there's just no evidence of that.

SCULLY: You're right, which is suspicious in and of itself. I mean, this car definitely hit something and the only evidence that we have are these two prints.

(SCULLY gets up and steps away from the car. DOGGETT does his version of the Scully eye-roll and follows her.)

DOGGETT: You know I hate to ruin your beautiful theory with ugly facts but stop to examine the incident. If a man were standing here, the driver would have stopped.

SCULLY: Well, it looks like he tried to.

DOGGETT: Well, even so, if a man were in the middle of the road with a car coming wouldn't he try to move?

SCULLY: Unless he wanted to stop the car.

DOGGETT: Yes, but if nothing less than a block of steel could stop this car then, ipso facto, it could not have been a man standing in the street last night.

SCULLY: Or certainly no ordinary man.

(DOGGETT and SCULLY regard each other for a moment. SCULLY again steps away.)

(NORA PEARCE comes running out of the house. She is hysterical.)

NORA PEARCE: Just tell me what happened-- where is he? Where...

(The local officers restrain her.)

DOGGETT: Excuse me, ma'am? (shows badge) John Doggett with the FBI. Do you know about this?

NORA PEARCE: What happened? Where is he?

DOGGETT: Curtis Delario, you know him?

NORA PEARCE: He was a friend of my husband's. They worked together at the salvage yard.

DOGGETT: Now, I want you to calm down, Mrs....

NORA PEARCE: Pearce. How am I supposed to calm down? Finding this now, it...

DOGGETT: Well, we're not even sure he was driving the car last night.

NORA PEARCE: He was. He came over after my husband's funeral and then he left and...

(SCULLY, looking in a dumpster a few yards away, calls to DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett!

(He joins her. She flips open the dumpster lid all the way.

SCULLY: Meet Curtis Delario.

(The very dead bloody body of CURTIS DELARIO is in the dumpster. His forehead and temples have five deep puncture wounds, each a little less than an inch in diameter.)

SCULLY: I guess he won't be much help clearing any of this up.



SCENE 3

(Morgue. SCULLY is conducting the autopsy on CURTIS DELARIO. She is measuring the diameter of the holes. She has a CUTE YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT assisting her. DOGGETT enters, file in hand.)

DOGGETT: I think I got some answers.

SCULLY: So do I. It wasn't the crash that killed Curtis Delario. He was badly injured, but he was clearly still alive when his body was pulled  through the car's windshield.

DOGGETT: Pulled?

SCULLY: Yeah, these five deep puncture marks match five fingers of one hand.

DOGGETT: You mean, someone just reached right in and...

SCULLY: Like a bowling ball.

DOGGETT: That seems humanly impossible.

SCULLY: Certainly for any ordinary man.

(Pause.)

DOGGETT: Well, from the evidence I've gathered the man that did this is actually less than ordinary. I was able to reconstruct a section of the windshield and lift a print from the glass.

SCULLY: Whose?

DOGGETT: Raymond Aloysius Pearce. Husband of Nora Pearce, woman I spoke with at the accident site.

(He shows her the Indiana State Police file with Pearce's prints.)

SCULLY: Hmm.

DOGGETT: Her recently deceased husband.

SCULLY: Well, if he was recently deceased then it must have been an old print.

DOGGETT: Well, what you would think except along with the print there was evidence of fresh blood and it belongs to Ray Pearce, too.



SCENE 4
ST. CLARE'S HALFWAY HOUSE
9:41 AM

(Old white building in a run down section of town. RAY PEARCE wakes up in a plain institutional bed in a mostly white room. His cheek appears to have a rash. He looks over at the pillowcase and sees a few drops of blood. He gets up and goes into the bathroom and turns on the fluorescent light. It buzzes for a moment, then finally comes on. He looks at his cheeks in the mirror and then reaches into the medicine cabinet for a pair of toenail clippers. As very sad piano music begins underscoring the scene, he uses the clippers to slowly snip off his beard stubble, one "whisker" at a time. They fall into the sink basin with metallic clinks. He is surprised, but continues the tedious process.)



SCENE 5

(DOGGETT knocks at a door. NORA PEARCE answers it.)

DOGGETT: Mrs. Pearce... Agent Doggett again. Sorry to bother you but there are some things I need to go over.

(Another man, HARRY ODELL, is with NORA PEARCE. He is about 50, and very protective of NORA PEARCE.)

HARRY ODELL: Everything all right, Nora?

NORA PEARCE: He's with the FBI. Uh, this is Harry Odell. He runs the Salvage yard where... Ray and Curt worked.

DOGGETT: May I come in?

(Close up on another affectionate picture of NORA PEARCE and RAY PEARCE. NORA PEARCE and HARRY ODELL are seated on the sofa.)

NORA PEARCE: Agent Doggett, I don't understand. Before, you were talking about Curt. Now you want to talk about Ray?

DOGGETT: What was their relationship, Mrs. Pearce-- your husband and Curtis Delario-- outside of work?

NORA PEARCE: I know what their relationship is now. They're both dead.

DOGGETT: Going back through your husband's medical records it says that he died after a long, debilitating illness?

NORA PEARCE: Gulf War Syndrome. No one will cop to that, but I aim to prove it-- put the blame where it belongs.

DOGGETT: I'm having trouble proving something myself, Mrs. Pearce. You signed a form to have your husband's body cremated but it appears it never happened.

NORA PEARCE: What do you mean? They gave me the ashes. They were at the funeral.

DOGGETT: Well, I can't find a record of Ray's body ever even being at the crematorium.

ODELL: Oh, for crying out loud. Hasn't this woman grieved enough?

DOGGETT: Let me get to the point, Mrs. Pearce. Is it possible your husband is still alive?

NORA PEARCE: Still alive? Is this a joke?

DOGGETT: Because we have evidence to suggest that maybe your husband was involved in the death of Curtis Delario.

HARRY ODELL: Are you saying Ray faked his death?

DOGGETT: We found Ray's blood and fingerprints on Curt's car.

NORA PEARCE: (tearfully) I watched him die. I nursed him when he was sick, when he couldn't eat. What you're saying is impossible. He couldn't even walk or... lift his head at the end.

HARRY ODELL: Ray Pearce worked for me nine years. He was a good man. He never raised a hand to anyone.



SCENE 6

(Back at the Halfway House. RAY PEARCE gets a sandwich wrapped in foil and brings it to a table. A blonde woman, LARINA, is walking around the room encouraging others. She comes over to RAY PEARCE and sits at his table, friendly and concerned. She is young, but looks like she has seen and been through a lot.)

LARINA: Hey. How're you doing? Ray, right? They said you're new.

(He stares at her with hostility. She winces as he bites some of the foil along with the sandwich.)

LARINA: Rough night? You're, uh... you're eating the tin foil on the...

(She smiles nervously as he slowly removes the foil from his mouth and continues eating the sandwich.)

LARINA: My name's Larina. I help out around here. Yeah, you might have some questions about how it all works. No, I don't know. It's, it's pretty basic.

(He ignores her and eats his sandwich.)

LARINA: Look, um... I've been down the road and back a few times and... I just want to say you're not alone, Ray. I mean, I... I been where you been and... and sometimes it can help. You know. Sometimes it's good to just... talk. Make a connection. You know what I'm saying, Ray?

(He just stares at her.)

LARINA: So if there's anything I can do for you, you know...

RAY PEARCE: You can leave me alone.

LARINA: Okaay.

(Rebuffed, she taps on the table, gets up and walks away. RAY PEARCE winces and squeezes his sandwich. His hands and knuckles appear to be hardening.)



SCENE 7
SOUTHSIDE SALVAGE
10:12 PM

(Night. Junkyard with lots of metal debris piled up. We see a man coving up a logo on the side of a blue 55-gallon drum with a can of blue spray paint. He tosses the can down, looks around, and then goes into the trailer office of the site. It is HARRY ODELL, and he seems to be in a hurry. He takes an office paper shredder and sets it on the desk and begins shredding papers from a file. The door opens. HARRY ODELL looks up and sees RAY PEARCE and gasps in amazement. RAY PEARCE's face is red and mottled. The rash is worse. The last paper inserted into the shredder hasn't gone all the way through. Must be manually operated.)

HARRY ODELL: God almighty. Ray. It's true. (nervous) Oh, you got everybody wondering, man. And they're looking for you. They blame you for killing Curt.

(HARRY ODELL sits and opens a desk drawer containing a gun and ammo.)

HARRY ODELL: Now, me and Curt, we're your friends. You can't blame this on us. You got to believe me, it wasn't us.

(RAY PEARCE just looks at him.)

HARRY ODELL: Well, I can show you. It's right here, Ray.

(HARRY ODELL is reaching into the desk drawer not for a file, but for the shotgun.)

HARRY ODELL: It wasn't me.

(He pulls out the shotgun and aims it levelly at RAY PEARCE.)

HARRY ODELL: (confidently) This time, you stay dead.

(HARRY ODELL fires the gun. The impact sends RAY PEARCE crashing through the large window of the trailer. Cautiously, HARRY ODELL goes out to investigate. He looks down in horror at RAY PEARCE's dismembered right forearm and hand. The blood seems to be moving like mercury from a broken thermomenter and the fingers twitch. RAY PEARCE begins walking toward him. HARRY ODELL screams as, with his remaining hand, RAY PEARCE grabs him by the head.)



SCENE 8

(Salvage yard, next day. Crime scene. DOGGETT is looking at the body of HARRY ODELL, specifically at his fingers which have a blue tinge. He stands and calls SCULLY. He now has her on speed dial.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Did you find anything to go along with those holes in Curt Delario's head? Paint on his hands and nails?

(SCULLY is still in the morgue with CURTIS DELARIO's body.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Paint?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Blue paint, specifically.

SCULLY: (on phone) Hang on.

(SCULLY looks at CURTIS DELARIO's fingers.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Uh... no. Is it significant?

DOGGETT: (on phone) I don't know. But Harry was a busy boy last night. He must've left Nora Pearce's right after I saw him, right after he learned that Ray Pearce might still be alive.

SCULLY: (on phone) To do what?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Well, it's pretty clear that he was in his office shredding papers when he was surprised by someone.

SCULLY: (on phone) And you think it was Ray?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Well, somebody took a blast. There's blood all over the doors, trailing down the stairs here to there-- massive blood loss.

SCULLY: But the man with the gun is dead.

DOGGETT: I saw guys take hits in the war that kept right on fighting, holding their insides in their hands. I know it's not impossible. But to do this to a man's head after taking two barrels of buckshot...

SCULLY: (on phone) Or being hit by a car.

DOGGETT: (on phone) I don't see how a man could possibly do this.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, maybe the question's not how but why? I mean, if Ray Pearce did indeed kill this man what would be his reason?

DOGGETT: (on phone) I'm not sure, but I think I know where to start looking.

(DOGGETT hangs up and watches as the coroners load HARRY ODELL's body onto a stretcher. He goes into the office and uses his pocketknife to pry open the top of the paper shredder and finds the section of paper not yet shredded. It says "Chamber Technologies," an invoice.)



SCENE 9

(Halfway house. RAY PEARCE's bathroom. We see him rinse blood off of his left hand, then he puts his right hand and arm, now half scaly metal, into the sink basin also. Camera pans up to show us that the right half of his face is also covered in metal. He regards himself in the mirror. LARINA knocks at RAY PEARCE's door.)

LARINA: Hello? Ray?

(There is no answer, so she enters. Some bloody clothes are lying on the bed. She sees RAY PEARCE, his jacket hood pulled over his head Unibomber-style, come out of the bathroom.)

LARINA: Ray. You okay?

(He doesn't answer and keeps his face from her. He starts collecting files on his bed.)

LARINA: Somebody saw you come in with blood on you. I can see it on your clothes. Look, Ray, I know it never does anybody any good getting the cops involved, okay? Look, I've been there, man. I know what it's like to feel dark and alone. I can get a doctor for you.

RAY PEARCE: Get out. Get out.

(He pulls the hood back. She recoils at the sight of his face.)

LARINA: (backing off) Okay. Okay.



SCENE 10
CHAMBER TECHNOLOGIES
10:23 AM

(DOGGETT and a dweeby looking scientist, DR. PUGOVEL, are in front of a computer monitor in a lab. He shows diagrams.)

DR. PUGOVEL: They're called smart metals. The idea is to one day build things that are indestructible. Cars, equipment built of alloys with molecular memory. If damaged, they'd rebuild into their original forms.

DOGGETT: All by themselves? That's amazing!

DR. PUGOVEL: And right now, all a metallurgist's pipe dream. But beside the point of your visit, I would imagine.

DOGGETT: Well, you tell me. I found a document at a crime scene listing Chamber Technologies. An employee number on the document was assigned to a Dr. David Clifton.

DR. PUGOVEL: Dr. Clifton's no longer here.

DOGGETT: What happened to him?

(Pause.)

DR. PUGOVEL: He left the company. I'm actually his successor in this department.

DOGGETT: Do you have any reason to deal with a man named Harry Odell or a business called Southside Salvage?

DR. PUGOVEL: No, I don't deal with materials. Nor did Dr. Clifton for that matter. Our work here is all theoretical. We have an environmental manager who's in charge of waste management but disposal is done at TSD Facilities, definitely not city salvage yards.

DOGGETT: Thanks for your time, Doctor...

DR. PUGOVEL: Puvogel. German, no H. You need me to spell it for you?

DOGGETT: No, no. That's quite all right. Thanks.

(DOGGETT walks away and dials his cell phone.

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(She is still in the morgue.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Hey, it's Agent Doggett. I'm at Chamber Technologies.

SCULLY: (on phone) Did you find Dr. Clifton?

DOGGETT: (on phone) He's no longer with the company. But his successor says his work here was entirely conceptual. Everything's done on computers.

SCULLY: (on phone) What kind of conceptual work?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Thing called smart metals. It's pretty incredible-- metal alloys designed to rebuild themselves.

SCULLY: (on phone) I wonder. As it happens Ray Pearce's illness is pretty incredible, too. I've reviewed Ray's medical records from the VA. What his wife was calling Gulf War Syndrome is nothing of the kind. His entire cellular makeup was affected by exposure to some non-identifiable contaminant-- a metal.

DOGGETT: (on phone) What are you saying? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man? Because that only happens in the movies, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (on phone) Does it, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Tell you what. I'll press this guy here a little more on the issue.

SCULLY: (on phone) Well, maybe there's a reason why he's not being perfectly forthcoming.



SCENE 11

(LARINA is watching the news on television and reading the paper. Headline is "Clinton prepares to pass  ." On the back of the section she finds an obituary photo of RAY PEARCE in his uniform. She looks up at the television. Channel 6.)

WNKW NEWSCASTER: ...manufacturing crystal meth at a farmhouse outside of Muncie. DEA agents arrested the unlikely pair after a month-long investigation. Police are still searching for clues in last night's bloody robbery and murder at Muncie's Southside Salvage. Workmen found the body of 53-year-old Harry Odell outside his office at approximately 7:30 this morning. Detectives have refused to comment on the cause of death pending an autopsy but sources close to the case describe it as a...

(LARINA goes to the phone and dials 411.)

OPERATOR: This is Operator 525. What city, please?

LARINA: (on phone) Uh, Muncie. Number for a Raymond Pearce.



SCENE 12

(Night. SCULLY, looking tired, walks out of the morgue and gets in the passenger side of the rental car.)

DOGGETT: Sorry I'm late.

SCULLY: It's all right. I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce who was pronounced dead three days ago. But that's not all. By all medical standards he should still be dead. His blood has enough metal alloy in it to  uh poison an elephant.

DOGGETT: Except that he's still a man, Agent Scully and he's going to act and think like one even if he is more powerful than a speeding locomotive.

SCULLY: But then the question is, why kill his friends? I mean, if he was wronged somehow wouldn't he go to them for solace? I mean, to his wife, at least?

(He hands her a file.)

DOGGETT: That's why I was late. I asked myself that same question. Ray was an outpatient at the VA. He had a history of substance abuse. Did some time for a couple of DUIs.

SCULLY: This was ten years ago.

DOGGETT: Cleaned up his act. He met Nora and married her in '91, checked himself into a rehab and got straight. This was a guy to root for, Agent Scully. This was a guy that overcame adversity and made a life for himself.

SCULLY: Until three days ago.

DOGGETT: I've busted a lot of killers, Agent Scully and dollars for doughnuts, they fit a profile. But the Ray Pearce in this file is no murderer let alone a guy that would hunt down his friends and crush their skulls.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, the man that we're speaking about withstood impact from a speeding car and two shotgun blasts at short range. Even if we can find him, who's to say we can stop him?

(He looks at her. They both look more than a little concerned.)



SCENE 13
CHAMBER TECHNOLOGIES
9:52 PM

(DR. PUGOVEL is sitting at his computer. He senses someone watching him, and gets up and leaves the room. Through another door, RAY PEARCE enters and looks around. He follows DR. PUGOVEL through a doorway covered with plastic hanging strips. In the room, DR. PUGOVEL is hiding behind a wall section. He pushes a button on a computer. A metal chamber in the room glows with a red light. RAY PEARCE walks cautiously into the chamber. DR. PUGOVEL quickly pushes another button on the keyboard and the door to the chamber slams shut, trapping RAY PEARCE inside. Immediately, a police SWAT team armed with powerful guns and body armor run into the room, followed by SCULLY and DOGGETT armed with their little guns. True to X- Files form, no one turns on a room light, instead relying on handheld flashlights to illuminate the scene.)

DOGGETT: Make sure that door is secure!

SCULLY: Dr. Puvogel, are you sure he can't open that door from the inside?

DR. PUGOVEL: I've got a manual override on the door.

(Inside the chamber. RAY PEARCE looks around his trap.)

(Outside the chamber. There is a loud hollow thudding sound. An imprint of a fist? appears on the surface of the door to the sealed chamber.)

DR. PUGOVEL: What the hell was that?

(Another thud and another imprint.)

SCULLY: Ray Pearce.

(More pounding and more imprints. The officers in the room look nervous.)

DR. PUGOVEL: The door is four inches thick.

(More pounding. DR. PUGOVEL gets behind DOGGETT and SCULLY.)

DR. PUGOVEL: I don't think it's going to hold!

DOGGETT: You'd better hope it does 'cause if it doesn't, he's coming after you and I don't know if we can stop him.

(More pounding, then silence.)

DOGGETT: Open it up.

SCULLY: Get it open!

(DR. PUGOVEL looks down at the readout on the computer screen.)

DR. PUGOVEL: There's a rupture in the chamber. I don't believe this.

(The door is opened and SCULLY and DOGGETT follow the SWAT team inside. RAY PEARCE is gone and there is a huge hole torn out of the back of the chamber leading to the dark lawn outside.)

(Still in the chamber, SCULLY is looking at a metallic-looking liquid moving on the edges of the torn wall.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Look at this. You see this?

DOGGETT: What is that? Is that blood?

SCULLY: Turning itself into metal.

(DOGGETT leaves the chamber and begins helping the SWAT team hustle DR. PUGOVEL out of the room.)

DOGGETT: Get him out of here! Get him out of the building!

DR. PUGOVEL: I didn't do anything to the man! I didn't do anything.

DOGGETT: You want to argue about it or let us get you someplace safe?!

DR. PUGOVEL: Where's that? Where's safe?!

DOGGETT: It's not in here.

(As the SWAT team moves DR. PUGOVEL out of the room, DOGGETT notices several blue 55-gallon drums with the yellow Chamber Technologies logo on them. DOGGETT glances over at SCULLY, then also leaves the room.



SCENE 14
ST. CLARE'S HALFWAY HOUSE
11:08 PM

(RAY PEARCE, still wearing his hood, opens the door to his room at the group home to see NORA PEARCE, his wife, waiting for him.)

NORA PEARCE: My god. It's true.

RAY PEARCE: You shouldn't have come, Nora.

NORA PEARCE: I shouldn't have come? That's what you say to me? I'm your wife. I came here because you didn't come to me. I had to have some stranger tell me. Why didn't you come, Ray?

RAY PEARCE: Because I'm not me.

(She follows him into the bathroom, and gasps softly as he removes his hood.)

NORA PEARCE: I don't care what's happened. Whatever it is, it's a miracle. Don't go.

(She reaches for his hand, then cries out and cradles her bloody palm, cut from where she touched the metal part of his.)

RAY PEARCE: There's your miracle.

NORA PEARCE: Ray, let me help you. Please, let me help.

RAY PEARCE: They've got to pay for this. They've all got to pay.

(She nods.)



SCENE 15
SOUTHSIDE SALVAGE
11:34 PM

(DOGGETT flashlight in hand, is walking through the salvage yard. He finds the spray painted drums and uses his pocketknife to expose the yellow Chamber Technologies logo underneath the paint. He finds one of the drums with two handprints on the lid, punched from inside. He kicks the drum over. The solid figure of a man falls out of the drum. He seems to be made of solid metal, his hands frozen forever over his head.)

DOGGETT: Oh my god.



SCENE 16

(Police station. DR. PUGOVEL is led into a room with SCULLY and DOGGETT.)

DR. PUGOVEL: You mind telling me what's going on here. It's not enough that my life's been threatened. I'm being treated like a criminal.

SCULLY: Not without cause.

(DR. PUGOVEL stares in shock at the "metallized" body that DOGGETT found in the salvage yard. It is now in a glass case.)

DR. PUGOVEL: Oh, my god.

SCULLY: Do you recognize this man?

DOGGETT: We're assuming you don't know too many guys in this particular condition.

DR. PUGOVEL: It's not what it looks like.

DOGGETT: Is this Dr. Clifton-- Dr. David Clifton-- your predecessor?

DR. PUGOVEL: (sighs) Yes.

DOGGETT: You care to explain how he ended up in a Chamber Technology hazardous waste barrel?

DR. PUGOVEL: It was his idea. I was against it.

DOGGETT: If you knew, you might've told me about this when I first came to see you.

DR. PUGOVEL: He was dying... and he was afraid.

SCULLY: Of what?

DR. PUGOVEL: That it would hinder progress or halt it. That it would finish us.

DOGGETT: Oh, you're finished. One way or another your work here is done.

DR. PUGOVEL: We didn't know this was going to happen! We were just trying to push the envelope, do the right thing for the company. Then he got sick. He was... he was working with an alloy with a genetic algorithm built into it. It converted electrical energy into mechanical. Gave it memory.

SCULLY: And it poisoned him.

DR. PUGOVEL: We immediately shut down the project. But it was too late. He didn't have any family. His work was his life. He wanted to leave us to continue working on the science.

DOGGETT: And leave you to ship this barrel and his body to Southside Salvage where it infected somebody else.

DR. PUGOVEL: I don't know how that happened, I swear to god. That barrel was supposed to go to a designated site.

SCULLY: (to DOGGETT) Let me talk to you for a second.

(They step away.)

SCULLY: (quietly) I think he's telling the truth.

(Outside in the hall, they see NORA PEARCE run furtively into the hall and take the elevator.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is she doing here?

SCULLY: Who is it?

DOGGETT: Nora Pearce, Ray's wife.

(DOGGETT and SCULLY also head toward the elevator.)

(On another floor, we see NORA PEARCE enter an office and get a red file folder from a drawer. She looks at it, then returns the file to the open drawer, then picks up the desk phone and dials. DOGGETT and SCULLY enter. NORA PEARCE quickly hangs up the phone.)

DOGGETT: Mrs. Pearce? What are you doing here? How do you know about this place?

(SCULLY notices the open file drawer.)

SCULLY: She was looking for something.

DOGGETT: Who'd you call, Mrs. Pearce?

(Terrified, NORA PEARCE doesn't answer.)



SCENE 17

(Halfway house. SWAT team enters the house, then RAY PEARCE's room. LARINA looks on nervously for a moment then goes to her own room. RAY PEARCE is waiting for her. He clamps his metal hand over her mouth. Her cries of pain are muffled, then she is silent, eyes staring. He lowers her dead body to the floor as the police knock at her door.)

OFFICER: Let's check in here.

(Pounding.)

OFFICER: Police!

(Pounding continues as RAY PEARCE looks around, then heads for a window.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY and DOGGETT are questioning NORA PEARCE in another office.)

OFFICER: Want us to take the woman in?

DOGGETT: No, I want to talk to her first.

(DOGGETT turns to NORA PEARCE. She has a defiant, almost smug expression. Still nervous, though.)

DOGGETT: You might be interested to know that your husband just broke through a second-story wall and eluded a dozen cops at St. Clare house. That please you, Mrs. Pearce? Does it please you to know that he killed a young woman there, a volunteer named Larina Jackson?

SCULLY: That makes three people. Three people that he's killed and for what?

(NORA PEARCE is upset by this news, but defends her husband.)

NORA PEARCE: Because they made him what he is.

DOGGETT: They say this young woman he killed tonight had been concerned for himconcerned for Ray's welfare.

SCULLY: Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become, it was an accident. It was not those people's fault, Mrs. Pearce.

NORA PEARCE: Harry and Curt knew about it.

SCULLY: No, they were innocent, just like Ray was. They didn't know that this was going to happen.

NORA PEARCE: These people here knew about it. They got documents on it.

SCULLY: Oh, so that's what this is about? This is about looking for somebody to blame?

DOGGETT: Ray sent you here, didn't he to find that person; to get a name?

NORA PEARCE: The Ray I know... died. And the man responsible should pay for that.

SCULLY: So who is it? It's the CEO here? The owner? Give us a name, Mrs. Pearce, before someone else has to die.

(NORA PEARCE is not sure what to do. She doesn't look at them.)

NORA PEARCE: I... I never gave him a name.

(DOGGETT is tired of dealing with her.)

DOGGETT: Get her out of here. Put her on 24-hour watch.



SCENE 19
PEARCE RESIDENCE
2:17 AM

(Later, NORA PEARCE is escorted into her house. Lots of police cars on the street outside.)

OFFICER: We'll be right outside, ma'am.

(Alone, NORA PEARCE looks around her dark house, waiting. RAY PEARCE's voice startles her.)

RAY PEARCE: Nora?

NORA PEARCE: They're right outside, Ray.

RAY PEARCE: Did you get me the name?

NORA PEARCE: You killed her. The woman who called me. For god's sake, Ray, why? Why her? She cared about you.

(He begins walking toward her.)

RAY PEARCE: I need the name.

NORA PEARCE: No one else needs to die, Ray.

(His skin is now almost completely metal. Roughly, he grabs her wrist. She gasps in pain.)

NORA PEARCE: You won't do it, not to me.

RAY PEARCE: I need the man's name.

(She gasps again as he painfully grips her wrist.)

(A moment later, NORA PEARCE flings open the front door. She is clutching her wrist in pain. She yells to the waiting police.)

NORA PEARCE: He's in the house!

OFFICER: Go! Go! Go!

(Immediately, the OFFICERS begin searching the house and yard. Dogs are barking.)

NORA PEARCE: Tell the FBI agents it's Harris. Ray made me give him the name. Owen Harris! Ray's going to kill him.



SCENE 20

(Street at night. OWEN HARRIS, a mild mannered looking man, around 40, and his WIFE are driving along. Suddenly, he slams on the brakes when he sees a figure in the road ahead. RAY PEARCE, the Metal Man, slams his hands down on the hood of the car. Panicked, OWEN HARRIS tries to start the car. MRS. HARRIS screams as RAY PEARCE punches in the drivers' side window and pulls OWEN HARRIS from the car by his arm. No bowling ball holes in the head yet.)

MRS. HARRIS: No! Owen! No! No!

(OWEN HARRIS' SON, about 9, is watching in horror from the back seat.)

SON: Daddy!

WIFE: No! No!

(RAY PEARCE has OWEN HARRIS on the pavement and his holding him tightly by the jaw. Blood is welling up.

RAY PEARCE: Owen Harris... don't look away. Look at me.

OWEN HARRIS: Why are you doing this?

RAY PEARCE: Because you made me.

OWEN HARRIS: (terrified) I don't know what you're talking about.

RAY PEARCE: Southside Salvage.

OWEN HARRIS: I'm just an accountant.

SON: Daddy!

(OWEN HARRIS gasps in pain. RAY PEARCE looks up slowly at the boy watching from the back of the car.)

SON: Daddy!



SCENE 21

(Later that night. In front of the HARRIS' house, later. Sirens. SCULLY and DOGGETT arrive. DOGGETT notices that EMT's are attending to OWEN and MRS. HARRIS and their son. He also notices deep handprints on the hood of the car. SCULLY joins him.)

SCULLY: Ray Pearce.

DOGGETT: He came here to kill this man but something stopped him, didn't it?

SCULLY: This man, Owen Harris? He begged for his life. It might just have saved him. His attacker got up and ran away.

DOGGETT: Makes no sense. Ray Pearce was a determined killer looking for someone to blame. Why stop here?

(Cut to the salvage yard, maybe next day. A large hydraulic grappling clamp is at work.)

SCULLY: Wherever Ray Pearce went, the answer to that question went with him but I can tell you why he came after Owen Harris. It was his name Nora found in the file. He was the accountant who authorized the shipment of hazardous materials to Southside Salvage.

(In the salvage yard, the clamp goes for another load of scrap metal.)

DOGGETT: But if Owen Harris is the guy Ray holds responsible why'd Ray let him live?

SCULLY: Well, I think that, uh, Nora Pearce may have been right. Her husband died, or at least his body did. Whatever killed those people was an abomination of a man. It was a machine.

DOGGETT: A machine? Come on, a machine doesn't know blame, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Nor mercy. Unless what drove Ray to kill is also what saved those people.

(In the salvage yard, the machine lifts an old shell of a car toward the metal compressor.)

SCULLY: Some flicker of humanity.

(Inside the car in the compressor, we see RAY PEARCE, his body almost completely metal. His eyes flicker weakly in the dimming light as the machine compacts the car.)

SCENE 1
SAHAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
MUMBAI, INDIA

(Busy airport terminal. Lots of older model cabs entering and leaving. Creak. A very large man, MR. POTOCKI, gets out of a cab and enters the terminal. He is wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase. Inside the terminal are several beggars holding their hands out hopefully. They call out to MR. POTOCKI as he makes his way to the ticket counter.)

BEGGARS: Paise! Paise!

(MR. POTOCKI ignores the beggars and slaps his passport down on the counter.)

CUSTOMS AGENT: Home to America, Mr. Potocki?

MR. POTOCKI: Not a moment too soon.

(MR. POTOCKI's voice conveys all the distaste that he feels for India and the culture. The CUSTOMS AGENT stamps the passport, and looks to the next person.)

CUSTOMS AGENT: Next in line. Passport, please.

(MR. POTOCKI begins walking down the concourse. He pauses and turns at the sound of a metallic creaking squeaky wheel sound following him. He looks down at a very small legless MAN on a tiny wheeled platform. The LEGLESS MAN looks up at him.)

MR. POTOCKI: Poor bastard.

(MR. POTOCKI continues on down the concourse. He turns again at the sound of the squeaking wheels. The LEGLESS MAN is still following him. The difference in their sizes is painfully obvious. MR. POTOCKI reaches in his pocket and pulls out some change. He drops it in the LEGLESS MAN's hand.)

MR. POTOCKI: Here's 50 paise. Buy yourself some WD-40.

(The LEGLESS MAN is not pleased. He stares at the other man with hatred. As MR. POTOCKI walks away, the LEGLESS MAN drops the change onto the ground.)

CIUT TO:

(MR. POTOCKI is sitting on the toilet reading a newspaper, the Bombay Observer. The creaking sound enters the bathroom. Under the door he sees the arms of the man on the wheeled platform.)

MR. POTOCKI: Oh, for crying out loud. Listen, fella, I already gave.

(The platform squeaks closer. Heavy drum music begins.)

MR. POTOCKI: Do you understand English?

(MR. POTOCKI stands and begins pulling up his pants. Suddenly, he falls screaming to the floor. He grasps desperately at the walls of the stall as he is pulled under the door toward the man on the platform.)



SCENE 2
DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
WASHINGTON, DC

(A plane lands at night.)

CUT TO:

(A room in a nice hotel. A BELLBOY opens the door. Room 815. MR POTOCKI enters without a word and stands in the middle of the room. The BELLBOY smiles cheerfully, hoping for his tip.)

BELLBOY: Long flight, huh? Bombay to D.C.?

(The BELLBOY moves the bags into the room.)

BELLBOY: You know, I always wondered do they serve, like, Indian food on the plane?

(MR. POTOCKI gives no response.)

BELLBOY: If there's anything else I can do for you, sir...

(Still no response. Disappointed, the BELLBOY leaves, spinning a squeaky wheel on the small platform that was part of the luggage that he carried in. He closes the door behind him. MR POTOCKI slowly sits on the bed breathing heavily. Blood seeps out of his leg through the cuff of his pants. Pan up so that we see that the bedspread where he is sitting is now soaked with blood. His eyes fill with blood. The heavy breathing continues, then stops.)

HOTEL BELMONT
WASHINGTON, DC
9:46 AM

(MR. POTOCKI's hotel room, next day. Crime scene. DOGGETT comes over to SCULLY as she enters. She looks tired.)

DOGGETT: Things that land in your in-box, huh, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Good morning. I'm sorry I'm late. I didn't get a chance to look at the case file. The traffic's terrible.

DOGGETT: Beltway's a nightmare. Takes longer to get crosstown than it does a plane ride from India, which is where our victim flew in from last night-- Bombay.

SCULLY: Who are we talking about?

(He shows her the passport.)

DOGGETT: Hugh Potocki. Importer/exporter from Minneapolis. Laid over in DC on his way home when all this blood drains from his body.

(Shot of bloody bedspread.)

SCULLY: Did the M.E. See it? The body?

DOGGETT: Yeah. Tox test ruled out hemorrhagic fever, Ebola, anything exotic. Something killed this man but it doesn't seem to be any foreign disease.

SCULLY: No sign of forced entry?

DOGGETT: No. No one was seen coming or going from this room. The maid found the body 20 minutes after a bellman left Mr. Potocki here. Whatever happened, happened fast.

SCULLY: So, basically what you're saying is that nobody knows anything.

DOGGETT: But then I guess that's why it's in your in-box.

(Pause as he circles her and sits and she, surprised, considers his words.)

DOGGETT: So, what do you think, Agent Scully? Haunted hotel room? Alien invaders? Sloppy vampires?

(She has no answer.)

DOGGETT: There is one small thing. The cops missed it their first time around.

(He pulls back the covers of the bed to reveal a small bloody handprint.)

SCULLY: (quietly) A child's print.

DOGGETT: Yeah. That's what it looks like.

DOGGETT: You know there was a ring of thieves when I was back in New York. They used kids for B&E jobs.

SCULLY: Mm...

DOGGETT: Squeezing in through cracked windows, that kind of thing. But this, this is beyond.

SCULLY: No. From what I see, Agent Doggett, from the way this man died... I doubt it was a kid who did this.

DOGGETT: Thanks. I'm not quite ready yet to lose all my faith in humanity.

SCULLY: But regardless, I'd say it's wise you keep an open mind.

(School administrators office. Outside we hear children playing. Inside, MRS. HOLT, 40's, is interviewing a MAN, MR. BURRARD, for a janitorial position. He doesn't speak at all, just maintains a small smile.)

MRS. HOLT: The better the economy gets the harder it is to fill these kinds of jobs. And the problem is that people look at it as just a paycheck. They don't realize that as maintenance engineer you are playing an important part in these kids' lives. And I can't tell you how wonderful it is to find someone as enthusiastic as you are, Mr. Burrard. And I understand you can start immediately?

(When the camera returns to him, we see that it is the LEGLESS MAN from the teaser. He nods. Very creepy. MRS. HOLT still sees him as MR. BURRARD.)

MRS. HOLT: That's wonderful.

(DOGGETT enters the morgue. SCULLY is autopsying the large body of MR. POTOCKI. The body is covered with a sheet. SCULLY is working near the lower middle of the body.)

DOGGETT: Big fella, isn't he?

SCULLY: Big is a relative term, Agent Doggett. It took three strong men to wheel him in here. He tipped the scale at 402 pounds.

DOGGETT: Uh, Hugh Potocki was a big man, big appetites. Loved big cars, big houses, big business. Divorced twice. He carried two alimonies, one with child support. Never missed a payment. In fact, he seems to have spoiled his wives and kids.

SCULLY: I'm missing the point.

DOGGETT: (grinning) It seems he loved big women, too. Considering the evidence and motives we can probably rule out his ex-wives as suspects.

SCULLY: Well, considering what I found here today I'd say I have to agree.

(VERY reluctantly, DOGGETT walks around the table to look at the body. Whatever he sees is not at all pleasant.)

SCULLY: Tissue damage. Massive trauma to the lower intestine and the rectal wall.

DOGGETT: Is that from something going in or coming out?

SCULLY: Well, unfortunately there's so much damage that it's hard to tell.

(DOGGETT winces. [So does CarriK's Husband.] SCULLY leads him over to the lighted photo viewing screen. She shows him images. They look more like xrays. Definitely not MRIs.)

SCULLY: I took MRIs, which reveal further shredding throughout the abdomen and, uh, into the stomach area.

DOGGETT: India's a major transit point for the Golden Triangle. This guy flew in and out of India half a dozen times over the past 18 months.

SCULLY: Are you suggesting that he's a mule? A courier of heroine or opiates? Drug dealer?

DOGGETT: Fills a latex balloon with heroine, swallows it. We've all seen this kind of thing before but what if somebody got to him en route, forcibly extracted the drugs, tearing it from his stomach?

SCULLY: Well, I'd say, uh, that's a good theory, Agent Doggett, not to mention a graphic one, but there would have been traces left of drugs in his system. Nor does it account for the blood loss that this man experienced.

DOGGETT: Then we're right back where we started. Nobody knows anything.

SCULLY: Not exactly. I ran a decay analysis to, uh, determine the time of death. Liver temperature, buildup of gases, extent of rigor-- routine stuff. It's not 100% accurate, but it gives us a range.

DOGGETT: What's the range?

SCULLY: 24 to 36 hours.

(DOGGETT thinks.)

DOGGETT: Well, that's just wrong.

SCULLY: Well, it would mean that, uh, Mr. Potocki here would have died before he left Bombay.

DOGGETT: No. It would mean that a dead man boarded a plane in India, changed planes in Paris, hailed a cab at Dulles, and then checked into a downtown hotel and tipped the bellman. In my experience, dead men don't tip, Agent Scully.

[CARRIK: Well, we didn't see Mr. Potocki tip. Is this a subtle reference to the possibly dead, nontipping Mulder, i.e. Bad Blood?]

SCULLY: I told you to keep an open mind.



SCENE 5

(Sound of squeaking wheels as a 12-year-old boy, QUINTON, rides up to his school on a scooter. Three older boys are waiting for him. One of them, TREVOR, pushes him off of the scooter.)

TREVOR: Oh... look what he just did to my scooter.

QUINTON: That's mine!

TREVOR: Yeah, right, you going to take it from me?

(A fight almost happens. A MAN, QUINTON's FATHER approaches the boys and picks up the scooter.)

QUINTON'S FATHER: Hey! Leave him alone. What's going on here, Quinton?

(He turns to face TREVOR who is looking a little nervous.)

QUINTON'S FATHER: I know you. Your name's Trevor? You're in seventh grade, right? Don't you guys have anything better to do than pick on sixth graders?

TREVOR: Well, he ran into me.

QUINTON: That's a lie!

QUINTON'S FATHER: Enough. You want to be a bully? Find somebody your own age. I'll talk to your father if I have to. Come on, Quinton.

(QUINTON's FATHER leads his son to the car. Mr. BURRARD, the new janitor, is working near the bicycle rack. He looks up as QUINTON loads his scooter into the back of the car. QUINTON gets into the car. We now see the LEGLESS MAN sitting on his platform in BURRARD's place.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS
5:45 PM

DOGGETT: (on phone, loudly) Yes. Thank you. Sorry to wake you. Good-bye.

(He hangs up.)

SCULLY: Bad connection?

DOGGETT: Consulate in New Delhi. Three weeks ago an American businessman was found dead inside his hotel room. Take a look.

(He shows her several documents.)

DOGGETT: A Mr. Albert Brecht of Spokane. The reports have been hard to piece together. The medical records are in Hindi. Death certificate's in Farsi and the news accounts are in... I don't knowletters I've never seen before but I did get you a translation of Mr. Brecht's autopsy results.

(He pulls out another document.)

DOGGETT: Internal trauma. Tearing in the abdomen. You're the doctor-- it sounds like the same MO, doesn't it, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Look at this. Albert Brecht's passport was a recent issue and it has his weight at 205 pounds whereas here, an Indian medical examiner has him listed at 238 pounds just two hours after his death.

DOGGETT: Well, if there's one thing people lie about, it's their weight.

SCULLY: Well, that's a pretty big lie. I mean, that's a 33 pound discrepancy.

DOGGETT: Well, he was a big man, that's for sure.

SCULLY: Yeah. As was our DC victim. All the better for accommodation.

(DOGGETT looks up suspiciously.)

DOGGETT: Accommodation?

SCULLY: (slowly) Well, something has to account for the weight gain, Agent Doggett. What if, whatever it is that killed these men entered and exited them of its own free will? I mean, something.... small... with small hands... living... inside the victims as a... as a stowaway of sorts.

DOGGETT: You know I agree that having an open mind is important to crime solving, but... this theory of yours requires an openness that I'm... (he smiles and sits)  I'm just not comfortable with.

SCULLY: I understand, Agent Doggett and I can't prove it... but I bet that if we had weighed Hugh Potocki when he first arrived here from Bombay that he would have been 33 pounds heavier than his corpse.

DOGGETT: It's a theory, Agent Scully, but to my mind and... pretty much the rest of me, it-it... doesn't work.

SCULLY: I appreciate your resistance but so far this evidence supports it.

DOGGETT: Except one thing... Even if there was something living inside of Hugh Potocki when he arrived here from Bombay... you said that Mr. Potocki was already dead.



SCENE 7
CHEVERLY, MARYLAND
10:07 PM

(Nice suburban home. QUINTON wakes up in his dark bedroom. A creaking sound has awoken him. He looks around the room and sees the LEGLESS MAN on the squeaky- wheeled platform. Panicked, he calls for his father, softly at first, then rising in volume.)

QUINTON: Dad? Dad. Dad! Dad! Dad!!

(QUINTON'S FATHER enters the room.)

QUINTON'S FATHER: Quint, what is it?

QUINTON: There's a man in here.

QUINTON'S FATHER: What? What are you talking about?

(QUINTON'S FATHER goes to the window and makes sure that it is locked. There is no sign of the LEGLESS MAN.)

QUINTON: He was here, Dad. Right over there. He had no legs!

QUINTON'S FATHER: Quinton... Quinton, listen to me. The things that you imagine, the things that-that you dream... are not real. And what's not real can't hurt you.

QUINTON: But, Dad, it was real. It was.

QUINTON'S FATHER: Quint, there's nobody here.

(He kisses his son on the forehead.)

QUINTON'S FATHER: Try to get some sleep. Okay?

(QUINTON is still nervous as his father leaves the room and closes the door.)

(QUINTON'S FATHER goes downstairs where the TV is tuned to a news program.)

NEWSGUY 1: (on TV) There's no denying the world order has changed. The United States is the sole Super Power-- in both a military sense and an economic one. With this comes responsibility.

(QUINTON'S FATHER goes to his chair to watch TV,)

NEWSGUYS: (on TV) No one's dismissing American responsibilities, here or abroad. But Third World debt relief, in my view would be a positive step toward solving Third World issues and Third World problems. Well, now it's my turn to disagree. Relieving that debt would allow these countries to find solutions without American intervention... I think you're being naive... There's no denying the world order has changed...

(The LEGLESS MAN sits watching QUINTON'S FATHER.)

(In his room, QUINTON hears his father scream in agony. QUINTON runs out of his room and looks down into the great room. His father is sitting in the chair.)

QUINTON: Dad?

(There is no response. QUINTON begins walking slowly down the stairs.)

QUINTON: Dad?

(Still no response. QUINTON gets close to his father. We see QUINTON'S FATHER's staring eyes fill with blood.)



SCENE 8

(Same house, next day. DOGGETT comes down the stairs and sees SCULLY sitting at the dining room table with QUINTON and QUINTON'S MOTHER. QUINTON'S MOTHER has her arm around her son, and is crying softly. SCULLY looks up as DOGGETT enters and she joins him in the great room. The situation is very disturbing to him.)

(DOGGETT sighs, looking at QUINTON who is crying with his mother. They speak softly.)

DOGGETT: The first dead body I saw, I was 19 and a marine. This boy... criminy.

SCULLY: Yeah. That's not all he claims he saw.

DOGGETT: That's what the cops told me. That's why I thought we should come down here.

SCULLY: He said he called his dad in because there was something in his room. I asked him to describe it. He said that it was a munchkin. That it had no legs. And that it was keeping itself up with its arms.

(QUINTON and his mother leave the room.)

DOGGETT: Well, that's a pretty good trick considering what I just found upstairs. Palm prints in the boy's bedroom. They match the one's we found in Potocki's room. And that's the good news. It just doesn't serve your theory because this thing didn't get in here in anybody's body. It came in through the bedroom window.

SCULLY: How can you be sure?

DOGGETT: There was another print on the sill outside the locked window. And somebody must have closed it after this thing got in.

SCULLY: Right. Which is exactly what the boy said that his father did. But it's the father that I have a problem with here. I mean he had none of the massive hemorrhaging that we found in Mr. Potocki. In the coroner's initial report, he makes it sound like the guy died of a cerebral embolism. The one salient detail in the external exam were the eyes... in which only the blood vessels are broken.

(SCULLY pauses, realization dawning.)

SCULLY: Unless that's just the first stage.

(DOGGETT watches as she quickly leaves the house.)



SCENE 9

(Morgue. SCULLY enters, breathing heavily. She pauses, then nervously approaches the body of QUINTON'S FATHER. She quickly pulls the sheet off of him. His belly is rounded and swollen, like that of a pregnant woman. She puts on scrubs and latex gloves and turns on the microphone. Her voice is tense.)

SCULLY: This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I am a medical doctor about to perform an unauthorized procedure on a body. The, uh  the subject is a Caucasian male. Age, uh... I don't remember at this particular time. His height is about six feet. And his weight is... quite possibly subject to change.

(She picks up a scalpel from the medical cart next to her. We see that she has laid her gun down on the cart.)

SCULLY: I suppose distention could be due to decomposition gases... but that seems unlikely.

(She makes an incision, starting at the base of the belly and going up to the sternum. Something in the belly begins moving. Startled, SCULLY backs up and knocks the cart over. Everything crashes to the floor, including her gun. )

SCULLY: Oh.

(A small bloody hand reaches out of the belly. [This scene is way up there on the CarriK "Ewww Factor" chart.] It takes her several precious seconds to locate her gun behind a curtain. She turns and aims it at the autopsy table. The man's belly is open and bloody, like the victims of the black oil infections in the movie and the beginning of season six. Holding her gun ready, she begins searching the morgue. She sees a smeared trail of blood, bordered by small bloody handprints on the floor. Very tense music. The phone rings, but she ignores it. She follows the trail to a supply closet. She flings open the door and looks around, but sees nothing, and goes back into the main room to the phone. When the camera pans back into the closet, we see the LEGLESS MAN, now covered in blood and maybe other stuff, watching her.)



SCENE 10

(Elementary school hallway. Children laughing in the background. MRS. HOLT is chastising the janitor, MR. BURRARD.)

MRS. HOLT: Reliability's one of the most important parts of your job. We were very worried when you didn't show up this morning.

(She walks away. MR. BURRARD goes into a closet and pulls out a squeaky wheeled mop bucket. TREVOR is walking down the hall, but pauses to watch as MR. BURRARD kneels down beside the bucket. His image slightly flickers. TREVOR watches, confused, for another moment. The bell rings. TREVOR then goes on to his class. Camera pans back to MR. BURRARD, but finds the LEGLESS MAN on his wheeled platform. He stares after TREVOR.)



SCENE 11

(X-Files office. The TV monitor is playing a tape of an Indian man sticking a burning torch into his mouth. CHUCK BURKS is showing it to SCULLY and DOGGETT.)

(CLOSED CAPTIONING: CHUCK BURKS: They take religious devotion to an extreme.)

CHUCK BURKS: They're called Fakir-- ascetic masters bound to acts of self-torture to attain enlightenment.

(Another image of an Indian man who has done some really weird and painful-looking stretching and piercing of his face.)

CHUCK BURKS: We shot this video when I was traveling through India back in the late '70s... Oh, man, look at my hair back then.

(On the video, a YOUNG CHUCK BURKS with very long dark hair grins and flashes a peace sign at the camera as another Indian messes around with a very dangerous looking snake.)

SCULLY: Agent Mulder consulted with Dr. Burks on occasion and I have to admit that I've been skeptical of him in the past but he does have certain insights.

DOGGETT: Well, we could use some insights.

CHUCK BURKS: Uh, well, I-I'm embarrassed to admit but I-I'm not sure I know what the heck's going on here.

SCULLY: These ascetic masters... they have abilities?

CHUCK BURKS: Oh, absolutely. An-and abilities similar to those you told me about on the phone have been ascribed to what are know as Siddhi mystics. The Siddhi are a very mysterious and particularly powerful order of Fakirs. These Siddhi, they pass on their secret practices from father to son gaining occult powers with each generation.

DOGGETT: What kind of powers?

(DOGGETT is not impressed with CHUCK BURKS. SCULLY is listening intently.)

CHUCK BURKS: Powers of the mind. Powers that help them manipulate reality. Powers that allow them to become invisible or tiny as an atom.

DOGGETT: Well, I hope they're tiny. Where, whoever it is, is going.

(SCULLY gives DOGGETT a look, then turns back to CHUCK BURKS.)

SCULLY: Chuck... Could one of these Siddhi mystics make you believe that he vanished in a room when in fact, he's standing right in front of you?

CHUCK BURKS: Totally. Or disguise themselves appearing in front of you as, uh, well, virtually anyone.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, Dr. Burks, you're a... you're a professor of what?

CHUCK BURKS: I run the Advanced Digital Imaging lab at the University of Maryland. And, um, I dabble.

DOGGETT: You dabble. (to SCULLY, sarcastic) Well, this has been... insightful.

(DOGGETT leaves the room. CHUCK BURKS watches him go.)

CHUCK BURKS: Doesn't surprise me.

SCULLY: What?

CHUCK BURKS: It's hard to believe in something when you can't understand it.

(SCULLY nods slowly.)



SCENE 12

(QUINTON's house. There is a knocking at the door. QUINTON answers it. It is TREVOR.)

QUINTON: Get out of here.

(QUINTON tries to close the door, but TREVOR stops him.)

TREVOR: No, just... let me talk to you.

QUINTON: Leave me alone.

TREVOR: No, I want to say I'm sorry.

QUINTON: No, you're not.

TREVOR: Look, I am. Would you just... listen.

(QUINTON listens.)

TREVOR: I'm... sorry about your Dad.

(QUINTON tries not to cry. TREVOR looks at the yard and the street behind him nervously.)

TREVOR: I, I think I know who did it.



SCENE 13

(Next day. X-Files office. SCULLY is at MULDER's desk taking notes and sifting through papers. The desk is as messy and disorganized as if MULDER was here himself. She looks tired. CHUCK BURKS enters.)

CHUCK BURKS: Agent Scully?

(SCULLY rises and greets him. Something is bothering her. She is vulnerable.)

SCULLY: Chuck. Thank you for, uh, coming down here again.

CHUCK BURKS: Not at all. Uh... I'm just a little curious. I mean, it's always Mulder who'd been doing all the calling and...

SCULLY: This, uh... this case, I-I-I-I'm just... I'm trying to see it the way that Mulder would and... please have a seat.

(They sit. She in MULDER's chair, he in "hers.")

CHUCK BURKS: Of course. So, what's seems to be the problem?

SCULLY: You described these, uh, Siddhi mystics as being religious men.

CHUCK BURKS: Extremely. They believe their powers derive directly from the divine.

SCULLY: So, presumably using those powers for murder would be in opposition of that?

CHUCK BURKS: Worse. It would violate the very foundation of ascetic life. It would endanger their eternal soul.

SCULLY: Which got me thinking that, uh... if these Siddhi hold so fast to their orthodoxy then what would cause them to break their faith?

CHUCK BURKS: I don't know.

SCULLY: Something human?

(CHUCK BURKS nods.)

SCULLY: Revenge?

CHUCK BURKS: Well, maybe, um.

(SCULLY sighs and hands him a Bombay Observer newspaper page. The headline reads "Vishi Disaster - 118 Die in Chemical Plant Disaster")

SCULLY: This is... an American chemical plant in a village in India called, uh, Vishi. It's just outside of Mumbai which is a better known to us as Bombay. About six months ago the plant inadvertently released a small cloud of methyl isocyanate gas. 118 of Vishi's mostly indigenous population were killed. But it wasn't very well reported over here. I spent all night cross-checking the, uh, victims of the disaster. And one... finally caught my attention.

(She indicates a smaller article detailing another victim on the Vishi Disaster.)

SCULLY: Now, I'd say, right here. It's an 11-year-old boy... whose father is described as being a holy man of the Chamar caste.

CHUCK BURKS: The beggar caste. Fakirs and mystics are.... well, often of low birth.

SCULLY: Do you think that this boy's father could be a Siddhi mystic like you described?

CHUCK BURKS: He could be. But if he's out for revenge then why is he killing the people that he's killing?

(SCULLY doesn't know.)



SCENE 14

(Suburban street. TREVOR is walking down the sidewalk. He hears the sound of a squeaky wheel behind him. He turns, but sees nothing. Nervously, he continues walking. He hears the sound again and turns, but again sees nothing. The squeaking gets louder and faster. TREVOR begins running. We see the LEGLESS MAN on the wheeled platform following him. TREVOR runs into his house, running into his mother.)

TREVOR'S MOTHER: Woo! What's the matter with you?

TREVOR: Nothing.

(TREVOR, as any self-respecting 13-year-old boy would do, collects himself and head off into the backyard.)

TREVOR'S MOTHER: Trevor? Where are you going? Dinner's on the table.

(She follows him outside, but doesn't see him.)

TREVOR'S MOTHER: Trevor. Trevor? Dinner.

(She walks around to the swimming pool and sees TREVOR lying motionless at the bottom.)

TREVOR'S MOTHER: Trevor!

(She dives into the water and swims down to her son. Still under water, she reaches out and grabs his shirt, turning him over. She recoils in horror. It is no longer her son, but the LEGLESS MAN who is staring predatorily at her.)



SCENE 15

(Later that evening. The body bag is zipped closed, covering TREVOR'S MOTHER's dead, horrified, blood-filled stare. DOGGETT watches as the EMTs raise the gurney and wheel it to the ambulance. They pass TREVOR'S FATHER who is wet and wrapped in a blanket, still in shock. He has been talking to SCULLY.)

TREVOR'S FATHER: Excuse me.

(He turns and follows his wife's body to the ambulance. SCULLY goes to DOGGETT by the pool.)

SCULLY: She came out to call her son in for dinner. That's all we know.

DOGGETT: What are we doing here, Agent Scully 'cause I'm not sure.

SCULLY: What are we doing? A woman died of mysterious circumstances not three blocks away from a previous victim. External signs are a direct match. That woman's eyes.

DOGGETT: I saw her eyes. But dollars to donuts there wasn't anything that crawled up inside her. Now, I think we're reaching here and I don't know how to say it but maybe you're seeing things that you want to see.

SCULLY: Are you questioning my integrity?

DOGGETT: No, I'm questioning the whole damn case. From your so-called expert, to the evidence you've chosen to ignore, to the fact that your approach has got us no closer to seeing a pattern or a motive or even catching this killer than we were when we started.

SCULLY: I asked you to keep an open mind.

DOGGETT: Yeah, well, I try to keep an open mind but it tends to shut my eyes.

SCULLY: There is something here, Agent Doggett. And I'll admit that it's hard to accept. But there is a motive and there is a pattern and there is a reason and we will see it... but not working like this.

DOGGETT: Yeah, well... I hope somebody sees it.

(He starts to leave the pool area. SCULLY turns at the sound of TREVOR climbing over the wall into the yard. He looks at the lights of the ambulance and the unfamiliar people in confusion. SCULLY approaches him slowly.)

SCULLY: Trevor. Trevor, I'm Dana Scully...

TREVOR: What happened?

SCULLY: Your father's in the house. I'm going to take...

TREVOR: Where's my mom?

(DOGGETT has turned back and is watching them.)

SCULLY: (gently) Trevor.

(TREVOR breathes heavily, trying not to cry, realizing what must have happened.)

TREVOR: He was here. The-the little man. I-I saw him. He... he followed me.

(As TREVOR runs toward the house, DOGGETT and SCULLY look at each other.)



SCENE 16

(Police station. MR. BURRARD is sitting motionless in an interrogation room with an observation window. DOGGETT, drinking a cup of coffee is watching him from the hall. CHUCK BURKS joins DOGGETT. He is excited.)

CHUCK BURKS: Agent Doggett? Where is he? Is that him?

DOGGETT: If you mean the janitor yeah, that's him, right in there.

(CHUCK BURKS begins setting up a video camera on a tripod.)

CHUCK BURKS: Agent Scully called and said that, uh, you had arrested what might be an honest to goodness Siddhi mystic.

DOGGETT: Well, Agent Scully jumped the gun on that one. The only thing extraordinary about this man is he doesn't speak... to anyone.

CHUCK BURKS: Well, where is Agent Scully?

DOGGETT: She left, after four hours of attempting to interrogate this guy. Unless he jumps up and does something mystical in the next ten minutes, we're releasing him.

(CHUCK BURKS finishes setting up the camera.)

DOGGETT: What are you doing?

CHUCK BURKS: The man sitting there may not be the man sitting there. No one may be there at all, in fact.

DOGGETT: Not in the next ten minutes, there ain't.

(CHUCK BURKS looks at the image on the camera.)

CHUCK BURKS: Oh, wow. Agent Doggett? Y-you got to take a look at this.

(DOGGETT joins him and looks at the image on the camera. It shows an empty chair where MR. BURRARD should be sitting. Image and reality do not match up. DOGGETT is skeptical.)

DOGGETT: Come on. It's a trick.

CHUCK BURKS: Yeah, but not of the camera.

(Pause as DOGGETT processes the information.)

DOGGETT: Wait, if... if he's not there...

CHUCK BURKS: He could be anywhere.



SCENE 17

(TREVOR's house. Night. SCULLY knocks at the door. TREVOR'S FATHER answers.)

TREVOR'S FATHER: Yeah.

SCULLY: Sir, I am so sorry to bother you again. I know this has been a terrible ordeal.

TREVOR'S FATHER: Yes... what is it you need?

SCULLY: I need to speak with your son, Trevor, again.

TREVOR'S FATHER: Is this about his mother?

SCULLY: Well, Trevor told me that he saw a man... It was just something that doesn't quite add up and I need to be certain.

(TREVOR'S FATHER nods sadly and goes to get TREVOR.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(Her cell phone rings. She answers it.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(DOGGETT is still at the police station with CHUCK BURKS.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Think you ought to get back here, Agent Scully. There's something...

SCULLY: (on phone) What?

DOGGETT: (on phone) The janitor, he's here... but he's not. I can't... I can't explain it.

(TREVOR'S FATHER, upset, comes back to SCULLY.)

TREVOR'S FATHER: Trevor's not in his room.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, just hang on one second.

SCULLY: (on phone) Agent Doggett what do you mean he's not there?



SCENE 18

(Elementary school. MRS. HOLT and a TEACHER are talking in an office. They hear a creaking sound out in the hall.)

TEACHER: Who's that?

MRS. HOLT: Hello?

(The creaking continues. They see MR. BURRARD and his mop bucket in the hallway.)

MRS. HOLT: Mr. Burrard... I thought you... Well, I-I didn't expect to see you back at work.

(MR. BURRARD continues down the hallway. MRS. HOLT hands the TEACHER SCULLY's FBI business card. Federal Building  Washington, DC 20013)

MRS. HOLT: This is the agent who picked him up before. Can you make this call?

(Out in the hall, QUINTON is watching MR. BURRARD. He whispers into a two-way radio.)

QUINTON: Here he comes.

(The LEGLESS MAN opens a supply closet door and wheels himself in. He reaches up for something on a shelf, then looks up quickly as TREVOR, who is sitting on the top shelf in the room, drops a gallon sized bottle of some chemical on the LEGLESS MAN's head. The chemical sizzles on the ground. TREVOR jumps down and stumbles.)

(Out in the hall, QUINTON speaks into his radio again.)

QUINTON: Trevor, are you there?

(He hears squeaking, then sees the LEGLESS MAN wheeling himself into the hall. QUINTON is terrified and runs. He makes his way down a staircase and enters a classroom. He goes to the windows, but cannot open any of them. He sees the doorknob begin to turn. Then, he sees TREVOR right outside one of the windows.)

TREVOR: Get out of there, let's go!

QUINTON: I can't, the windows are locked.

TREVOR: Break them, okay!? You...

(TREVOR pauses and looks behind QUINTON. QUINTON turns slowly toward the creaking sound. The LEGLESS MAN is in the room with him. Creaking, the LEGLESS MAN begins moving to him.)

TREVOR: I'll get help.

(QUINTON watches, terrified, as the LEGLESS MAN moves toward him. SCULLY and the TEACHER enter the room.)

SCULLY: Oh, thank god.

QUINTON: (desperate) Do something!

SCULLY: Quinton, what's the matter?

(SCULLY and MRS. HOLT see TREVOR in the room with QUINTON.)

QUINTON: It's him! It's the little man!

SCULLY: Who? Trevor?

MRS. HOLT: All right, now you boys, you just stop playing around.

(SCULLY, focused on the boys, pulls out her gun and aims it at TREVOR.)

SCULLY: Okay, don't move. Stay where you are.

MRS. HOLT: Wait, wait what are you doing?

(TREVOR, emotionless, keeps walking toward SCULLY.)

QUINTON: Stop him! Shoot him!

(SCULLY is breathing heavily and weakening.)

SCULLY: I can't.

(Outside, DOGGETT pulls up. There is the sound of gunshots.)

(DOGGETT runs into the classroom, gun drawn. MRS. HOLT and SCULLY are both staring at a figure on the floor.)

MRS. HOLT: Oh, my god.

DOGGETT: What is it, what happened? Agent Scully! Scully.

[CARRIK: First time he's called her Scully?]

(SCULLY, crying, leaves the room. DOGGETT looks down at the figure on the floor. It is the LEGLESS MAN, now dead. TREVOR runs into the doorway and looks at the LEGLESS MAN and at QUINTON who is also crying.)



SCENE 19

(Later that evening. DOGGETT watches as police escort QUINTON and TREVOR into the back of a patrol car. DOGGETT goes to SCULLY who is standing by herself. She is upset.)

DOGGETT: You going to be okay, Agent Scully?

(She nods slightly.)

DOGGETT: I got a drift of what happened in there... to you. I mean, sort of.

(Long pause. Close up on SCULLY. She doesn't look at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: (voice breaking) I shot a young boy.

DOGGETT: The good news is, you're wrong.

SCULLY: But it's what I saw. With my eyes, anyway. Do you know what it's like not to be able to trust your own eyes?

DOGGETT: Then why'd you shoot him?

(SCULLY searches her soul for a moment.)

SCULLY: Because it's what the boy saw. And in an instant I realized that it's what Mulder would have seen or understood.

(SCULLY begins to cry.)

SCULLY: Because that's just how he came at things... without judgment and without prejudice and with an open mind that I am just not capable of.

(Tears run down her face.)

DOGGETT: It's been a long night. Give yourself a break.

(SCULLY sighs.)

DOGGETT: This whole thing doesn't make any sense.

SCULLY: No... it did. In some way, it did.



SCENE 20
SAHAR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
MUMBAI, INDIA
TWO WEEKS LATER

(Back at the airport in India. A large, 200 lb + AMERICAN MAN is walking through the beggars on his way to his flight. The LEGLESS MAN is among the beggars. He looks up at the AMERICAN MAN.)

[THE END]


                                 THE GIFT



SCENE 1
SQUAMASH TOWNSHIP
PENNSYLVANIA

(Dark and stormy night. A MAN is driving a car along a rural road. He stops in front of a house and gets out of the car. His casual clothes are already wet. Leaving the headlights on, he goes up to the front porch, small pistol in hand. On the front door is a circular symbol with a cross in the middle of it. The MAN goes into the house. Another man, PAUL HANGEMUHL, 30's, sees him enter. He recognizes the MAN.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Marie!

(His wife, MARIE HANGEMUHL, small and pale, red hair, dressed in a nightgown, also sees him. She is upset and pleads with the MAN.)

MARIE HANGEMUHL: No! Please!

(In a doorway, we see the shadow of a CREATURE. It is shaped like a man, but the features are distorted and the hair is long and unkempt. The MAN looks into the haunted eyes of the CREATURE, then fires three shots. The CREATURE falls to the floor. MARIE HANGEMUHL cries out in horror and runs to her husband's arms. He holds her as she sobs. The MAN goes back out of the house and gets into the still-running car. He sets the gun down on the seat next to him. For the first time, we see that it is MULDER. He stares at the gun for a moment, then looks up at the house sadly, and drives off again into the storm.)

SCENE 2

(Day. DOGGETT is driving a Pennsylvania rental car, license 633-06M, along the rural road. He is remembering conversations that he had with SCULLY in the season premiere episodes Within/Without about the search for MULDER.)

FLASHBACK SCULLY: Mulder was dying... it's all right here. For a year he was going to doctors.

(SCULLY, her voice breaking, is showing a file to SKINNER.)

FLASHBACK SCULLY: There's a clear record of his decline.

(Present day shot of DOGGETT remembering.)

FLASHBACK DOGGETT: How well did you really know him? How far would Mulder go?

(He and SCULLY are talking in the office. SCULLY stares at hm.)

FLASHBACK SCULLY: How far would he go for what?

FLASHBACK DOGGETT: The truth... his truth.

(Present day. DOGGETT remembering.)

FLASHBACK DOGGETT: Whatever you and I may differ on...

(With SCULLY again.)

FLASHBACK DOGGETT: I'll find him, Agent Scully.

(SCULLY looks up at him from her hospital bed. It was after her collapse in Without.)

(Present day. DOGGETT, in his gray Dodge Stratus, passes a sign welcoming him to the town of Squamash, Pennsylvania. He pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office and goes up to the door. SHERIFF KURT FREY, a big good ole boy, around 40, watches DOGGETT suspiciously as he gets out of the car then goes to greet him.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: You must be Special Agent Doggett. I'm Sheriff Frey. Just call me Kurt.

(They shake hands.)

DOGGETT: I appreciate the help, Kurt.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Shame to have you drive all the way up here on a Saturday. Hate to say you're wasting your time.

DOGGETT: Not if you confirm what you told me before.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Yes, sir. Agent Mulder was here, all right... last spring.

(He opens a file cabinet.)

DOGGETT: You said on the phone Agent Mulder was investigating a missing woman, Marie Hangemuhl.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Well, she wasn't exactly missing. He wasn't exactly investigating, either.

DOGGETT: I'm not following you.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: It was a false report. Marie never even left the house. The only reason Agent Mulder found out about it was because Marie's sister got all excited about nothing. There. See for yourself.

(He hands DOGGETT a file.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Say, I've got some hot coffee and a danish here if you're interested.

DOGGETT: No, thanks.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: You know, if you don't mind me asking, Agent Doggett, what's your interest? I mean, I was actually surprised that one FBI agent gave this case a thought.

(SHERIFF KURT FREY pours himself a cup of coffee.)

DOGGETT: It's not so much the case as it is the agent. Agent Mulder disappeared last May.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Sorry to hear that. I still don't see what that has to do with us.

DOGGETT: Did Agent Mulder have a personal connection here-- something that might not be in your report?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: No, I don't think he'd ever been to Squamash before, as far as I know.

DOGGETT: I have cell phone records showing that Agent Mulder came back here the week before he disappeared.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: What for?

DOGGETT: That's what I want to know. It's my job to find him.



SCENE 3

(Later there is a knock at the HANGEMUHL's door. PAUL HANGEMUHL answers it and sees SHERIFF KURT FREY and DOGGETT.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Kurt?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Paul, this is Agent Doggett from the FBI. He'd like to ask you and Marie some questions.

(PAUL HANGEMUHL is not thrilled with the idea, but allows them to enter and calls to his wife.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Marie, can you come out here a minute?

(MARIE HANGEMUHL looks even smaller and paler than she did in the teaser. She has been washing dishes. She is in a sweater and skirt and looks tired and ill. PAUL HANGEMUHL is very protective of her.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: This is an FBI agent. He wants to ask us a few questions. (to DOGGETT) What's this all about?

DOGGETT: A colleague of mine, Fox Mulder, questioned you last spring.

PAUL HANGEMUHL: (defensive) Come on, Kurt. This again? Look, this was a personal matter that's been blown way out of proportion.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: He's not investigating you, Paul. He's investigating Agent Mulder.

DOGGETT: If you could tell me what you and Agent Mulder talked about

(Flashback, either PAUL'S or DOGGETT seeing it through PAUL'S eyes: MULDER is talking to PAUL HANGEMUHL and MARIE HANGEMUHL. MULDER presses his fingers against the bridge of his nose as he asks the question. He looks as if he is in pain.)

MULDER: You told your sister you were going to disappear, Mrs. Hangemuhl. Tonight.

(SHERIFF KURT FREY is standing nest to the couch, his hands on his belt.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: I told you already. We had a fight, she was going to leave, not disappear.

MULDER: I'm talking to your wife.

(SHERIFF KURT FREY shifts uncomfortably. MULDER focuses on MARIE HANGEMUHL.)

MULDER: Mrs. Hangemuhl.

MARIE HANGEMUHL: (quietly) It's what he said. My sister lives out of state. I was going to go... I didn't want her to worry.

MULDER: You told your sister a story, a story you were afraid of?

PAUL HANGEMUHL: This is crazy. There is no crime here!

MULDER: I don't think you were going anywhere tonight, Mrs. Hangemuhl. I think someone or something was coming here. And I think maybe it still is.

(She doesn't look at MULDER.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: (angry) We had a fight. We patched things up and that was the end of it.

(Present day. DOGGETT approaches the HANGEMUHLS.)

DOGGETT: The Sheriff's report says that Agent Mulder spoke to you on Saturday, May 6th.

MARIE HANGEMUHL: (uncomfortable) Yeah, I-I guess so.

DOGGETT: Did you see Agent Mulder again that night?

(Flashback of MULDER firing the three shots into the creature.)

(Present day. PAUL HANGEMUHL takes a breath and speaks)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: No, he never came back.

DOGGETT: According to his cell phone records, he did. To this area, anyway.

(They have no answer. DOGGETT notices a large medical machine against one wall.)

DOGGETT: What's that there? Is that a dialysis machine?

PAUL HANGEMUHL: My wife suffers from end-stage renal failure. She's a very sick woman.

(DOGGETT nods and looks down.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Anything else?

DOGGETT: One thing. This someone or something Agent Mulder said might be coming?

MARIE HANGEMUHL: I just told my sister I was afraid of the stories. That's all, I didn't mean...

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Let me ask you something, Agent Doggett. Was this Mulder guy sick? Sick in the head, I mean? Is that why you're checking into this?

DOGGETT: What stories, Mr. Hangemuhl?

PAUL HANGEMUHL: An Indian folk legend about a creature who lives out in the woods.

(They both look at MARIE HANGEMUHL.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: I've heard these stories since I was a kid. So your colleague twisted it into a theory that she was going to disappear, all right 'cause this creature was coming to eat her.

DOGGETT: Eat her?

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Alive.

(DOGGETT and SHERIFF KURT FREY head back outside to the SHERIFF's truck.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Like I said, Agent Doggett, I hate to waste your Saturday.

DOGGETT: The Hangemuhls own a gun, Kurt?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: No, I don't think so. Why?

DOGGETT: I saw three holes plastered over in their living room wall.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Gunshots?

DOGGETT: Possibly.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: You want to go back and ask 'em?

DOGGETT: No.

(They get into the truck.)



SCENE 4
ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA
2:18 PM

(MULDER's apartment. DOGGETT uses a lockpick and enters the apartment and begins searching through drawers. A light coating of dust is on the desk and there are a few spiderwebs under the table. He feeds the fish way too much food. They seem to be doing quite well, despite MULDER's absence. Perhaps SCULLY comes over to nap every once in a while. He looks through books in athletic shoe boxes. MULDER has lots of umbrellas. No one has taken out the trash, however. DOGGETT sifts through it, finding nothing. Finally, he looks under the kitchen sink and pulls down a small pistol that was taped up underneath the basin.)



SCENE 5

(Day. SHERIFF KURT FREY supervises as a backhoe digs up a section of grass in a cemetery. PAUL HANGEMUHL pulls up and runs over to SHERIFF KURT FREY. He sounds hopeful.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Kurt, they told me you were out here. I just can't believe it. Is it true?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: That's what I'm here to find out.

(The backhoe continues uncovering the grassy area. In the process, it disturbs a circle of white stones with a cross in the middle that had been laid over the area.)



SCENE 6
FIREARMS TOOLMARK UNIT
FBI HEADQUARTERS
4:41 PM

(DOGGETT is looking at the results on the tests that were run on the gun that he found under MULDER's sink. SKINNER enters.)

DOGGETT: Were you aware Mulder carried a second weapon, a Walther PPK?

SKINNER: Yeah, in an ankle holster.

DOGGETT: I found it hidden under his sink. The clip was three rounds shy.

SKINNER: What's this about?

DOGGETT: Three shots were fired in a house where Mulder investigated a case last May. He never filed a report on the case or the discharge of his weapon. Do you know any reason why?

SKINNER: If Mulder did these things, he would've reported them.

DOGGETT: Mulder submitted case reports, all right but they indicate he was here in Washington on days his cell phone records prove he was in Pennsylvania.

SKINNER: Are you calling Mulder a liar?

DOGGETT: (pointing to the computer screen) This is the muzzle of Mulder's pistol. You see that there?

SKINNER: It's blowback.

DOGGETT: Macrospatter of dried blood in a semi-circular pattern. Which indicates Mulder fired close-range at something or someone.

SKINNER: I've heard enough.

(SKINNER starts to leave he room in disgust.)

DOGGETT: Where are you going?

SKINNER: It's where you're going, Agent Doggett. You're trying to build a case that what? Mulder killed a man and then made himself disappear? That's not what happened. I told you before, he was abducted. I saw it!

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder signed falsified case reports.

SKINNER: (angry) Oh, come on, John, this isn't about Mulder, it's about you! Your career. You give the FBI a narrative for Mulder's disappearance, you're off the X-Files and back on the fast-track to the directorship.

DOGGETT: I'm just trying to find the truth.

SKINNER: You want the truth? Then ask Agent Scully!

DOGGETT: I can't do that.

SKINNER: Why not?

DOGGETT: Because she... she signed those case reports, too.

(SKINNER looks at the file.)

SKINNER: You take that story to OPR, the accusation alone could cost Scully her job.

DOGGETT: I'm not taking it to OPR. I'm taking it to you.



SCENE 7

(Night. Several cars and trucks, including that of SHERIFF KURT FREY, pull up outside an old cabin. Men get out of the vehicles along with several hunting dogs. The dogs bark.)

DOG OWNER: Hold back.

(The MEN line up with their dogs in front of the house.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: We're giving you two minutes to bring it outside! Then we're coming in to get it!

(A WOMAN, dressed simply, her blonde hair tied in a ponytail comes out of the house, her arms crossed.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Where is it?

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: It's dead. You know that. Dead and buried.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: It's here. We've come for it.

PAUL HANGEMUHL: You lied to us!

(Everyone looks over into the woods next to the house. The CREATURE, moaning desperately, runs past. The men and dogs chase it. It stumbles. They catch it in a net and carry it back to the trucks. It moans in fear and agony. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN pleads with them.)

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: Please, don't! Don't do this! Don't do this to him!

(They ignore her and load it into the back of an enclosed truck.)



SCENE 8
SQUAMASH SHERIFF'S STATION
7:48 PM

(DOGGETT and SKINNER, sans tie, enter the station.)

DOGGETT: Sheriff Frey.

(SHERIFF KURT FREY enters from another door.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Back again?

DOGGETT: This is Assistant Director Skinner. We drove up when we couldn't reach you on the phone.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Yeah, sorry about that. I went hunting and turned off my radio. So. You find something?

DOGGETT: You might say that.

SKINNER: You filed this death certificate at the county seat, Sheriff. We're hoping you might be able to tell us something about it.

(SKINNER hands SHERIFF KURT FREY a paper.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Yeah. Yeah, last spring. An unidentified transient. Local woman found the body in the woods.

SKINNER: You got no suspects? No motive?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: No, why?

DOGGETT: You get a lot of shootings around here? That why you failed to mention this one, Kurt?

SHERIFF KURT FREY: What are you insinuating?

DOGGETT: The body was found dumped outside this woman's cabin on Sunday, May 7-- the morning after Mulder saw the Hangemuhls.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Okay, so I didn't make the connection. So what?

DOGGETT: Three rounds were missing from Mulder's weapon.

(Pause.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: So Mulder came back to town to kill this man and now the Hangemuhls are lying about it. Maybe I am, too.

DOGGETT: Pretty much.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: This theory is even nuttier than the one Agent Mulder came to town with. Where's the evidence?

DOGGETT: Where's the body buried?



SCENE 9

(Night. SKINNER and DOGGETT arrive at a really creepy graveyard. They pull out their flashlights and begin looking around.)

SKINNER: You're on pretty shaky ground here, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Something happened here that night.

SKINNER: But you're forgetting one thing-- Fox Mulder wouldn't do this.

DOGGETT: Look, somebody shot this man. Somebody fired Mulder's weapon and Mulder was here that night.

SKINNER: And you trying to prove that Mulder's a murderer is going to help you find him?

DOGGETT: Maybe he's not. I'm not saying that he did this. Not yet. But he was here for a reason and then he disappeared.

SKINNER: Why would these people, people he'd never met before try to cover it up?

DOGGETT: That's the question, yeah.

(DOGGETT shines his light into an empty grave. He jumps in. SKINNER kneels at the edge of the hole and fingers the earth.)

SKINNER: Earth is fresh.

DOGGETT: Sheriff must've dug it up this afternoon after I left.

SKINNER: What would he want with the body?

DOGGETT: I don't know that he found it.

(DOGGETT sees a rough hole in the bottom of the open casket and a tunnel under it.)

DOGGETT: Looks like there's another way out.

SKINNER: Are you telling me the man inside that casket did this?

DOGGETT: Looks pretty deep. A man doesn't get shot three times and then tunnel out of his own grave.

SKINNER: The Sheriff said this transient was unidentified, right?

(DOGGETT climbs out of the hole.)

DOGGETT: That's right.

SKINNER: Then why'd somebody leave these on top of his grave?

(They both shine their flashlight on what remains of the circle/cross of white stones over the grave.)



SCENE 10

(Night. PAUL HANGEMUHL is on his front porch with a bucket of dead bloody chicken parts. Using part of the dismembered chicken, he finishes drawing the circle/cross symbol in chicken blood on his front door. SHERIFF KURT FREY pulls up and comes up onto the porch.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: We've got to move fast.

PAUL HANGEMUHL: She's not ready yet.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Then she better get ready.

(SHERIFF KURT FREY goes into the house. PAUL HANGEMUHL looks uncomfortable, but follows.)

(PAUL HANGEMUHL stands behind MARIE HANGEMUHL as she slowly sets her wedding ring set on the dresser. She is dressed in her nightgown.)

MARIE HANGEMUHL: I can't do this.

(He puts his hands on her shoulders comfortingly.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: You've got to do this. We don't have another choice.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: Paul?

(They turn to look at him.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: (gently) Marie.

(Outside, a car approaches. MARIE HANGEMUHL breathing gets heavier. She is frightened. She turns to her husband who holds her and kisses her on the forehead.)

(Outside, a man walks around to the back of a cage in his truck. Through the grill of the cage, we see the CREATURE breathing heavily. He sounds as frightened as MARIE HANGEMUHL.)

(Inside the house from several feet away, we see PAUL HANGEMUHL gently help his wife remove her nightgown and lower her nude body to the floor. Her face is streaked with tears. They kiss tenderly.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: (voice breaking) I'll be waiting for you.

(She gives a weak smile and nods. She is scared, he is reluctant to leave her.)

(Outside, SHERIFF KURT FREY cocks his gun as he approaches the rear of the cage. He opens the door. The CREATURE slowly appears from the darkness.)

(Inside the house, MARIE HANGEMUHL lies sobbing quietly on the floor. The sobs increase as she realizes that the CREATURE is coming near. She sees his face and cries out.)

MARIE HANGEMUHL: No!

(But she stays still and sobs some more. The CREATURE kneels down beside her. His eyes are painful and haunted. He dislocates his jaw, spittle dripping from his mouth. She screams in horror as he bites her neck. Blood spatters her face and she screams as he begins eating her alive. In the adjoining room, only feet away, wincing in shared pain at her cries, PAUL HANGEMUHL is praying softly.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Our father, who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name...

(MARIE HANGEMUHL continues screaming as her body is consumed by the CREATURE. The CREATURE's mouth is full of blood and flesh.)



SCENE 11

(Later, DOGGETT and SKINNER arrive at the HANGEMUHL's house. PAUL HANGEMUHL answers the door, a towel in hand. He is alone and exhausted.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: What is it now?

DOGGETT: Mind if we come in?

(They enter without waiting for answer.)

PAUL HANGEMUHL: What do you think you're doing?

DOGGETT: Looking for the Sheriff. He was here, wasn't he?

PAUL HANGEMUHL: Look, I've had a long day and I want to go to bed, so if you don't mind...

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder came back here that night and shot a man in this room. You know why, and so does your wife.

PAUL HANGEMUHL: I want you guys out of my house, now. Hey, did you hear me?!

(SKINNER looks at the floor.)

SKINNER: Mr. Hangemuhl, we'd like to speak with your wife. Where is she?

DOGGETT: Where is she, Mr. Hangemuhl?

(PAUL HANGEMUHL doesn't answer.)

DOGGETT: Something happened here and I'm going to figure out what it is.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett.

(SKINNER holds up a corner of the rug showing some blood pooled beneath it.)

DOGGETT: Looks like you missed a spot, Mr. Hangemuhl.



SCENE 12

(A dirt basement floor. The CREATURE is groaning in pain and vomiting up a pale substance into a vaguely human shape. CarriK has GenderBender and Kindred flashbacks from Season One.)



SCENE 13

(Later that night. SHERIFF KURT FREY has arrived at the HANGEMUHL's house and crime scene procedures are underway. DOGGETT stands motionless beside his car. He is having a series of flashbacks of wet MULDER arriving at the house, entering and seeing PAUL HANGEMUHL and MARIE HANGEMUHL, then firing at the CREATURE. SKINNER, coming out of the house, interrupts the flashback series.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Hangemuhl says his wife must've coughed up the blood. He insists he didn't harm her.

SKINNER: Of course he says that.

DOGGETT: Maybe he didn't.

SKINNER: What are you talking about?

DOGGETT: You said it before, Mulder wouldn't do this-- shoot a man in cold blood. Unless he was trying to protect Mrs. Hangemuhl.

SKINNER: From who?

DOGGETT: From the man that's supposed to be buried in that coffin.

(Pause.)

SKINNER: The county police found something you ought to look at.

(SKINNER leads DOGGETT up to the porch where a TECHNICIAN is working on the front door.)

SKINNER: Mr. Hangemuhl must've just used water to clean this.

(SKINNER accepts a UV light from the TECHNICIAN.)

SKINNER: Thank you. Otherwise... we might not have found it.

(SKINNER shines the UV light on the door revealing the image of the circle/cross symbol.)

SKINNER: Look familiar?



SCENE 14

(SKINNER and DOGGETT have established a link to the LONE GUNMEN over a laptop with a camera. WETLEGKIK gives a beautiful description of the scene: "The Lone Gunmen in their jammies and skivvies talking to Doggett and Skinner via notebook computer on a high speed, broadcast quality, full-color, full-duplex, wireless Internet DS-3 digital connection. In Squamash, Pennsylvania. Uh huh. Sure. Fine. Whatever. It looked like electricity was considered to be a luxury in that town." CarriK's Husband just sort of sputtered, "Yeah, right." Anyway, the GUNMEN are dressed very casually in bathrobes, etc. and look tired.)

BYERS: We learned what we could. This is somewhat short notice, of course.

FROHIKE: And a little outside our area of expertise.

LANGLY: Plus the fact we were sleeping.

DOGGETT: You wearing pants, Langly?

LANGLY: Uh...yeah.

(Sheepishly, LANGLY, ducks out of the range of the camera.)

SKINNER: We don't have much time. What did you find?

FROHIKE: Thought you'd never ask, big guy.

(FROHIKE types commands into another computer that brings up the circle/cross symbol.)

BYERS: The pattern you described to us is most likely a medicine wheel. It's a symbol for healing usually associated with North American shaman.

FROHIKE: Now, the circle represents the continuum between life and death. The journey is separated by two roads, one for happiness, one for sorrow.

BYERS: Lakota Indians teach that all these elements-- life, death, sorrow, happiness-- are all one. But it takes an enlightened mind to see it.

DOGGETT: Why paint it on a door, or mark it on a grave?

(LANGLY enters again zipping up a newly-donned pair of pants.)

LANGLY: Well-- that's the part that takes some conjecture there, Agent Dogbird.

BYERS: We don't know what Mulder was doing out there.

FROHIKE: But legends date back hundreds of years of a sin-catcher shaman also known as a soul eater.

DOGGETT: A soul eater?

LANGLY: They minister to the sick-- legend has it they consume their illnesses.

BYERS: The symbol might be placed on a grave as a sign of respect. Or on a door as a summons.

SKINNER: A summons for what?

BYERS: To indicate a sick person lives there, someone in need of the creature's healing gift.

DOGGETT: Thanks for your help, boys.

LANGLY: (sarcastically) Yeah, you're welcome.

(LANGLY shuts off the connection.)

(DOGGETT closes the laptop.)

DOGGETT: Marie Hangemuhl suffered from a kidney disease.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: That wasn't a transient buried in that grave.

(DOGGETT gets into the car and drives away.)



SCENE 15

(DOGGETT knocks at the door of the BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN. She answers. He shows his badge.)

DOGGETT: Sorry to disturb you at this hour, ma'am. I'm Agent Doggett with the FBI. May I come in?

(She lets him in. A fire is burning in the hearth.)

DOGGETT: The Sheriff's report last May said you found a body in the woods out here.

(She doesn't answer.)

DOGGETT: Look, the people of this town are keeping a secret about that body-- about who it is. There was an FBI agent who came here because he believed that it was some kind of a "soul eater."

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: Maybe it is.

DOGGETT: You believe it, too. You put those stones on top of his grave.

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: The things you're asking about-- they've been this way for hundreds of years. You can't change them.

DOGGETT: A colleague of mine came here to try and kill this thing last spring. I believe he was trying to protect a woman named Marie Hangemuhl. I need your help.

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: You've got it all backward.

(DOGGETT turns at the sound of thumping below them. He looks up at the BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN who is nervous, but says nothing. DOGGETT flips up a corner of the rug exposing a trap door. He opens the door, readies his gun and flashlight, and descends the dirt stairs. He sees a naked female figure in a human sized indentation on the dirt floor. She is covered in slimy goo. He wipes the goo from her mouth and nose and she gasps in a breath and her eyes open. It is MARIE HANGEMUHL.

DOGGETT: I'm going to get you out of here.

(DOGGETT has wrapped MARIE HANGEMUHL in his overcoat. He carries her out of the house to his car. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN watches from the window.)



SCENE 16

(Hospital room. MARIE HANGEMUHL is in the bed. DOGGETT watches through the window as PAUL HANGEMUHL puts the wedding ring set back her finger. She beams and giggles happily. SKINNER enters the hall behind DOGGETT.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett. How is she?

DOGGETT: She feels fine, you believe that? The doctor says Mrs. Hangemuhl's kidneys have spontaneously healed. She's a healthy woman.

(SKINNER looks confused. DOGGETT glances back in the room.)

DOGGETT: Explain that.

SKINNER: You're going to have to explain it. The Sheriff's waiting to take your statement.

DOGGETT: The Sheriff knows. He's known all along. So's her husband.

SKINNER: Known what?

DOGGETT: That this soul eater took her to cure her. I thought Mulder shot this man to protect Marie Hangemuhl. But it wasn't her he was trying to protect.

(DOGGETT heads out of the room.)

SKINNER: Where are you going?

DOGGETT: Something happened here. It just wasn't what we thought.



SCENE 17

(Night. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN watches as DOGGETT pulls up in front of her house and enters. She is sitting in front of the fire.)

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: To understand what this thing is you have to understand what it can do-- its gift. People hate it because they need it. It looks the way it does because of their sickness.

(He sits beside her.)

DOGGETT: You care for this man.

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: Someone always has.

DOGGETT: Because you believe it? That it can cure people's sickness?

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: Not cure. Consume.

DOGGETT: Mulder came to see you last year. Not to save Marie Hangemuhl. To save himself.

(Flashback of MULDER lying passively naked on the rug in front of the fire. He is looking up at the CREATURE in curiosity and fear. The CREATURE is gasping, sad and in pain.)

(Present day.)

DOGGETT: Mulder was dying, but he kept it a secret. He had an undiagnosed brain disease. He was a sick man, desperate to find a cure.

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: They all are.

(Flashback. MULDER watches in fearful pity as the CREATURE dislocates its jaw.)

(Present day.)

DOGGETT: (realizing) Mulder didn't do it.

(DOGGETT rises and sits closer to her.)

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: Agent Mulder saw how it suffered. He saw it in its eyes. I knew what needed to be done. I just couldn't bring myself to do it.

DOGGETT: Mulder killed it.

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: He couldn't bear to add to its pain.

DOGGETT: So he came back here that night to take its pain away.

(Flashback of MULDER shooting the CREATURE.)

(Present day.)

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: They buried it. It wanted to die. It still does, but it can't. All these months I've kept it here in secret. But now that they know it's back it'll keep suffering.

(They both look up at the CREATURE who is in the room with them, whimpering softly. DOGGETT escorts the CREATURE gently outside and helps it into the backseat of his car. He looks at it a moment, then closes the door. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN watches passively from the window of her house. SHERIFF KURT FREY and others drive up, blocking DOGGETT's car. They are armed with guns.)

DOGGETT: Sheriff, as a federal officer I'm asking you and your men to get out of my way.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: You can't take it, Agent Doggett. It belongs to us.

DOGGETT: This is a man. He doesn't belong to anybody.

SHERIFF KURT FREY: We have sick people. Sick people who need what it has. We're taking it. You're free to go.

DOGGETT: No, sir. I'm driving this man out of here.

(DOGGETT turns his back on the men and heads back to his car. Gunshot. DOGGETT falls face forward to the ground. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN screams. SHERIFF KURT FREY turns DOGGETT's dead body over. Leaves and dirt are stuck to the bloody exit wound in the front of his chest. A MAN, PAUL HANGEMUHL? looks into the back of DOGGETT's car.)

MAN: Sheriff.

(The backseat of the car is empty. The CREATURE has escaped.)

SHERIFF KURT FREY: It'll come back. It always does.



SCENE 18

(Night. SHERIFF KURT FREY and the others shovel dirt onto DOGGETT, whose dead body is lying in a shallow grave. The BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN watches as the trucks drive away one by one.)



SCENE 19

(It is as if we are in a thick, bloody, viscous fluid. We see the CREATURE chewing. GROANING. CUT TO: DOGGETT lying naked on a dirt floor, covered in thick slime. His hand moves as he wakes up. He sees the BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN leaning over the body of the CREATURE in the dirt basement nearby. He rises and goes to kneel beside her. The CREATURE is dead.)

BLONDE RUSTIC WOMAN: (on the verge of tears) All these years we didn't know what it could do. It took your death. You freed it.

(SlimyDOGGETT looks at her.)



SCENE 20

(Late. DOGGETT is sitting at the computer in the X-Files office. His hands hover over the keyboard, but don't know what to type for his case report. SKINNER enters.)

DOGGETT: A.D. Skinner, you're here late.

SKINNER: So are you.

DOGGETT: I wanted to finish my case report before Agent Scully comes in tomorrow morning.

SKINNER: Have you?

DOGGETT: I don't even know where to begin or how to explain it. Only thing I do know is is I'm no closer to finding Mulder now than when I started this thing.

SKINNER: You got inside of his head, Agent Doggett. You understood why Mulder did something I wouldn't have thought him capable of doing. You want some free advice? Don't write that report. You turn that in you open up a world of trouble for Agent Scully. And yourself.

DOGGETT: She didn't know anything about this, sir. Of that I'm certain.

[CARRIK: Good boy! Already learning to protect Scully.]

SKINNER: How many months will be lost proving that? How much damage done to her good name? And Mulder's? And to yours? For what?

DOGGETT: The truth.

(SKINNER looks at a piece of paper with the circle/cross symbol on it.)

SKINNER: You and I both know what happened out there, Agent Doggett. No one else needs to.

(SKINNER hands the paper to DOGGETT and leaves. DOGGETT looks at the symbol a moment, then lowers it. Across the office behind the other desk MULDER stands in the shadows, watching him. DOGGETT stares at him. MULDER is there for another moment, then is not there.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1
CLAY STREET STATION
BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

(Almost deserted underground train station that probably looks more familiar to Los Angeles residents than to Bostonians. A PASSENGER, male, about 40, stands on the platform alone waiting for the train. He sees a GANGBANGER jump the turnstile. The GANGBANGER circles the PASSENGER threateningly, moves several yards away and also waits for the train just behind the PASSENGER. The PASSENGER, aka undercover TRANSIT COP PHILBRICK, speaks softly into a handheld radio.)

TRANSIT COP PHILBRICK: I'm on the Clay Street platform. Got a fare-jumper. White male, shaved head, 20s. Possible 10-13.

[If that guy is in his twenties, then CarriK is 12.]

(Brakes squealing, the train, a big "M" on the front and side, arrives. The GANGBANGER looks hostile. PHILBRICK boards the train and watches through the window into the car behind him. The GANGBANGER has not boarded. The bell dings. PHILBRICK foolishly turns and watches the doors of his own car slide shut. Relaxed, he speaks again into his radio and takes a seat near the front of the car.)

TRANSIT COP PHILBRICK: Officer Philbrick, all clear.

(In the door window of the car behind him, we see movement. PHILBRICK glances around as the GANGBANGER, who did indeed board at the last stop, crosses into his car. PHILBRICK looks a little nervous. Carefully, he unholsters his gun as the GANGBANGER confidently approaches him. Suddenly, as if someone pulled the emergency brake, the train screeches to a halt and the lights dim. PHILBRICK is thrown to the floor, his gun skidding a few feet away. He scrambles after it, then turns to see the GANGBANGER bearing down on him. PHILBRICK screams in horror. We see the rear of the train as it moves away. Repeated flashes of PHILBRICK's gun accompany his screams.)

(Later, perhaps next morning. A WOMAN, about 40, stands waiting for the train with others at another stop. It arrives and she boards. She is about to take a seat, when she glances at the floor and sees what remains of PHILBRICK. She covers her mouth. His head is half-eaten away by what looks like acid. She screams.)

SCENE 2
TRANSIT OPERATIONS CENTER
BOSTON, MASSACUSETTS
10:34 AM

(Sparks fly as work is done on tracks and train. SCULLY and DOGGETT, fashionably clad in long black coats, are met by DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS and LT. BIANCO. DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS is 50's, brash, impatient, all business. LT. BIANCO is 30's, big, tough, very much DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS's man. They glare at SCULLY and DOGGETT.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Deputy Chief Karras, Transit Police. This is Lieutenant Bianco. You're Scully and Doggett, right?

SCULLY: Yes. Is the assessment team here?

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Downstairs, waiting 45 minutes. Where the hell have you two been?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully needed to examine the body of the victim first.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Who's missing the picture here? I got lots of people who can examine the body. What I need from the FBI now is a time frame.

DOGGETT: A time frame?

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: One of the main arteries of the Boston Public Transport System has been closed for exactly 11 hours and four minutes. My phone is ringing off the hook right now with calls from the press. I got 100,000 pissed-off commuters who were late to work this morning who are going to be even more pissed off if they can't get home. And I got one extremely pissed-off mayor paying me to do one thing-- keep the damn trains running.

SCULLY: Sir, se appreciate the pressure that you're under, but...

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: No. It's you guys better kick it in the ass. The afternoon rush starts in five hours. Do what you've got to do but this line is going back in operation AT 4:00 P.M.

SCULLY: I'm afraid you can't do that.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Oh, yes, I can.

SCULLY: You've got a dead man who's got over 1/3 of his body tissue completely eaten away and until we figure out how and why that tunnel cannot be reopened.

LT. BIANCO: We understand the FBI's need to do a thorough investigation, but as I see it the facts of this case are actually pretty simple.

SCULLY: Simple?

LT. BIANCO: The train briefly lost power during which time an assailant killed a Boston Transit cop. That man is still at large.

DOGGETT: An assailant using what?

LT. BIANCO: Acid, lye... your examination of the victim must've told us something.

SCULLY: No, it didn't, that's the thing. Until we culture the tissue and run the proper tests we're not going to know what killed him or if it can infect others.

LT. BIANCO: The centers for disease control had robotic sniffers in the tunnel all night. They found no trace of biological or chemical agents. So let's clear this up. What we're looking for is a man-- a cop-killer. Single suspect.

DOGGETT: At least that's your cover story.

(LT. BIANCO stares at him. This is not the beginning of a close friendship.)

DOGGETT: That's what you're telling the press.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: The question is can you get me the killer or an explanation in less than five hours? Because hell or high water, the subway reopens at 4 PM sharp. Now let's go.

(DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS turns and walks down the platform, followed by LT. BIANCO. SCULLY and DOGGETT pause a moment, then also join him. Another man, STEVEN MELNICK, 40's, a little overweight, and an African-American woman, HELLURA LYLE, 30's, are waiting for them.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Steven Melnick, Transportation Authority Chief Structural Engineer. He built this tunnel.

MELNICK: I only oversaw construction of it four years ago. I know every square inch down there.

(Friendly, MELNICK shakes SCULLY's hand. So does LYLE.)

LYLE: Dr. Hellura Lyle. Special pathogens branch, CDC.

SCULLY: We were told you folks said that the tunnel was free of pathogens.

LYLE: (dryly) Well, I guess I'm just here for the moral support.

(Like MELNICK and LT. BIANCO, LYLE begins to put on protective and research gear.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: We're just covering our bases.

(LYLE glances over at DOGGETT and SCULLY.)

LYLE: What base are they covering?

(DOGGETT is also getting ready. He has stripped to his undershirt and is putting on a bulletproof vest like the others.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Agent Scully is a medical doctor. Who they tell me has a lot of experience with equivocal deaths.

(DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS does not look at SCULLY as he says this. He doesn't think much of what "they" have told him, or of SCULLY. CARRIK: Oh, he will pay.)

MELNICK: Equivocal? (chuckles) Hey, I mean you're dead or you're not, right?

SCULLY: (slightly uncomfortable) Deaths for which there may be many explanations or for which an explanation may be hard to find.

(LYLE looks at DOGGETT.)

LYLE: What about you?

DOGGETT: I'm just a good shot.

(LT. BIANCO has a really big gun.)

LT. BIANCO: (sarcastically) Well, good. Now that we're bosom buddies, let's get this show on the road.

(DOGGETT follows SCULLY over to another pile of gear obviously intended for her. She has made no move to put it on. They speak quietly. SCULLY seems to be avoiding DOGGETT's eyes.)

DOGGETT: Do you need some help with that?

SCULLY: No. You're going in without me.

DOGGETT: (surprised) What?

SCULLY: I don't know what kinds of game are being played, but I'm going to be much more effective analysing the situation from up here.

(Things are tense. DOGGETT is not happy.)

DOGGETT: Yeah, but I'm just tag along here. This is your thing. You've got all the experience.

SCULLY: You've got capable people with you, Agent Doggett. What I need down there are eyes and ears.

(Pause. CarriK has Pusher flashback as SCULLY hands DOGGETT a radio-controlled head-mounted camera/microphone. DOGGETT puts it on.)

DOGGETT: Okay. I'll be your eyes and ears. But I wish somebody would tell me what the hell I'm supposed to be looking for.

(SCULLY has no answer.)



SCENE 3
TRANSIT CONTROL CENTER
11:51 AM

(Lots of computer screens showing the subway grid. SCULLY is at one monitor that shows what DOGGETT's camera sees. She speaks into a handheld radio. DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS stands a few feet behind her. She glances back at him before speaking to DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Third rail's powering down. You're clear to enter the subway floor and as long as you stay on this line there should be no risk of accidental shock or electrocution. You copy that, Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT, LT. BIANCO, LYLE, and MELNICK are entering the dark subway line.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Yep, we're on the tunnel floor. Hope you got yourself a nice clear picture, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: (on radio) We got you every step of the way.

(SCULLY looks back again at DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS who stares at her without emotion.)

(IN THE TUNNEL: The members of the team look hot and uncomfortable. They all have a light sheen of sweat on their bodies.)

HELLURA LYLE: Ooh, it feels like Atlanta in August.

DOGGETT: Yeah, it's the middle of winter. How come it's so hot down here?

MELNICK: They shut down ventilation last night. Normally you have almost a million cubic feet of fresh air per minute pushing through here but now we're in a sweatbox.

LYLE: Aren't we lucky? Hot, sticky and crawling in the dark. All so every commuter in Boston can get home to watch Survivor II.

[There's our Late Winter 2001 date stamp.]

DOGGETT: I wonder why they shut down the ventilation if it's a man we're supposed to be looking for.

LT. BIANCO: You doubt that so much, Agent Doggett, why bring a gun?

(As they walk through the dark corridor with flashlights, LYLE steps in a puddle. She gives it a glance, then continues after DOGGETT and LT. BIANCO. MELNICK, bringing up the rear, steps over it. As he passes, we see that there is a green glowing substance in the puddle, much like what you would see in your footprints if you walk along a Carolina beach at night in early summer.)

(In the station, SCULLY is watching the monitor.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, you still reading me down there?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Like a songbird, Agent Scully.

(Suddenly, MELNICK yells and falls to his knees. He is grasping at his bare neck.)

STEVEN MELNICK: My shirt, my neck... Get it off!

LT. BIANCO: What's going on?

STEVEN MELNICK: Something's burning! Something's burning!!

LT. BIANCO: Just, just hold still...

SCULLY: (on radio) What just happened?

(The other members of the team have gathered around MELNICK. DOGGETT shines a light on his neck. There is a small round wound there. LT. BIANCO appears to be putting some kind of ointment on it.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) I don't know. He's got a burn on his neck, silver-dollar sized.

DOGGETT: (to MELNICK) You get seepage down here?

MELNICK: (breathing heavily, in pain) Yeah, constantly. This line was tunneled through landfill adjacent to the harbour. It's a part of the Big Dig.

LYLE: There was a puddle 20 yards back.

DOGGETT: (on radio) You hear that, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah. Ask Dr. Lyle if she can get a sample.

DOGGETT: We need you to get a sample.

LYLE: Okay, I'm on it.

DOGGETT: Maybe it's not a man we're looking for but some sort of toxic leak.

LT. BIANCO: (a little nervous) We were told there are no contaminants down here.

(SCULLY watches in the monitor as DOGGETT approaches LYLE who has pulled up a sample of water from the puddle. She puts it into a shoulder mounted chemical analyser that apparently has a built in modem.)

LYLE: Tell her I'm sending this.

(High-pitched beeping as the information is sent to SCULLY. )

LYLE: We're transmitting.

DOGGETT: (on radio) You online, Agent Scully?

(SCULLY sees the results on her screen.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah, I got it. I'm getting a reading... Sample analysis is showing carbon, bromide, boron and calcium.

(SCULLY sighs in frustration.)

LYLE: It's just seawater.

SCULLY: (on radio) Let me get on the phone. Maybe I can get a molecular analysis.

(SCULLY dials the phone.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: (warning tone) Four hours, Agent Scully.

(SCULLY could live quite happily on this planet without the existence of DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS. He walks away.)

(In the tunnel, LT. BIANCO is kneeling beside the wounded MELNICK.)

LT. BIANCO: Take it easy.

(They see movement down the tunnel. LT. BIANCO pulls out his large gun and holds it ready as MELNICK stands quickly holding his flashlight aloft.)

MELNICK: Agent Doggett!

(DOGGETT and LYLE run to join them.)

DOGGETT: What? What is it?

LT. BIANCO: There's somebody in the tunnel.

DOGGETT: All right, let's go find him.

(Ominous music as the four members of the team proceed down the tunnel.)

LYLE: Open this line in four hours passengers will get more than just a ride-- they'll get a steam bath to boot.

(She notices MELNICK taking off his bulletproof vest.)

LYLE: Wwhat are you doing?

MELNICK: If this guy was going to shoot me he already had his chance. Besides, I'm sweating like a pig.

(DOGGETT notices a side tunnel covered with loose plastic.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Melnick, what's this?

MELNICK: It's a tunnel from the old system. Been shut down for years.

DOGGETT: (on radio) You see this, Agent Scully? You have this on your graphic?

(In the office, SCULLY and DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS are watching their progress live and on the map of the subway. They can both be heard by DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah. It's a fork in the line.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: (on radio) That line is obsolete. It's been gutted and decommissioned.

DOGGETT: (on radio) How far from here to where the train lost power, Agent Scully?

(DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS leans over SCULLY's shoulder and points to an area on the map.)

SCULLY: (on radio) It's about a mile up the main tunnel.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: He's going to waste valuable time going in there.

(DOGGETT starts toward the decommissioned tunnel.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT pushes aside the plastic and enters the tunnel. The other members of the team follow him.)

SCULLY: (on radio, warning tone) Agent Doggett...

DOGGETT: (on radio) I'm just taking a look.

(Very creepy in this tunnel.)

LT. BIANCO: All right, let's get out of here.

DOGGETT: Mr. Melnick what's your call? You think there's any good reason to pursue this section?

MELNICK: Lots of places to hide in here.

DOGGETT: Dr. Lyle?

(LYLE sees movement down the tunnel.)

LYLE: Agent Doggett, look out!

(DOGGETT yells as something human with a burned face attacks him, knocking him to the ground.)



SCENE 4

12:37 PM

(SCULLY speaks into the radio, concerned.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, what happened? Can you hear me?

(In the tunnel, DOGGETT is gasping to get his breath back after being knocked violently to the floor.)

DOGGETT: (weakly) Yeah.

(Camera-eye view of MELNICK extending his hand to help DOGGETT up. DOGGETT, still way out of breath, politely refuses.)

DOGGETT: Nah, give me a minute. What hit me?

LYLE: Well, he came at you like some kind of phantom.

SCULLY: (on radio) What did? Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT raises himself up onto his elbow and stares in shock at a man's body lying beside him. The face is badly burned, just as the TRANSIT COP was in the teaser. He resembles the GANGBANGER, but with much less skin.)

MELNICK: Would you call that equivocal?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully...

(SCULLY, seeing the image through DOGGETT's camera, is a bit shaken.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Uh, okay, I see it. Um, I'm going to need some data.

(DOGGETT looks at the others with exhausted resignation.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully needs some data.

LYLE: I'm already on it.

LT. BIANCO: I think this is the guy that killed Officer Philbrick.

(LYLE begins taking pictures with the Super!Digital camera.)

LYLE: I'm transmitting some photos.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Here comes your data, Agent Scully.

(SCULLY is horrified by the images of the burned man that she is receiving.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(In the tunnel, MELNICK has been standing to one side, but when he sees something further down the tunnel, he starts to investigate. LT. BIANCO stops him, gun in hand.)

LT. BIANCO: Where you going?

MELNICK: I think I just saw something.

(DOGGETT comes over.)

DOGGETT: What's the problem?

LT. BIANCO: There's no problem. This man fits the description called in by my transit cop. We found what we were looking for. Let's get him wrapped up and go home.

(DOGGETT instead looks in the direction that MELNICK indicated.)

MELNICK: See it? There's something on the floor.

(There are three bodies wrapped in clear plastic lying in a row on the floor.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, we got bodies. Looks like three males. Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah, I see them. Can you get any closer?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Smell's a little overpowering. They've been here for a while. Looks like someone wrapped them up and stashed them down here.

SCULLY: (on radio) Can you get them uncovered?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Look like squatters from the way they're dressed. I'm not sure I want to touch these.

(As DOGGETT shines his light on the bodies, we see that they all have burned flesh.)

SCULLY: (on radio) I see signs of the same tissue degradation we saw in the other victims. We may have a contagion here after all.

(Backlit by the image from DOGGETT's camera, SCULLY looks up at DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS who looks back at her defensively.)

(In the tunnel, everyone is nervous.)

LT. BIANCO: What did she say?

DOGGETT: Dr. Lyle, down here.

LYLE: (looking at her recorder) Oh...

DOGGETT: The CDC may be wrong.

(LYLE sees some movement down the tunnel.)

LYLE: Somebody's over here!

(DOGGETT and the others run down the tunnel, guns ready. They see nothing.)

SCULLY: (on radio, worried) Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Whatever she saw... What did you see?

LYLE: Somebody out here just took off.

(The tunnel is empty.)

DOGGETT: I don't see where.

LT. BIANCO: (sweating, wanting to leave) Look, we're done down here. Let's get this show on the road.

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett...

(Gun in hand, DOGGETT confronts LT. BIANCO.)

DOGGETT: Hold it, Lieutenant.

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, if there's somebody else down there you're going to need to find him.

(DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS comes up behind SCULLY.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: What are you doing, Agent Scully? Get those people out.

SCULLY: "Those people" just found three dead bodies and I want to know what happened to them.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Look, they are in an obsolete, decommissioned tunnel. I'll get a crew down in there tonight after rush hour.

SCULLY: You don't understand. They could be infected and contagious.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: With what? Seawater? You are being irrational here. The CDC says there are no contaminants. I'm going to take their word on it.

SCULLY: (angrily) Then, who are those dead men and how did they die?

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Probably tunnel rats. Squatters attacked by the same man who killed my transit cop.

SCULLY: Then take a look at the man who fits the description of your killer, okay?

(She points to the monitor displaying the dead GANGBANGER, his face half burned away.)

SCULLY: Just look at his injuries, sir. He died the same way. There is something down there and I am not going to risk bringing it up here before I figure out what it is!

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully...

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah?

DOGGETT: (on radio) What do you want us to do?

SCULLY: (on radio) I want you to leave those bodies where you found them and go after whoever it is who's in that tunnel.

(SCULLY looks defiantly at DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS, who, exasperated, leaves the room.)

SCULLY: (on radio) We need to know whether he is causing this or if he's infected himself. Either way, he may kill more people. I'm sure Dr. Lyle will agree.

DOGGETT: All right, we just got our order. We're going to continue on.

LT. BIANCO: Says who?

DOGGETT: Says the boss.

(DOGGETT leads the team down the tunnel. The other team members looks at each other, then follow DOGGETT. LT. BIANCO steps up to walk beside DOGGETT.)

LT. BIANCO: Agent Doggett. This agent you work with deals with weird stuff, right?

DOGGETT: She works on something called the X-Files-- FBI cases dealing with unexplained phenomena.

LT. BIANCO: You know her at all?

DOGGETT: Yeah, I know her. We've worked together for a short time.

LT. BIANCO: I wonder why she sent you down here instead of coming herself.

DOGGETT: It's the right call. (pause) You got a problem, Lieutenant?

LT. BIANCO: Yeah. A problem when somebody I don't know keeps me down herein the dark looking for jack squat when we've already found our man.

DOGGETT: It's a question of contagion.

LT. BIANCO: It's a question of who's in charge.

(They look at each other. Alpha Male square off. Manhoods are questioned. Testosterone is measured. They are interrupted by SCULLY's voice.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Yeah.

SCULLY: (on radio) You all right down there?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Fine. What do you got for us?

SCULLY: (on radio) You're about 50 yards from the spot where the train stopped.

DOGGETT: (on radio) What am I looking for?

SCULLY: (on radio) I don't know. Anything.

(The team looks around the tunnel. They are all sweating heavily. MELNICK is rubbing at his neck. The wound is glowing green and begins sparking. He falls to his knees in pain.)

MELNICK: Get it off me. Get it off me!

LYLE: What is it?

MELNICK: I don't know, but it burns!

DOGGETT: Just hold still. Let us see it.

MELNICK: It burns!

SCULLY: (on radio) What is it? What's happening? Agent Doggett?!

DOGGETT: (on radio) I can't tell what it is.

(SCULLY watches through DOGGETT's camera as MELNICK begin screaming in agony. His arm is covered in blisters that are sparking as if connected to an electrical current.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, talk to me.

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah, um, get some fresh water on it!

DOGGETT: Give me water here!

(MELNICK continues screaming as the others fumble for the water bottles on their belts. DOGGETT empties his onto MELNICK's arm which stops the sparking.)

LYLE: (horrified) What the hell was that?

DOGGETT: I don't know, and I don't like it that you don't know!

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, talk to me!

(SCULLY is at a loss.)

SCULLY: (on radio) I don't know what to say... I, mean, i-it's something attacking the dermis.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Attacking? It ate his arm off!

SCULLY: (on radio) I hate to say this, Agent Doggett but it looks like it could be some kind of biochemical weapon.

DOGGETT: (putting his hand to his head) Great.

LYLE: What?

LT. BIANCO: What did she say?

DOGGETT: She said a lot of people might be taking cabs home tonight.

(LYLE is injecting MELNICK with a painkiller, I hope. He is in agony.)

MELNICK: What the hell is this thing?!

DOGGETT: It might be a terrorist using some kind of biochemical agent.

LT. BIANCO: Might? What, is she guessing?

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, I pulled up a map of the subway grid where you are now. I want you to listen to me.

(She continues speaking. DOGGETT tells the others what she is saying.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully's telling me the tunnel we're in connects to another tunnel 100 yards up. It's the only place for another mile that this guy could be hiding.

LYLE: Well, this man ain't going nowhere.

DOGGETT: Then you take care of him. I'll have a hazmat team come down here and prep you for quarantine. Lieutenant, let's go.

(DOGGETT heads on down the tunnel.)

LYLE: All right, buddy. I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on. Come on. I got you, buddy. Hang in there.

(MELNICK moans in pain.)

(LT. BIANCO watches LYLE and MELNICK a moment. He looks at his own hand, which shows signs of a glowing green substance. Nervously, he follows DOGGETT down the tunnel.)



SCENE 5

2:23 PM

(MELNICK is being carried out of the tunnel on a gurney by a team of clean-suited men. He is alive, but looks bad. SCULLY runs up to DR. LYLE who has been outfitted in a high level biohazard suit of her own.)

SCULLY: Dr. Lyle... Dr. Lyle, how are you feeling?

LYLE: Me?

SCULLY: Yeah.

LYLE: Well, I seem to be okay, but Melnick... Melnick is getting worse.

SCULLY: Well, we got vehicles on the way. The CDC doctors have been informed of your conditions.

LYLE: So, what are they going to be treating us for? How are they going to treat Melnick?

SCULLY: I'm working on that.

(LYLE looks at her, then heads off to the ambulance. SCULLY sees another large team of CLEAN-SUITED MEN running with gurneys containing the dead victims from the abandoned tunnel. She chases after them.)

SCULLY: Hey! What are you doing?! Hey, where are you taking them? Those bodies go to the CDC... Look, as a federal agent I order you to stop and explain yourself.

(They stop. SCULLY looks up and sees DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS supervising.)

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: Agent Scully, we are on a deadline here, which is fast approaching.

SCULLY: These bodies need immediate examination and diagnosis.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: And that is being arranged.

SCULLY: By whom? I already arranged it.

(They stare at each other. SCULLY steps toward him.)

SCULLY: (accusing) You knew those bodies were down there, didn't you?

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: I'd watch yourself, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Look at the way they're wrapped. Somebody sealed them in plastic, hoping they wouldn't be found. Look, if I find out you sent my partner and those others down there knowing about this...

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: You are way out of line here.

SCULLY: I want to see inspection reports. I want to know who was down there in that tunnel and what they saw.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: I'll get you anything you want.

SCULLY: Good. Now, let's get these bodies to the CDC where they're supposed to go.

(As DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS watches, SCULLY follows the bodies out of the station.)

(In the tunnel, DOGGETT and LT. BIANCO are still exploring.)

DOGGETT: What's this here, Lieutenant?

LT. BIANCO: Abandoned station-- old stop.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully... Agent Scully...

LT. BIANCO: Here we are, we're pissing away our time and she's asleep at the wheel.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully...

LT. BIANCO: Come on, Agent Doggett. Make a decision. Let's get out of here.

DOGGETT: We got to find whoever it is that's still down here, Lieutenant.

LT. BIANCO: And what if we don't find him? Maybe it'll be us they find lying facedown on the floor, dead.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully knows what she's doing. This is about saving people's lives.

LT. BIANCO: Well, it looks like it's about saving her life. If she knows what she's doing why hasn't she figured it out yet?

(DOGGETT stares at LT. BIANCO.)

DOGGETT: Lieutenant... Walk towards me.

LT. BIANCO: What? What, damn it?

(They both look at LT. BIANCO's arm, which, along with his face, is covered in the glowing green substance.)

LT. BIANCO: The stuff's on me. You see that it's spreading. I told you, Agent Doggett-- we should've gotten out.

DOGGETT: That's exactly why we got to stay.

LT. BIANCO: You saw! You saw what it does.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I saw what it did. But I don't see it having any other effect on you, so just calm down.

LT. BIANCO: I'm getting out of here. I'm leaving.

(LT. BIANCO starts to leaves, but stops at the sound of a pistol being cocked. He turns slowly to see DOGGETT holding a gun on him. DOGGETT is not messing around. This should rate high on AutumnT's Manly Man Meter.)

LT. BIANCO: You'd do it, wouldn't you?

DOGGETT: Not because I want to. But you're pushing pretty hard. So put your weapon down, Lieutenant, right now.

(LT. BIANCO lays his really big gun on the floor.)

DOGGETT: Now, we're going to get out of here but we're going to wait for the okay.

(As DOGGETT kneels to pick up the big gun, LT. BIANCO kicks him in the head. With a grunt, DOGGETT falls unconscious to the floor.)



SCENE 6

(Control room. SCULLY is looking at the monitor displaying DOGGETT's camera view. It shows an unmoving image of the tunnel ceiling.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett? Agent Doggett, can you... Agent Doggett? Come in, Agent Doggett. Agent Doggett! Come in, damn it!

[CARRIK: She is obviously worried about Doggett, but if this were Mulder down in that tunnel, baby or no baby, 400 rabid, acid-blooded, black oil infected aliens would not be able to keep her from running down into that tunnel to save him. No scene could make the point more clear that she considers herself Doggett's co-worker. She already has a partner and will not replace him.)

(Crash sound as SCULLY throws the headset to the floor in disgust.)

(SCULLY turns to see an attractive YOUNG WOMAN, about 30, ethnic mix, enter the room.)

YOUNG WOMAN: Is this a bad time?

SCULLY: Excuse me?

YOUNG WOMAN: I don't know, I'm looking for an FBI Agent Dana Scully. Do you know where I can find him?

SCULLY: No... Yes... I mean, I'm-I'm she. Can I help you?

YOUNG WOMAN: Yes. I'm Dr. Kai Bowe. I was sent a scribbled note and a saltwater sample for analysis. I'm a marine biologist from BU.

SCULLY: I'm sorry. Yes, Dr. Bowe, please. Um... Did you get an analysis?

DR. BOWE: Well, yes, I have something to show you, that's for sure. I'm going to assume you're in a hurry.

(She sets up her laptop and pulls up an image on the screen. It is a magnified image of a very small sea creature.)

DR. BOWE: This is an image taken from a stereo microscope of what's called a medusa. Your saltwater sample was rather deceiving. Its components are exactly as you'd expect except for higher levels of calcium. This creature is primarily that.

SCULLY: Calcium?

DR. BOWE: Yes, it's what powers its movement and gives it bioluminescence.

SCULLY: So you're saying that this is a sea creature? (realizing) Which is why the CDC missed it.

DR. BOWE: Well, it's hard to find. I daresay I'm not even sure if it's of the sea but... wherever it's from, it... it's quite incredible.

SCULLY: It's killing people.

DR. BOWE: How?

SCULLY: I don't know. There is seawater in that subway tunnel and it's eating people's flesh off. It's producing some kind of a  a reaction that looks almost electrical.

DR. BOWE: On contact?

SCULLY: No. Something triggers it.

DR. BOWE: Have you been in the tunnel?

SCULLY: No, I have not. But my partner is down there, and I fear the worst.

(They look at the image of the ceiling on the monitor.)



SCENE 7

(In the tunnel, DOGGETT is unconscious. LT. BIANCO has climbed a wall and is knocking desperately at a sealed access point. He is sweating profusely.)

LT. BIANCO: Hey, hey... Anybody out there?

(He pounds at the hatch in desperation, sweating more.)

LT. BIANCO: Somebody! Anybody hear me?! Anybody?!

(LT. BIANCO gives up and moves away from the access point. As he passes the unconscious DOGGETT we see that half of DOGGETT's face is now covered with the glowing green substance.)



SCENE 8

(In the tunnel, green-splotched DOGGETT is regaining conscious.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett? Agent Doggett, can you hear me? Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: (on radio) Yeah. I'm here. I hear you.

SCULLY: (relieved, on radio) Oh, you had me. I, uh... I started fearing the worst.

DOGGETT: (on radio) No, I... I got blindsided by... I don't see Lieutenant Bianco. He's infected with something. I saw it glowing on his skin.

SCULLY: (on radio) And what's your condition, Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT looks at the green glowing substance that is now on his arms and hands.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) I'm going to assume it's not good.

SCULLY: (on radio) I'm going to send a quarantine unit down to get you, Agent Doggett, okay? I want you to stay right where you are.

DOGGETT: (on radio, cocking his gun) I appreciate it, Agent Scully, but I can't do that. If we're going to stop the spread of this thing I got to stop Lieutenant Bianco.

(He gets up and starts down the tunnel.)

SCULLY: Dr. Bowe, I need you to get on the phone with the CDC. Tell them everything we know. We have to learn as quickly as possible what sets this thing off.

(DR. BOWE goes to do what she says. SCULLY goes up to DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS who enters the room.)

SCULLY: Look... I need you to blockade any and every exit from the system. You've got a possible outbreak situation here.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: No, no. That's not going to happen.

SCULLY: No, you listen to me. Your lieutenant is infected and at large in the system and he is looking for a way out.

DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS: I hear you. It's just that there are already passengers waiting on the platform.

(SCULLY looks at him in disbelief, then at the security monitor nearby. Sure enough, there are many passengers standing on the platform. The computer clock reads 3:39. SCULLY goes back to the microphone.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett... We've got a new wrinkle.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Don't tell me.

SCULLY: (on radio) We're running out of time. It's 20 to 4:00.

DOGGETT: (on radio) I'm moving as fast as I can.

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, you shouldn't be moving at all.

DOGGETT: (on radio) In 20 minutes I'll be taking a long bath at the hotel. Right now, I got to find this guy.

SCULLY: (on radio) This organism that's on your skin-- something triggers it, and I don't know what. It could be body temperature. It could be heart rate.

DOGGETT: (on radio) It could be from standing still, too, right? Maybe the only thing keeping me from sparking up right now is that I'm moving.

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah, I guess you're right.

DOGGETT: (on radio) I'm getting out of this thing, Agent Scully. Just make sure Karras holds those trains till I find Bianco.

SCULLY: (on radio) He's got passengers waiting at the next station.

DOGGETT: (on radio) You tell that son of a bitch he's got to clear the system. He's...

DOGGETT: (on radio) Wait. I see something.

(SCULLY watches on the monitor as DOGGETT kneels down beside an unconscious LT. BIANCO.)

DOGGETT: Lieutenant... (on radio) He's hurt.

(SCULLY sees that LT. BIANCO is covered in the green glowing substance.)

SCULLY: You see this, Dr. Bowe?

(DR. BOWE looks up from the phone and sees it.)

SCULLY: You see this, Mr. Karras?

(DEPUTY CHIEF KARRAS has left the room. SCULLY looks back to DR. BOWE.)

SCULLY: You're on with the CDC?

(DR. BOWE nods.)

SCULLY: I need anything they can give me about what sets this organism off-- an idea, a notion, a wild guess.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, what do you want me to do?

SCULLY: (on radio) Get out of there, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: (on radio) What about this man?

SCULLY: (on radio) I'm going to send a hazmat team down for him but from what I've seen the reaction's progressive.

LT. BIANCO: (weakly) Please, Agent Doggett, don't leave me.

(Later, DOGGETT is half carrying LT. BIANCO down the tunnel.

DOGGETT: I hope you're enjoying the ride.

(DOGGETT suddenly stops. He sees a shadow of a man down the hall.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) You see this, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah.

DR. BOWE: Who else is down there?

DOGGETT: We don't know.

DOGGETT: You, there! Stop! Federal Agent! I'm armed!

(Gun out, DOGGETT chases after the caster of the shadow, then stops in surprise.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, believe this?

(SCULLY looks at the monitor. It is a little boy, maybe seven years old.)

DOGGETT: Who are you? What's your name? What are you doing down here?

SCULLY: (on radio) What's he pointing at?

DOGGETT: (on radio) I don't know.

DR. BOWE: Is he infected?

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, turn the light away.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Nothing. He's unaffected.

DR. BOWE: How's that?

SCULLY: I think I just figured it out. I might know what triggers this.

DOGGETT: (on radio) What is it?

SCULLY: (on radio) Sweat. Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions promoting a chemical-electrical reaction.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Electricity?

SCULLY: (on radio) That's right. And since the boy's sweat glands aren't fully developed then he wouldn't be as conductive.

DOGGETT: (on radio) Just my luck.

(The BOY runs further down the tunnel.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, where's he going?

DOGGETT: (on radio) I don't know, but he wants me to follow him.

(DOGGETT follows the boy into an area that is covered in the green substance. Infected water drips from the ceiling and walls.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) Agent Scully, I don't know if you can see this. I think I found the source of the contagion. It looks like a big leak in the ceiling is crumbling the walls flooding into the system. It must have seeped in from the bay. Hey, where you going?

(The BOY crosses the infected area and looks back toward DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) You see this? The kid's walking right through this stuff.

(SCULLY is looking at the map of the system.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Yeah. I'm... I'm checking my graphic here. It... It looks like he's trying to lead you through to a tunnel on the main system. And, if what I'm looking at is accurate, it would put you about 400 yards from an access point. I mean, if I could put a hazmat team together we might be able to have you out in about 15 minutes.

(DOGGETT goes back and lifts LT. BIANCO to his feet.)

DOGGETT: Come on, Lieutenant.

(Following the BOY, DOGGETT leads LT. BIANCO through the dripping area to a main tunnel. Unfortunately, pools of green liquid have seeped into the main tunnel also, right beside the tracks.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) We're in through to the main system, Agent Scully and we got big, big problems here.

SCULLY: (on radio) Yes, we do.

DOGGETT: (on radio) You see this flooding?

(SCULLY has her eyes on another monitor, showing people boarding the trains and the trains running down the tracks. It is 4:00 PM.)

SCULLY: (on radio) No. It's worse than that. I think this moron Karras has started the trains rolling.

(In the tunnel, DOGGETT hears the screech of a train and sees a red light turn to green. He sends LT. BIANCO and the BOY back down at the opening to the access tunnel. DOGGETT shines his light on a sign warning him away from the third rail, "extremely dangerous.")

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett what are you doing? Agent Doggett... Get off the tracks, Agent Doggett. Get out of there!

(The train is visible.)

DOGGETT: (on radio) We got people on the train. They could get infected.

SCULLY: (on radio) Get out of there, Agent Doggett!

(DOGGETT works to pull LT. BIANCO's Really Big Gun away from him. LT. BIANCO resists.)

DOGGETT: Give it to me! Give it to me!

(DOGGETT wrests the gun away as he hears the whistle of the train approaching.)

DOGGETT: I got an idea, Agent Scully.

(He dips the end of the gun in the green water, and at the last second drops the wet gun onto the third rail and jumps out of the way of the train. Sparks fly, and static fills SCULLY's monitor.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett? Talk to me, Agent Doggett.

(No response but electrical crackling.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Agent Doggett, are you there? Can you hear me?

DOGGETT: (on radio, weakly) Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

SCULLY: (on radio) Thank god. Uh... I lost you on the visual.

(DOGGETT fumbles with his headset. The monitor image comes back on. SCULLY is relieved.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Okay... Okay, I've got you. You're back.

(DOGGETT stands and watches the train proceed safely down the track. The now murky green puddles are still sparking. DOGGETT and the BOY and LT. BIANCO look at each other.)

SCULLY: (on radio) Are you okay?

DOGGETT: (on radio) I can only hope, Agent Scully.



SCENE 9
BOSTON GENERAL HOSPITAL

(DOGGETT, wearing an open backed gown, is lying in a hospital bed. He looks manly, frustrated and bored. He presses the buzzer. No response.)

DOGGETT: Nurse! Nurse!

(He gets out of bed. SCULLY enters the room.)

SCULLY: Where do you think you're going?

DOGGETT: (defensively) Find the nurse. She said she was going to talk to the doctor about me going home. I could be dying in here for all she knows.

[CARRIK: Oh, so male. Manly Man Meter just went up again.]

SCULLY: Well, you're not... Agent Doggett. Your skin and body have been rid of the organism. Simple alcohol bath cleaned you right up. I was just down talking to the nurse and I told her I'd come and give you the news.

DOGGETT: Well, can I get out of here?

SCULLY: Yes.

(DOGGETT starts for the bathroom, then remembers his revealing attire and does a very cute backup move to the bathroom, taking his pants, while SCULLY tolerantly averts her eyes.)

DOGGETT: What about the others?

SCULLY: Well, the kid is with Social Services and plastic surgeons are working on Melnick and Bianco and Dr. Lyle has been discharged.

DOGGETT: You know, I'd like to think that this was over but there's going to be hell to pay for these guys.

SCULLY: No. It's over, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT comes back out of the bathroom, zipping up his pants.)

DOGGETT: Excuse me? This guy Karras put a train back on the tracks. He recklessly endangered people's lives.

SCULLY: (holding up a file) But there is no proof of that.

DOGGETT: What do you mean, there's no proof?

SCULLY: What I'm saying is that the organism is no longer extant. It's destroyed.

DOGGETT: By what?

SCULLY: I'm guessing by the electrical charge that you set off.

(Irritated, DOGGETT reaches for his shirt and puts it on.)

DOGGETT: We have victims. Dead bodies.

SCULLY: Infected by a pathogen of unknown aetiology.

(He stares at her, very upset.)

SCULLY: Look, Agent Doggett, not a criminal charge is going to stick. These guys were just doing their job-- keeping the trains running.

SCULLY: But they've got you to thank. And not just for saving their butts.

DOGGETT: No. You figured it out. I was just your eyes and ears.

(SCULLY smiles weakly, but does not want to take the credit.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully...

(SCULLY's smile is gone.)

SCULLY: Let's go home.

(DOGGETT watches SCULLY leave the room, then follows.)

[THE END]


                                 PER MANUM


ANNOUNCER: (Chris Carter) Previously on The X Files...

(Scenes from SCULLY's abduction (2X05, 2X06, 2X08). She is in the "white place," masked DOCTORS leaning over her, her stomach artificially inflated, the drill descending, her eyes opening in horror. Scully's line is from Requiem 7X22.)

SCULLY: I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests which left me barren.

(Scenes from Memento Mori, 4X15. MULDER meeting the KURT CRAWFORDs and discovering the bank of stored human eggs. One of the drawers is SCULLY's.)

MULDER: What are these?

KURT CRAWFORD: Human ovaharvested during abduction.

(MULDER is holding one of the tubes containing some of SCULLY's ova.)

(From Requiem 7X22. SCULLY is lying in a hospital bed, crying, sadly happy.)

SCULLY: I'm having a hard time explaining it. I'm pregnant.



SCENE 1

(A delivery room. A very pregnant woman, KATH, 30s, is in labour. DUFFY HASKELL, 40's, is coaching her.)

DUFFY HASKELL: You got to breathe, Kath. In and out, in and out. You're panting.

KATH: Can't we just go home and start this all over again tomorrow?

DUFFY HASKELL: You're in safe hands now.

(KATH groans loudly as the DELIVERY NURSE enters.)

DELIVERY NURSE: How are we doing, Ms. McCready?

DUFFY HASKELL: I think she's getting ready.

DELIVERY NURSE: I'll check on her dilation. If she's close, then we'll call Dr. Lev.

(The DELIVERY NURSE reaches under KATH's sheet between her legs and does something that CarriK's Husband was glad we didn't have to see up close. The unborn baby's heart monitor begins beeping oddly. Everyone looks concerned.)

KATH: What is that? What's that sound?

DELIVERY NURSE: It's the baby's heart monitor.

KATH: What's happening, Duffy? Something's happening.

(DR. LEV enters the room. He is already prepped for surgery. He types something into the computer attached to the monitor and pulls on a mask and surgical gloves.)

DR. LEV: Nurse, get the team in here for an emergency C-section.

KATH: Why? What's wrong?

DR. LEV: Baby's having some trouble. Some distress. We'll take care of it. We know what to do. You just lie back now.

(The DELIVERY NURSE begins preparing KATH's belly.)

DR. LEV: Sir, you'll have to scrub if you're going to be here.

(DUFFY HASKELL starts to leave the room.)

KATH: Duffy?

DUFFY HASKELL: It's all right. I'll be right back. Don't wait for me.

(He leaves the room with what seem like relief. The SECOND NURSE enters the room as he leaves and closes and locks the door behind him. KATH doesn't notice. Really eerie music begins.)

KATH: (panicked) Please, please, just don't let anything happen to my baby.

(Another NURSE injects the contents of a syringe into KATH's IV line.)

DR. LEV: Just lie back now. Let us do our work.

(They begin the C-section. incision. The SECOND NURSE holds a suction line for the blood.)

KATH: I can't... I can't feel anything. Something's wrong, isn't it?

DR. LEV: Lie down now, Mrs. McCready. (to SECOND NURSE) You better hit her again.

(The NURSE injects another syringe in to KATH's IV.)

KATH: Something wrong with my baby?

DR. LEV: Your baby's just fine.

(Her stomach ripples with the movement of the baby inside. The SECOND NURSE is trying to hold KATH's head down so that she can't see.)

KATH: Let me see. What is it? Is it a boy?

(DR. LEV removes the baby from her body.)

KATH: Oh, my god... Oh, my god.

(The "baby" is making weird mewling sounds. Definitely not normal. Through her drugged haze, KATH looks at its tiny deformed body in horror.)

KATH: Oh, my god, what is it? Duffy.

DR. LEV: Put her under.

KATH: Duffy.

(But DUFFY is not there. Another syringe is injected into the IV line, and KATH passes out. Close up of the NURSES and DR. LEV tending to what looks like a relatively cute baby Grey Alien. They are cutting the umbilical cord and using a suction bulb to gently remove the mucous plugs from it's little flat nose. They don't seem the least bit surprised or worried about the odd "condition" of the newborn.)

SCENE 2

(Close-up of and ultrasound image of a baby. Camera pans up to show that it is for Dana Scully. The doctor's name is Parenti. SCULLY, dressed all in black, looks up from the ultrasound. She is in her bedroom. The haunting melody we now know as "Scully's Theme" is playing. She turns to look at her profile in the closet mirror and rests her hand on her barely protruding abdomen. Her lips and chin quiver. She is on the verge of tears, but looks up at the ceiling, takes a breath and sighs.)



SCENE 3

(X-Files office. Scully enters, removing her coat as she walks toward MULDER's empty desk. Men's voices. She is surprised to see DOGGETT sitting at his desk in the corner talking to the man from the teaser, DUFFY HASKELL.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully...

SCULLY: Hi.

(DUFFY HASKELL stands quickly and nervously. He looks at SCULLY in what seems like awe.) [CARRIK: Well, at least someone on the show understands the Divinity that is St. Scully! CARRIK'S HUSBAND: Nah, he just thinks she's hot.]

DUFFY HASKELL: Hi.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Agent Doggett, I didn't realize that you had an appointment.

DOGGETT: This is Duffy Haskell. He says he knows you or you know him.

(SCULLY does not recognize him at all.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I don't remember.

(She shakes his hand.)

DUFFY HASKELL: I contacted you about my wife About eight years ago because she was an alien abductee.

SCULLY: That was before my time here. But, uh, is there something I can help you with?

(SCULLY walks around behind MULDER's desk.)

DUFFY HASKELL: (urgently) She's dead. My wife is dead now. They killed her. Kath-- my wife.

DOGGETT: I checked the files. Mr. Haskell wrote several letters to Agent Mulder describing his wife's abduction experiences.

DUFFY HASKELL: My wife gave birth to an alien.

SCULLY: I-I thought you said that your wife was murdered.

DUFFY HASKELL: That's the reason they did it.

SCULLY: Ooo-kay, Mr. Haskell. Why don't you, uh, start from the beginning.

(DOGGETT watches SCULLY as she slowly sits in MULDER's chair. DUFFY HASKELL sits across from her.)

DUFFY HASKELL: Kath was a multiple abductee. The aliens did these procedures on her. Tests and whatnot. One procedure would give her cancer while another one would cure her. Stuff like that. For years, you see. And then, this year, they came right into our bedroom and implanted an alien embryo in Kath.

(SCULLY is not comfortable listening to this.)

SCULLY: I don't suppose that you have any, uh, medical proof of this.

(He hands her an envelope containing an ultrasound for Kath McCready. The envelope is labeled "Zeus Genetics Germantown, Maryland 1-800-555-0100.")

DUFFY HASKELL: I have an ultrasound here. Anyone with a trained eye can see that is a bizarre pregnancy. Especially for a woman who was never supposed to be able to conceive. I doubt you'd ever get the doctors to cop to any of that.

SCULLY: What doctors?

DUFFY HASKELL: We've been through three sets. They're all in on it. They're all in cahoots.

SCULLY: So you're... saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife?

DUFFY HASKELL: And stole the alien baby. That ultrasound is proof.

(SCULLY looks at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: Do you, uh... have all the information and numbers and a way that we can reach Mr. Haskell?

(DOGGETT nods and holds up a notepad. SCULLY turns back to DUFFY HASKELL.)

SCULLY: Uh, we'll be in touch.

DUFFY HASKELL: Thank you. Thank you very much.

(DUFFY HASKELL leaves. SCULLY turns to DOGGETT. She is not pleased.)

SCULLY: Thank you, Agent Doggett. I'm sure the rest of my afternoon can't possibly be so amusing.

DOGGETT: I thought you'd find it interesting, actually.

SCULLY: Interesting? As in preposterous and outrageous?

DOGGETT: Well, unless I'm mistaken you already knew that man's story. (pause) The abduction the tests, a bout with cancer then a remission.

SCULLY: What exactly are you getting at?

DOGGETT: That's your story, Agent Scully. I'd say right down to a tee.

(SCULLY just stares at him.)

DOGGETT: I mean, except for the pregnancy. It's all right there in the X-Files.

(SCULLY silently looks over at the file cabinets, then back to the room at large. She seems angry, but quietly controlled.

SCULLY: Well, I appreciate your thoroughness, Agent Doggett, and your familiarity with the X-Files cases in those cabinets, but my personal files are my personal files. Okay?

DOGGETT: Sure, of course.

(SCULLY leaves the office with the ultrasound. DOGGETT sighs, exasperated, and tosses a pencil onto the desk. Out in the hall, SCULLY gets into the elevator and watches the doors slide shut. Camera pans around to the closed doors. The doors open again, this time on an upper floor. MULDER turns and looks at her in relieved surprise. He is wearing a suit and his FBI badge.)

MULDER: There you are. I've been looking all over for you.

(He gets into the elevator with her. SCULLY is now dressed differently and her hair is flatter. We now realize that this is a flashback. The elevator doors close again.)

SCULLY: Hi. Um, I'm sorry. I had a doctor's appointment and, um, I don't know, I guess time just got away from me.

(She is having trouble meeting his eyes. MULDER is concerned, but trying not to press too hard.)

MULDER: Is anything the matter?

SCULLY: Nothing. No, I just, uh... I went for a walk.

MULDER: Mmm. Then what's wrong?

(SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: I'm... I'm sorry I haven't told you. I don't know why I haven't. I mean, you were always there for me during my illness but, um...

(Pause. MULDER leans into her and speaks softly with a small smile.)

MULDER: Don't make me guess.

SCULLY: I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me. And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children.

(MULDER looks down as the elevator dings and the doors open into the basement. He walks out, then turns back to the elevator.)

MULDER: Scully, there's, um, there's something I haven't told you either and I hope you, uh, forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you.

SCULLY: What?

MULDER: During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you were left barren. Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab.

SCULLY: What?

(SCULLY is looking at him in shock. The elevator doors begin to close, but she puts up her hand to stop them.)

SCULLY: You found them?

MULDER: I-I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were okay.

SCULLY: I don't believe this.

MULDER: Scully, you were deathly ill, and I... I couldn't bear to give you another piece of bad news.

(SCULLY looks at him, hurt.)

SCULLY: Is that what it was? It was bad news?

MULDER: The doctor said that the ova weren't viable.

SCULLY: I want a second opinion.

(She presses the button and the doors start to close. MULDER reaches out with both hands and keeps them from closing. They look at each other. SCULLY gives a short nod, "Well?" Reluctantly, MULDER lets the doors close. The doors reopen onto the basement hallway. DOGGETT is standing there. SCULLY is standing in the elevator, lost in thought, the Zeus Genetics ultrasound in hand. We are present day again.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully? What are you doing?

SCULLY: Um, I don't know. I guess I just forgot to push the button.

(She reaches over to the panel and pushes the button. The doors start to close, but DOGGETT reaches out and holds them open.)

DOGGETT: I wasn't exactly clear on what you wanted to do about this guy Haskell. About his wife's story.

SCULLY: There's nothing to do.

(DOGGETT nods, glances down at the envelope in her hand, and allows the doors to close.)



SCENE 4
ZEUS GENETICS
GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND

(SCULLY enters what looks like a doctor's office waiting room. Housekeeper's nightmare. Everything is white, including the Macintosh flatscreen monitors on the white desk. Sofas, chairs, carpet, everything.)

SCULLY: Hello. Is anybody here?

(No one is in the front part of the office, but SCULLY goes to the door leading to the examination room area of the office. She hears voices. She knocks and opens the door and enters. The hall is as white as the rest of the office. A WOMAN sounds frightened. A MAN is trying to calm her.)

WOMAN'S VOICE: This is my baby. I have to know...

DR. LEV: Ms. Hendershot, try to stay calm. I'm doing all I can....

(SCULLY walks toward the room where she hears the voices. She peeps through the door window. DR. LEV and a NURSE are trying to calm MRS. HENDERSHOT, very pregnant. MRS. HENDERSHOT is hysterical.)

MRS. HENDERSHOT: No, listen to me. You don't know, you don't know.

DR. LEV: Just try and stay calm. There are no similarities between your baby and the others.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: How can you say that? You don't know that.

DR. LEV: Because I know both cases. Try to keep her as calm as possible. I'm going to get another doctor.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: No, no, I'm not staying here. I'm not staying here.

(MRS. HENDERSHOT is about to cry. Her voice is weak as she is probably drugged. DR. LEV starts for the door. SCULLY quickly moves away and enters another room and closes the door. She turns on the light, then turns in shock to see the walls covered in shelves containing jars of odd looking foetuses. As SCULLY steps closer to examine them, the door opens and DR. LEV enters.)

DR. LEV: Who are you? What are you doing here?

SCULLY: I'm, um, I'm here with my friend.

DR. LEV: You're here with Ms. Hendershot?

SCULLY: Yes. I'm worried about her.

DR. LEV: Ms. Hendershot is fine. But you'll have to wait up front, please. You can't be back here.

(SCULLY nods and walks out of the room. DR. LEV watches her intently as she passes him.)



SCENE 5

(SCULLY enters her apartment and locks the door. She looks up Dr. Parenti's number on her laptop address book and dials her phone. "625 Oakhurst Ave. College Park, MD 20740 240-555-0125, fax 240-555-0187.")

SEFVICE: (voice, on phone) Parenti Medical Group.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, I want to speak to Dr. Parenti, please.

SEFVICE: (voice, on phone) This is his service. I can reach him if it's an emergency.

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, it is. It's Dana Scully.

(SCULLY compares her ultrasound with the one she got from DUFFY HASKELL. They look the same. Phone clicks.)

DR. PARENTI: (on phone) Dana? What's wrong?

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm afraid.

DR. PARENTI: (on phone) Tell me what it is.

SCULLY: (on phone) I want you to look at something for me. Right away. It's an ultrasound.

DR. PARENTI: (on phone) Well, I'm not in my office right now. Can you send it over there? I'll look at it as soon as possible.

SCULLY: (on phone) I want you to compare it to mine.

DR. PARENTI: (on phone) Dana... are you going to be okay?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes. Fine, I'm... I'm okay.

DR. PARENTI: (on phone) All right, I'll get back to you, Dana.

SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you.

(As DR. PARENTI hangs up, we see that he is in the room with the jars of foetus. He walks over to a table and carefully unwraps the small body of the alien baby we saw delivered in the teaser. It is dead.)



SCENE 6

(Flashback. SCULLY, flat-haired, is sitting in DR. PARENTI's waiting room. DR. PARENTI opens the door. He is smiling.)

DR. PARENTI: Ms. Scully? Got a good report for you. I've looked at the ova you've given me and consulted with some of my colleagues. We all feel that with the proper approach we might be successful. Got a good chance to get you pregnant.

(SCULLY is overwhelmed.)

SCULLY: Oh... It's too good to be true.

DR. PARENTI: I don't want to lay odds but it's not out of the realm of possibility if we start soon.

(SCULLY looks up at him in amazement.)

SCULLY: We can start right away?

DR. PARENTI: Well, you need a father, of course. I can get you genetic counseling on finding an anonymous donor if that's what you want... unless you already have someone in mind.

SCULLY: Yeah... I, uh... I just have to figure out how to ask him.

(Present day. Floofy hair. SCULLY is sitting in DR. PARENTI's waiting room. He opens the door.)

DR. PARENTI: Dana? You want to come on back?

(She joins him in the back area of the office.)

SCULLY: What did you find?

DR. PARENTI: I looked at this ultrasound you sent me and... I don't know what I'm supposed to be seeing but it looks fine to me. As does your own ultrasound.

SCULLY: You didn't see anything strange?

DR. PARENTI: Why do you ask that?

SCULLY: I just want to be sure. I've had... complications.

DR. PARENTI: It's normal to be worried.

SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.

DR. PARENTI: You bet.

(SCULLY goes back out into the waiting room.)

DR. PARENTI: Your only concern right now is when you're going to tell the FBI. Can't keep it a secret forever, Dana. You're going to start showing soon.

(He smiles at her affectionately.)

SCULLY: Right.

(She looks cutely embarrassed as she heads on out of the office.)



SCENE 7

(X-Files office. SCULLY enters. DOGGETT is on the phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Okay, got it. Thanks.

(He hangs up.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, I just got a call from a Dr. Parenti's office. About an ultrasound you left there this morning.

(His tone is accusing. SCULLY is defensive. She heads for MULDER's desk.)

SCULLY: Dr. Parenti is my doctor.

DOGGETT: Come on, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: You don't believe me?

DOGGETT: That ultrasound is the one Duffy Haskell left here yesterday. Dr. Parenti is one of the doctors he consulted with during the course of that pregnancy.

SCULLY: Excuse me, Agent Doggett, but are you investigating me?

DOGGETT: No, I was doing a background check on Mr. And Mrs. Haskell before I dropped the case, like you asked me to do.

SCULLY: No, I didn't ask you to drop the case. I said there was nothing to do.

(She opens one of the drawers in MULDER's desk, rummages, and closes it.)

DOGGETT: Well, if there's nothing to do, then why are you investigating?

SCULLY: You are jumping to conclusions.

DOGGETT: No, I'm just trying to do my job, only it gets hard to do if the person you're working with is keeping secrets and telling lies.

SCULLY: I am not investigating these people, Agent Doggett. Parenti is my doctor. Is that so strange? Is there something about him I don't know?

DOGGETT: No. But Duffy Haskell is a piece of work. I'll tell you that much.



SCENE 8

(SKINNER's office. SCULLY and DOGGETT are there with DUFFY HASKELL. DUFFY HASKELL is frustrated and angry.)

DUFFY HASKELL: What am I being accused of? What did you call me in here for? You were going to help me.

(SKINNER is "in control." He has a file on his desk.)

SKINNER: As president of the Ohio Mutual UFO Network you sent Agent Mulder a series of very threatening letters which he passed on to me, Mr. Haskell. Something of a habit with you, sir. Writing letters... threatening letters. Isn't it?

DUFFY HASKELL: No one will believe me.

DOGGETT: You wrote a letter to a Dr. Lev saying you would kill him if he hurt your wife.

DUFFY HASKELL: Dr. Lev killed my wife. He stole the alien baby out of her womb.

DOGGETT: Well, I can't find any documentation that the two of you were even married, Mr. Haskell. Let alone any history or evidence of foul play. Dr. Lev is a serious physician, a leader in the field of birth defects. His peers hold him in the highest regard. Why would he ever kill your wife?

DUFFY HASKELL: That's why I came to you.

SKINNER: Mr. Haskell, allegations aside, it's a crime to threaten anyone.

(DUFFY HASKELL looks at SCULLY.)

DUFFY HASKELL: You believe me, don't you?

(SCULLY just looks at him.)

SKINNER: Mr. Haskell, we're sorry for your loss, but if you persist in these threats and in disseminating these stories we're going to have to enter your name in the federal system as a dangerous individual.

DUFFY HASKELL: (standing) I'm alone now because of them. They took everything from me.

(He turns and looks at SCULLY.)

DUFFY HASKELL: And there are other women out there just like Kath.

(DUFFY HASKELL leaves the office. SKINNER and DOGGETT both look at SCULLY.)

(In the hall, DUFFY HASKELL enters the elevator. He no longer seems upset or nervous. As the door close, he takes out his super-elevator proof-cell phone and dials.)

DR. LEV: (on phone, voice) Zeus Genetics, Dr. Lev speaking.

DUFFY HASKELL: (on phone) They called me back here to the FBI to poke holes in my story.

DR. LEV: (on phone) As we knew they would.

DUFFY HASKELL: (on phone) We still risk losing Hendershot.

DR. LEV: (on phone) Then it's time to let her go.

(DUFFY HASKELL hangs up. We see reflected in DR. LEV's surgical goggles the image of the alien baby. It has been thoroughly autopsied.)



SCENE 9

(SCULLY enters her apartment. It is late afternoon, and she is tired. She closes the door and rests her hand on her stomach. The camera pans back to the door. There is a knock at the door. SCULLY's hand, now in a white blouse sleeve, reaches to open it. It is MULDER. This is another flashback. They both seem a little nervous and uncomfortable with each other.)

SCULLY: Hi.

MULDER: Hi.

SCULLY: Come on in.

MULDER: Thanks.

(She closes the door behind him.)

SCULLY: Can I take your coat?

MULDER: No, I can't stay. I gotta get back to the office for a while.

SCULLY: Obviously you've had some time to think about my request.

MULDER: Um, it's... it's not something that I get asked to do every day. Um, but I am absolutely flattered.

(SCULLY looks embarrassed.)

MULDER: No, honestly.

SCULLY: Okay, if... if you're trying to politely say "no," it's okay. I, I understand.

(She avoids his eyes.)

MULDER: See what's weird is... this sounds, and this sounds really weird, I know, but I, I just wouldn't want this to come between us.

(SCULLY is devastated, but tries to cover it up.)

SCULLY: Yeah. I know... I, I understand. I do.

(Realizing that she has misunderstood, MULDER reaches out as if to stroke her cheek, but pulls back.)

MULDER: Well ... the answer is "yes."

(About 18 emotions cross SCULLY's face in four seconds. She is happy. They smile at each other. She comes into his arms and they hold each other for a moment. Things are still a little awkward as they part.)

SCULLY: Um... Well, I'll call Dr. Parenti and...

(MULDER nods, smiling.)

SCULLY: I assume that he'll want to meet you and go through the, uh, the donor procedure.

MULDER: At that part, I'm a pro.

(They both smile as he shyly leaves her apartment and closes the door. The camera pans back to SCULLY. We are once again present day, she is all in black with floofy hair, holding her stomach. There is another knock at the door. SCULLY opens it. MRS. HENDERSHOT is standing in the doorway, a look of desperation about her. She is also holding her belly.)

MRS. HENDERSHOT: My name is Mary Hendershot. My baby's in danger. So is yours.



SCENE 10

(Outside an urban diner, late night. A large manly pickup truck pulls up in front of a small four door, Taurus-like sedan. DOGGETT gets out of the pickup and enters the diner. SCULLY and SKINNER are seated at a table. DOGGETT speaks to the WAITRESS behind the counter.)

DOGGETT: Can I have some coffee-- black, please?

WAITRESS: Sure.

(DOGGETT sits at the table.)

SKINNER: Thanks for getting down here.

DOGGETT: Yeah.

(DOGGETT looks over at SCULLY, who looks back at him defensively.)

DOGGETT: You going somewhere?

SCULLY: Yes.

DOGGETT: Am I missing something here?

[CARRIK: Are you ever, buddy.]

SKINNER: Agent Doggett as Assistant Director in charge of your assignment Agent Scully has come to me and asked to take a leave of absence.

DOGGETT: (sarcastically) Hey, great. Can I ask why?

SCULLY: No.

DOGGETT: So I'm the X-Files now? Just me?

SKINNER: Agent Scully isn't quitting the FBI. She's just going away.

(DOGGETT looks over at SCULLY who avoids his eyes. He looks at SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: Thanks for getting me out of bed to give me the news.

(DOGGETT stands and looks to SCULLY again.)

DOGGETT: Drop me a line if you get a chance.

(Angrily, DOGGETT leaves the diner. SKINNER turns to SCULLY.)

SKINNER: You gotta tell him, Scully.

SCULLY: I can't.

(Outside, DOGGETT is getting ready to get into his truck. SCULLY comes out of the diner.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT closes the door of the truck and turns back to her.)

SCULLY: I want you to understand.

DOGGETT: What is it you want me to understand, Agent Scully? The secrets or the lies?

SCULLY: I told you... I'm not doing anything behind your back.

DOGGETT: You're supposed to watch my back, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: If I was putting you at risk in any way you can be sure that I wouldn't let you down. I hope you know that. I only know what you tell me.

(SCULLY sighs quietly and looks at SKINNER who has come up behind her protectively.)

SCULLY: I gotta go.

(SCULLY gets into her car. MRS. HENDERSHOT is in the passenger seat. SKINNER joins DOGGETT beside his truck as SCULLY drives away.)

DOGGETT: Who's that... In Agent Scully's car?

SKINNER: That I don't know, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT gets in his truck and drives away also.)



SCENE 11
WALDEN-FREEDMAN
ARMY RESEARCH HOSPITAL
5:01 AM

(SCULLY and MRS. HENDERSHOT are greeted by a team of four DOCTORS. Camera activity is odd and creepy, constantly circling the scene.)

DR. MIRYUM: You're Scully? Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes, Dana Scully. This is Ms. Hendershot. Mary Hendershot.

MULDER: I'm Dr. Miryum. These are the best team of obstetricians one could hope to assemble. Now you tell them what you told me.

SCULLY: Ms. Hendershot believes that she is carrying a baby that is not her own. That, by whatever means, at 40 weeks she is about to give birth to something inhuman.

FIRST ASSOCIATE: Does she have medical records?

MRS. HENDERSHOT: I can't trust my doctors.

SCULLY: She believes, and with possible good reason, that her life may be in danger. That women just like her have been murdered in childbirth.

SECOND ASSOCIATE: Why? Because it sounds insane.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: These doctors killed a friend of mine because she was on to them. Because she saw too much.

SCULLY: You should know that I'm not just here as an FBI agent.

DR. MIRYUM: Agent Scully is an MD.

FIRST ASSOCIATE: So what is it she's carrying?

SCULLY: That's why we've come to you.

DR. MIRYUM: All right. Let's get Ms. Hendershot prepped and ready.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: For what?

DR. MIRYUM: You're going to have this baby, Ms. Hendershot. Our big concern right now is you have it safely. Whatever it is in you we'll know in a few hours from now if we induce labour immediately.

(The DOCTORS escort MRS. HENDERSHOT away.)

DR. MIRYUM: How did this woman find you?

SCULLY: A man named Haskell led her to me. His pregnant wife is now dead.

(DR. MIRYUM starts after the others. SCULLY stops her.)

SCULLY: Dr. Miryum... she's not the only woman whose life is in danger.



SCENE 12

(X-Files office. DOGGETT is in the back part of the office looking at the ultrasound. He notices that another man, AGENT JOE FARAH, has entered.)

DOGGETT: Agent Farah.

(AGENT JOE FARAH turns in surprise.)

AGENT JOE FARAH: I didn't see you in here, John. What are you doing in the dark?

DOGGETT: I'm in the dark pretty much most of my time on the X-Files, Joe.

AGENT JOE FARAH: Got a little something you may want to shine a light on.

(He holds up a file.)

AGENT JOE FARAH: You had me run this guy Duffy Haskell's prints, right?

DOGGETT: I hate to say that case is closed now, Joe.

AGENT JOE FARAH: From what I found, it's been closed since 1970. When David Haskell, same prints, was buried in a Virginia cemetery-- USMC honor guard ceremony.

DOGGETT: You're kidding.

AGENT JOE FARAH: I kid you not. Looks like you got yourself a real spook.

DOGGETT: Or a snake in the grass.



SCENE 13

(Army hospital. MRS. HENDERSHOT is lying on a bed while a NURSE works on her. SCULLY stand next to the bed.)

MRS. HENDERSHOT: How long will this take?

SCULLY: Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: All my life I wanted children. But I'm afraid of what's growing in me. That it even happened.

SCULLY: You mean getting pregnant?

MRS. HENDERSHOT: I had a boyfriend. When I looked at the dates, there was no way. Now I'm sure it was an abduction. I'm sure of what's inside of me.

(SCULLY looks worried. DR. MIRYUM enters.)

DR. MIRYUM: Agent Scully... we're all set for you.



SCENE 14

(SCULLY is lying on a bed, her stomach exposed. DR. MIRYUM is preparing to conduct an ultrasound. She inserts a tape into the VCR and presses a button.)

DR. MIRYUM: You ready for this?

SCULLY: Yeah.

DR. MIRYUM: At your stage, the foetus is still only about eight centimetres, but we should still be able to get a pretty clear picture of its development.

(She moves the wand over SCULLY's belly. On the monitor, we see an image of the foetus.)

DR. MIRYUM: There it is. You see it?

SCULLY: Yeah.

DR. MIRYUM: I see two legs, two arms and hands. I see what would appear to be a healthy baby at 14 weeks.

SCULLY: Are you sure?

DR. MIRYUM: The picture doesn't lie, Agent Scully. Hard to tell, but... would you like to know the sex?

SCULLY: I just want to be certain that it's okay.

DR. MIRYUM: We could do an amnio. It's a little early, but we could do it if that's what you want.

(SCULLY nods.)



SCENE 15

(Day. Somewhere on Capitol Hill. Camera pans down over an American flag to a tall man, KNOWLE ROHRER, politician extraordinaire, getting out of a chauffeured car. DOGGETT runs up behind him.)

DOGGETT: Knowle... can I talk to you?

KNOWLE ROHRER: John, what are you doing here?

DOGGETT: Your assistant said you were going to get right back to me about this David Haskell fingerprint.

KNOWLE ROHRER: I've got a day job, John. The government gets suspicious if I work at too fast a pace.

DOGGETT: I can't wait, Knowle. Is it the same guy, or not?

(Pause as KNOWLE ROHRER looks around nervously.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: How about we take a walk? How'd you hook up with this guy, anyway?

DOGGETT: The man was in my office, Knowle. Military records show he died in 1970. What the hell's the story?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Possible He's intelligence.

DOGGETT: Doing what? Working for who?

KNOWLE ROHRER: What did he say he wanted?

DOGGETT: He wanted us to investigate the murder of his wife. He claims she was an alien abductee.

(KNOWLE ROHRER stops walking and smiles indulgently. DOGGETT is embarrassed.)

DOGGETT: Look... I don't buy this crap but if the guy's CIA he wasn't just in my office killing time.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Why go to the trouble at all?

DOGGETT: All I can think is that there must be documentation in our files of a conspiracy to hide the truth.

KNOWLE ROHRER: About what, extraterrestrials?

DOGGETT: Look, it's not my work. It's the woman I work with-- an Agent Scully.

KNOWLE ROHRER: John, there's no conspiracy. You and I go back a long time. You know I'll do anything I can for you. Just give me a little more time to find out who this Haskell guy is, okay? By the end of the day.

(KNOWLE ROHRER clasps him on the shoulder, and then walks away.)



SCENE 16

(DR. MIRYUM and a NURSE are completing an amnio procedure on SCULLY. This involves a very large bore syringe inserted into the abdomen, and fluid drawn out.)

DR. MIRYUM: I know I don't have to tell you, but you need to take it easy now after the procedure. The baby's at risk if the membrane were to rupture, all right?

SCULLY: Yeah. I just want to know. I'm anxious about the results.

DR. MIRYUM: Well, we're hoping Mrs. Hendershot will deliver in the next few hours. You're our next priority.

(DR. MIRYUM and the NURSE exit. SCULLY looks over at the VCR. The readout indicates that the machine is playing, not recording. SCULLY reaches over and stops the tape then ejects it. The label on the side indicates that it is for "Nancy Maxwell 11-20- 00." SCULLY is clearly concerned.)

(CUT TO: SCULLY enters MRS. HENDERSHOT's room. She speaks quietly and urgently.)

SCULLY: Ms. Hendershot... you have to get up.

(Both women look very weak and tired.)

SCULLY: I have to get you out of here.



SCENE 17
FBI HEADQUARTERS
8:25 PM

(SKINNER's office. DOGGETT gets out of the elevator and enters the office as SKINNER is getting ready to leave for the day.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett, what is it?

DOGGETT: Scully-- do you know where she is? How to alert her right away?

SKINNER: To what?

DOGGETT: I think she's been misled. We all have by this man,Haskell.

SKINNER: You think or you know?

DOGGETT: I can't get a straight answer on that which leads me to believe that this was a setup from the start-- that this guy Haskell came to us with his story to get Agent Scully to go wherever she's gone.

SKINNER: I can tell you that she's in a safe place, Agent Doggett. A hospital.

DOGGETT: What hospital?

(SKINNER won't answer.)

DOGGETT: Look, this involves doctors. Doctors who may have killed pregnant women. Now, a hospital could be the worst place in the world for her. Tell me where Scully is.

SKINNER: Walden-Freedman Army Hospital.

DOGGETT: Get on the phone to security there. Tell them everything I told you.



SCENE 18

(Hospital. SECURITY OFFICER answers the phone.)

SCURITY OFFICER: Security...

(SCULLY walks MRS. HENDERSHOT to an elevator and looks at her with concern.)

SCULLY: Can you do this?

(MRS. HENDERSHOT nods bravely.)

(DR. MIRYUM calls down to the SECURITY OFFICER.)

DR. MIRYUM: We've got two patients missing

(Elevator opens on SCULLY and MRS. HENDERSHOT. KNOWLES ROHRER is waiting for them with a team of men in black fatigues.).

KNOWLE ROHRER: I need you to follow us. I'm a friend of John Doggett's.

(They put MRS. HENDERSHOT into a black SUV.)

SCULLY: Who are you?

KNOWLE ROHRER: That's not important. Get in the car. We're going to get you out. Go.

(SCULLY and KNOWLE ROHRER also get into the SUV.)

SCULLY: This woman could give birth at any minute. I hope you realize that.

KNOWLE ROHRER: You're in good hands. These men are experienced field medics.

SCULLY: Where are you taking us?

KNOWLE ROHRER: We're going to get you to the closest hospital where we can make sure this kid is born safe.

(SCULLY is in pain.)

SCULLY: Oh.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Are you going to make it?

SCULLY: Yeah, I just... just had a procedure. I shouldn't even be on my feet.

(Sound of sirens. Several military vehicles with plashing lights are approaching.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: Who the hell is this? Get off this road, now.

MRS. HENDERSHOT: (labour beginning) Oh!!

SCULLY: Mrs. Hendershot?

(The military vehicles pass them. MRS. HENDERSHOT is gasping.)

MRS. HENDERSHOT: I think it's coming.

SCULLY: We have to stop this car.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Not until it's safe.

SCULLY: If you don't stop this car you could be endangering her life.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Stop the car.

(The car, headlights off, pulls off the road. The MEDICS get MRS. HENDERSHOT out of the SUV and lead her to the open back of the vehicle.)

MEDIC: Just relax, ma'am.

(SCULLY starts to go to MRS. HENDERSHOT's side. KNOWLE ROHRER physically restrains her.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

KNOWLES ROHRER: Making sure you don't hurt yourself, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I'm fine. Let go of me.

KNOWLES ROHRER: It's for your own good.

SCULLY: Who are you?

SCULLY: Ms. Hendershot...

(MRS. HENDERSHOT screams. SCULLY again tries to go to her, but KNOWLES ROHRER restrains her.)

SCULLY: Mary!

KNOWLES ROHRER: Agent Scully... we're going to have to sedate you.

SCULLY: No!

(Another MEDIC injects a syringe into SCULLY's arm. She relaxes.)

KNOWLES ROHRER: Get in the car.

SCULLY: Hey!

(Through a drugged haze, SCULLY sees the MEDICS hold up an eerily mewling deformed alien baby. She passes out.)



SCENE 19

(SCULLY groggily wakes up in a hospital room. A heart monitor is beeping. DOGGETT is sitting next to her.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: What are you doing here? What am I doing back in this place?

DOGGETT: Lie down, Agent Scully. You're not taking any more chances.

SCULLY: What happened to me?

DOGGETT: You're okay. You're fine. And your baby's fine.

(SCULLY relaxes.)

DOGGETT: But you're very, very lucky.

SCULLY: What about Ms. Hendershot?

DOGGETT: She's resting fine, too.

SCULLY: What about her baby?

DOGGETT: Six pounds, eight ounces. A boy.

SCULLY: Oh, my god. They switched it. Agent Doggett, they switched it on her.

DOGGETT: It's over, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: No, it's not. We can prove this.

DOGGETT: We can't prove anything. They say you overreacted to everything. They say you overreacted to fears you had about Ms. Hendershot's pregnancy, to the fears you had about your own.

SCULLY: They showed me a tape of another woman's womb.

DOGGETT: They say it's your baby just taped onto an old cassette.

SCULLY: Well, then who were those men?

DOGGETT: They acted off information that came from me. They say they saved your life. How can I question that, standing here?

SCULLY: It was all planned. You know that. From the moment that man walked into our office. we were used to get at Ms. Hendershot's baby. And now we are being used to cover it up. Oh, my God.

DOGGETT: At least you're okay. Why didn't you tell me?

SCULLY: I was afraid. Afraid that they'd use it against me to take me off the X-Files so that I couldn't find Mulder.

(She is on the verge of tears. DOGGETT grasps her shoulder.)

DOGGETT: I told you I'd help you. I said we'd find him.

(He leaves. SCULLY remembers.)



SCENE 20

(Flashback. SCULLY enters her dark apartment. MULDER wakes up from where he has been sleeping on her couch.)

MULDER: Scully? I must have dozed off. I was waiting for you to get back.

(He looks at her sad face.)

MULDER: It didn't take, did it?

(She doesn't correct him.)

SCULLY: I guess it was too much to hope for.

(He opens his arms for her. She walks into them and lets him hold her. She sobs.)

SCULLY: It was my last chance.

(He holds her tightly, then kisses her on the forehead. He presses his forehead against hers.)

MULDER: Never give up on a miracle.

(She kisses his cheek and neck, then embraces him again. Cut to: SCULLY still in the hospital holding her pillow. Her hand drifts down to her belly.)

[THE END]


                         THIS IS NOT HAPPENING 



SCENE 1
HELENA, MONTANA
12:58 PM

(Night. Rural area. Fog and dust suddenly blow along the highway. There is a bright white circular light in the sky moving rapidly. A young man, RICHIE SZALAY, who we last saw in 7X22 Requiem, is driving an older model car very quickly after the light. He has a cheap disposable camera that he holds up with one hand through the sunroof. He is very excited as he snaps a picture.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Bogey at 12 o'clock. Whoo! Gotcha.

(He speaks into a handheld tape recorder. He is very excited.)

RICHIE SZALAY: I have engagement of unidentified flying object on Fanning Ranch Road westbound moving like a bat out of hell.

(He looks out the window as the light swerves and turns.)

RICHIE SZALAY: 90-degree, low altitude, max-g redirect. Absolutely impossible.

(The light slows down over a field, and RICHIE SZALAY stops the car and gets out. He looks up at the spaceship in awe, speechless at the sight of the light.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Uh... I'm...

(He fumbles for his camera and tries to take a picture, but the camera doesn't work. He realizes why.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Oh, you idiot.

(Frantically, he advances the film, but in that time the ship sinks below the hill a few yards away.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Oh, this is not happening.

(Light coming from behind the hill is eerily similar to what MULDER and SCULLY saw in the Pilot episode. Camera ready, RICHIE SZALAY runs to the top of the hill, but as he gets there, the ship nears the ground and then disappears.)

RICHIE SZALAY: This is not happening! (kicks the ground) Shoot!

(He sees a WHITE-HAIRED MAN standing in the field below the hill.)

RICHIE SZALAY: (yelling) Hey! Hey!

(The WHITE-HAIRED MAN begins running. RICHIE SZALAY runs after him.)

RICHIE SZALAY: I come in peace.

(RICHIE SZALAY trips and falls. He looks back in horror at what tripped him.)

RICHIE SZALAY: (weakly) This is not happening.

(We see that he tripped over a human body. We can't see the face, but dark hair curls against the person's face. The person is not moving.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 2

(X-Files office. DOGGETT is alone. He opens MULDER's desk drawer and takes out the "Fox Mulder" nameplate and contemplates it. He quickly puts it away again when he hears someone coming down the hall. SCULLY enters. She seems a little breathless.)

SCULLY: Hi.

DOGGETT: Hi.

SCULLY: You said on the phone you'd received something urgent.

DOGGETT: You're right, I did. And I think it's really important you got right down here, Agent Scully. Thanks.

(SCULLY looks at him, nervous.)

SCULLY: You going to tell me what it is?

DOGGETT: I passed it on to A.D. Skinner. I'd like for him to tell you.

(Upstairs, we see SKINNER peering out of the blinds in his ASSISTANT's office. He sees SCULLY and DOGGETT coming down the hall.)

SKINNER: Here they are.

SKINNER'S ASSISTANT: Do you need me to ask Agent Scully about her travel plans?

SKINNER: No. She'll be flying with us.

(SCULLY and DOGGETT enter the office. SCULLY steps toward him. SKINNER is dreading the coming conversation and case.)

SCULLY: What? What is it?

SKINNER: Let's go into my office.

(SCULLY leads the three of them into SKINNER's office and he closes the door. This is all torture for SCULLY.)

SCULLY: All right, what's going on here?

SKINNER: A report came in last night from Montana. About a UFO encounter.

SCULLY: What kind of encounter?

SKINNER: A young man chased a bright object flying low across the sky. Tracked it all the way to a big field where the UFO disappeared  but where he claimed he saw an alien.

(DOGGETT looks away.)

SCULLY: Assistant Director, I've got drawers full of reports that begin just like that. Are you going to tell me what's so important about this case?

SKINNER: Young man's named Richie Szalay. UFO nut from Bellefleur, Oregon. You and Agent Mulder met him out there last spring.

(Pause. SCULLY looks at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: (voice breaking) Are you trying to tell me this has something to do with Mulder?

DOGGETT: He's trying to tell you that it might.

SKINNER: Richie Szalay didn't find an alien last night. He found a woman. A woman whose name you will remember-- Teresa Hoese.

SCULLY: Teresa Hoese was the young mother who was abducted the night before Agent Mulder was.

SKINNER: And who was returned last night.

SCULLY: Returned?

(SKINNER and DOGGETT glance at each other.)

SKINNER: Hanging onto life by a thread.

(SCULLY stares at him.)



SCENE 3
ST. JEAN HOSPITAL
HELENA, MONTANA

(SKINNER, SCULLY and DOGGETT enter a hospital. A young man, DR. DESAI comes to meet them.)

DR. DESAI: Who, who is Mr. Skinner?

SKINNER: I'm Skinner. You Dr. Desai?

DR. DESAI: I was just told you were on your way. That you flew out here all the way here from Washington, DC.

SKINNER: Yeah, we're here to see Teresa Hoese.

DR. DESAI: I know. I just wish someone would tell me these things because this woman is in no condition...

SCULLY: What is her condition?

DR. DESAI: She's circling the drain. 12 years, I have never seen anything near this level of mistreatment.

DOGGETT: Doctor, it's important we see the victim and talk to her if we can about what happened.

DR. DESAI: Just promise me, whoever did this, you guys will do everything in your power to catch them.

(DR. DESAI leads them into an intensive care room.)

DR. DESAI: By rights, this young woman shouldn't even be alive.

(TERESA HOESE is lying unconscious on the bed hooked up to various wires and tubes. There are three bruised scars on each of her cheeks. SCULLY is controlled but pale and upset throughout the scene.)

DR. DESAI: The medics said she asked for her baby last night but she hasn't said a word otherwise. I suspect it's all she's holding on to. What's upsetting is... it's almost like someone was experimenting on her.

SKINNER: What exactly did they do to her?

DR. DESAI: Inside her cheeks there's tissue damage in a linear pattern. Her chest was cut into and organ tissue in her abdomen's scooped away. In the x-rays I see damage to the soft palate.

SCULLY: (avoiding his eyes, hand over her mouth) In the x-rays, did you see, um... anything else? Foreign objects.

DR. DESAI: I'm not sure what you mean.

SCULLY: Little pieces of metal. Implants.

DR. DESAI: No, I didn't.

(The door opens again and a UNIFORMED COP and his partner enter.)

UNIFORMED COP: There was an Agent Doggett requesting a police report.

(DOGGETT takes a file from the COP and glances through it. He looks back up at SCULLY and SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: You're welcome to stay here and discuss foreign objects but... looks like we got a suspect.



SCENE 4

(RICHIE SZALAY's motel room. He is watching a documentary on UFO sightings. On the screen is an article form the Stars and Stripes, the US Army newspaper. There is a knock at the door.)

TV DOCUMENTARY: U.S. pilots patrolling German airspace...

DOGGETT: (outside) Richie Szalay?

RICHIE SZALAY: Yeah?

TV DOCUMENTARY: ...Describing highly manoeuvrable balls of light, which they referred to as "foo fighters..."

(RICHIE SZALAY turns down the volume and looks through the peephole on the side of the doorknob. He is startled as DOGGETT opens the door and enters the room, followed by SCULLY and SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: Richie?

RICHIE SZALAY: Yeah.

DOGGETT: John Doggett. I'm an FBI Agent. This is Agent Scully, Assistant Director Skinner, our boss. You mind if we come in?

(DOGGETT steps into the room.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Dude, you're, you're already in.

(He sees SCULLY pass him.)

RICHIE SZALAY: But, I, I know you. Do I know you?

SCULLY: You do... Richie. From Oregon. We met late last spring, you remember?

(They look at each other for a moment, sharing something.)

SKINNER: Richie, if you live in Oregon... what are you doing in Montana?

RICHIE SZALAY: My buddy, Gary, right? He was abducted. (looks at SCULLY) Right before your partner. I, I came looking for him.

(DOGGETT is looking at lots of pictures of UFOs taped to the wall.)

DOGGETT: So, you just came out here on a lark?

RICHIE SZALAY: No. I was following the news.

DOGGETT: The news?

RICHIE SZALAY: (pointing at the pictures on the wall) All, all that's in the last two weeks. Yeah, I go on these Internet chat rooms to talk about sightings and junk. After Oregon there wasn't a whole lot but then all of a sudden in Montana... (his voice cracks) I, I never... I, I never thought I'd find Mrs. Hoese like that. Not in a million years.

DOGGETT: Richie, when you found that woman's body you said you saw somebody with her. You told the police it was an alien. You know what a moulage casting is, Richie?

(RICHIE SZALAY shakes his head.)

DOGGETT: (harshly) It's what the cops take when they find shoe prints. They do these plaster castings and the ones they got from the field that night were from 9½ Nikes. You ever hear of an alien in Nikes?

RICHIE SZALAY: Doesn't mean it wasn't.

DOGGETT: Did it ever occur to you that it wasn't an alien but a man?

RICHIE SZALAY: Then what about his spaceship?

(DOGGETT looks at SCULLY who is looking at RICHIE SZALAY. DOGGETT leaves the room. SCULLY follows him.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett? What was that in there?

DOGGETT: That was pressing a witness to get to the truth.

SCULLY: You refuse to believe that anything other than a man could have done this. Could have done what we saw to that woman in the hospital.

DOGGETT: It's not worth arguing about. The point here is to find Mulder.

SCULLY: And for months, we have been looking for a break, which is what we've got here.

DOGGETT: What we've got is hope. But let's be honest, Agent Scully, about what no one wants to say.

(She looks at him questioningly.)

DOGGETT: Bad as you want to find Mulder, you're afraid to find him, too.

(He walks away from her. She looks as if a knife has been twisted in her gut.)



SCENE 5

(Unknown location. Lights come on in a nasty, dark room. MULDER is lying on the same chair/table thing we saw in Within/Without. Blood drips from his impaled wrists and feet. Each side of his face is held in three clamps. He is unconscious and very pale. In her hotel room, SCULLY wakes up, gasping.)

(Short time later. Knock at a door. SKINNER, in a white t-shirt answers. SCULLY, dressed all in black, stands shivering in the doorway.)

SCULLY: (weakly) What if he's dead?

(SKINNER doesn't know what to say. SCULLY is embarrassed.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry. I just had a bad dream.

SKINNER: Let me get some clothes on.

(SCULLY nods as he closes the door. He joins her out in the chilly parking lot. The stars are bright overhead. Musical score is a sad version of Scully's theme.)

SCULLY: I once had a talk with Mulder about starlight. How it's billions of years old.

(They look up at the stars.)

SCULLY: Stars that are now long dead whose light is still traveling through time. It won't die, that light.

(SKINNER watches SCULLY watch the stars.)

SCULLY: Maybe that's the only thing that never does. He said that's where souls reside. I hope he's right.

(Long pause. He puts his arm around her shoulders.)

SKINNER: If you're trying to prepare yourself I want you to stop. Nothing says that we're going to stumble over him in some field. Nothing says he won't be fine.

(SCULLY nods. Then her face falls and she turns into his chest and sobs quietly. He holds her and stokes her hair gently.)



SCENE 6
ST. JEANS HOSPITAL
11:48 PM

(A MAN, JEREMIAH SMITH, enters the intensive care ward. The NIGHT NURSE looks up from her station.)

NIGHT NURSE: May I help you, sir?

(The MAN now looks like DR. DESAI. His speech is unsure, his expression hesitant.)

DR. DESAI: Yes, I want to have a patient transferred. Teresa Hoese.

NIGHT NURSE: To be transferred?

DR. DESAI: To another facility. I'd like to get her ready as soon as we can.

NIGHT NURSE: Okay.

(The NURSE thinks this is an odd request, but goes off to comply with his order. Camera pans down to show that DR. DESAI is wearing what look like size 9 ½ Nike athletic shoes.)



SCENE 7

(Next morning. SCULLY, still fully clothed, wakes up lying sideways on her hotel mattress. She answers the ringing phone.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah?  Hold on.  Who took her?  Well, has anybody talked to the doctor and asked him why? Or where?  Well, where's Agent Doggett now?



SCENE 8

(SKINNER and SCULLY arrive at the field location in a silver Montana Taurus rental car, 2P-312LT. SCULLY gets out of the passenger side and goes to DOGGETT who has been waiting for them.)

SCULLY: Did you find her?

DOGGETT: No.

SCULLY: No? I don't understand. You called us all the way out here.

DOGGETT: To get another point of view.

SCULLY: Another point of view? We have a patient missing, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: You should just hear her out.

SCULLY: Hear who out?

(They all look up at a tall, dark-haired woman standing on top of the hill that we saw in the teaser. Her back is to us.)

DOGGETT: Her name's Monica Reyes. I worked a case with her once.

(The three begin walk up the hill toward the new woman who is dressed all in black. SCULLY is sceptical.)

SKINNER: She's FBI?

DOGGETT: Yeah. She's got some expertise I thought we might take advantage of.

SCULLY: Expertise in what?

DOGGETT: She's got her master's in religious studies. Her specialization is ritualistic crime.

SCULLY: Ritualistic crime? Are we working the same case here?

(DOGGETT smiles and laughs briefly at her. They join REYES. DOGGETT is pleased to see her.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes.

(REYES tosses something small to the ground and turns to face them. She is a couple of inches shorter than DOGGETT, and has an open inviting smile. She's a little nervous.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director Skinner, Agent Scully... Monica Reyes.

(Smoke comes out of her mouth. It isn't that cold. She gives a small wave and a grin.)

REYES: Hi.

(SKINNER and SCULLY stare silently at her. Their reaction does not help her nervousness. She keeps smiling.)

REYES: Beautiful country out here.

(She turns and walks over to the object that she tossed to the ground and steps on it. It is a smouldering cigarette. Embarrassed. She turns back to SCULLY and SKINNER. She keeps her arms crossed on her chest.)

REYES: I know it's not very FBI of me, but I'm really trying to quit.

(SCULLY and SKINNER both nod, still not smiling.)

REYES: So, Agent Doggett's been taking me through the case. Interesting.

SCULLY: Interesting?

REYES: What do you think happened?

(SKINNER looks at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Isn't that what you're here to tell us?

REYES: Oh, I have my own thoughts. It's just, what we think happened and what actually happened aren't always the same thing but not altogether insignificant, either.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, this feels like therapy.

REYES: What happened being different from what we want to have happened.

SCULLY: What "who" wants to have happened?

REYES: Well, I'm told this case involves you.

(SCULLY is very defensive.)

SCULLY: It may involve someone close to me. Can we stick to the facts, please?

REYES: Well, it's pretty clear that the woman who was found out here did not inflict her own injuries. That she was dropped here by someone and whoever it was cared about her enough not to kill her.

SCULLY: Did you happen to know the peculiar nature of her injuries?

REYES: Yes. They were peculiar, but not altogether different from your typical cult ritualistic abuse.

SKINNER: Agent Reyes, we're dealing with abductions here... not by any cult.

REYES: Okay. Good. I mean, if it's not.

SCULLY: But you think that it is.

REYES: Well, I go on what I know, of course but I try to stay, you know, open.

SCULLY: So, what do you think happened?

REYES: Well, I'm told that Agent Mulder and the other people who were taken were true believers. People 100% convinced in the abduction phenomenon.

SKINNER: If this is about these people staging their own abductions...

REYES: No, it's about people coming together. Like minds as a group.

SCULLY: So you're basically saying that Agent Mulder has joined some sort of UFO cult.

REYES: Call it a group.

SKINNER: For what?

REYES: Well, we've all heard the news stories about transport to a mothership, the idea of a giant motherwheel. The whole Heaven's Gate thing.

(SCULLY is not convinced.)

SCULLY: I see.

DOGGETT: It'd make sense. The leader of the cult leaves this woman out here to die. Learning she's still alive he comes back to kidnap her again for fear of exposure. It'd make sense, too that if we find this guy, maybe we find Mulder.

SCULLY: Are you asking me to believe this?

REYES: No. That's not what I said. I don't think he left her to die. I don't think she's dead.

SCULLY: Based on what?

REYES: Nothing, really. It's just a feeling.

(SCULLY walks away from the others. DOGGETT follows her. REYES smiles at SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: What are you walking away for? It makes some kind of sense.

SCULLY: I'm glad you agree with her, Agent Doggett, because I'm not even sure that she agrees with you. Nor has she made any sense for me of how the doctor who removed Teresa Hoese from the hospital last night seems, by all accounts to have been in two places at once.

DOGGETT: I know where you're going with this, Agent Scully but if you're going to tell me this is another alien bounty hunter this is where we part company.

(SCULLY considers.)

SCULLY: Enjoy your new company.

(She walks away from him.)



SCENE 9

(Ranch compound of buildings. A sensitive looking blonde man, 30s, ABSALOM, enters a building with some others..)

ABSALOM: How is she?

(The gentle-looking WHITE-HAIRED MAN from the teaser is wiping the brow of the bed-ridden TERESA HOESE. We see that it is JEREMIAH SMITH, the alien healer from the Season 3-4 series.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: We were almost too late.

(JEREMIAH SMITH has a look of concentration on his face. As ABSALOM looks on in awe, JEREMIAH SMITH places his hand on TERESA HOESE's forehead. His expression is one of love and devotion. He then removes his hand. The scars on her cheeks and eyes, and we can assume, the rest of her body, fade. She now looks like a normal healthy sleeping woman. JEREMIAH SMITH looks at ABSALOM who smiles through his tears..)



SCENE 10

(Hospital. SCULLY is walking down the hall, but pauses near the door of a room where REYES is looking at x-ray images.)

REYES: Oh, hi.

SCULLY: I thought you'd be out combing the hills with Agent Doggett.

REYES: I'm on my way out to see him. I just wanted to see film on this woman's injuries-- Teresa Hoese.

(SCULLY closes the door. She is sceptical.)

SCULLY: Is there something you're looking for, Agent Reyes in particular?

REYES: Implants, or signs of them.

SCULLY: Implants? I don't understand.

REYES: Metallic implants. Placed in the body, oftentimes in the nasal cavity. Sometimes made of bone or cartilage making detection a little more difficult.

SCULLY: Yeah, I'm well aware of how they work.

REYES: You said you didn't understand.

SCULLY: I don't understand your interest in what is commonly considered evidence of alien abduction as a disbeliever in that phenomena.

REYES: I'm not a disbeliever.

SCULLY: Excuse me. I, I, uh, I'm very confused. I know what I heard and I heard you say that what we're dealing with here is nothing more than a UFO cult.

REYES: There's the confusion. I still believe that but it doesn't mean I don't believe in the phenomena.

SCULLY: You believe in extraterrestrials?

REYES: (small laugh) Let's just say I don't not believe. As I said, I try to stay open.

(As REYES crosses to another part of the room to look at a photo, SCULLY considers what has been said.)

SCULLY: What is it you specialize in again? Ritualistic crime?

REYES: Right. Satanic ritual abuse. Or, I should say claims of it. We never found any hard evidence.

SCULLY: We should talk sometime.

REYES: Not that I don't believe in it. I was something of a black sheep in the field office in New Orleans  because of my beliefs.

SCULLY: And what beliefs are those?

REYES: I just have certain spiritual notions. I believe there are energies in the universe. It might sound kind of cosmic but I think I'm sensitive to them. I mean, I get these feelings.

SCULLY: And do you have any feelings about Agent Mulder?

REYES: I don't know Agent Mulder. And I don't have any feelings about him. But I am feeling your fear. And fear's not going to help you find him or anyone else. Maybe you can try and stay open, too.

(SCULLY nods softly. As REYES walks away from her, we do see SCULLY's fear.)



SCENE 11

(Night along a highway. REYES is alone in her car. She looks jittery. She looks at the pack of Morley Light cigarettes on the notepad on the seat beside her. She looks away, then picks up the pack and puts a cigarette in her mouth. Suddenly all of the dashboard lights go out and the car engine dies at 7:36PM. Then it comes back on. 7:36PM. She looks up and sees a bright light traveling quickly through the night sky. Awed, she takes the cigarette out of her mouth.)

REYES: No frickin' way.

(She turns the car around and follows the light. Some distance away, the light nears the ground, then vanishes. A pickup truck arrives. ABSALOM and JEREMIAH SMITH get out. A MAN's body is lying on the ground. ABSALOM and JEREMIAH SMITH go to pick it up.)

ABSALOM: One, two, three, up.

(As they cover the MAN's body with a blanket and load him into the bed of the truck, REYES pulls up and gets out of her car, gun drawn.)

REYES: Stop there! I'm a Federal Agent!

(ABSALOM and JEREMIAH SMITH quickly get into the truck and drive away. REYES has lost them. She turns and starts walking back to her car, but stops when she sees another body lying in the field.)



SCENE 12

(SCULLY is preparing to autopsy the body that REYES found in the field. It is a young male. SKINNER and DOGGETT observe.)

SCULLY: (speaking with difficulty into recorder) Examination of victim, Gary Edward Cory, reveals cuts and abrasions from ligature or binding devices accompanied by distal and proximal bruising radiating in a symmetrical pattern around the ankles, the wrists... and the face.

(The door to the examination. room enters and RICHIE SZALAY enters with a POLICEMAN. He stares at the body in shock.)

RICHIE SZALAY: Oh, my god, Gary.

SCULLY: You can go now, Richie. They just need you to sign a form.

(RICHIE SZALAY looks sadly at his friend, and stumbles out of the room. He has lost his best friend. SCULLY begins to cry silently.)

SKINNER: Dana...

SCULLY: I'm okay. There's work to do here.

(SKINNER and DOGGETT leave the room. Later, DOGGETT is sitting on a chair in the waiting room. REYES joins him.)

REYES: You're hurting for her, I know.

(DOGGETT looks up at her.)

REYES: Agent Scully.

DOGGETT: I don't know how she's doing it in there. With everything she's feeling. What she's afraid of.

REYES: You know all too well.

DOGGETT: Let's leave the past in the past.

REYES: (gently) It was your fear, too. Those three days we looked for your son. The fear of finding what we did.

(DOGGETT is uncomfortable.)

REYES: I understand. That's why you're so determined to find Mulder alive.

DOGGETT: It's why I can't stand here and listen to all this mumbo jumbo about spaceships.

REYES: I saw what I saw, John. I'm not going to lie to you. But whatever it was, it led to this. It's the man I saw in the field.

(She shows him a colour photo of the man, ABSALOM. The sheet contains statistics about him.)

REYES: He goes by the name Absalom. A religious zealot who escaped a shoot-out in Idaho. Where he was the nominal leader of a doomsday cult who believed aliens would take over the world at the millennium. Disgraced when they didn't, he fled and tried a more ecumenical scam: credit card fraud. I ran the plate on the pickup truck. It's registered to a farm about an hour from here.



SCENE 13

(Outside the farm compound. JEREMIAH SMITH arrives in the truck and comes up to a group of people getting soup from a common pot over an outdoor fire.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: Get everyone inside.

ABSALOM: What? What is it?

JEREMIAH SMITH: They're coming.

ABSALOM: Who? Who's coming?

JEREMIAH SMITH: You can't let them find him.

(Flashlights are seen as the Federal Agents move in.)

MALE VOICE: Federal Agents! Nobody move!

(The members of the compound begin running, yelling and screaming.)

MALE VOICE: Hands on your heads!

(SCULLY and SKINNER follow DOGGETT into the compound.)

DOGGETT: (on megaphone) FBI! Please remain calm! We have a warrant to search the premises. You are surrounded by law officers who are armed, and prepared to shoot, if necessary.

(SKINNER follows and stops ABSALOM.)

SKINNER: Stop there! Hands on your head. Turn around so I can see you.

(ABSALOM surrenders. The other agents raid the rest of the compound. Much screaming and confusion.)

MALE VOICES: Move! Move! Go on! Move! Move! On the ground now! FBI! Don't move!

REYES: Please don't panic. You are in no danger if you stay calm and where we can see you.

(She looks up at a rafter and sees a video camera.)

(SCULLY enters an area that is draped in plastic sheets. Very medical looking. She stops moving when she sees TERESA HOESE, completely healed, blinking in the bright search lights.)

SCULLY: Teresa.

(REYES arrives in the room and sees SCULLY.)

REYES: Agent Scully...

(REYES goes silent when she sees TERESA HOESE.)

SCULLY: You better get AD Skinner in to see this. And Agent Doggett.

(Later. SCULLY and DOGGETT are interviewing ABSALOM.)

ABSALOM: I said I can't explain why it happens. Or how. Only where.

DOGGETT: I got 46... of your followers rounded up out there at your compound. You make me go to them for a straight answer it's only going to make it worse for you.

ABSALOM: How many times can I tell you?

DOGGETT: Night's early. Coffee's hot.

ABSALOM: The ships come in, drop the abductees all messed up. I go and get them so I can help them.

DOGGETT: Just like you helped Teresa Hoese when you left her for dead?

SCULLY: (gently) Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT backs off. SCULLY crosses to ABSALOM.)

SCULLY: You, uh... you say that these abductees are returned with severe injuries. But that doesn't fit the pattern of any alien abduction model.

ABSALOM: That's what I'm trying to explain. I predicted there would be an alien invasion at the Millennium. I was right, it turns out. 'Cause that's when this all started.

(SKINNER and REYES are watching them from another room.)

SCULLY: Sir... given the criminal charges against you, you couldn't be a less credible witness so stop trying to validate your theories and just give us the truth.

ABSALOM: I'm telling you the truth. I only want to help these people.

SCULLY: So these video cameras that you have around your compound-- how do they help?

(We see a stack of videos.)

ABSALOM: Abductees... live in fear of being taken again. The cameras give them a sense of security.

DOGGETT: Or makes them afraid to leave.

(ABSALOM looks away from DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: Do you have videotape of how you happened to heal Teresa Hoese?

ABSALOM: No.

SCULLY: (whisper) I asked you to give me the truth.

(SCULLY walks slowly toward him taking a folded piece of paper form her pocket.)

SCULLY: (weakly) Do you have videotape of this man?

(She hands him a copy of MULDER's new ID photo. ABSALOM looks at it for a long moment, then shakes his head. SCULLY has tears in her eyes. DOGGETT looks at her, then back at SKINNER and REYES.)

SKINNER: He's hiding something.

REYES: Yeah, that's for sure.



SCENE 14

(SCULLY enters her dark motel room and flicks the light switch. No light. Frustrated, she flicks it up and down a few times and looks into the room. She freezes. MULDER is standing in front of the window. There is a blue-light ethereal quality to him. He says nothing, just looks at her. She stares back at him.)

REYES: Agent Scully?

(SCULLY turns and sees REYES in the doorway. When she turns back to the window, there is no one there,)

REYES: What?

(SCULLY runs to the closed window. Nothing.)

REYES: What is it?

SCULLY: (wistfully) I saw him.

(SCULLY's wall comes up. She turns to REYES, calm and collected.)

SCULLY: I saw something.

(Not understanding completely, REYES looks at her in confusion.)



SCENE 15

(Video room. REYES is showing SKINNER, SCULLY, and DOGGETT footage from the compound.)

REYES: I reviewed these tapes from the compound. There are some things here I want you all to see.

(Part of the video shows JEREMIAH SMITH and ABSALOM loading a body into the back of a pickup.)

SKINNER: They've got a body in there.

SCULLY: Who is it?

REYES: You can't tell from this angle.

SCULLY: Well, then where's another angle?

REYES: This is the only angle I could find.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. Stop it.

(SCULLY looks closely at a frame that shows JEREMIAH SMITH walking around the truck.)

SCULLY: That man. I know that man.

REYES: Good, because here he is again.

(REYES advances the film showing us JEREMIAH SMITH entering one of the buildings in the compound.)

SKINNER: Who is he?

SCULLY: His name is Jeremiah Smith. Agent Mulder knew him. He believed that he had the ability to heal people.

DOGGETT: What do you mean, "heal people"?

SCULLY: Like he did Teresa Hoese.

REYES: Well, whoever he is take a look at this.

(On the tape, JEREMIAH SMITH enters a building. He passes through a shadow, and when he comes out he looks like AGENT DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: What the hell just happened?

REYES: That's what I'd like to know.

SCULLY: Wow. That's still Jeremiah Smith.

DOGGETT: The hell it was. That's me, and I never even went in that building.

SCULLY: Exactly. We have to get back out there.

(SCULLY leaves the room.)



SCENE 16

(SKINNER, SCULLY, DOGGETT, and REYES enter the compound. A GUARD stops them.)

GUARD: Halt. Identify yourself.

SCULLY: (getting out of the car) We're looking for someone. A man who may be one of the detainees.

SKINNER: We need some bodies out here to help search the woods.

(They enter one of the buildings. A group of people are standing near the door.)

SCULLY: FBI. Where is he? Jeremiah Smith.

(No one answers.)

SCULLY: Look, I know he's here. Jeremiah Smith. I need to speak with him.

(She sees a young man standing in the back of the group.)

SCULLY: You-- in the back. Step out.

(The YOUNG MAN hesitantly steps forward.)

SCULLY: Come with me.

(He follows her into a room. REYES is watching.)

SCULLY: Take a seat.

(He does.)

SCULLY: Are you Jeremiah Smith?

YOUNG MAN: No, I...

SCULLY: Did you heal these people?

YOUNG MAN: No.

SCULLY: Did you heal Teresa Hoese?

(He starts to get up, but SCULLY stops him.)

SCULLY: Look, I know who you are.

(Someone knocks at the door.)

REYES: Agent Scully.

(The door opens. REYES looks in.)

REYES: I'll be right outside.

(She exits and closes the door. SCULLY turns back and gasps when she sees that the YOUNG MAN has become JEREMIAH SMITH.)

JEREMIAH SMITH: You're going to expose me. You're putting people in danger-- Abductees all over the country. I save them. I'm the only one.

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

JEREMIAH SMITH: You came crashing in here. I was trying to help him, too.

SCULLY: Where is Mulder?

(She gasps again as the door opens.)

SKINNER: You'd better come with us.

(SKINNER is sad. Breathing heavily, SCULLY looks back at JEREMIAH SMITH. He is now ABSALOM and looking very frightened.)

ABSALOM: You must protect me.

(SCULLY goes to SKINNER and REYES.)

SCULLY: What is it?

SKINNER: It's Mulder.

(Field. There is a group of AGENTS standing around a body. SCULLY, accompanied by SKINNER come running up. DOGGETT intercepts SCULLY and physically restrains her from going to the body.)

SCULLY: Where is he?

(She is breathing rapidly.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, he's over there.

SCULLY: How bad is he?

(She struggles in DOGGETT's arms.)

SCULLY: How bad is he?

(DOGGETT still restrains her.)

SCULLY: How bad is he hurt?

(She breaks free and runs to MULDER's side. She kneels down beside him. He is covered in a blanket. His cheeks are horribly scarred and bruised. She gently touches his face.) SCULLY: (hysterical) No. No. No. No. He needs help.

(DOGGETT pulls her away form MULDER's body. SCULLY is hysterical.)

DOGGETT: It's too late.

SCULLY: He needs help!

(She breaks away from him.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

(SCULLY runs as fast as she can through the woods back to the compound. As she gets there, she pauses in shock at the sight of a brightly lit object over the compound. SCULLY sees a UFO. She runs toward the building. Too late. As she and the other members of the compound watch, glass shatters and the light disappears. JEREMIAH SMITH is gone. His room is empty.)

SCULLY: Jeremiah.

(SCULLY falls to her knees.)

SCULLY: No... no. This is not happening!

(She screams to anyone who will listen.)

SCULLY: No!

                                  DEADALIVE


SCENE 1

ANNOUNCER (CHRIS CARTER): Previously on The X Files:

(Scenes are from the previous episode, This is Not Happening {8x14})

(SCULLY and DOGGETT are interviewing ABSALOM.)

ABSALOM: Their ships come in, drop the abductees. I go and get them so I can help them.

(Scenes of the spaceship, abductees being returned and TERESA being healed instantly.)

REYES: (voiceover) He goes by the name Absalom-- the nominal leader of a doomsday cult who believed aliens would take over the world at the Millennium.

(FBI raids the complex.)

SCULLY: Where's Mulder?

ABSALOM: When you came crashing in here I was trying to help him, too.

(SCULLY falls to her knees beside MULDER's lifeless scarred body in the field surrounded by other agents.)

SCULLY: No... no  (screams) No...!!!!!



SCENE 2
RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA

(Old snow covered cemetery. [Ummm  CarriK lives in North Carolina and doesn't remember any late spring or early fall snow storms in the area this year, 2000-2001.] A minister is officiating at a closed casket graveside service. Only a few mourners are in attendance, KERSH, DOGGETT, THE LONE GUNMEN, two or three AGENT- LOOKING MEN. SCULLY stands at the grave's edge, her mother, MRS. SCULLY and SKINNER standing on either side of her.)

MINISTER: Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. We are here to deliver the body of Fox Mulder to its resting place. We pray to God to deliver his soul and to resolve the deep mysteries Fox Mulder sought so tirelessly to uncover. Let us pray now for his eternal peace.

(Camera closes in on SCULLY. She is dressed all in black, holding a white handkerchief. Her eyes are closed, her hands clutch her belly.)

MINISTER: "'I am the resurrection and the life,' saith the Lord; he that believeth in me, though he were dead yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.'"

(SCULLY opens her eyes and takes a breath.)

(Short time later, the FUNERAL DIRECTOR starts the motor that lowers the coffin into the grave. He and the MINISTER leave quietly. SCULLY and SKINNER are the only ones left at the grave.)

SCULLY: He was the last. His father and mother... his sister... all gone. I think the real tragedy... is that for all of his pain and searching... the truth that he worked so hard to find was never truly revealed to him.

(SKINNER looks down at her, listening.)

SCULLY: (her voice begins to break) I can't truly believe that I'm really standing here.

SKINNER: (softly) I know. And I don't truly believe that... Mulder's the last.

(SCULLY's face trembles with emotion. She kneels down and picks up a handful of dirt and crumbles it over the coffin, which is now at the bottom of the grave. She stands and turns her head into SKINNER's chest and cries silently. Her arms hang limply at her sides. He gently puts his arms around her.)



[OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS] [OPENING CREDITS]



SCENE 3
THREE MONTHS LATER

(KERSH's office. DOGGETT enters and sits down beside SKINNER in front of KERSH's desk. KERSH has a rather satisfied smirk on his face. SKINNER looks rather depressed and frustrated.)

KERSH: Smile, John. You look tense. I've asked you here to commend you.

(KERSH hands DOGGETT a letter.)

DOGGETT: What's this?

KERSH: A letter to the director citing your meritorious efforts in the recovery of Agent Fox Mulder. And a recommendation that you be considered for advancement.

(DOGGETT, uncomfortable with this honor looks to SKINNER who looks even more uncomfortable with the situation.)

DOGGETT: Sir, the Assistant Director here deserves more credit than I...

SKINNER: (tightly, avoiding eye contact) Deputy Director Kersh spoke to me at length before you came up. He thanked me and asked me to write you a letter, too.

(Pause.)

SKINNER: Officially transferring you off the X-Files to a division more suited to your talents.

(KERSH smiles at DOGGETT.)

KERSH: Man of my word, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT gives a small smile and stands.)

DOGGETT: Thank you for your support, sir. But all things being equal, I, uh... would like to give any transfer some thought.

(KERSH gives DOGGETT a warning look.)

KERSH: Fish while they're biting, John.

(DOGGETT nods his acceptance of the warning and leaves.)



SCENE 4

(X-Files office. SCULLY is standing behind a file cabinet looking through folders. The "I Want to Believe" poster is seen behind her very pregnant belly. She is wearing a classy black maternity dress-suit. Great hair. DOGGETT enters.)

DOGGETT: Hey, good morning, Agent Scully. How you feeling today?

SCULLY: I'm fine. How are you feeling?

DOGGETT: Me? Good. But then I don't got a little J. Edgar to lug around.

(DOGGETT sits at his desk and looks through a folder.)

SCULLY: A.D. Skinner just called. He told me about your meeting with Kersh.

DOGGETT: Well, whatever he told you I'm still going to be here to drive you crazy with questions and nagging doubt.

SCULLY: You'd be crazy to stay, Agent Doggett. This is a huge career opportunity for you.

DOGGETT: It's not my career he's got in mind.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

(DOGGETT looks at her belly.)

DOGGETT: In six weeks, you go on maternity leave. Kersh transfers me out, guess what? He gets to lock that door over there for good.

SCULLY: You don't owe me anything, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: They put me down here to find Mulder. I found him. So what? We still got an open file on this case and I got big questions.

(SCULLY smiles and laughs softly.)

DOGGETT: What?

SCULLY: I heard the same speech come out of my mouth seven years ago.

(She lowers herself into MULDER's chair.)

SCULLY: Get out while you can, Agent Doggett... or you may never get out at all.



SCENE 5
ATLANTIC OCEAN
OFF CAPE FEAR, NORTH CAROLINA

(Night, middle of the ocean. A fishing trawler is weathering a storm as they work to bring in a catch. The FIRST DECK HAND spots something in the water.)

FIRST DECK HAND: All stop! All stop! In the net! Get the light! Down there! Further out!

(We see that it is a bloated dead body floating on the water.)

FIRST DECK HAND: Get Coast Guard on the radio! Tell them to send a chopper out!

(In the searchlight, we see that the body is REALLY dead and bloated.)

FIRST DECK HAND: Doesn't look like there's any big reason to hurry.



SCENE 6
COUNTY MORGUE
WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA

(Autopsy bay light flicks on. The Coroner, DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ, is putting on his gloves as he enters.)

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: So, what's the deal here?

PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT: Body was found at sea. DA wants to know how it got there.

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: At 2:00 in the morning? I've once to see a DA down here in his jammies waiting for an answer.

(DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ gives a cursory visual exam of the body.)

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: I see a surgical cut or scar on the sternum, linear pattern scarring on each facial cheek. But for a certain enviable post-mortem intumescence this man is unremarkable. Short of this body sitting up and telling us what happened I'd say we've got a long night ahead.

(As DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ prepares his instruments, the PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT looks at the body. The lips move slightly, startling the ASSISTANT.)

PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT: Doctor... it moved.

(DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ smiles tolerantly.)

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: Joke's on me, right?

PATHOLOGY ASSISTANT: Its mouth... his lips... they moved...

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: Yeah, well, maybe he's trying to tell...

(DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ stops speaking as he also sees the lips of the "corpse" move.)



SCENE 7

(DOGGETT's manly bedroom. Late night. Phone rings. DOGGETT, wearing a gray t- shirt, wakes turns on the light and answers the phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah.

(SKINNER is driving in the rain.)

SKINNER: (on phone) It's Skinner. I want you to meet me at the Bureau in about 20 minutes.

DOGGETT: (on phone) For what?

SKINNER: (on phone) I got a call from the police. Pathologist down in Wilmington, North Carolina. Fishermen pulled in a dead body 50 Miles offshore which they've now ID'd as Billy Miles.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Billy Miles?

SKINNER: (on phone) Kid from Oregon. He was abducted same time Mulder was last May.

DOGGETT: (on phone) So what's the big hurry now?

SKINNER: (on phone) Now he's alive.

(Short time later. FBI parking garage. SKINNER pulls up beside DOGGETT who gets in the car. SKINNER drives.)

DOGGETT: You told Agent Scully any of what you told me?

SKINNER: No.

DOGGETT: My strong recommendation, Sir: Don't. This thing pans out or not, you're going to reopen wounds that still need a lot of healing. Not to mention the fact that she's had a difficult pregnancy. You know that as well as anybody.

SKINNER: I appreciate your concern, Agent Doggett, but I wouldn't have told her anyway. Certainly not where we're going.

DOGGETT: Where are we going?

(SKINNER looks at him, but doesn't answer.)



SCENE 8

(Still night. They pull up to a snowy graveyard and park. They get out and make their way across the cemetery.)

DOGGETT: I'll say it again. We're opening up more than a grave here.

SKINNER: I respect that, Agent Doggett, but under the circumstances I think not digging it up would be far more regrettable, don't you?

DOGGETT: No. I think this is insanity.

SKINNER: Yeah, well, personally, I couldn't live with the doubt.

DOGGETT: That what? That we buried a man alive? We found Mulder, you and me together. We saw the same body. Mulder wasn't just dead, he'd been dead for days. Had to have a closed casket. For crying out loud, the body was too far gone and that was three months ago.

(A backhoe is excavating one of the graves.)

SKINNER: The kid they pulled from the ocean, Billy Miles, from the extensive tissue necrosis, they think he could've been in the water for months. Heart beat, rate of metabolism-- it slowed to imperceptibility. I mean, the body had rigored. For all intents and purposes, he was dead. It's a fluke that the doctor even noticed.

DOGGETT: I don't believe it. I don't believe I'm even standing here.

(We see that it is MULDER's grave that is being excavated.)



SCENE 9

(Morgue. MULDER's coffin is wheeled into the examining room, followed by SKINNER and DOGGETT. DOGGETT stares in surprise at the media circus inside the room. The room is full of cameramen and reporters. The county coroner, ARTHUR GAFFIN, comes to greet them.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is this?

CORONER GAFFIN: Assistant Director Skinner?

SKINNER: Yes.

CORONER GAFFIN: Arthur Gaffin, County Coroner.

SKINNER: I asked you to keep this thing low key.

CORONER GAFFIN: Word spreads. Exhumation's big news any day of the week and you had the body moved to another county to a specific pathologist. Well, that takes people and paperwork.

SKINNER: I want these people out of here.

(DOGGETT turns to the reporters.)

DOGGETT: All right, listen up, ladies and gentlemen. As much as you're here to see the horror show I'm not letting that casket open up until we get some privacy. It's a private matter.

(The reporters leave.)

DOGGETT: Thank you.

DR. FRANCIS OROVETZ: Agent Skinner, so no one's confused, this is a completely different scenario. I'm only here 'cause you asked for me. I don't expect to find anything in this box but a dead man. It's not going to be Curse of the Mummy, okay? No claw marks on the lid of the coffin.

DOGGETT: (Softly to SKINNER) I'll say it again: insanity.

(SKINNER is nervous. The coffin is opened. SKINNER walks forward for a closer look. MULDER was buried in one of his suits, blue oxford shirt. He looks pale but well preserved, three scars on each cheek.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 10
US NAVAL HOSPITAL
ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND

(Hospital corridor. SKINNER and others are talking quietly. SCULLY enters with great urgency.)

SCULLY: Is it true?

SKINNER: Slow down.

SCULLY: No. I want to see him.

SKINNER: I know you do...

SCULLY: (frenzied) No, I need to see him, damn it!

SKINNER: You're not going in there.

(He grabs her arms, stopping her.)

SKINNER: Scully, you can't.

SCULLY: (desperate, whisper) Tell me it's true. Tell me.

(Inside the room, DOGGETT is watching the DOCTOR examine MULDER. MULDER is now hooked up to several life support machines. He doesn't look too bad, a few scars on the cheeks.)

DR. LIM: It's so improbable... and I would have said impossible before this. The clinical fact he's alive when effectively this man, his tissue and I presume his neural and vascular systems are all in a state of decomposition.

DOGGETT: What does that mean?

DR. LIM: That effectively he's dead.

(DOGGETT sighs and leaves the room, #115. SCULLY and SKINNER are waiting. SCULLY, her hand on her belly, walks toward DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: What did they say?

(DOGGETT doesn't answer. SCULLY is on the verge of tears. She looks very small.)

SCULLY: I need to see him.

DOGGETT: I know... but I wish you wouldn't.

(SCULLY looks at DOGGETT a moment, biting her bottom lip, then enters the hospital room. She closes the door and goes to her partner. Tubes are coming out of every part of his body. She rests her hand for a moment on MULDER's body, feeling his heart beat. She then leans down and, embracing him, cries softly into his chest. Beautiful bookend to MULDER's bedside vigils in One Breath and Redux 2.)



SCENE 11
FBI HEADQUARTERS
5:35 AM

(KERSH's office. KERSH is standing at the window looking at the dark city outside. DOGGETT enters the office.)

DOGGETT: You wanted to see me, sir?

KERSH: Yes, John. Please come in. I've been in this office just over six months and I haven't yet had to see a sunrise from it.

DOGGETT: (looks at his watch) I believe the sunrise isn't for another hour and six minutes, sir.

(Pause. KERSH turns for the first time and crosses to DOGGETT.)

KERSH: (softly threatening) It serves a man to have useful information, John. One never knows when he might find himself having to survive on his wits alone.

DOGGETT: Yes, sir.

KERSH: I know you look forward to a future at the FBI, John. You take your job seriously. I hope you took my job offer seriously, too.

DOGGETT: As I said, I'm thinking about it.

KERSH: I got a call about this... Mulder thing. I want you to drop it.

DOGGETT: Drop it?

KERSH: You know the tune: if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI. I'm throwing you a rope. Don't go and hang yourself with it now.



SCENE 12

(Later that morning. SCULLY enters a hospital room identical to MULDER's. Life support machines are beeping. She looks at the bloated and puffy body on the bed. She picks up the chart from the bed.

9429776 708/1
010411726 5 23124 01
BILLY MILES
078021 70 LIM/LIM
DIAGNOSIS: Acute Hypothermia

Suddenly, the monitors begin beeping rapidly. BILLY MILES body convulses. SCULLY stares at the heart monitor where she sees that it seems to be registering two heartbeats. Then everything returns to normal. The door opens and a NURSE enters.)

NURSE: Who-who are you, and what are you doing?

SCULLY: Nothing. I was just looking in on the patient and he started to go into grand mal seizure. I, uh, I-I think he's all right now. Um, it's okay. I'm, uh, sorry  (she shows her badge) ... I'm a doctor. My name is Scully, and I'm with the FBI.

NURSE: You're here to treat him?

SCULLY: No. No, I, uh... the man down the hall was my... is my partner and we knew Billy and I-I guess I was just hoping that there might be some indication that he was getting better... somehow. Anyway... um... you might want to tell the doctor about this. And, uh... and check those monitors carefully. I think I might have seen some kind of equipment malfunction.

(SCULLY slips out of the room leaving the confused NURSE to deal with the situation.)



SCENE 13

(SKINNER comes out of his office. Without warning he stumbles against the wall in pain. Two AGENTS run to help him stand.)

FEMALE AGENT (SKINNER's ASSISTANT?): Oh, a-are you all right, sir?

SKINNER: I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay, thank you.

(The AGENTS go on down the hall. SKINNER catches his breath, holding his left shoulder. Pain strikes again, then eases off. Holding his heart, he goes to the elevator. The doors open revealing everyone's favourite RatBoy, ALEX KRYCEK. He is holding the Palm Pilot of Doom in one hand. [CarriK: It seems smaller than the last time we saw it. Technological improvements to the design, I suppose.] SKINNER glares at him.)

KRYCEK: All aboard.

SKINNER: I don't know how you got in this building, Krycek, but whatever it is you want... you can go to hell.

(The doors slide shut again. Outside in the hall, SKINNER grabs his arm again as he begins to sink to the floor in pain. Inside the elevator, we see KRYCEK increase the level on the screen of the PPOD. The elevator doors open again. SKINNER is breathing heavily. KRYCEK is smirking.)

SKINNER: What do you want from me?

KRYCEK: Let's take a ride.

(Later, SKINNER and KRYCEK are in the X-Files office. KRYCEK is sitting at MULDER's desk. He takes MULDER's nameplate out of the desk drawer, glances at it and tosses it nonchalantly on the desk.)

KRYCEK: The word on the street is he's back from the dead. He's a regular Houdini.

SKINNER: Tell me what you want.

KRYCEK: What I want is to give you the chance to save Mulder's life.

(SKIINER just stares at him.)

KRYCEK: You don't believe me?

SKINNER: No, I don't.

KRYCEK: I can push a little button and send thousands of nanobots lying dormant in your bloodstream sizzling to your brain stem and all I want to do with that power is save a man's life.

SKINNER: I don't think his life can be saved.

KRYCEK: I have a vial that contains a vaccine. Mulder knows of it. His father developed it to fight the alien virus.

SKINNER: There's no vaccine can help the man I found in that grave.

KRYCEK: You found him, and you don't even know what you got.

(SKINNER turns and starts to leave the office, but then turns quickly and grabs for the PPOD lying on the desk. KRYCEK grabs it first, though and smiles at SKINNER.)

KRYCEK: It's a push of a button, Walter.

(KRYCEK leaves SKINNER alone in the office.)



SCENE 14

(BILLY MILES' hospital room. Machines are beeping. BILLY MILES opens his eyes. He removes the ventilation tube from his own mouth. Beeping speeds up as BILLY MILES stands up and walks away from the bed, putting strain on and dislodging the wires attached to him. Next shot is of BILLY MILES in the shower. We see him from the knees down. In a brand new contestant for the most disgusting scene ever on this show, we see blood beginning to flow, then huge hunks of putrid skin breaking off and sliding down onto the shower floor. CarriK does not envy the janitor who gets to clean this mess up. Although judging from the mildew buildup around the drain, janitors don't come in here very often.)



SCENE 15

(MULDER's hospital room. DOGGETT enters. SCULLY calmly looks up at him, perhaps waking up. She is sitting beside the bed, one hand holding MULDER's, the other resting on her belly. DOGGETT looks at her with pity.)

DOGGETT: You can't do this to yourself.

SCULLY: You asked me not to come in here, Agent Doggett. I hope you're not asking me to leave.

DOGGETT: Concern's for your well-being, Agent Scully. That's all it's ever for. I felt this was a bad idea from the start. I told the Assistant Director so. Worrying about the effect it might have on you.

SCULLY: You mean finding Mulder alive?

DOGGETT: I know you came in here with the doctors. I'm sure you must have asked them what his chances are.

(SCULLY lets go of MULDER's hand and stands up, stepping toward DOGGETT angrily. She speaks softly.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett... ...However I felt about you when we first met, you changed my opinion with the quality of your character and of your work. Now, I am thankful to know you and I am thankful for your concern... ...But no matter what Mulder's chances are the choice not to open up that grave was wrong. And not because of me personally but as my partner on the X-Files. Now, the truth may hurt but it's all that matters.

DOGGETT: What truth?

SCULLY: About what caused this.

(They stare at each other. The door opens and the NURSE enters.)

NURSE: You've got to come quickly! It's Billy Miles.

(SCULLY and DOGGETT follow the NURSE to the nurse's station. The NURSE points down the hall. BILLY MILES, wet and naked and confused, is slowly making his way up the corridor. He turns and sees SCULLY and DOGGETT staring at him. He looks lost.)



SCENE 16

(Hospital examination room. SCULLY and DOGGETT are questioning BILLY MILES who is now wrapped in a blanket. He is staring at the floor.)

BILLY MILES: I don't really remember all that much of anything. SCULLY: Do you have any idea what you're doing here, Billy? Do you have any conscious memory at all?

BILLY MILES: I remember water. And I remember being on the ship.

DOGGETT: You were found by a fishing boat.

SCULLY: That's not what you mean... is it, Billy? You mean... a spacecraft.

(BILLY MILES focuses on SCULLY.)

BILLY MILES: They took so many this time. But now I understand. They're here to save us. (he smiles gently)

DOGGETT: (sarcastically) Well, that's great news. I'm going to let you two talk.

(DOGGETT leaves the room. SCULLY follows him into the hall.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett... Where are you going?

DOGGETT: Back to the real world. Why?

SCULLY: You just won't believe it, will you? Not even for a minute. Not even with it staring you right in the face.

DOGGETT: Is that so important to you? What I believe or don't believe?

(SCULLY sighs.)

DOGGETT: I'm really not up to this assignment anyway as you so gently put it.

(DOGGETT starts to leave again. SCULLY's words stop him.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, you spoke with his doctors. He was lying on his deathbed.

DOGGETT: I'm with you, Agent Scully. It's a medical mystery, for sure. But don't ask me to take a load of horse crap for the gospel truth.

SCULLY: I underestimated you, Agent Doggett. I thought this was just simple... resistance to extreme possibilities... when, in fact, you're just downright bullheaded.

DOGGETT: Do you believe it, Agent Scully? I mean that stuff he said about aliens coming to save the world.

(SCULLY is not ready to answer that. DOGGETT leaves.)



SCENE 17

(SCULLY is in a hospital image viewing room. She is looking at test results on BILLY MILES. SKINNER enters.)

SKINNER: Hi.

SCULLY: Hi.

SKINNER: Nobody called me about Billy.

SCULLY: I know. I'm sorry.

SKINNER: What, this is incredible.

SCULLY: It's too incredible. Sir, there isn't a piece of medical data on him that isn't 100% normal.

SKINNER: Why are you questioning that... when it could mean that the doctors are wrong about Mulder?

SCULLY: Because it doesn't make sense. I mean, there should be blood, fluid, electrolyte imbalances. Loss of brain function, but as it is, it's like he shed his skin and literally became a new person. And I don't mean the same person.

(Pause.)

SKINNER: What are the chances this could be due to an alien influence? Could it be a virus?

SCULLY: Why are you asking me this? Sir, if you know something... look, we-we're working against the clock here. This, this could happen to Mulder. And until we know what it is we have to do everything to control it.

SKINNER: There may be a vaccine.

SCULLY: Where?

SKINNER: It doesn't come without a price.

SCULLY: This is about saving a man's life.

(SKINNER looks at her sadly.)

SKINNER: Yes. It is.



SCENE 18
FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(ABSALOM is escorted into an interrogation room. DOGGETT is waiting.)

ABSALOM: Brother... you aren't someone I expected to be... paying me a visit.

DOGGETT: How are they treating you?

ABSALOM: Treating me? Like a prophet.

DOGGETT: That's what I'm here about, your prophecies-- these preachings of yours.

ABSALOM: Oh... you misread me, is that it?

DOGGETT: I want to know about these men and woman you say you would find left for dead.

ABSALOM: You found someone yourself. Left for dead, but who's not dead?

DOGGETT: Yes.

ABSALOM: You're here to receive the word... and yet you can't bring yourself to say my name. Say it.

DOGGETT: Absalom.

ABSALOM: "I am the resurrection and the life. He who believeth in me... though he were dead, yet shall he live." Do you know the words?

DOGGETT: They're from the bible.

ABSALOM: What is the bible? Preaching... Prophecy... Misread.

DOGGETT: Look, I'm not here to debate theology. I'm here because somehow you healed these people and I want to know how you did it. I need your help.

ABSALOM: You ask for my help... But you refuse to believe in me.



SCENE 19

(SKINNER walks down the hospital corridor. He sees that the door to MULDER's hospital room is standing open. He enters and sees MULDER lying there, still unconscious. Monitors are beeping slowly. SKINNER is startled by KRYCEK who is standing in the shadows of the room.)

KRYCEK: It's hard to believe, isn't it... that Mulder could ever possibly get out of that bed?

SKINNER: I need the vaccine, Alex.

KRYCEK: Yeah? Time is wasting.

SKINNER: What do I have to do?

KRYCEK: Oh, it's simple, really. Make sure Scully doesn't come to term.

(SKINNER stares at him in shock.)

SKINNER: You're out of your mind.

KRYCEK: She can't have that baby.

(For SKINNER, there is no decision to make.)

SKINNER: No. The answer is no.

KRYCEK: We all have a life in our hands. I have yours... you have Mulder's... and Scully has her unborn child. It's who's willing to sacrifice.



SCENE 20

(DOGGETT enters the hospital and passes a leather jacket-clad KRYCEK in the hall. KRYCEK is tucking the PPOD into his pocket. DOGGETT turns and watches him leave; perhaps sensing the threat the man poses. DOGGETT then looks into MULDER's room and sees SKINNER standing beside the bed. SCULLY comes out of a room up the hall. She is looking at a chart. DOGGETT goes to her.)

(Inside MULDER's room, SKINNER looks down at MULDER. The monitors beep.)

(Up the hall, DOGGETT joins SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: Where are you going?

SCULLY: Look, I don't have time to waste debating our differences, Agent Doggett. I strongly believe that Agent Mulder is infected with a virus.

DOGGETT: A virus?

SCULLY: A virus that seems to keep the body just alive enough to take it through a transformation...

DOGGETT: Into-- let me guess-- an alien.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, I don't have time to argue.

DOGGETT: I'm not arguing, and for what it's worth that's what this guy that first found Mulder told me. This man that we put in prison Absalom?

SCULLY: He told you this was a virus?

DOGGETT: No. He said the abductees were being returned and left for dead. That if he hadn't found them and done his hocus-pocus they would've been resurrected as aliens. It was all part of some big alien takeover of the world.

(SCULLY has a Mulder-like moment of realization.)

SCULLY: That's it.

DOGGETT: What's it?

SCULLY: How Billy Miles came back so perfectly. I stood there and watched his body go into seizure just moments before this happened. On the monitor, there were two heartbeats and I told the nurse that it was just a mechanical error.

DOGGETT: You think this kid has sloughed his skin and come back as an alien?

SCULLY: And it'll happen to Mulder if we don't stop it soon.

(She starts down the hall. DOGGETT stops her.)

DOGGETT: Where are you going?

SCULLY: I need a surgical bay, a team of doctors. I have to keep Mulder's body stabilized in order to administer the vaccine.

DOGGETT: What vaccine?

SCULLY: The one I asked AD Skinner to get me.

(SCULLY leaves. DOGGETT goes back to MULDER's room. The door is closed and locked in his face. DOGGETT sees SKINNER inside the room.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director?

(DOGGETT bangs on the door.)

DOGGETT: Open up. It's John Doggett.

(SKINNER doesn't respond. Beeping from the monitors in the room increases. DOGGETT kicks the door open. High points on AutumnT's Manly Meter there. SKINNER has removed all the life support from MULDER.)

DOGGETT: What the hell are you doing?

SKINNER: You don't understand.

(DOGGETT slams SKINNER up against the wall. [CarriK: Oh the Manly Meter just went through the roof!!])

DOGGETT: You're killing him.

SKINNER: I had no choice. He wanted me to kill Scully's baby.

DOGGETT: Who?

(SKINNER is very upset.)

SKINNER: Alex Krycek-- for the vaccine. It's the only way he'd give it to me  but I couldn't trust him. I couldn't do that to her.

DOGGETT: Where is he?



SCENE 21

(Hospital parking garage. DOGGETT enters and begins looking around. KRYCEK is sitting in his car. He sees DOGGETT in the rearview mirror. This is unexpected. KRYCEK starts the cars and whips it into reverse. DOGGETT fires at the car, but has to leap out of the way as KRYCEK's car smashes into another parked car. DOGGETT falls to the pavement and his gun skitters away. KRYCEK throws the car into drive. DOGGETT gets up and gets hold of the car by the open driver's window. He is barely holding on.)

DOGGETT: Stop the car!

(DOGGETT punches KRYCEK who is trying to drive the car and defend himself at the same time.)

DOGGETT: Stop the car!

(KRYCEK whips the car through the deck. DOGGETT is dangling out of the window. He gets another good punch on KRYCEK. KRYCEK aims the car for a line of parked cars. He hits DOGGETT in the face. To avoid getting smashed against the other cars, DOGGETT lets go and rolls away. He is in pain. KRYCEK starts to drive off, then reverses and stops the car a few yards away and gets out. He holds up a small vial of liquid.)

KRYCEK: You looking for this? It's the vaccine for Mulder.

(Standoff. DOGGETT starts toward KRYCEK. KRECEK smiles and drops the glass vial to the pavement. It shatters and the liquid splatters out onto the ground. DOGGETT, hatred in his eyes, runs for KRYCEK who calmly gets back in his car and drives away. DOGGETT looks down at the now ruined vaccine on the pavement. CarriK wonders why he doesn't try to salvage some of it, but, hey, it's the X-Files. We don't hold onto evidence. That would make things much too easy.)

(DOGGETT enters the hospital corridor again and is met by a hopeful SKINNER.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett. Agent Mulder's in the O.R. Did you get the vaccine?

(DOGGETT's look says no. SKINNER is devastated.)

DOGGETT: Listen to me. You weren't wrong. He wasn't to be trusted.

(Small comfort to SKINNER. DOGGETT enters the OR. A team of doctors, including SCULLY, is working on MULDER. SCULLY looks up and sees DOGGETT. She comes over to him, lowering her mask. Great stance. This is an actress who knows how to be pregnant, lol. She is tired, but now also seems more hopeful.)

DOGGETT: He's going to make it?

SCULLY: I don't know. I... I really don't know how we could've known.

DOGGETT: What?

SCULLY: That by keeping him on life support we were incubating the virus. We were hastening it along.

DOGGETT: How'd you figure it out?

SCULLY: When Skinner pulled Mulder off of the machines, his temperature dropped rapidly without affecting his vital signs.

DOGGETT: You mean Skinner saved him.

(SCULLY nods.)

DOGGETT: What about the vaccine?

SCULLY: If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of antivirals. I think it could work.

(DOGGETT's phone rings. Hospital staff looks at him. He looks at the caller ID and leaves the room.)



SCENE 22

(KERSH's office. DOGGETT enters.)

KERSH: John.

DOGGETT: Sir. Morning rush hour. I got here as quickly as I could.

KERSH: Missed the sunrise.

DOGGETT: I was with Agent Scully.

(KERSH is exuding evil. The bruises on DOGGETT's face from his fight with KRYCEK are starting to show up.)

KERSH: I know. It's going to be awful crowded down in that X-Files office.

(Pause. KERSH sits at his desk, puts on his glasses, and looks at a file. DOGGETT doesn't move. KERSH looks up at him.)

KERSH: Maybe you didn't hear me. I said you're on the wrong floor.

DOGGETT: (bitterly) Yes, sir.

(DOGGETT stares at KERSH a moment, then leaves.)



SCENE 23

(MULDER is back in his hospital room, still unconscious. His colour looks better, but his face and probably the rest of his body are still scarred. SCULLY is sitting next to him, holding his hand, rubbing his fingers. She looks tired. She looks up as his hand twitches. His head moves slightly.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

(MULDER slowly opens his eyes and looks over at her. SCULLY is on the verge of tears or laughter or both. Her lips quiver as she searches for the right words to say. What comes out is: )

SCULLY: Hi.

(She smiles at him. MULDER stares at her without recognition. His voice is scratchy.)

MULDER: Who are you?

(SCULLY's face falls, her second worst nightmare coming true. Then MULDER gives her a small smile, his eyes warm. He is teasing her. SCULLY sobs in relief, tears streaming down her face.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god. Don't do that to me.

(They look at each other. He smiles gently. CarriK: Oh, they love each other. Sorry noRomos.)

SCULLY: Do you know...? Do you have any idea what you've been through?

MULDER: Only what I see in your face.

(She strokes his hair, then presses her face to his chest and lays her head down on his shoulder and holds him.)

MULDER: Anybody miss me?

(SCULLY laughs through her tears and kisses his shoulder.. MULDER gazes down over the top of her head, his face away from the door. The door opens and DOGGETT enters silently. Without moving her head from its place on MULDER's chest, SCULLY looks up at DOGGETT. There is nothing to say. DOGGETT looks at the two of them for a moment, then leaves the room. MULDER closes his eyes again, resting his head near SCULLY's. SCULLY closes her eyes also, her head tucked into MULDER's shoulder.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1 ANNOUNCER: (CHRIS CARTER): Previously on The X-Files:

(Scenes from DeadAlive, 8X15)

(SCULLY standing with SKINNER at MULDER's grave, tears in her eyes.)

SCULLY: I can't truly believe I'm really standing here.

(ABSALOM talking to DOGGETT. Fishing boat finding BILLY MILES' body.)

ABSALOM: You found someone left for dead but who is not dead.

(DOGGETT talking to SKINNER about exhuming MULDER.)

DOGGETT: This is insanity. We saw the same body. Mulder wasn't just dead, he'd been dead for days.

(SCULLY talking in the hospital.)

SCULLY: Blood, electrolyte imbalances, a loss of brain function. I strongly believe that Mulder is infected with alien virus.

(SCULLY crying into MULDER's chest as he lies in the hospital room.)

DOGGETT: Somehow you healed these people. I want to know how you did it.

ABSALOM: You ask for my help but you refuse to believe in me.

(SCULLY in the operating room.)

SCULLY: If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of antivirals. I think it could work.

(SCULLY sitting with MULDER in his hospital room. MULDER's hand twitches. SCULY gasps. New Episode Begins.)



SCENE 2
WASHINGTON, DC
6:44 PM

(Early evening, but it is already dark. Behind the fence surrounding the White House, tourists are taking pictures. A mild-mannered looking MAN, mid-thirties, walks past them. He is watching the grounds intently. He is HOWARD SALT. He sees his opportunity. Nervously, he slips on a pair of black leather gloves and climbs over the fence. The TOURISTS watch as he begins running across the lawn to the White House. He is only a few yards from the front door when SECRET SERVICE GUARDS spot him. They surround him, guns in hand. HOWARD SALT puts his hands up, but still keeps trying to get to the front door as he pleads with the GUARDS.)

SECRET SERVICE GUARDS: Freeze. Freeze! Put your hands in the air! Freeze! Put your hands...

HOWARD SALT: I need to tell the president something. Need to tell... I need to tell the President something.

LEAD GUARD: Get down on the ground.

(Mass confusion. The GUARDS wrestle HOWARD SALT to the ground.)

HOWARD SALT: I need to see the President. He needs to know. Look, He needs to know. Aliens... aliens-- they're taking over the United States. He needs to know.

(The LEAD GUARD lowers his weapon, listening. In the struggle, HOWARD SALT's jacket has opened. There is a pistol inside.)

GUARD: He's got a weapon.

(HOWARD SALT removes the gun, muzzle down. It looks like he might be giving it up, but a GUARD grabs his wrist and the gun accidentally fires into HOWARD's stomach.)

GUARD: Get the weapon! Get the weapon!

LEAD GUARD: He's shot. He shot himself.

(HOWARD SALT moans in pain. The LEAD GUARD kneels next to him, concerned.)

LEAD GUARD: He's shot. He's been shot. Damn it. Stupid son of a bitch. What was he thinking?

ANOTHER GUARD: (off screen) Someone get a medic!

GUARD: (off screen) Get a medic!

(HOWARD SALT looks up at the LEAD GUARD and begs.)

HOWARD SALT: Please, the President... he needs to see this. Get this to him.

(HOWARD SALT hands the LEAD GUARD a homemade CD with the words "Fight the Future" handwritten on it. The LEAD GUARD stares at it.)

SCENE 3

(MULDER's hospital room. MULDER sits alone in the room. He is wearing just a hospital gown. He has flashbacks of himself screaming during his torture aboard the spaceship: his cheeks being pulled, his nose invaded, his chest being cut open. He touches his scars. Flashback of another scream as his soft palette is being drilled. He swallows uncomfortably. Pregnant!SCULLY and DR. LIM enter the room.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you okay?

(MULDER is not okay, but takes a moment to collect himself, then turns to face SCULLY and the DOCTOR.)

MULDER: Yeah. For a guy who was, uh... in a coffin not too long ago I think I'm doing pretty damn good. I don't quite have my legs under me... yet.

(He has stood up and crossed to the other side of the room, uncomfortable looking at them. If the gown is open in the back, SCULLY should be getting a nice view.)

SCULLY: Well, you might want to consider sitting down when you hear what we have to tell you.

(MULDER sits, preparing for the worst news.)

MULDER: Uh-oh.

SCULLY: Now, it's, uh... it's good news. It's... it's miraculous news.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.)

DR. LIM: I can't possibly exaggerate the inconceivability of you sitting here. Let's be honest... your condition may be more incredible than your recovery.

SCULLY: Whatever neurological disorder you were suffering from, it's no longer detectable. After a course of transfusions and antivirals it has rid your body of the virus that was invading it. The scars on your face on your hands, on your feet, on your chest, they, they seem to be repairing themselves.

(MULDER touches the scars self-consciously.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you are in perfect health.

MULDER: (not sounding thrilled) Wow.

DR. LIM: How do you feel, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Like Austin Powers.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a half-smile. She gives a small laugh, but neither finds the situation funny.)



SCENE 4

(SCULLY and MULDER enter MULDER's apartment. SCULLY is carrying a medium- sized duffel bag.)

SCULLY: Must feel good to be home.

MULDER: Mmm.

(SCULLY carries the duffel bag into the bedroom as MULDER looks around the apartment.)

MULDER: Something looks different.

(SCULLY has come back to the living room.)

SCULLY: (a little embarrassed) It's clean.

(MULDER chuckles, but without much humour. The situation is awkward.)

MULDER: Ah... that's it.

(SCULLY fingers her key ring as MULDER leans down and looks in the fish tank. SCULLY looks VERY pregnant.)

MULDER: Missing a molly.

SCULLY: Yeah. She wasn't as lucky as you.

(MULDER sits on his desk.)

SCULLY: Mulder... I don't know if you'll ever understand what it was like. First learning of your abduction... and then searching for you and finding you dead. And now to have you back and, uh...

(Her voice breaks.)

MULDER: Well, you act like you're surprised.

(MULDER chuckles at his own joke. SCULLY doesn't. MULDER stops laughing and looks away.)

SCULLY: I prayed a lot. And my prayers have been answered.

(MULDER looks at her stomach.)

MULDER: In more ways than one.

(SCULLY looks at her stomach.)

SCULLY: Yeah.

MULDER: I'm happy for you. I think I know... how much that means to you.

(SCULLY hesitates. It looks like she is about to cry. She starts to speak.)

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: I'm sorry. I don't mean to be cold or ungrateful. I just... I have no idea where I fit in. Right now. I just, uh... I'm having a little trouble... processing... everything.

(SCULLY looks at him.)



SCENE 5
FEDERAL CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
PERKEY, WEST VIRGINIA

(Prison recreation room. One cheerful prisoner, MARION, is pushing a cart of books. ABSALOM is sitting by himself.)

MARION: It's Marion the Librarian, boys. I got the new Harry Potter.

(Other PRISONERS laugh as MARION holds up a book. MARION pushes the cart next to ABSALOM. MARION holds out a book and speaks respectfully to ABSALOM.)

MARION: Our Lord and Saviour. For you.

ABSALOM: I've got my books.

MARION: Expand your horizons.

ABSALOM: I know all I need to know.

MARION: Want to bet?

(ABSALOM looks up at the book that MARION is holding out. The title is: "The Coming Apocalypse.")

MARION: Put a rise in your Levi's.

(ABSALOM takes the book and opens it. Inside is a newspaper clipping about HOWARD SALT. "Census Worker Shot on White House Lawn." ABSALOM reads the article, tears in his eyes.)



SCENE 6

(KERSH's office. KERSH is watching a news report [News 8] of the White House incident as SKINNER and DOGGETT enter.)

TV REPORTER: Again, our top story is the death of a man who jumped the fence at the White House last evening, his name now released. Howard Salt, a federal employee working on the US Census, got as far as the White House front door yesterday where he was stopped by security and shot accidentally by his own gun. According to a Secret Service spokesman, Salt appeared to be irrational and resisted arrest, shouting unspecified grievances against the U.S. Government and demanding to speak with the President. Co-workers describe him as likable and hardworking.

(KERSH turns off the TV and turns to face SKINNER and DOGGETT.)

KERSH: We never see them coming. People are so rarely what they seem. Gentlemen. Please, sit down.

(SKINNER and DOGGETT could not possibly look any unhappier to be in this office with this man, but they sit.)

KERSH: An application was submitted to me this morning by Agent Scully on behalf of our old friend, Fox Mulder, for reinstatement. I assume you both know about this.

(He hands copies of a file to both men.)

SKINNER: Reinstatement?

KERSH: To the X-Files.

DOGGETT: I thought Mulder just went home.

KERSH: Well, somebody's very anxious for him to get back to work. I wanted you both to see this before I deny the application.

(SKINNER opens the file.)

SKINNER: What is it?

KERSH: It's a review of the success rate of your X-Files since Agent Doggett joined the team. Damn impressive, John.

DOGGETT: Impressive, sir? The only thing impressive about my work on the X-Files is that I even know what's going on half the time.

KERSH: From this report, you and Agent Scully have had more arrests on percentage than she and Mulder over seven years. Take a look.

SKINNER: Well, that's not very fair to Agent Mulder. So many of his cases involve --

(KERSH finishes the sentence for him.)

KERSH: Aliens?

(SKINNER glares at KERSH.)

KERSH: There lies the problem. The FBI isn't a place for personal crusades. I'm asking you both to make that understood  on my behalf.

DOGGETT: Well, you can't ask me to tell Mulder he's off the X-Files. It's his unit. He created it.

KERSH: I'm not asking you, John.

(DOGGETT stands.)

DOGGETT: You sent me to find Mulder. I found him. Don't charge me with driving a stake through his heart.

KERSH: Maybe you'd rather I close the X-Files. Then we'd both be getting what we want.

SKINNER: Let's go, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT doesn't move, glaring at Kersh.)

SKINNER: Now.

(DOGGETT follows SKINNER out of the office.)



SCENE 7

(MULDER's apartment. Next day. MULDER is slouched comfortably on his couch, his feet up. He looks like he plans to sit there a while. SCULLY and SKINNER stand facing him. SCULLY is in a different outfit from the day before.)

MULDER: Kersh wants to put me behind a desk? That is not what Kersh wants.

SCULLY: No, I think Kersh wants you to quit, Mulder.

(SCULLY lowers her pregnant body onto the couch beside MULDER.)

SKINNER: It's more than that. He wants to punish you, to hurt you.

MULDER: And you by putting you in this position. And Agent Scully, for not giving up on me. Truth is, this is a bullet that was fired about eight years ago. It's a magic bullet that's been going round and round and right now it seems poised to hit me right in the back of the head.

SCULLY: Well, I think the question is, Mulder, are we going to sit here and let this happen?

MULDER: Scully, you're going to give birth in a couple months. You can talk as tough as you like but you know and I know and they know that in a little while you're going to have more important things than whether or not the X-Files remains open.

SKINNER: They're not closing the X-Files. Kersh aims to keep them open with Agent Doggett running them.

MULDER: Agent who?

(SCULLY avoids MULDER's eyes.)

SCULLY: I've had a partner for the last several months. He was assigned to help me find you.

MULDER: Mission accomplished. Does he know what he's doing at all, this guy?

SKINNER: About the paranormal? Not much.

MULDER: I see. Then maybe the question is not who fired this magic bullet, but whether or not it was a lone gunman.

(MULDER smiles.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett is above reproach, Mulder. He's being manoeuvred just like you.

MULDER: Well, good. At least he's manoeuvrable.

(MULDER gets up quickly and crosses to the bedroom.)

SKINNER: Where are you going?

MULDER: I'm going to get dressed. For the first time I feel like getting back to work.

(SKINNER looks at SCULLY.)



SCENE 8
BASSETT COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA

(Prison crew is working a roadside clean-up project. Several armed guards are on duty. ABSALOM is one of those digging. He makes sure the GUARDS are looking away, then bends down and hides an old nail studded piece of wood inside the sleeve of his orange jumpsuit. The transport vans arrive to take them back to the prison.)

PRISON ARMED GUARD: Wrap it up and fall in. Stay in line. Let's go.

(The PRISONERS all begin walking toward the vans. ABSALOM lets the piece of wood slide back down to his hand. He moves to a GUARD.)

PRISON ARMED GUARD: Get back in line

(ABSALOM hits the GUARD with the nail-studded piece of wood and breaks away.)

PRISON ARMED GUARD: Hey, you!

(As ABSALOM runs, the other prisoners cheer.)

WOUNDED GUARD: Go get that son of a bitch.

PRISON ARMED GUARD: Nobody move! Stand down!

(The GUARDS in the van start the engine and sirens and begin chasing ABSALOM. A train is approaching. ABSALOM runs for the tracks. He crosses just before the train arrives. The van has to stop for the train. ABSALOM escapes.)



SCENE 9

(DOGGETT house. Late evening. DOGGETT enters his house. He closes and locks the door, then sets his gun and holster on the table beside the door. He crosses to his desk and begins looking through the day's mail. He hears a click. He turns to see ABSALOM aiming the cocked gun at him.)

(DOGGETT house. ABSALOM still has the gun trained on DOGGETT. He pushes DOGGETT roughly to a chair.)

ABSALOM: Get over here. Over here now. Come on, sit down. Hands behind your back. Head down. Get over here. Over here now. Come on, sit down.

(DOGGETT does as ABSALOM says.)

ABSALOM: Hands behind your back. Head down. Down between your legs.

(ABSALOM feels the back of DOGGETT's neck.)

DOGGETT: Absalom. That's your name, right? What are you looking at?

ABSALOM: The back of your neck.

(ABSALOM sounds relieved to have found nothing.)

ABSALOM: Sit up, Agent Doggett. I had to make sure.

DOGGETT: Make sure of what?

ABSALOM: Make sure that you're still you.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I'm still me. So why don't you put that weapon down?

(ABSALOM shows DOGGETT the article about the White House shooting.)

ABSALOM: You see this? Huh, do you see it?

DOGGETT: "Man shot at the White House."

ABSALOM: They killed him for what he knew. Then they'll kill me, too.

DOGGETT: Not if you put the weapon down.

ABSALOM: No. They'll kill me anyway. I got one chance here. With you.

(DOGGETT starts to get up and make a grab for the gun.)

ABSALOM: Sit down. Didn't I tell you to sit down?

(DOGGETT backs down.)

DOGGETT: I'm not going anywhere.

ABSALOM: You're going with me. And I'm going to show you and you are going to spread the word. Doubting Thomas is going to spread the word.

DOGGETT: What word?

ABSALOM: The invasion has begun.

DOGGETT: What invasion?

ABSALOM: They're already here.

DOGGETT: Who's already here?

ABSALOM: Certain men have gone out among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying, "let us go, and serve other gods that ye have not known."

DOGGETT: I don't know what that means.

ABSALOM: I open my mouth... in parables. I utter things that... have been kept secret from the world.

(The telephone begins ringing.)

ABSALOM: On your knees, John Doggett.



SCENE 10
FBI TASK FORCE BRIEFING ROOM
4:45 PM

(Same time. FBI briefing room. SKINNER is leading the investigation into ABSALOM's escape. Other AGENTs listen and look at the slideshow. An image of ABSALOM is up, DOC # I 07294327. SCULLY is trying to call someone on her phone.)

SKINNER: He goes by the name Absalom. A self-styled prophet Agent Scully and I apprehended in Montana where he commanded members of a small UFO cult.

(SCULLY is getting no answer. She looks frustrated. The next slide is of a prison cell wall. The words "Fight the Future" and "Forever  " are hand written on the wall.)

SKINNER: These words were found on the wall of his cell after he escaped from a work detail 40 miles from the state prison. Now, we don't know they mean, but Absalom claimed to have knowledge of an alien invasion. There were also claims of healings of numerous abductees  that have been subjected to alien torture.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING HAD: "who claimed to have been subjected to alien torture."]

(Slide image is of the abductees, including TERESA HOESE, that we saw at the Montana compound in This is Not Happening.)

(The AGENTS snicker. SKINNER is not amused.)

SKINNER: Claims that have never been substantiated... or refuted.

(SKINNER advances the slide to a brutal image of TERESA HOESE lying in a coma before she was healed. Her face is badly damaged. SCULLY looks away. SKINNER moves the slide again to an image of ABSALOM.)

SKINNER: But evidence of torture was real. Now, the only way we're going to get answers is to bring this guy in. Just know the man that you're looking for is dangerous. He's a felon, and he is capable of physical violence. All right, that's it.

(The AGENTS go their separate ways. SKINNER crosses to SCULLY who is still holding her phone.)

SKINNER: Where the hell is Agent Doggett?

SCULLY: I can't reach him.

(She clicks off her phone.)

SKINNER: I can't run this thing, Agent Scully. This is obviously an X-Files case.

SCULLY: I know. And I'm all over it. I will find him.

(SCULLY's phone beeps. She looks at the display.)

SCULLY: I don't know if this is going to make you feel any better.

(She shows SKINNER her phone. The message reads: "Where is everybody? Come on down. Mulder.")



SCENE 11

(X-Files office. SCULLY and SKINNER enter. MULDER, dressed in one of his suits, is sitting in his chair, his feet up on the desk. He is looking at a copy of the photo of the abductees. He looks up at them happily. A picture of SAMANTHA is on the desk.)

MULDER: Hey.

SCULLY: (warning tone) Mulder...

MULDER: Who says you can't go home again?

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

MULDER: What's it look like?

SKINNER: It looks like you want to give them real ammunition to use on you, that's what it looks like.

MULDER: Hey, I am just down here visiting my buds. Where is this Agent Doggett anyway? What kind of hours does he keep?

SCULLY: Please, you do not want to stir that up right now.

MULDER: Why?

SKINNER: Because we have a manhunt in progress and I want Agent Doggett running it.

(MULDER holds up the photo, tauntingly.)

MULDER: Anything to do with this? This Absalom abductee class picture?

[Closed Captioning calls it a "group photo?"]

SCULLY: Yes... It does. Why?

MULDER: Because I noticed that the man who was shot on the White House lawn is one of the men in that photograph. Top right hand corner. In profile. Howard Salt, if I'm not mistaken.

(SCULLY looks at the photo, glances resignedly at SKINNER, then back to MULDER.)

SCULLY: He's right. You're right.

MULDER: Consider that a freebie. The next one's going to cost you.

SKINNER: Why? What else do you know?

MULDER: Oh, I don't know anything. But you know me, I got a real big hunch. This Howard Salt was a multiple alien abductee, worked for the U.S. Census Bureau. Wanted to get word to the President, unspecified grievances. What do you want to bet those grievances were?

SCULLY: You think he knew something?

MULDER: I think they killed him for it.

SKINNER: The man jumped the White House fence. He had a gun.

MULDER: Once again, I'm a betting man. I'm betting he had more than that.

SCULLY: Mulder, you make it sound like this was a conspiracy.

MULDER: Ooh. There's that word again.

SKINNER: You're being paranoid, Mulder. Even for you.

MULDER: Do you want to hear something really paranoid? The FBI gets its way, there's going to be nobody down here to ask the paranoid questions. Nobody to find those faces in those photographs. Surely not this Agent Doggett.



SCENE 12

(DOGGETT house. DOGGETT is lying on his stomach as ABSALOM duct-tapes the gun to his back.)

DOGGETT: Just what do you have in mind, if you don't mind my asking? It's my head that's going to get blown off if there's a screw up.

ABSALOM: We're going to get what that man at the White House died for.

DOGGETT: To get it? To get it where?

ABSALOM: You just concentrate on not screwing up, Agent Doggett.

(ABSALOM cocks the gun. DOGGETT flinches.)

ABSALOM: Either way, you and I are going to become overnight sensations.



SCENE 13
FBI EVIDENCE ROOM
9:48 PM

(MULDER and SCULLY enter an evidence storage room. SCULLY is not happy about it.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I know you know this, but if anything leaves this room you could be in violation of the law.

(MULDER is looking around the dark room.)

MULDER: Really? When I was dead I was hoping maybe they changed the rules.

SCULLY: Mulder, just being here could be used by Kersh as cause for dismissal.

MULDER: Then why don't you shut the door so he doesn't find out.

(After a moment, SCULLY closes the door. MULDER is cutting the plastic off of a stack of boxes.)

SCULLY: I just don't know what you're hoping to find in Howard Salt's personal effects.

MULDER: Neither do I, really. But maybe it's like Howard Salt's picture. I'll know it when I see it.

SCULLY: So you'll risk the consequences even though there may be nothing here?

MULDER: You don't get it, do you, Scully? The man shot at the White House, the prison escapee, there's something bubbling to the surface here. I want to know what it is.

SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through an ordeal that defies all logical explanation. How can you think that these two men have the answers when they defy all standard of credibility?

(MULDER has been looking through files from the boxes. He pulls out a laptop and boots it up.)

MULDER: Since when has an X-File not defied a certain standard of credibility? At least that's the way it used to work.

(MULDER gives SCULLY a challenging look. She meets his gaze.)

MULDER: Look, Scully, I need to make sense of what happened to me. So that I can stop it. Because if I can't stop it, it could happen to anyone. It could happen to you. And who's to say it's going to stop there?

SCULLY: Mulder, if you go down the X-Files will go down, too. I mean, theoretically, they could put you in prison for what you're doing here.

MULDER: Yeah, well, compared to where I just was, prison would be a Princess cruise.

(SCULLY sighs and starts for the door. MULDER sees something on the laptop. [CARRIK'S HUSBAND: It is a Macromedia Flash file made to look like some hybrid operating system known only to the FBI.] )

MULDER: Ho. Hey. What the hell is this?

(SCULLY listens to him. Lots of numbers.)

MULDER: The entire hard drive is taken up with this. Ten gigabytes of memory.

(Her curiosity piqued, SCULLY walks back over and looks at the screen,)

SCULLY: It's been encrypted.

MULDER: Mm.

(MULDER closes the laptop and removes the hard drive.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

MULDER: I'm going to book myself on that Princess cruise.

SCULLY: I'll book it for you.

(SCULLY takes the drive and the responsibility from him. With a smile, he covers up the boxes again and follows her out of the room.)



SCENE 14
FEDERAL STATISTICS CENTER
CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA
1:11 AM

(A car pulls up in front of a secured government installation. In a monitor we see DOGGETT, closely followed by ABSALOM, making their way to the Guard's station. A GUARD looks at them suspiciously.)

FBI GUARD ON INTERCOM: State your name and your business.

DOGGETT: Special Agent John Doggett, FBI.

(DOGGETT notes the security features in place. The GUARD types in DOGGETT's name and gets his picture and record. He buzzes open the door, but is still suspicious. ABSALOM keeps his hand poised at the middle of DOGGETT's back. As they pass, the GUARD looks at an infrared image. He sees the gun resting against DOGGETT's back. The GUARD picks up the phone to call security.)

(DOGGETT and ABSALOM are walking down a hall.)

DOGGETT: I hope you know I got no idea where I'm going down here.

ABSALOM: I just need access to wherever they compile all the available data from the current US census.

DOGGETT: And then what?

ABSALOM: Then you pick up the phone, you tell the FBI why you aren't coming to work until somebody pays us some serious attention.

DOGGETT: Just so you're not surprised, we might not make it that far. We passed through an x-ray scanner on the way in here back at the gate.

ABSALOM: Well, you better hope we make it. I'd hate to see you die in vain.

DOGGETT: That's sort of in your hands, huh? So just in case how about you tell me what's in this facility that's worth me dying for.

ABSALOM: It's all in the census data.

DOGGETT: What?

ABSALOM: Proof. That they're already here. That they're already among us.

(They have arrived at a glass walled white room containing two computer stations and several large server banks. ABSALOM tries to open the door. It is locked.)

ABSALOM: The proof is in there.

(Suddenly, a SWAT team enters the corridor. ABSALOM grabs DOGGETT tightly, holding the gun on his back. Very tense moment.)

ABSALOM: I got a loaded gun pointed at this man's head! He's an FBI Agent!

DOGGETT: Listen to him! Just back off!

ABSALOM: I'll pull the trigger!

(The SWAT team moves in closer.)

DOGGETT: Listen to the man!

ABSALOM: I'll pull it! Back off!

DOGGETT: Lower your weapons! Listen to him!

(One of the SWAT TEAM MEMBERS shoots ABSALOM in the head. The bullet leaves a welt on DOGGETT's right cheek. The cheek on his face, that is. DOGGETT watches in shock as ABSALOM's now dead body slides to the floor, a surprised expression on the face. DOGGETT stares at the SWAT TEAM MEMBERS.)



SCENE 15

(SKINNER's office. DOGGETT is sitting in one of the comfy chairs away from the desk. He has a nasty wound on his right cheek where the bullet grazed him.)

SKINNER: It may not be the best way but it's certainly one way to catch an escaped convict. I'll give you that, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: I'd just as soon stick to the old-fashioned way, sir. Shot was a little too close for comfort.

SKINNER: You say this man claimed the U.S. Census Bureau had data information that he was after that connects to this man who was shot on the White House lawn?

DOGGETT: Proof, he said, that they were here among us  whoever they are.

(The door opens and MULDER enters.)

MULDER: Sir.

SKINNER: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Is this John Doggett? You Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT stands up to greet MULDER. MULDER shoves him roughly back down into the chair.)

MULDER: I hope you're not commending him as a hero for what he did 

SKINNER: Agent Mulder, back off.

(SKINNER grabs MULDER and pushes him away from DOGGETT.)

MULDER:  in this thing, 'cause he's not.

SKINNER: Back off! I'm not about to referee a boxing match.

(DOGGETT is confused and uncomfortably amused.)

DOGGETT: Just what's the problem here?

MULDER: The problem? You occupy an office that used to be devoted to finding the truth and now you're busy burying it. That's the problem.

DOGGETT: Whoa, you must've got your wires crossed somewhere, Agent Mulder.

MULDER: You got that man killed.

DOGGETT: I got him killed?

MULDER: Because of what he knew. What he was going to expose.

DOGGETT: You see this, Agent Mulder?

(DOGGETT points to the bullet wound on his cheek.)

MULDER: I see you sitting there, Agent Doggett. That's good enough for me.

(With a last look to SKINNER, the pissing contest over for now, MULDER turns and goes back out the door he came in. SKINNER is embarrassed, unsure what to say.)

SKINNER: You've got to understand what he's been through. I mean, now he's back and you're...

(Without a word, DOGGETT gets up and leaves through the other door. SKINNER sighs, looking at both closed doors.)



SCENE 16

(SCULLY's apartment. FROHIKE opens the door for MULDER. They smile at each other.)

FROHIKE: You know, it's really not fair. You've been dead for six months and you still look better than me. But not by much.

(FROHIKE hugs him tightly around the waist. MULDER embraces him back and laughs softly.)

MULDER: Melvin. I'd be a whole lot happier to see you if you'd just take your hands off my ass.

(Embarrassed, FROHIKE lets go and steps back.)

FROHIKE: Sorry.

(BYERS and LANGLY cross the room to greet MULDER.)

BYERS: I think it goes without saying that we're all, uh, tremendously relieved.

LANGLY: And not just because we got big questions about your involvement in a certain  blessed event.

(LANGLY glances over at Pregnant!SCULLY. Surprised, MULDER looks at SCULLY. Apparently ignoring them, SCULLY indicates the laptop on her table.)

SCULLY: So much for playing a hunch, Mulder. The, uh, Gunmen were able to decrypt the data that you found on Howard Salt's hard drive. It was a series of file directories that were downloaded the day that he died.

MULDER: Downloaded from where?

LANGLY: The FSC, the Federal Statistics Center.

BYERS: A government information bank used by the U.S. Census Bureau where your Mr. H. Salt worked.

MULDER: All right, what are you waiting for, boys? Get cracking.

FROHIKE: Unless you think we're all idiots, it's only Langly who's the idiot.

LANGLY: Don't make like it's my hacking skills. I've never seen such a radical counterdefensive.

SCULLY: Fifteen minutes after Howard Salt was shot at the White House, firewalls went up on every data bank at that very facility.

MULDER: Well, why do that?

(FROHIKE and SCULLY look at each other. MULDER smiles.)

MULDER: Because I'm right. Because they would kill to protect what's in those files.

BYERS: Unless you got a password we don't see any way short of that of getting a hold of this data.

LANGLY: And the thing is, even if you have a pass code you still have to break into the FSC just to use it. We all agree, you're going to have to let this one go.

MULDER: Oh. I see.

(GUNMEN look uncomfortable. MULDER looks directly at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Somebody's been doing a little campaigning for her cause.

(Stung, SCULLY looks away.)

MULDER: Well, just remember, boys, this is America. Just because you get more votes doesn't mean you win.

(SCULLY meets MULDER's smug look.)



SCENE 17

(Rainy conditions at a track field. DOGGETT is wearing a trench coat and carrying an umbrella. KNOWLE ROHRER is jogging in a hooded track suit. CarriK has a Deep Throat flashback. He stops at a water fountain, gets a drink and spits part of it out as DOGGETT joins him.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: Your name came up today, John. Folks are all worked up. They say you dodged a bullet.

(Casually, DOGGETT leans down and gets a drink from the fountain. This is a covert meeting.)

DOGGETT: You can't dodge what you don't see coming, Knowle, that's for sure.

KNOWLE ROHRER: That should tell you something about who you're dealing with.

DOGGETT: Who am I dealing with? NSA? Secret Service? Military? Who?

KNOWLE ROHRER: You know better than that, John.

DOGGETT: They shot the man in cold blood. Didn't even stop to ask him his name.

KNOWLE ROHRER: The way I hear it he made it too easy. Taking a federal agent hostage in a government facility.

DOGGETT: They'd have shot him anyway.

(A FEMALE JOGGER runs by.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: Without a doubt.

DOGGETT: Why?

KNOWLE ROHRER: You and I have been friends a long time, John. I tell you things. But this is a whole other level.

DOGGETT: Don't give me that doublespeak crap, Knowle. I'm being accused.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Accused? Of what?

DOGGETT: Of being used to get that man killed.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Well, that's insane.

DOGGETT: Oh, is it? Maybe I am being used, and I just don't know it. That's what I want to know from you.

KNOWLE ROHRER: I can't tell you that, John. But I can tell you something. One thing you already know. These men are very good shots.

DOGGETT: What don't I know?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Three words.



SCENE 18

(Night. Outside SCULLY's apartment building. As SCULLY walks out of the building and hails a cab, DOGGETT crosses over to her.)

DOGGETT: Hold up!

SCULLY: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Yeah.

SCULLY: (to the CABBIE) Could you wait minute?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, I'm sorry to surprise you. I don't mean to.

SCULLY: What are you doing here at is hour? You're freezing cold.

DOGGETT: I got something for Agent Mulder only I can't go up there. I don't know him, and I know he doesn't trust me so I'm going to ask you to get it to him.

SCULLY: What do you have to give him?

DOGGETT: Information about this escaped convict who took me hostage. One of his disciples was the man shot on the White House lawn.

SCULLY: Oh, yeah, Agent Mulder knows that already.

DOGGETT: What he doesn't know is that man had a computer diskette that he was trying to get to the President.

SCULLY: Who gave you this information?

DOGGETT: I can't tell you that but what I can tell you is  is this diskette was labeled with a pass code.

SCULLY: You have this, this password?

DOGGETT: It's three words: "Fight the Future."

(Movie theme plays. SCULLY sighs, knowing what is to come.)

(CUT TO: Short time later. SCULLY enters her apartment. MULDER is sitting on the sofa, resting. SCULLY looks upset.)

MULDER: Scully, what are you doing back? Did something just happen?

SCULLY: I'm, um... I'm not exactly sure I should tell you, Mulder.

MULDER: Scully, if you know something that can get us moving forward again, you need to tell me.

(SCULLY looks up at him. She is debating what to do, on the verge of breaking.)



SCENE 19

(DOGGETT house. Someone is knocking at the front door. DOGGETT comes down the stairs to the door, gun in hand. No more gun left on the table beside the door!)

DOGGETT: Yeah, who is it?

SKINNER: It's Skinner. Open up, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT opens the door for SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: What're you doing here?

SKINNER: I got a call from Agent Scully. She's at her apartment, completely beside herself.

DOGGETT: Over what?

SKINNER: Mulder somehow got hold of a computer password to a database filled with secrets.

DOGGETT: What kind of secrets?

SKINNER: Names of people the federal government is tracking using the US census. Names of people who have a certain genetic profile. It's the same information he believes the shooter at the White House knew about. Also the guy that took you hostage.

DOGGETT: You said Scully was upset.

SKINNER: That Mulder was going to act on this information in some way that... What? You know about this?

DOGGETT: I gave Scully the password.

SKINNER: Where did you get it?

DOGGETT: I can't tell you that.

SKINNER: You know, I'm starting to wonder about you, too, John. Just whose side you are working on here.

DOGGETT: I'm starting to wonder about that myself. You said Scully's at her apartment. What's the number there?

SKINNER: That's why I'm here. I can't get a hold of them-- either one of them-- and I have no idea where they went.

(DOGGETT grabs his jacket.)

SKINNER: Where are you going?

DOGGETT: I can't tell you that, either. If I open up my mouth, I put you at risk. You're going to have to trust me on this.

(DOGGET leaves the house.)



SCENE 20
FEDERAL STATISTICS CENTER
CRYSTAL CITY, VIRGINIA

(Night. SCULLY is waiting in the driver's seat of her car, engine running. She is looking intently at the building next to her. She is frustrated and worried.)

SCULLY: (softly) Oh, man.

(Suddenly, DOGGETT taps at her window. Startled, she lowers the window.)

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

DOGGETT: Where's Agent Mulder?

SCULLY: He wouldn't listen to me.

DOGGETT: Get out of here. Get going.

(SCULLY shuts off the engine.)

SCULLY: I can't do that to him.

(DOGGETT reaches in the car and cranks the engine back on.)

DOGGETT: Then do it for yourself. Look... I think I may have set you up.

SCULLY: What?!

DOGGETT: You just get out of here now and I'll explain it to you later.

SCULLY: No. You explain it to me now. Set us up how, and with whom?

DOGGETT: The same men that shoot first and ask questions later.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett!

(DOGGETT is gone, running toward the building.)

(Inside the compound, MULDER is walking toward the Guard House. He is wearing a mike and earpiece.)

MULDER: (on radio) Frohike? Langly? Byers? Let's go. I'm dying out here.

FROHIKE: (on radio) Well, let us just finish our cappuccino and biscotti, and we'll see what we can do.

(The GUNMEN are dangling by wires and harnesses in what looks like the wall next to the bathroom in the Matrix. Instead of plumbing, however, this wall apparently contains every important security cable in the complex.)

BYERS: (on radio) You can start walking now, Mulder.

MULDER: (on radio) Is the system bypassed?

LANGLY: You'll know if it's not.

MULDER: (on radio) Great.

(While the GUARD watches his monitors, MULDER runs past the windows and kneels down next to the door.)

[Closed captioning:

LANGLY: (on radio) We hijacked the feed from the surveillance cameras.

BYERS: (on radio) What the guard is seeing on his monitors are still-frames from ten minutes ago.]

(A phone rings. The GUARD goes to answer it.)

FROHIKE: (on radio) Smile, buddy boy. The eye in the sky is watching.

LANGLY: (on radio) We'll be watching Mulder get busted if I don't find that override circuit.

[Closed captioning:

LANGLY: This wiring must have been colour-coded by Helen Keller.]

BYERS: (on radio) Everything's under control, Mulder. Just hold tight.

LANGLY: (on radio) Okay, got it!

(The GUNMEN's monitor shows a sector cleared. The door near MULDER clicks open.)

FROHIKE: (on radio) And voila!

(MULDER enters the compound and begins walking down the hallway. DOGGETT now arrives and after looking around, follows MULDER through the door. The GUARD is still away.)

MULDER: (on radio) Come on, guys. I'm on autopilot here.

FROHIKE: (on radio) Go left, Mulder. There should be a pair of glass doors up about a hundred yards up.

BYERS: (on radio) According to our information, those doors will lead you straight into the databanks.

[Closed captioning:

BYERS: (on radio) According to our information, those doors will lead you straight into the inner sanctum - the FCS databank.]

(MULDER runs to the doors. They are locked.)

MULDER: (on radio) Hey, who's working on the locks, fellas?

FROHIKE: (on radio) Stand by. There you go.

(The doors open and MULDER enters the white room and closes the door behind him..)

LANGLY: (on radio) Mulder, there ought to be two work stations in the middle of the room. Either one will give you access to the data.

[Closed captioning:

LANGLY:  so I say log on and start downloading.

BYERS: (on radio) In the meantime, we'll try and keep the firewall disabled so you can transmit the data out.]

(MULDER sits at one of the stations. When the computer asks for the security code, he types in "Fight the Future." Lots and lots of files come up on the screen.)

MULDER: Let's do some e-mailing.

(DOGGETT has arrived and is pounding on the glass doors to the room. MULDER ignores him and keeps accessing the computer files.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, get out of there! Agent Mulder!

(DOGGETT keeps knocking.)

FROHIKE: (on radio) Mulder? What the hell's that?

DOGGETT: Your life's in danger if you don't get out now.

MULDER: (on radio) Just a fly buzzing around the window.

(Suddenly, one of the glass door shatters as DOGGETT shoots it. MULDER stares in surprise as DOGGETT walks over to him. The GUNMEN swing around on their cables grabbing their ears in pain from the shock of the gunshot over the radio headsets. Very funny.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder... get out. You're coming with me. I'm here to save you, whatever you may think.

MULDER: I think you're trying to keep this information from ever seeing the light of day, just like you did once before, Agent Doggett. That's what I think.

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, I don't even know what that information is.

MULDER: Well, you're about to, along with a lot of other people. There going to learn that they've been targeted because of their genetic profiles for abduction and replacement by alien facsimiles. What do you say we start off with the Washington Post, huh?

DOGGETT: You can believe whatever you want, but that information is never going to make it out of here.

MULDER: What are you going to do, shoot me?

(Outside in her car, SCULLY sees several military jeeps arrive. She takes out her cell phone and dials a number. One of the GUNMEN's phones ring. They all answer.)

GUNMEN: (on phone) Hello.

SCULLY: (on phone) Something's wrong.

(It was BYERS' phone. The others hang up. You would think they, of all people, would have programmed different rings for each phone, lol.)

BYERS: (on phone) What are you talking about?

SCULLY: (on phone) I think we've been set up. You have to get Mulder out of there.

BYERS: (on phone) Right now that's basically impossible.

(FROHIKE sees the jeeps arriving.)

FROHIKE: (on radio) Uh-oh. Mulder? You'd better start typing fast.

MULDER: (on radio) Why?

FROHIKE: (on radio) The cavalry just arrived.

(MULDER turns angrily to DOGGETT.)

MULDER: You son of a bitch. You set me up.

DOGGETT: No.

(The SOLDIERS are moving in.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Get him out of there, Gunmen.

LANGLY: (on radio) We're working on it.

DOGGETT: Come on, Agent Mulder.

(DOGGETT grabs MULDER's arm.)

MULDER: Hey, get off of me.

(MULDER pushes him away and sits back down at the terminal.)

DOGGETT: If I set you up, I wouldn't be here trying to convince you to go. They're coming to kill you. They're going to kill me, too. That's the set up.

LANGLY: (on radio) Mulder, I think you better listen to the man. They got the data trapped and I can't get it uploaded let alone start transmission.

(On LANGLY's screen, we see that the data is not being uploaded.)

SCULLY: (on phone, worried) What is happening, Byers?

BYERS: (on phone) I'm trying to figure that out. (on radio) Mulder, are you there?

MULDER: (on radio, sounding depressed, glaring at DOGGETT) Yeah, I'm here.

BYERS: (on radio) It's look like there's really, uh... no good way out of there. Uh... except...

MULDER: (on radio) Except what?!

(The SOLDIERS are very close.)

BYERS: (on radio) It's a long shot, but, uh... worth a try, especially given the alternative.

(MULDER looks intently at DOGGETT as he listens to BYERS.)

BYERS: (on radio) Here's what you do.

(The SOLDIERS enter the white computer room. It is deserted. They begin searching around the machines. Camera pans up to show a ceiling tile being carefully lowered back into place.)



SCENE 21

(Day. Track field. KNOWLE ROHRER finishes a run and takes a long drink from the water fountain. Breathing heavily, he pulls off his hooded sweatshirt exposing the tank top underneath. He looks at DOGGETT in surprise.)

DOGGETT: You've got two minutes, Knowle. Two minutes to give me one good reason why I shouldn't put your name in lights. Why I shouldn't expose you for the lying bastard you are.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Hey, John, nice knowing you.

(KNOWLE ROHRER starts to walk away.)

DOGGETT: You see that man across the park?

(SKINNER is walking toward them and stops a few yards away.)

DOGGETT: You walk, that man puts your name on all the wrong desks.

KNOWLE ROHRER: I get it John. You asked me for information, I tell you what I can. What you do with it is out of my hands.

DOGGETT: You knew what I would do with it. That's when you gave it to me.

KNOWLE ROHRER: You expose me and then what? Where are you going to get your answers? 'Cause you're standing on the tip of the iceberg, my friend.

DOGGETT: You're full of crap.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Am I? What is it you think those men were trying to protect? Census data? You need me worse than you know. DOGGETT: I don't need someone using me to get another man killed.

KNOWLE ROHRER: You think this about Mulder. It's about the truth, John.

DOGGETT: What truth?

KNOWLE ROHRER: You got it all right in front of you. It's all in the X-Files. I'm just one man trying to point you in the right direction.

(DOGGETT walks away to join SKINNER. As KNOWLE ROHRER leans down for another drink, we see a couple of strange lumps on his neck. He looks after DOGGETT and SKINNER with an odd smile on his face.)

SCENE 1
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA
5:45 PM

(Typical corporate mid-level executive office. GARY GARBER, a distinguished looking silver-haired man, is sitting at his desk. His accent indicates that he is NOT from New Orleans. A dark-haired woman, 40ish, ROBERTA TOEWS, is sitting next to him. Her face reflects nothing. A mild-mannered looking man, JEB DUKES, 30s, dark blue suit probably from S&K Men's Wear, is sitting in front of the desk. He is staring at GARY GARBER in surprise.)

GARY GARBER: You don't know how much I hate my job on days like this, Jeb. If it were my choice... (he glances at ROBERTA TOEWS)  I'd be giving you a promotion but with the economy the way it is...

(JEB DUKES also glances at ROBERTA TOEWS, then back to GARY GARBER. He is in shocked disbelief.)

JEB DUKES: Are you firing me?

GARY GARBER: You can hold your head up, Jeb. You've done a good job here.

JEB DUKES: I-I don't believe this. I... I thought this was just an evaluation.

(GARY GARBER stands and shakes his head. It is a polite but firm dismissal.)

GARY GARBER: I'm sorry. I really am.

(JEB DUKES looks again at the woman, ROBERTA TOEWS. She merely looks back at him.)

(JEB DUKES leaves the office. So does ROBERTA TOEWS. As if in a dream, JEB DUKES walks slowly through the office watching the other employees answering phones, gathering up papers, closing up their desks, preparing for the next day of work. He speaks to no one and leaves the building. The city streets are dark and wet. An older model car comes around the corner followed by a flashing police car, sirens blaring. The car passes JEB DUKES and crashes into a station wagon in the middle of the next intersection. The cars burst into flames. JEB DUKES, along with other horrified witnesses, run toward the accident. One of the OFFICERS blocks them from approaching the fiery wreck.)

OFFICER: Stay back. Everybody stay back. Just get back. Everybody stay back.

(There is movement in the car engulfed in flames.)

DISTRAUGHT WOMAN: Oh, my god, there's someone in there! [Closed Captioning: We've got to help him! Someone help that man!]

(JEB DUKES stands transfixed as the figure of a man completely covered in flames emerges from the car and begins approaching him. No one else appears to be able to see him. The MAN IN FLAMES steps close to JEB DUKES, then into him. The flames disappear leaving JEB DUKES standing alone, his eyes glowing red.)

OFFICER: Stay back! Keep your distance.

(JEB DUKES staggers backward, confused and frightened, then runs from the crowd.)

(Later, JEB DUKES has returned to the office building. He is dressed casually, all in black. He expression is unrecognizable, there is nothing left of the sad man we saw earlier, only a struggling sense of confusion as he walks unsteadily through the corridor. The woman, ROBERTA TOEWS sees him.)

ROBERTA TOEWS: Jeb. Can I help you? Jeb...

(JEB DUKES ignores her and keeps heading down the corridor. GARY GARBER comes out of his office and sees him.)

GARY GARBER: Hey... Jeb... What's up?

(JEB DUKES dispassionately raises a pistol at GARY GARBER and fires.)

SCENE 2
8:39 PM

(Same office building. The New Orleans Police Department is investigating the shooting. One TECHNICIAN is collecting fibres with some rolling vacuum device. ROBERTA TOEWS is lying dead face down on the carpet. A CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHER finishes collecting photos. DETECTIVE FRANKLIN POTTER, 50's, African- American, covers her face with a sheet. The elevator dings, and he rises to see MONICA REYES walking toward him. She is struggling to unwrap a piece of nicotine gum.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Agent Reyes?

REYES: Yeah, hi. Uh... Uh, Monica Reyes.

DETECTIVE POTTER: Frank Potter, New Orleans PD.

REYES: Trying to quit the habit.

(REYES smiles self-consciously and puts the gum into her mouth.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Yeah, I tried to quit smoking myself once. I hated that damn gum.

(REYES nods and chews, doesn't have the proper response.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Well, anyway you, uh, want to see the victims?

REYES: Well, on the phone you said you had reason to believe the killings might be satanic ritual murders.

DETECTIVE POTTER: Right. Let me show you.

(She subtly takes the gum out of her mouth and drops it into a wastebasket as he leads her to a cubicle.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: This is Jeb Dukes' work area. I found this among his personal effects.

(He hands her what looks like an unfolded CD jewel case insert.)

REYES: What can you tell me about the killer, detective? Anything?

DETECTIVE POTTER: Thirty-one years old. College grad, lived alone. There's some who felt he had a dark side which could explain that there.

(REYES looks at the desk.)

REYES: Can I look in there?

DETECTIVE POTTER: Sure. You're the expert.

(REYES sits down at the desk.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Does it tell you anything about why he might've killed those people?

REYES: The fact is, a killer like this is usually pushed over the edge by what we call a stressor, a catalysing event-- an emotional breakdown the breakup of a relationship or sometimes when someone's been fired.

DETECTIVE POTTER: This guy was fired  by the two victims.

REYES: Well, that's most likely what drove him to murder.

DETECTIVE POTTER: Yeah, but what about all these images... these devil pictures?

REYES: It's Marilyn Manson.

DETECTIVE POTTER: (confused) Marilyn Manson?

REYES: Your kids listen to him. They probably buy his CDs at K-Mart. I don't think there's anything satanic going on here, Detective.

(REYES gets up and start to leave. DETECTIVE POTTER calls after her.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Agent Reyes? Okay, okay... It's some rock group, but you don't think this has anything to do with Satan or evil or...?

REYES: Personally? I'd look into his gum.

(REYES pops another piece of gum into her mouth and starts for the elevator. She stops beside the body of ROBERTA TOEWS, still covered by the sheet. REYES stares the woman's exposed hands. As she watches, a glowing red flame from within quickly reduces the flesh to ashes. REYES kneels down, raises the sheet, and looks at the rest of the body. It is also burned, as if consumed by a very hot fire. DETECTIVE POTTER notices REYES.)

DETECTIVE POTTER: Agent Reyes? Did you find something?

(REYES looks up at DETECTIVE POTTER, then back down at the corpse. It now appears normal, no burns, just a shooting victim lying on her stomach.)



SCENE 3

(SCULLY's apartment. Knocking. SCULLY, in blue maternity pajamas and robe, comes to the door. More knocking. She stands on tiptoe to look through the peephole, and then opens the door for MULDER. She was not expecting to see him.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: I was just about to jump in the shower but I was waiting for the pizza man.

MULDER: You got something going on with the pizza man I should know about?

SCULLY: The pizza man?

MULDER: Well, correct me if I'm wrong but you just said you were waiting for the pizza man to jump in the shower.

SCULLY: No, what I mean was the pizza man's usually late, and so...

(SCULLY gives up trying to explain, and smiles and sighs.)

SCULLY: You want to come in?

(MULDER continues to play the role of the injured party.)

MULDER: Thank you.

SCULLY: I feel like I'm stuck in an episode of Mad About You.

(As SCULLY heads back toward the bathroom, MULDER closes the door and slips the wrapped package he has hidden behind him under the sofa cushion and stands beside the arm of the sofa.)

MULDER: Well, uh, yeah, but small technicality. Mad About You was about a married couple and we just work together.

SCULLY: Yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about.

MULDER: I do, I do. What-what I'm trying to say is that, uh... we have no good reliable information on this man. I mean, what I am saying is the pizza man...

(As SCULLY comes back out of the bathroom, MULDER points at her swollen belly.)

MULDER:  is not above suspicion.

SCULLY: Ah, I see.

(SCULLY looks up at him. He smiles and glances significantly to the couch beside him. She follows his gaze and notices the almost hidden present on the couch. Her eyes light up.)

SCULLY: Is that for me?

MULDER: Yeah.

(She bends down in front of MULDER to pick up the present.)

SCULLY: Nice package.

MULDER: (modestly embarrassed) Thank you.

SCULLY: What's the occasion?

(Having "misunderstood" SCULLY's meaning before, MULDER "realizes" that she was talking about the present. [CarriK: If you don't get this joke, and are under 18, please don't ask me what it means.] )

MULDER: Oh, uh, I was going through some stuff after my mother died and, um, it's just an old family keepsake and I wanted you to have it.

SCULLY: Well, I'm touched.

(There is knocking at the door.)

MULDER: Little Caesar, I presume?

(MULDER answers the door. The PIMPLY-FACED PIZZA DELIVERY MAN is standing there holding a pizza. He is a Dude  mid twenties, tall, dark-haired, cute in a bored looking way. MULDER looks at him intently, then accusingly back at SCULLY. SCULLY sighs.)

SCULLY: Hi... just, uh, give it to the man with the funny look on his face.

PIMPLY-FACED PIZZA DELIVERY MAN: Yeah, it's $29.08.

(MULDER face reflects amused shock as he pulls out his wallet.)

MULDER: $29.08? What'd she get on it, a tank of gas?

(Suddenly, on the sofa SCULLY grips her stomach and leans over in pain.)

MULDER: Scully?

(SCULLY doesn't answer.)

MULDER: Scully!

(MULDER runs to her. She is in too much pain to speak. MULDER looks back up at the PIMPLY-FACED PIZZA DELIVERY MAN.)

MULDER: Call 911.

(The PIMPLY-FACED PIZZA DELIVERY MAN runs for the phone as MULDER kneels next to SCULLY.)



SCENE 4
WASHINGTON MEDICAL CENTER
1:42 PM

(SCULLY, her eyes closed, is on a gurney being wheeled by technicians through the emergency room corridor. MULDER is walking quickly to stay beside her. The ER NURSE, a no-nonsense middle-aged African-American woman meets them, a clipboard in her hand.)

ER NURSE: That Scully? Dana? She's got what? Abdominal pains?

MULDER: Her doctor is Dr. Speake.

ER NURSE: Oh, he's been called.

MULDER: She.

ER NURSE: Who are you? The husband?

MULDER: No.

ER NURSE: Then you wait outside.

(The gurney and the team of medical personnel all enter a set of double doors leaving MULDER alone in the hall. DOGGETT arrives. MULDER, still very worried about SCULLY, is surprised to see him.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, what happened?

MULDER: How'd you find out?

DOGGETT: I was dropping something off. The landlord told me.

(The ER NURSE sees DOGGETT and comes over to the two men.)

ER NURSE: Are you the husband?

DOGGETT: Me?

(DOGGETT looks at her, confused. MULDER says nothing.)

DOGGETT: No.

(DOGGETT looks at MULDER. MULDER's phone rings.)

MULDER: Excuse me.

(While DOGGETT talks to the ER NURSE, MULDER steps a few feet away and answers his phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

REYES: (on phone) Special Agent Fox Mulder?

MULDER: (on phone) Speaking.

REYES: (on phone) Agent Mulder, my name is Monica Reyes. We never met. Not since you've been alive, I should say.

MULDER: (on phone, impatiently) Who?

REYES: (on phone) Special Agent Reyes. I know this is out of the blue, but I have a case I need your help on. It involves a certain phenomenon.

MULDER: (on phone) I can't help you, Agent Reyes, for so many reasons. I think you should contact Agent Doggett at the X-Files.

REYES: (on phone) I can't call Agent Doggett because it involves him.

(MULDER looks over at DOGGETT, still talking to emergency personnel.)

REYES: (on phone) I'm in New Orleans, but I can be in DC in a few hours. It's important, Agent Mulder. Very.

(Pause.)

MULDER: (on phone) Call me when you get here.

(MULDER hangs up. DOGGETT finishes speaking to the ER NURSE.)

DOGGETT: They're telling us not to worry. They're running some tests.

(MULDER nods, but still looks worried. For MULDER.)



SCENE 5
LAVONIA, GEOGIA
OFF INTERSTATE 85

(Seedy motel. JEB DUKES is sitting alone in his room. He is looking despondently at the gun on the table near him. He slowly stands, picks up the pistol and with a trembling hand holds it to his temple as he looks in the mirror. He pauses, the struggle with himself evident on his face. Just as he appears ready to pull the trigger, he drops it with a gasp of pain. The gun is glowing red hot. He stares at his hand which is now covered in blistering third-degree burns. Slowly, he reaches his hands to his face. Pinpricks of a glowing red light are coming through his cheeks. Using his fingernails he methodically rakes the flesh from his face leaving strips of glowing red. It's as if his skin is just a container for a raging fire within. JEB DUKES stares in pain, not sure whether to cry or to scream in horror.)



SCENE 6
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, DC

(REYES is a records office looking through a file drawer. She pulls out LUKE DOGGETT's file, glances through it, then closes the drawer. She hears the door open. MULDER enters.)

REYES: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Agent Reyes?

(Holding the file, REYES comes down the stepladder to meet him. They shake hands.)

REYES: You're taller than I thought.

MULDER: You keep on alluding to a time that we've met and I don't remember.

REYES: I was there when they found you in the woods. You were...

(She pauses. MULDER nods. Both smile very uncomfortably.)

REYES: Uh... Yeah. I'm not surprised you don't remember.

MULDER: Yeah. Um, I-I have somewhere I have to be  if we could cut to the chase.

REYES: As I said before, it involves Agent Doggett  the death his son. I don't know if you're familiar at all with that case.

MULDER: No, I'm not at all familiar with Agent Doggett.

(She hands him the file and crosses her arms. He opens it. A smiling picture, probably a school photo, of a blonde spiky-haired little boy in a brown plaid shirt. The adjoining sheet reads

LUKE JOHN DOGGETT
Age at Disappearance: 7
Date of Birth: 7/9/90
Date of Last Contact: 8/12/97
Race: White
Gender: Male
Height: 48"
Weight: 52
Eyes: Blue
Hair: Blond
AKA: Unknown
Missing From: Long  [Island, NY, perhaps?]
Child is suspected to have been 

MULDER scans the information. He looks at another picture, crime scene photo of LUKE DOGGETT lying dead, face down on the ground. There is sympathy in MULDER's voice.)

MULDER: I-I wasn't aware of this. You were the lead investigator?

REYES: Once it fell to the FBI. Agent Doggett was with the NYPD at the time. We worked it together. We never caught the killer. It was the hardest case I've ever had. As in stealing-into-the-bathroom-to-cry-my-eyes-out kind of hard. I can't begin to imagine what it was like for John.

(MULDER is looking at her. She sighs, controlling her emotions.)

REYES: I couldn't bear to put him through this again, but if it means we could catch his son's killer... I just can't go to him until I know if what I saw means anything.

MULDER: You said this case involves some kind of phenomenon?

REYES: I don't know if it was a psychic experience or what, but when we found his son, I had a vision. It was as if for just a moment... The body was changed.

MULDER: Changed? Into what?

REYES: Ashes. It looked like ashes. The thing of it is Agent Doggett told me he saw it, too  although he spent the last few years convincing himself he didn't, that even if he did, it didn't mean anything.

MULDER: What do you think it means?

REYES: I can't shake the feeling that it's a clue, that it could somehow point to who's responsible, if only I let it. And now I've seen it again. A thousand miles from here, a seemingly unrelated case and I've had the same vision. There has to be a reason for it, a reason it's happening now.



SCENE 7

(Hospital corridor. DOGGETT walks down the hall and quietly enters SCULLY's room. She is asleep, the vitals monitor beeping softly. The clock reads 8:40. As DOGGETT watches her, the room around him changes to an outdoor wooded area. The camera pans around him as he passively watches police and suited FBI agents run past him toward and area of the woods shrouded in mist. A few of the agents are running toward him. The vision is broken as the ER NURSE enters the room. She is not happy to see him there.)

ER NURSE: Sir, immediate family only. You fellas just don't listen. You have to go now.

(DOGGETT stares at SCULLY who is still sleeping peacefully. The room around his is once again a typical hospital room.)



SCENE 8

(FBI building. MULDER comes out of the records office carrying the file. He walks down the hall. DOGGETT steps in front of him, grabs MULDER by the front of his jacket and slams him violently against the wall. DOGGETT is furious. MULDER is naturally a little defensive.)

MULDER: Hey! Hey!

DOGGETT: (yelling in MULDER's face) You stay out of my life!

MULDER: Take it easy!

DOGGETT: (yelling) You stay out of my business!

MULDER: Take it easy, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: (yelling) You want to get something on me, you ask for it! I don't want to get calls about you going behind my back! You got that straight?!

MULDER: I don't want anything on you. I was asked to look into this file.

DOGGETT: (yelling) Who asked you?!

REYES: (calmly) Agent Doggett. What are you doing?

(DOGGETT releases MULDER and stares at REYES who has also come out into the hall. He grabs the file from MULDER's hand.)

DOGGETT: Is this you? Is this you looking into this?

REYES: Yes. I asked Agent Mulder.

DOGGETT: You asked him what? There's nothing in there for him to bother with.

MULDER: Why don't you just calm down, Agent Doggett and let her explain the connection to you.

DOGGETT: The connection? To what?

REYES: I was going to tell you, John. I was in New Orleans on a case-- a shooting. Something that I saw connected back to Luke. A vision.

DOGGETT: Not this again. You're not going to make something out of nothing.

MULDER: Bob Harvey. Does that name mean something or nothing to you?

DOGGETT: Bob Harvey was a suspect in the death of my son. We questioned him but then we realized he wasn't our man.

REYES: Agent Mulder pointed it out. Bob Harvey was killed last night in a car crash fleeing the police near a shooting in New Orleans. He died in front of the building where the shooting occurred.

DOGGETT: What's the connection?

MULDER: That's it.

DOGGETT: That's it?

REYES: And then there was the vision.

DOGGETT: No, there's no connection. I don't care what you saw, you leave it alone  (points his finger in MULDER's face)  and you leave it the hell alone.

(DOGGETT looks as if he is about to say something else to REYES, then leaves with his son's file, still angry. REYES watches him go, then steps closer to MULDER.)

REYES: I know there is something here.

(MULDER give a short exhausted laugh.)

MULDER: Good.

(MULDER also goes, leaving REYES alone in the hallway.)



SCENE 9
KATHA DUKES RESIDENCE
SILVER SPRING, MARYLAND

(Comfortable two-storey home. The doorbell rings and a LITTLE GIRL in a nightgown, MIA, runs down the stairs and opens the door for REYES.)

REYES: Hi.

MIA: Hi.

REYES: Is your Mommy home?

MIA: (yells, not leaving the doorway) Mom!

(KATHA DUKES, 30s, comes to the door and hugs her daughter and picks her up.)

KATHA DUKES: Mia?

REYES: Katha Dukes?

KATHA DUKES: Yeah.

REYES: (taking out her badge) Sorry about the late hour. My name is Monica Reyes. I'm with the FBI.

(KATHA DUKES says nothing.)

(Later, REYES and KATHA DUKES are sitting in the living room. KATHA DUKES is holding a recent picture of herself, MIA and JEB DUKES. They look like a happy family.)

KATHA DUKES: I believe that we're all born good, uncorrupted and life itself does the corrupting. But, you know, someone like Jeb... He just isn't capable of this.

REYES: Are you close... to your brother?

KATHA DUKES: Very. Jeb lived here in the house with us till he went down South. He loves his niece.

REYES: Does the name Bob Harvey mean anything to you? Did Jeb ever have any dealings with him?

KATHA DUKES: No. I think I'd know. Why?

REYES: No reason. It's the answer I was kind of expecting, actually.

(The phone rings. With an apologetic look to REYES, KATHA DUKES goes to the other side of the room to answer it.)

KATHA DUKES: (on phone) Hello?

SPARTANBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA
OFF INTERSTATE 85

(JEB DUKES is calling from a payphone in a dark rural area.)

JEB DUKES: (on phone) Katha?

KATHA DUKES: (on phone) Yes?

JEB DUKES: (on phone) Katha, it's Jeb.

(KATHA DUKES is very aware of REYES sitting on the couch a few feet away. She tries to sound casual.)

KATHA DUKES: (on phone) I really can't talk right now. It's been a very bad day here.

JEB DUKES: (on phone, on the verge of tears) Listen, it wasn't me that killed those people, all right? It was somebody else. I'm telling you, it was somebody else.

KATHA DUKES: (on phone, glancing at REYES) You're going to have to call back later.

(She hangs up and goes back to REYES.)

(At the South Carolina payphone, JEB DUKES hangs up sadly. A WOMAN taps at the glass door startling JEB DUKES. She smiles apologetically.)

PAYPHONE WOMAN: Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. I got a flat tire back a ways.

(She has a Northern accent. JEB DUKES stares at her as he reluctantly, yet inexorably opens the door of the phone booth.)



SCENE 10

(SCULLY is lying in the bed in her hospital room. Clock reads 8:30. AM, probably. DOGGETT stands beside her bed watching her. SCULLY wakes. She is surprised to see DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: What are you doing, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: I was, um... I just came by to see how you're doing.

SCULLY: I'm, uh... I feel all druggy. Do you mind?

(She points to the bed table. DOGGETT pours a glass of water and hands it to her.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

DOGGETT: They say you're stabilized but we've been worried about you.

SCULLY: Who's we?

DOGGETT: You know... me and Agent Mulder ...

SCULLY: What's wrong, Agent Doggett? You don't seem too good yourself.

DOGGETT: You worked with Agent Mulder for how long? A long time.

SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

(Her eyes briefly flutter closed as if reliving the exhaustion of the last eight years in 2/3rds of a second.)

DOGGETT: You never believed in any of this stuff. This paranormal or whatever you call it. So, what changed your mind?

(SCULLY is very sleepy.)

SCULLY: I realized it was me, that I was afraid. Afraid to believe.

(DOGGETT starts to leave the room, then turns back. Again, he is in the wooded area. He is standing a few yards away from the police and FBI agents who are standing in a small circle around something on the ground. As he watches, REYES, in a brown trenchcoat, slowly turns and looks at him. SCULLY's voice brings DOGGETT back into the hospital room.)

SCULLY: Why do you ask?

(DOGGETT is silent.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, why do you ask?

DOGGETT: Some other time.

(DOGGETT leaves. SCULLY closes her eyes.)



SCENE 11

(X-Files office. MULDER is sitting comfortably at his old desk, his feet up. He is looking through an X-File and chewing on a pencil. REYES enters.)

REYES: Agent Mulder? I was looking for Agent Doggett.

MULDER: Well, that'd make sense. It's not my office anymore but old habits die hard.

(REYES notices the open files on the desk.)

REYES: What are those?

MULDER: Cases involving images like you described. People close to crimes who experience visions of death disassociated from reality.

REYES: And what did you find?

MULDER: Absolutely nothing. These visions are so random as to have absolutely no significance to the cases they're supposed to pertain to.

REYES: You're wrong.

(MULDER laughs condescendingly.)

MULDER: I think I know these files.

REYES: And I know what I saw. There's a reason these things are happening. There is something at work here, and it all began with the man killed in the car crash-- Bob Harvey.

MULDER: I think that's a coincidence. I think that life is full of them.

REYES: And full of patterns things we see, but can't comprehend. You believe that. Why can't you believe this?

MULDER: I think there's an opening coming up in this office soon. You might want to apply.

REYES: Is that why you won't help him?

(MULDER closes the files and pauses a moment, shakes his head, his mouth tight.)

MULDER: I have a, uh, sick friend in the hospital and, uh, I think I should go see her.

(MULDER smiles briefly, stands and puts the files into REYES's hands. He pulls on his suit coat.)

REYES: I hope she gets well. This office down here needs at least one person with an open mind.

(MULDER has left the room, but steps back in at the challenge.)

MULDER: You'll say anything, won't you?

REYES: Only when I think I'm right.

(MULDER chuckles and leaves the office.)



SCENE 12

(Rural road. A minivan with a half changed tire and a tire iron are lying on the dusty roadside. JEB DUKES comes stumbling toward them. He walks as if in a daze, the pistol dangling limply from his hand. He reaches the abandoned minivan and looks at himself in the tinted glass of the rear window. He sees flames roaring behind him as if he is inside a raging furnace.

CUT TO:

JEB DUKES drops the tire iron on the ground as he gets into the minivan. He has changed the tire, but not removed the jack. The jack falls as he starts the engine and pulls the minivan out onto the road with squealing tires.)



SCENE 13
SPARTANBURG, SOUTH CAROLINA
11:02 AM

(Payphone area we saw the night before. Sheriff's Deputies are walking around. DOGGETT pulls up in a rental car. He sees MULDER, in rolled-up shirt sleeves, casually leaning against a Sheriff's car.)

DOGGETT: What am I doing here?

MULDER: Been asking myself that same question, Agent Doggett. But it seems the tenacious Agent Reyes does not want to let go of this one.

DOGGETT: Of what?

(MULDER leads DOGGETT toward the crime scene.)

MULDER: She's got a murder victim out here, a woman found shot. She thinks it's probably the same man who killed those two people down in New Orleans-- this Jeb Dukes.

DOGGETT: What does she want from me?

MULDER: She wants to know if you see it, too. What she's been seeing.

DOGGETT: I told you, there's no connection.

(DOGGETT looks over and sees REYES standing with the Deputies in a loose circle around something on the ground. The clothing is different, but the arrangement of people is identical to that of his flashback/vision in the hospital. As she did in the vision, REYES looks back at him.)

REYES: Agent Doggett.

(The circle of men breaks apart. DOGGETT comes to stand next to REYES. He looks at the body of the PAYPHONE WOMAN lying face down on the ground. Same position and angle of the body as that of his son in the file photo we saw earlier and the woman in New Orleans. DOGGETT takes a breath and speaks calmly. MULDER is a few feet away, watching them.)

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, Agent Reyes. I don't see it.

REYES: I think you do.

(DOGGETT starts to leave. He pauses.)

REYES: You're just afraid to go there.

MULDER: Whoo. You just keep shooting till you hit something, don't you?

(REYES stays focused on DOGGETT.)

REYES: You'd rather blind yourself to the connections, but I can't.

DOGGETT: You keep talking about these connections. Connections to what? To who?

REYES: What if this is a thread of evil  connecting through time through men, through opportunity, connecting back to you. In India, in Africa, in Iran, in the Middle East, in the Far East. Most of the world, they take it as a given. They see evil in death the way other people see God in a rose.

MULDER: (dryly) I saw Elvis in a potato chip once.

(REYES glances to MULDER.)

REYES: You know what I'm talking about.

MULDER: Yes, I do. I do. But if this man doesn't see it, he doesn't see it, right?

(DOGGETT stares at REYES. MULDER leaves. REYES and DOGGETT continue looking at each other.)



SCENE 14

(Night. Clock says 3:20. MULDER enters SCULLY's hospital room. She is asleep. He calls softly from the doorway.)

MULDER: You awake?

(SCULLY wakes up and looks at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER closes the door as he walks to the bed. SCULLY is resting her hands on her abdomen.)

MULDER: What did the doctor say?

SCULLY: That I had a partial abruption. Which means that my placenta started to tear away from the uterine wall. They're going to need to monitor me for awhile.

(MULDER smiles a little.)

MULDER: But you're going to be fine?

SCULLY: Yeah.

(MULDER reaches out and rests his hand on her swollen belly for a moment. His expression is one of wonder, awe, and joy. He and SCULLY smile at each other.)

SCULLY: Where have you been?

(Almost reluctantly, MULDER slides his hand off of her stomach.)

MULDER: I've actually been out in the field with Agent Doggett and this, um, female Agent from New Orleans.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes.

MULDER: Yeah.

SCULLY: I like her.

(MULDER laughs softly.)

MULDER: You're nothing at all alike.

SCULLY: Well, then neither are you and I. So this is a case you're working on?

MULDER: Yeah. Actually, one that involves Agent Doggett's son, the son who died.

SCULLY: Yeah, he's never talked to me about him, but I know something. Are you able to help him at all?

(SCULLY is getting sleepy again.)

MULDER: You can't help a man who can't help himself.

SCULLY: He's worth the effort, Mulder.

(They look at each other. MULDER considers.)



SCENE 15

(KATHA DUKES' house. KATHA DUKES carrying a bag of groceries enters the front door. He daughter, MIA, comes in with her and races up the stairs,)

KATHA DUKES: All right, you got a half an hour to play in your room before mommy has dinner ready. Mia?

MIA: (already upstairs) Okay.

(KATHA DUKES heads for the kitchen and turns the light on with her elbow. She gasps at the sight of JEB DUKES standing in the room.)

KATHA DUKES: What are you doing here?

JEB DUKES: I'm coming home.

KATHA DUKES: The FBI was here, Jeb.

JEB DUKES: I didn't do what they said, Kath. It wasn't me, okay? It wasn't.

KATHA DUKES: What is that on your face?

JEB DUKES: What?

(JEB DUKES wipes a dark smear from his face.)

KATHA DUKES: Is that blood?

JEB DUKES: I don't know how that got there.

(Exasperated, KATHA DUKES sets the groceries on the table.)

KATHA DUKES: I need the truth, Jeb.

JEB DUKES: Look, please, believe me, Katha, it's not me, okay? (pleading, about to cry) I need help, please.

MIA: Mom? Is that uncle Jeb?

(MIA has come into the kitchen. She is looking happily at JEB DUKES. JEB DUKES smiles and walks to the little girl.)

JEB DUKES: Yeah, sweetheart. Yeah, it is.

(He kneels down, closes his eyes in relief, and hugs her gently.)

JEB DUKES: It's me.

(Over his shoulder, KATHA DUKES is watching them. She looks very worried.)



SCENE 16

(DOGGETT is sitting at the X-Files desk. He is on the phone.)

DOGGETT: Jeb Dukes, middle name, Larold. No, Larold. Okay, thanks, anyway.

(He hangs up as REYES enters and hears part of the conversation.)

REYES: What are you doing, John?

DOGGETT: I'm looking into this case.

REYES: You're looking in the wrong way. There are a hundred agents in this building who can phone canvass.

DOGGETT: Ah, but there's only two who can solve crimes with mental telepathy-- you and me. So we'll just read the tea leaves on this one and there it is, right? Case closed?

REYES: John...

DOGGETT: Damn it, Monica, you want to find this guy. I'm trying to find him. What do you want from me?

REYES: I want you to be honest with yourself about what you saw that day. Honest about what your feelings tell you.

DOGGETT: Feelings don't solve crimes. What the hell does it matter what my feelings are? How the hell's that going to get the job done?

REYES: I'm not talking about the job, John. What are you scared of? Why does it scare you?

DOGGETT: I got to believe that I did everything I could to find my son.

REYES: (reassuring) You did do everything to find your son.

DOGGETT: I got to believe that I did everything I could to save him, to get him back safe, to not let him down. I got to believe that I did everything humanly possible 'cause if I can't believe that then these other possibilities that you talk about, that Mulder talks about, that Agent Scully talks about... if they're real... if they're real, then... that's something else I could have done to save my son.

(Pause. REYES' cell phone rings.)

REYES: (on phone) Monica Reyes. Katha? Katha, wait.

(She hangs up.)

REYES: Jeb Dukes' sister. He's there at the house with her.

DOGGETT: This guy somehow has some link to my son and I'm damn sure going to find out what it is.

(DOGGETT grabs his coat and precedes REYES out of the office.)



SCENE 17

(JEB DUKES has MIA on his lap. She is in her nightgown. He is reading to her.)

JEB DUKES: (reading) "As it happened, Hansel and Gretel had overheard everything that their parents had said. 'Shh,' said the boy. 'I'll find a way out, I promise you, and when at last...'"

(KATHA DUKES enters the room. She has a weak smile that does not reach her eyes.

KATHA DUKES: Mia, honey? Can you come here a minute, please?

MIA: But uncle Jeb's reading to me.

KATHA DUKES: That's okay, I just need you a minute. Can you, can you just come here?

(JEB DUKES is instantly suspicious.)

JEB DUKES: Who's here?

KATHA DUKES: She just wants to talk, Jeb. I just want you to tell her what you told me. She can help you.

JEB DUKES: Who? I said who, damn it!

KATHA DUKES: Come on, baby.

(JEB DUKES grabs MIA and holds her up to his chest while he pulls out the pistol and points it at KATHA DUKES. KATHA DUKES puts her hands up in a non-threatening gesture and steps back and leaves the room, trying not to let her panic show. MIA is screaming.)

MIA: Uncle Jeb!

JEB DUKES: You lied to me!

KATHA DUKES: Come on, Jeb.

JEB DUKES: Just get back.

MIA: Mommy!

JEB DUKES: Go!

(JEB DUKES drags MIA through the hall and starts down the stairs.)

MIA: Mommy! Mommy! Let me go, Uncle Jeb! Mommy, help! Let me go, let me go, help!

(DOGGETT is at the foot of the stairs, his gun trained on JEB DUKES.)

DOGGETT: Right there, right there! Hands in the air! Federal Agent, I'm armed, I'll shoot!

JEB DUKES: You drop the gun, you drop the gun!

DOGGETT: Let her go!

MIA: Mommy!

JEB DUKES: I'll shoot her, I swear!

DOGGETT: I just need to talk to you.

(DOGGETT slowly sets his gun down on the bottom step. MIA is crying as JEB DUKES slowly pulls her back up the stairs.)

MIA: Mommy... Mommy, mommy!

DOGGETT: (calmly) I won't hurt you.

JEB DUKES: You stay back.

MIA: Mommy! Mommy!

(DOGGETT, his hands empty, is carefully approaching.)

JEB DUKES: I said stay back!

(A gunshot sounds and JEB DUKES falls to the stair. REYES comes around the corner of the upstairs hallway, still holding the gun on JEB DUKES. MIA breaks free and runs screaming to her mother.)

MIA: Mommy! Mommy!

KATHA DUKES: Mia, Mia!

(KATHA DUKES holds her daughter tightly. She screams at REYES and DOGGETT.)

KATHA DUKES: What have you done?

(DOGGETT yells out the door for their backup.)

DOGGETT: This man needs help!



SCENE 18
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
8:53 PM

(DOGGETT is beside the gurney carrying JEB DUKES into the emergency room.)

DOGGETT: You're not going to die on me now.

(REYES is trying to get his attention.)

REYES: Agent Doggett...

DOGGETT: You hear me? You're going to make it. You're going to make it. You hear me?

REYES: John!

(The same ER NURSE who admitted SCULLY earlier in the episode stops him.)

ER NURSE: No, no, the parade stops here. Now, if you want to save him, let the doctors do their work, okay? Who's the immediate family member here?

(KATHA DUKES steps forward.)

KATHA DUKES: I am.

ER NURSE: Okay, come with me. I'm going to need you to fill out some information for me, all right?

(KATHA DUKES follows the ER NURSE as the gurney is wheeled into the operating room.)

REYES: There is nothing more you can do.

DOGGETT: You can't tell me that now.

REYES: Maybe saving this girl was the reason. Maybe that's what this was all about. Maybe that's what I saw and why I saw it. For *that* kid. Go home, John. There's nothing here for you to do.



SCENE 19

(SCULLY's hospital room. She is asleep. DOGGETT stands watching her. Again, forest vision happens. DOGGETT watches as the circle of policemen part. In slow motion, DOGGETT walks toward REYES who remains beside a small figure on the ground. It is the small dead body of LUKE DOGGETT, face down. As DOGGETT stares at the body, it now appears completely burnt  just ashes loosely attached to the bones. MULDER's voice breaks the vision.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett...

(From the doorway, MULDER nods significantly toward the hall. DOGGETT follows him out. MULDER closes the door and stands protectively in front of it. DOGGETT stands across the hall from him.)

MULDER: She just fell back to sleep.

DOGGETT: I just wanted to check to see how she's doing. Anyways, I'm here with this other thing. We, uh, we caught this killer, Jeb Dukes. He's in the ICU. He may not make it.

MULDER: And now you're wondering if there really was a connection. You know, when I, uh... I first came to work at the FBI, I worked at Violent Crimes, and I saw, I saw the worst of humanity. I saw monsters and I wondered how they became that way, how these men became so evil. I know there were psychological explanations-- victims of their environment, victims of their parents-- but the scientific explanations were never truly satisfying. And I began to think about evil like, like a disease. You know, that it goes from man to man or age to age. Most of us walk around thinking we're incapable of any acts of evil and we are. You know, we can stifle that momentary urge to kill or to hurt. We have some kind of immunity to it. But I think it's possible that there's... an occurrence in somebody's life, a tragedy or a loss that leaves them vulnerable, hurts their immunity to evil, and all of a sudden at that point in their lives when they're weakened, they're open to evil and they can become evil.

DOGGETT: If that were true, then what you're saying is... is that this man we wheeled in here tonight is infected with evil, the same evil that killed my son. You really believe that, Agent Mulder?

MULDER: Uh, I'm not really a good test for questions like that. I'll believe almost anything, you know, but the, uh... the pisser is you may never know. It may be like Agent Reyes says. It could be random and meaningless-- who it affects, who it goes to.

DOGGETT: What if it isn't?

MULDER: Well, then you'd be seeing something that I don't, Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT nods and leaves MULDER leaning against the wall outside SCULLY's hospital room.)



SCENE 20

(JEB DUKES hospital room. KATHA DUKES is standing beside JEB DUKES, gently stroking his hair. He is on a ventilator, and is unconscious. REYES stands near the door watching them. Suddenly, JEB DUKES goes into convulsions and the heart monitor begins beeping wildly.)

KATHA DUKES: (screaming) Somebody!

(REYES calls out the door.)

REYES: Doctor!

(DR. SPEAKES, SCULLY's obstetrician, run into the room with two nurses. DR. SPEAKE looks at the monitors.)

DR. SPEAKE: Push one gram of epi.

(The NURSE holds out a prepared syringe.)

NURSE: Right here.

(DR. SPEAKE injects the epi. She gives it about 4 seconds to work, then feels JEB DUKES' neck and finds no pulse. No CPR. No defibrillator.)

DR. SPEAKE: Call it.

(DR. SPEAKE turns sadly to KATHA DUKES who is staring at her hopefully.)

DR. SPEAKE: I'm sorry.

(DR. SPEAKE leaves the room as the NURSES finish the paperwork.)

NURSE: Time of death: 10:57 P.M.

(The NURSES leaves. KATHA DUKES begins crying as she walks toward the bed.)

KATHA DUKES: No, no, no...

(REYES steps behind her and places what she means to be a comforting hand on her shoulder. KATHA DUKES stops crying, and looks off to the side.)

KATHA DUKES: You killed him.

(KATHA DUKES gasps, as if she has been hit in the stomach. When she opens her eyes, there is glowing fire in them. REYES, still standing behind her, takes her hand away, and sadly walks toward the door. KATHA DUKES grabs a metal gas canister from the wall next to the bed and hits REYES over the head, knocking her to the floor. There is a brief struggle, but KATHA DUKES manages to get REYES' gun and point it at her. DOGGETT runs in.)

DOGGETT: Drop the weapon!

(DOGGETT grabs KATHA DUKES, and forces her against the bed.)

KATHA DUKES: (screaming) No!

DOGGETT: Drop it!

(KATHA DUKES, sobbing, finally releases the gun. DOGGETT takes it, holds it on KATHA DUKES who is crying onto her brother's body, then turns to REYES and feels her pulse.)

DOGGETT: I need a doctor!

(DR. SPEAKE enters, horrified at what she sees.)

DR. SPEAKE: Oh, my Lord.

NURSE: Get a doctor in here stat.

(DOGGETT helps REYES weakly sit up.)

DOGGETT: It's over. It's over now.

REYES: It's never over.



SCENE 21

(SCULLY's apartment. MULDER has brought over a pizza. SCULLY is sitting on the sofa as MULDER comes out of the kitchen carrying two plates and silverware. He hides the present on the table behind her.)

SCULLY: Mulder, you never fail to surprise me. I just wish I felt like eating it right now.

MULDER: That's cool. We can just wait for the cheese to congeal and eat it later.

(He sits beside her on the sofa and sets the two plates on the table beside the open pizza box. He didn't skimp on the toppings. SCULLY has a wistful expression on her face. MULDER's face falls in mock depression.)

MULDER: You miss your regular pizza man, don't you?

(SCULLY pretends to pout.)

SCULLY: Yes. That's okay. He's coming by later.

(MULDER looks at her a moment, just insecure enough to wonder. She smiles at him warmly, he smiles and she laughs. From the table behind the couch, MULDER produces the gift he brought earlier.)

MULDER: I bet you forgot about that, didn't you?

SCULLY: No, I didn't, actually. I thought about it a lot while I was lying in my hospital bed wondering what on earth you could have given me.

(SCULLY is opening the gift.)

MULDER: And?

SCULLY: Oh, my god. Oh, Mulder.

(She is delighted. It is an old-fashioned home-made rag doll.)

MULDER: Is it what you imagined?

SCULLY: Not even close.

(She laughs. MULDER leans over and looks at the doll's embroidered face.)

MULDER: Oh, my, that's the wrong doll, actually.

(She makes as if to hit him with the doll. They laugh.)

SCULLY: But then that's the other gift that you gave me, Mulder.

(He looks at her questioningly. She looks back at him fondly.)

SCULLY: Courage... to believe. And I hope that's a gift I can pass on.

(MULDER glances down at her belly and they smile at each other. She gently touches the doll's face. Camera closes in on her face as it fades to )



SCENE 22

( DOGGETT's face, looking through the window of what looks like the door of a room in a mental hospital. In the room, KATHA DUKES lies strapped to the bed. She is unmoving, but her eyes stare straight ahead, an expression on confused horror frozen on her face. DOGGETT watches her.)

[Fade to black]

SCENE 1
GALPEX-ORPHEUS PLATFORM
GULF OF MEXICO
158 MILES OF THE COAST OF TEXAS

(Night. In the middle of the ocean, we can see a well lit and towering oil-drilling platform about a mile ahead of us. The camera closes in.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the crew's quarters. The TV is on showing an ice hockey game. The canteen is filled with about 20 men, eating dinner or watching the game. The camera tracks a Hispanic-looking man, DIEGO GARZA. He looks at another man, SIMON DE LA CRUZ, who is sitting down eating his dinner. They make eye contact, the two men seem to be uncomfortable with something. Suddenly, the TV loses its signal, and the screen is just snow. The crew get annoyed. The burly Chief, BO TAYLOR, walks up to the TV, and gives the top of the TV set a smack with his hand - the picture comes back. His co-workers cheer him. He turns to the crew.)

BO TAYLOR: You boys eat your vegetables or I'll do the same to you!

(We cut to the cook dishing up food for the workers. He puts some food onto a worker's plate.)

COOK: Hot meat, Senor.

(The cook sticks his large knife into a large piece of meat on the chopping board. DIEGO GARZA stares at the piece of meat. He makes eye contact again with the man eating his dinner, who looks up from his table. He notices the cook's knife.)

CUT TO:

(A stairwell. SIMON DE LA CRUZ is slowly descending the stairs, holding both rails. He turns onto a walkway. He enters the communications room. An engineer is sitting at a bench fixing some equipment. DE LA CRUZ enters the room.)

ENGINEER: ¡Hey Amigo! ¿Que pasó esta noche? (The engineer smiles. DE LA CRUZ stares back.) How was the roast beef? ¿Que cómo está el carne? ¿Bueno o malo?

(The engineer continues working. We see SIMON DE LA CRUZ is carrying the cook's knife from the canteen.)

(Suddenly, he lunges forwards and stabs the engineer from behind, who falls forward in pain.)

CUT TO:

(Ice hockey game on TV. A team scores, and the crew celebrate. Suddenly the picture goes again, and the crew moan. BO TAYLOR gets up again and approaches the TV. He gives it three hard smacks, but the picture doesn't come back. The crew are not happy.)

BO TAYLOR: Who's our communications officer?

CUT TO:

(BO TAYLOR is walking down the same walkway as before. We see some bright flashes. As he approaches the communications room, we hear loud banging and see bright flashes of light.)

BO TAYLOR: Hey, what gives with the ...

(He goes inside. He sees someone attacking the radio communications equipment. It's SIMON DE LA CRUZ)

BO TAYLOR: What the hell are you doing?

(DE LA CRUZ gets up, dropping his weapon, and tries to run. BO TAYLOR catches him, and throws him back onto the wall.

BO TAYLOR: Enough.

(He notices the engineer on the floor, doubled up. He turns him over.)

BO TAYLOR: Oh man.

(We can see the black oil under TAYLOR'S neck and face making its way into his eyes. We see DE LA CRUZ's face, looking scared.)

BO TAYLOR: Now you gone and done it.

(DE LA CRUZ tries to run, but BO TAYLOR gets hold of him around his neck and starts to strangle him. He's thrown to the ground. He looks up. Suddenly BO TAYLOR's eyes begin to glow bright white. We can see a white glow around his whole body. DE LA CRUZ cowers on the floor in fear, uttering words in Spanish.)

DE LA CRUZ: ¡Déjeme! ¡Déjeme! (Translation: Leave me alone! Leave me alone!) No, no, no, no, nooo, nooo-oooooooo ....

(SIMON DE LA CRUZ continues to scream out as BO TAYLOR is consumed in pure white light.)

(Fade to white.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
8:57 AM

(We see DOGGETT walking down the hallway in the basement to the office, reading the sports page of the newspaper. He gets to the office door and tries the handle. It's locked. He gets out his keys and unlocks the door. He opens it slowly, and we can see into the office. Standing in a corner, looking through some papers, is MULDER.)

DOGGETT: Am I interrupting anything, Agent Mulder?

(MULDER looks up to notice DOGGETT. He then looks back down at the papers.)

MULDER: Nothing you'd be too terribly interested in Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder. What are you doing down here?

MULDER: Looking into the recent death of an oil worker.

(MULDER hands DOGGETT the case file.)

DOGGETT: I got a heads up from you a couple of days ago.

MULDER: That's what I'm doing here.

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, I understand you have more than just a proprietary interest in these cases, but I can't help it if you're not assigned to this unit any more. (MULDER stares back at DOGGETT.) I didn't see any reason to pursue this oil worker case.

MULDER: Well maybe you missed the fact that this victim's corpse washes ashore in Port Arransis, Texas with massive flash burns on 90% of his body.

DOGGETT: I read the report Agent Mulder, if you're insinuating I didn't.

MULDER: Then you must also know that this man was not the only man to disappear from the Galpex-Orpheus platform that night, but one of two men. The communications officer is also missing.

DOGGETT: The company attributes that to an explosion on the rig, a blowout. Which is what they say caused Simon de la Cruz his burns.

MULDER: Burns the M.E. said in his report we not inconsistent to exposure to high levels of radiation.

DOGGETT: Not inconsistent. It's not exactly who I call a ringing endorsement.

MULDER: These files include the same kind of radiation phenomenon. Tissue destroyed by exposure to ...

DOGGETT:(Interrupting) Black oil. (DOGGETT starts to almost ridicule MULDER over the events from Piper Maru / Apocrypha from Season 3.) Five years ago, you and Agent Scully investigated a case of a World War Two plane salvaged from the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, where a sepsis was brought to the surface which you describe as a highly contagious virus of extra-terrestrial origin. That has radioactive properties and can take over a man's body. And it's part of an alien conspiracy to colonise the planet, if I'm not mistaken.

MULDER: (Smiling) And you'd love to help, but you left your light-sabre at home.

(DOGGETT nods)

MULDER: How'd you get stuck down here, Agent Doggett? Kersh catch you peeing in his cornflakes?

(There's an uncomfortable pause. The office phone rings, and both men reach to answer it. They look at each other. MULDER picks up the phone, but gives it to DOGGETT to answer.)

DOGGETT: John Doggett.

SCULLY:(On phone) The Deputy Director is waiting, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I was just on my way up.

SCULLY: (On screen) Why didn't you tell me you were pursuing the Texas oil worker case?

DOGGETT: (On phone) 'Cause I'm not.

SCULLY: Well there's an executive here from the oil company who says he was contacted by a man in our office.

DOGGETT: (Looking at Mulder) That'd be Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

DOGGETT: I'm gonna to let him answer that.



SCENE 3

(The Deputy Director's office. The door opens and in walks MULDER. SCULLY gets up. MULDER smiles warmly back at her.

MULDER: Just like old times.

KERSH: (Staring forwards) Now it's all making sense.

(We see SKINNER sitting opposite KERSH, he looks up and MULDER and then down again. SCULLY looks blankly at MULDER, and sits.)

MULDER: Tough crowd.

(KERSH stands up at his desk. We see an expensively-suited, bearded man sitting next to SKINNER, opposite KERSH.)

KERSH: Mr. Ortega, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder, the person you spoke to on the phone, I believe. (To the Agents) Mr. Ortega is Vice President of Operations for Galpex Petroleum out of Galveston, Texas.

MULDER: I believe we did speak, yeah.

KERSH: There's also confusion about who spoke to certain Government officials who seem to think the FBI is running an investigation into the accident.

MULDER: That would have been me as well, Sir, and that was in the best interest of the FBI and Mr. Ortega. I believe.

KERSH: Mr. Ortega would beg to differ, as would I.

ORTEGA: You complicated an already sensitive situation, Agent Mulder. Galpex Petroleum has discovered what we think may be a massive new oil province beneath the Gulf of Mexico. One that would give a huge advantage, financially and politically, to whoever gets to drill it.

SCULLY: Who else are we talking about?

ORTEGA: US territorial water cover the northern half of the Gulf. Our wells are on our side, but the field may spread well to the south. The Government of Mexico could claim it's theirs.

MULDER: This incident has nothing to do with that whatsoever. It's about the unexplained death of Simon de la Cruz.

ORTEGA: Simon de la Cruz was a Mexican national killed in a US business enterprise. They'd like nothing better than to use his death to get us to abandon the Orpheus rig so they can be the first to drill the province

KERSH: Leaving me no choice now but to conduct a criminal investigation, quickly and quietly, to take away any legal position that would affect American interests.

MULDER: A criminal investigation isn't doing to clear up anything.

KERSH: (Coldly) You've done more than enough Agent Mulder, thank you.

MULDER: I don't think you know exactly what you're dealing with here Sir.

KERSH: No, I think I do Agent.

MULDER:(Firmly) This is an X-File.

KERSH: And I'm sending someone from the X Files to investigate.

MULDER: You're talking about an oil rig that's 150 miles out at sea. You cant send a pregnant woman.

KERSH: I'm not sending Agent Scully.

(MULDER rolls his eyes. The camera focuses on DOGGETT.)



SCENE 4
GULF OF MEXICO
26 HOURS LATER

(Day. We follow a helicopter approaching the Orpheus rig, in the middle of the sea with nothing else in sight. The helicopter lands on the helipad on the rig. Two men are waiting on the rig, one of the SACHS, and two men get out, YURI VOLKOV and AGENT DOGGETT.

YURI: (Shaking hands) Yuri Volkov, Communications Specialist.

SACHS: Bring the new gear?

YURI: Yes, it's in there.

DOGGETT:(Shaking hands) John Doggett, Special Agent.

SACHS: Who?

DOGGETT: From the Bureau.

SACHS: FBI you say?

DOGGETT: Yeah. Someone told you I was coming I hope.

SACHS: No, got some new comm equipment.

DOGGETT: (Following him down some steel steps) You had radio problems? No-one told you about me coming?

SACHS: They got got shipped ashore. When they gave us the message it said just one Agent was coming.

(They stop on the steps.)

DOGGETT: Right, I'm the one Agent.

SACHS: Well then, who's the guy who get here this morning? Been talking to the crew chief for an hour.

(DOGGETT looks annoyed, and follows.)



SCENE 5

(DOGGETT enters a room on the rig. We can see MULDER sitting at a table with the burly Crew Chief, BO TAYLOR, from the teaser.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, can I have a word with you?

MULDER: If you give me a minute, I'm just getting in with details of the investigation. Why don't you pull up a chair and introduce yourself so Mr. Taylor won't have to repeat himself.

(DOGGETT looks at MULDER. There's a significant pause. DOGGETT then approaches Taylor.)

TAYLOR: I'm Bo Taylor. I was on night watch the day this thing went down.

(DOGGETT sits down opposite TAYLOR.)

DOGGETT: Go on Mr. Taylor.

TAYLOR: Men can go off the deep end out here, it's like a cabin fever of sorts. They're hundreds of miles away from their family and friends, 6 weeks at a stretch. Some of them might just well be doing hard time.

DOGGETT: So how does that figure with the victim, Simon de la Cruz?

TAYLOR: Well, mestizos are normally the most reliable men I know off on the drill floor. Simon, just lost his nut I guess. It's the only good explanation.

DOGGETT: Simon de la Cruz's body was found with flash burns. What's that got to do with him going off the deep end?

TAYLOR: Well hell, he tried to blow the whole damn rig. I mean it was sabotage, pure and simple. He knocked a cock of the gas valve, he must have sparked it cause it went faster than a Friday paycheck.

DOGGETT: What about the second victim?

MULDER: Communications chief, wasn't he?

TAYLOR: (Nodding) He probably never knew what hit him.

DOGGETT: What's the communications chief doing on the drilling floor?

TAYLOR: A man can die out here sir, just going for a walk. Probably what happened when it blew. Nobody knew he was gone until the shift change.

MULDER: I guess that's it, in a nutshell. Thank you Mr. Taylor.

(Mulder gets up and leaves.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder ...

(Doggett gets up and follows Mulder. The camera closes in on Taylor's staring face. We can see the black oil swirling around in his eyes.)



SCENE 6

(Outside on the platform deck. The camera pans down from the drilling tower to show DOGGETT about a pace behind MULDER.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder, don't walk away when I'm talking to you. Like it or not I've been assigned this case. One call to the Deputy Director and your up for insubordination.

MULDER: How are you going to call when the radio's broken?

DOGGETT: Don't push me Agent Mulder.

MULDER: You won't do it.

DOGGETT: You think?

MULDER: We're both in the same boat, Agent Doggett. We're just paddling in different directions.

DOGGETT: (Authoritatively) No we're not going in different directions here, we're going in one direction. My direction.

MULDER: I don't think Kersh expects you to come back empty handed on this one. Since you have already told me about what you think about this case in so many words, I don't see you coming back with anything that's gonna protect anybody's business interests let alone your own ass.

DOGGETT: Well you really got me pegged. Anything that doesn't fit in my narrow field of vision might as well not exist, is that right Agent Mulder? (MULDER looks at DOGGETT) So why is this man Taylor lying? You do know he's lying?

MULDER: I think he knows that truth about what happened, and he may not be the only one.

DOGGETT: I never would have believed it. These stories about you.

MULDER: Really, what stories are those?

DOGGETT: That you can find a conspiracy at a church picnic.

MULDER:(Deadpan Duchovny) What church?

(DOGGETT smiles. MULDER heads off. We see a pair of boots walking over a grating, revealing somebody hiding in the space below. It's DIEGO GARZA.)



SCENE 7

(Autopsy room. Scully is in a white coat with a face mask around her neck. We see a very badly burned body on a steel dissecting table behind her. The door opens and SKINNER enters.)

SCULLY: Close the door and lock it.

SKINNER: What's going on? You said you wanted to see me straight away.

SCULLY: I didn't know who else to talk to, and I haven't been able to reach Agent Mulder.

SKINNER: About what?

SCULLY: About what I found in my autopsy of the oil rig victim, Simon de la Cruz

SKINNER: Agent Scully, this man's body was supposed to be transported back to Mexico completely intact.

SCULLY: I found it by accident in the third ventricle of his brain.

(She uses her tweezers to pull something out from his dissected skull. Suddenly a large pool of black oil forms on the table beside his head. SKINNER looks shocked. He reaches for SCULLY to pull her away to safety.)

SKINNER: Scully!

SCULLY: No it's OK, it's alright.

SKINNER: What do you mean? I was under the impression that this stuff could literally jump into a man's body.

SCULLY: No, it can, and I've seen that happen. But that's the thing - this man was clearly infected by the alien virus. It entered his system and it was massing in the pineal gland, but it's dead.

SKINNER: What killed it?

SCULLY: Well intuitively, you would say the same thing that killed him - exposure to high levels of radiation. But it makes no sense because the virus itself has radioactive properties.

SKINNER: Someone needs to tell Agent Doggett that. He needs to have some kind of idea as to what he's dealing with out there.

SCULLY: No, you need to tell Deputy Director Kersh that he has to order a controlled evacuation of that rig right now.

SKINNER: Don't tell me to go to Kersh with this evidence. Telling him to order an evacuation for something that you cant even explain

SCULLY: If the virus is loose, Agent Doggett's life is in danger.

SKINNER: We don't know that for sure. There are nearly two dozen men on that rig and not one other case. Why?

(SCULLY can't give an answer.)



SCENE 8

(Sunset. Back on the rig. We see YURI VOLKOV, the comms engineer, working with the radio, apparently trying to get it working. TAYLOR enters wearing a hard-hat and walks up to him.)

TAYLOR: Hey Yuri, heard you had some problems with the radio.

YURI: This gear's all online working fine. But there's some sort of high frequency interference that I have no idea how to get rid off. Hear that? That's the signal that's coming in. Filtering in across a large range of channels. I don't think I have any choice but to power down and restore.

TAYLOR: (Threateningly) No, you can't do that!

YURI: I hate to argue with you.

(TAYLOR grabs YURI around the neck and throws him through the air into some shelves. He grabs him around the neck and holds him down on the floor, leaning over him. YURI's mouth is open trying to breath. We see black oil pooling in TAYLOR's eyes. Suddenly, the oil starts pouring from his eyes and mouth all over YURI's face. The black oil starts to move towards YURI's eyes, nose and mouth, quickly entering his body.)



SCENE 9

(Back in the comms rooms. We hear a garbled transmission being received on the radio.)

MARINE OPERATOR: (Slightly distorted) This is the marine operator for Galpex-Orpheus. Come in Orpheus. I have a priority transmission, repeat, this is a priority transmission.

(The camera focuses on the radio. Someone approaches it. We see it's YURI.)

YURI: This is Orpheus, go ahead.

CUT TO:

(Laboratory. We see some scans on a light box. SCULLY is on the phone, giving the priority message to the rig. She's examining what look like possibly DNA blots)

SCULLY: Orpheus, I've been trying to reach you for hours. This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I have an urgent message for an investigative agent on board, an Agent John Doggett.

YURI: I'm ready to take that message.

SCULLY: No I'm sorry, I need to speak with Agent Doggett directly.

(We see a hand appear on YURI's shoulder. We see its MULDER.)

MULDER: I got it (MULDER sits down in front of the microphone. YURI leaves.) Well I'm sorry, Agent Doggett's gone fishing. Can I take a message please?

SCULLY: (Surprised) Mulder?

MULDER: I was just in the neighbourhood.

SCULLY: Mulder you can't just flout orders like this. It's not like old times. Kersh isn't going to tolerate this.

MULDER: Kersh doesn't need to know.

SCULLY: (Worried) Mulder.

MULDER: You need me out here Scully, you know that better than anyone.

SCULLY: I'd hate to say as of this morning I'd have to agree.

MULDER: Who's flouting orders, you found something didn't you, in that victim's body. The virus?

SCULLY: Yes I did, and it's dead Mulder.

MULDER: Dead? What killed it?

SCULLY: Possibly radiation.

MULDER: That's not possible.

SCULLY: I know I know, and this could be an isolated event, but that he's infected at all means that everybody out there could be at risk. And that means you and Agent Doggett.

MULDER: We got to quarantine this rig.

SCULLY: No Mulder, you need to get off the rig. Have Agent Doggett give the order. We can quarantine you and the crew when we get back here.

MULDER: Scully, if these men are infected the last place we want to is onshore where they can infect other people. You're sitting on the answer right there, Scully. The body, you find the virus, you can find what knocks it out, you can find what kills it.

SCULLY: And what if I can't?

MULDER: (Joking) When he's old enough, tell the kid I went down swinging!

SCULLY: Let me talk to Agent Doggett.

MULDER: Agent Doggett's not here right now.

(DOGGETT appears in the doorway. MULDER finishes the call and walks out, past DOGGETT.)

DOGETT: Who was that on the radio?

(MULDER walks past him, without looking back.

DOGGETT: Who were you talking to?

(DOGGETT follows MULDER into an open area inside the rig.)

DOGGETT: Hey!

MULDER: That was Agent Scully.

DOGGETT: What did she say?

MULDER: She said it was lucky that I'm out here.

DOGGETT: No, you're lucky that I'm letting you stay. You got information important to this investigation then I damn well better know about it. I'm in charge out here, Agent.

MULDER: Alright, then go ahead and take charge, Only you might not like what it means in this case. What you're going to have to do with that information you're so anxious to have.



SCENE 10

(An open space inside the rig. We see a man, SACHS, walking along a walkway to some stairs, overlooking where the crew are relaxing.)

SACHS: Alright, listen up. I'm gonna make this brief. We've been given an order to quarantine the rig. (The crew show their annoyance. DOGGETT walks into the shot) At fourteen hundred hours we officially shut down and lock down. You're gonna be stuck here a while, all flights in and out have been suspended. I know I know, you're gonna have to cooperate until the FBI's certain everything is shipshape. Now for everybody's protection we need to all of us cooperate fully.

ED DELL: Oh man!

TAYLOR: Protection from what?

DOGGETT: From a possible contagion.

TAYLOR: (Turning to crew) Anybody here feel sick?

CREW: (Together) No!

SACHS: Alright, knock it off, I need everybody to check their water consumption, and we'll be cutting back to half rations.

(The crew are obviously pissed off. We see MULDER and DOGGETT moving around the room, checking the men. MULDER approaches the man in charge.)

MULDER: I've been going over the crew manifest Mr. Sachs, and there appears to be a problem.

SACHS: Problem with what?

MULDER: According to the manifest there's supposed to be eighteen men onboard. I count only seventeen including you.

SACHS: This is my whole crew in here.

(We see a close up of part of the crew's manifest that Mulder is examining)

DE LA CRUZ, SIMON
DELL, ED
GARZA, DIEGO
GORDON, MAC
HARBOUR, ROBERT
HOXWORTH, JACK

MULDER: (To SACHS) Diego Garza, where's he?

DOGGETT: Who?

SACHS: Deck hand. A friend of Simon de la Cruz. The man who tried to sabotage the rig. (SACHS walks into the middle of the room to check everybody.) Well I'll be damned.

DOGGETT: What, he's not here?

(Sachs shakes his head.)

MULDER: Any idea where he might be?

SACHS: Well he didn't leave the rig, not by any means I know of.

MULDER: (To DOGGETT) What do you say we go and find him?

(DOGGETT nods in agreement.)



SCENE 11

(Autopsy room. We can make out a body lying under a white sheet. Suddenly the sheet is pulled off revealing the body of Simon de la Cruz.

SCULLY: This man was exposed to a virus.

(We see MR ORTEGA standing next to SCULLY. He turns away as SCULLY lifts up the sheet.)

ORTEGA: And why do I need to see this?

SCULLY: To understand what your crew may be infected with. What they risk spreading on or off that rig.

ORTEGA: You understand Galpex is eager to cooperate, but shutting down a producing rig costs us in the neighbourhood of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars, a day, and according to my OIM, no-one on that rig is sick, they're just hungry and tired.

SKINNER: You don't know that for sure.

ORTEGA: Well, what symptoms would they be showing, what would we see?

SCULLY: Unexplained behaviour, possible detection in the eyes ..

ORTEGA: We've seen none of that.

SKINNER: You're relying on suspect data.

ORTEGA: I'm relying on medical reports, and unless you give me more than this, I'm calling that Orpheus crew back in. bringing them home, and rotating a fresh crew onto that rig.

(SCULLY looks very worried and can't believe what he's saying.)

SCULLY: Oh my god.

(A worried look appears on SKINNER's face.)



SCENE 12

(Day. Back on the rig. MULDER is climbing to metal steps on the very edge of the rig. We can see the sea far below him.)

DOGGETT: So what are hoping to find Agent Mulder, honestly?

MULDER: I'm hoping to find Diego Garza.

DOGGETT: There's no chance of that if you ask me. A man could disappear of this platform and no-one would even notice.

MULDER: Did you see the crew manifest? It listed Diego Garza as mestizo, of mixed Mexican descent, just like his friend who died?

DOGGETT: Yeah. So what?

MULDER: Well the crew chief said these mestizo were particularly good workers, but we've got one dead trying to sabotage the rig and another missing. If he's one of their best workers you'd think someone would've noticed him missing.

DOGGETT: Yeah so maybe he's still here. Maybe he's just waiting to finish the job that killed his friend to protect Mexican oil.

MULDER: These men are hiding something, but that's not it.

DOGGETT: You know, I quarantine a whole damn oil rig without any evidence to support what you're saying, not one damn thing, but you still have yet to give me straight answer as to what you think is going on out here. If these men are hiding something, if they're protecting something, then what the hell is it?

MULDER: I don't know yet.

DOGGETT: And when you do, let me know, cause I've got to get on the radio to justify this action.

(DOGGETT walks off. MULDER follows after a moment. DOGGETT is now descending some stairs, following by MULDER)

MULDER: I didn't come out here just to bust your ass. I'm telling you, I've seen this substance. I've seen it can take over a man's body. This crew could be infected and not even know it. They may have no idea they're being controlled.

(DOGGETT touches an oily piece of machinery, and rubs the oil between his fingers.)

DOGGETT: This? This is what you're saying is going to take over my body? Well when's it going to kick in?

MULDER: That's not how it works. It body jumps from man to man, and I'm not sure that it's in all oil.

DOGGETT: Well that's a relief, because only ninety percent of the planet is dependent on the stuff.

MULDER: The man from Galpex oil lied ...

DOGGETT: What, he's infected too?

MULDER: No, that new oil field is already in production. It's already being pumped by this rig. That's how this crew got infected.

DOGGETT: You're reaching Agent Mulder

MULDER: Billions and billions of barrels lying right underneath us, waiting to be produced, waiting to infect that ninety percent of the planet you talked about.

DOGGETT: If these men are hiding something. That'd sure be something to hide.

(DOGGETT turns and walks off.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett (DOGGETT turns back) what if that's why this man is hiding, this Diego Garza, because he knows what they're up to, and he knows what they're up to because he's the only one who's not infected with this alien virus.

DOGGETT: Alright, he knows. Why doesn't he just come down here and tell us?

(Suddenly an alarm sounds. MULDER and DOGGETT look around. The move in search of the cause of the alarm. We see flames coming from inside one of the rooms)

(MULDER and DOGGETT are racing down the steps towards the alarm.)

MULDER: It's the radio room!

(MULDER and DOGGETT enter the communications room and reach for the fire extinguisher, held back by the flames)

DOGGETT: I'll go find another one.

(MULDER tackles the fire with the extinguisher. We see DOGGETT running around looking for another. He sees one and rushes up to it. Just as he takes it off the wall, he is hit from behind and falls to the ground, unconscious. We see the culprit is the man they are looking for, DIEGO GARZA.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 13

(Autopsy room. It's dimly lit as SCULLY enters. She is startled by a voice in the corner of the room.)

KERSH: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Sir?

KERSH: You're in a hurry. To do what?

SCULLY: To continue with my work, Sir.

KERSH: (Walking towards Scully) I'm not privy to this work. I'd have thought this body would have been on its way back to Mexico.

(The door opens, and SKINNER appears in the doorway. SCULLY exchanges glances with him.)

KERSH: I obviously haven't been able to rely on those whose job it is to keep me apprised and informed. I have to rely on phone calls, like the call I received from Martin Ortega. Why doesn't somebody make me privy to who the hell gave the order to shut down that rig.

SKINNER: I did.

KERSH: Well I'm giving the order that this quarantine is lifted.

SCULLY: We could do that Sir, but all radio contact has been cut off.

KERSH: As soon as it's re-established I want that rig up and running, and the entire crew choppered off the Galpex-Orpheus and debriefed.

SCULLY: Sir, I think that would be a mistake ...

KERSH: I think it would be a mistake not to, Agent Scully. And you're running out of mistakes, both you, and the Assistant Director. (This whole scene exudes authority on KERSH's part. He glances at SCULLY and SKINNER, and walks to the doorway) If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a Mulder stunt.

(KERSH stands in the doorway for a moment, looking straight at SKINNER with contempt. SCULLY is noticeably shaken by the Deputy Director.)



SCENE 14

(Sunset. Aboard the rig, MULDER and SACHS are examining what's left in the communications room.)

SACHS: This stuff was all brand new.

MULDER: What is it about this room that inspires men to violence?

SACHS: You think this fire was set?

(MULDER bends down and picks something up.)

MULDER: Molotov cocktail anyone?

(SACHS looks at the remains.)

MULDER: Can I borrow your radio Mr. Sachs? (SACHS gives him the radio) Agent Doggett, you there?

MULDER'S VOICE ON RADIO: Agent Doggett, do you copy?

(We can see DOGGETT's radio on the ground. A shape starts to move, as it comes into focus we see it is DOGGETT coming to. He's holding his forehead.)

MULDER: (On radio) Agent Doggett. Come in Agent Doggett.

(We see DOGGETT getting up, but GARZA attacks him with a blade and cuts his forearm. DOGGETT grimaces. GARZA notices the blood on DOGGETT's arm and hand.)

GARZA: (In Spanish) Sangre colorada (Translation: Red blood.)

DOGGETT: Yeah my blood's red.

(DOGGETT stands up, with his arms up.)

GARZA: (In Spanish) Lo mataron a Simón. Soy el único que queda. Si me encuentran, me matan. (Subtitles: They killed Simon. If they find me, they'll kill me, too.)

DOGGETT: Tranquilo. I don't speak very good Spanish. Diego. Tu eres Diego Garza?? (Translation: Calm down. Your name is Diego Garza?)

GARZA: (In Spanish) Lo mataron, yo los miré. Ellos querían el radio. Por eso es que encendí la lumbre. (Translation: They wanted the radio. That's why I started the fire.)

DOGGETT: (Trying to understand) That's too fast. You're saying you set the fire? What are you afraid of?

(GARZA reaches toward Doggett.)

GARZA: (In Spanish) Tenemos que detenerlos antes que sea muy tarde. Ya vienen! Ya vienen! (Translation: We have to stop them before it's too late. They're coming! They're coming!)

DOGGETT: Vienen. Vienen (DOGGETT finally understands GARZA.) They're coming? Who? Who's coming?

GARZA: (In Spanish) Los platillos. Los platillos voladores. (Translation: The ships. The flying ships.)

(GARZA looks upwards, indicating what he is trying to explain.)



SCENE 15

(A computer monitor is displaying what appear to be computer-generated 3D organic molecules. There are only 2 shown on the screen.)

SCULLY: (Offscreen) I think I've got something.

SKINNER:(Offscreen) What?

SCULLY: (Offscreen) This is an SEM image pulled at random from anonymous donors.

(We see SCULLY sitting at the computer with SKINNER at her side.)

SKINNER: What off?

SCULLY: Blood. More specifically, normal T-cell antibodies. By comparison these are from the blood of the oil rig worker (A new image appears, showing many more objects on the screen) T-cells in impossible numbers. In layman's terms, this victim was a virus fighting machine.

SKINNER: How do you explain that?

SCULLY: Well, there are isolated cultures. In northern Italy for one, where people are immune to certain diseases - heart disease in that case, through a genetic mutation.

SKINNER: So this man had what, kind of genetic immunity to the alien virus?

SCULLY: Well his employment records list Mr. Simon de la Cruz as of mixed Mexican ancestry, when in fact he is Waicha Indian. The Waicha are an indigenous Mexican culture that has a rare undiluted gene pool. Now these genes may have an innate immunity to infection.

SKINNER: OK, so he was immune to the virus. That's still not what killed him. He died from being burned.

SCULLY: No, not burned. Irradiated. (SCULLY pulls the sheet from the body.) Because the virus had no effect on him. The crew members who were affected by the virus couldn't control him, so they killed him, by irradiating him.

SKINNER: Then why not kill Mulder? Or Agent Doggett? Why kill only this man?

SCULLY: This man must have been a threat, because of something he knew.

SKINNER: What?

SCULLY: That I don't know.

SKINNER: So even if we did know, and were able to give word to them, It'd put Mulder and Agent Doggett in danger too. Wouldn't it?

(SCULLY and SKINNER exchange very worried looks.)



SCENE 16

(A shot of a photograph of a dark-haired woman and two children, perhaps a wife and children. We pan back to DOGGETT and GARZA.)

DOGGETT: (In Spanish) ¿Su familia? ¿Fotografía? (Translation: Your family? The photograph?) Your family? You want to get back to them? I can help you. (In Spanish) Señor. Confía en mí. (Translation: Trust me.)

GARZA: (In Spanish) Yo no confío en nadie. (Translation: I trust nobody.)

DOGGETT: Right. Trust no one. (Pause) If you stay here, they will find you, just like your friend. (Pause) Let me go. I will get you back home. You have my word. Mi promesa.

(GARZA looks at DOGGETT who nods his head in reassurance.)

CUT TO:

(A man walking through the rig - we see it's Doggett. BO TAYLOR appears from nowhere in front of DOGGETT.)

TAYLOR: Where's Garza?

(He looks menacingly towards DOGGETT.)

TAYLOR: Where is he?

DOGGETT: I'll go get Agent Mulder.

(He turns away but TAYLOR grabs him around the neck. As they grapple with each other, DOGGETT sees with alarm the black oil welling up in TAYLOR'S eyes. Suddenly TAYLOR is hit from behind. We see it's MULDER. MULDER hits him repeatedly with a steel bar which he then drops with a clang on the floor. He helps DOGGETT up.)

MULDER: Get up, Agent Doggett. (He points to TAYLOR lying unconscious/dead on the ground.) There's more where that came from.

(MULDER and DOGGETT run off and into the comms shack.)

MULDER: You know anything about radio, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Yeah, I know a little.

MULDER: Let's see what little you know and get that ship-to-shore working.

(MULDER secures the door.)

DOGGETT: Call who?

MULDER: Anybody who can get us off here.

(Someone starts hammering on the door.)

MULDER: Get to work!

(As the attack on the door continues, MULDER stands armed with a metal pipe, while DOGGETT sits down at the radio.)

CUT TO:

(Outside the door. We see it's SAKSA. He stops kicking at the door and slowly looks around - crew members are standing there, one approaches him. We hear sounds of battering while oil starts to well up in the eyes of the watching crew members.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 17

(A long show of the Galpex-Orpheus oil rig lit up in the night sky.)

(Inside the communications room the door hinges show signs of weakening. MULDER pushes any furniture he can find up against the door.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett!

DOGGETT: I'm working on it.

MULDER: I don't think this door is going to hold much longer.

(The static changes to music.)

MULDER: Wagner?

(We hear strains of "The Ride of the Valkyries" on the radio.)

DOGGETT: What do you want?

MULDER: I take it back. It's perfect.

(Doggett searches through the mess of wires and finds the microphone.)

VOICE ON RADIO: Orpheus, this is the Marine Operator. I repeat, this is an emergency priority transmission for the Galpex-Orpheus.

DOGGETT: Yeah, you got John Doggett on board the Galpex-Orpheus. Come in.

(There is just static. The hammering on the door continues.)

DOGGETT: This is John Doggett.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, yeah, I'm right here.

(SCULLY is on a phone. We can her the loud banging on the rig as she speaks.)

SCULLY: Can you hear me?

DOGGETT: Yes!

SCULLY: What was that?

MULDER: That's someone knocking on the door.

(MULDER runs back to the door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me.

(Mulder turns with a "so what now?" expression.)

SCULLY: I think I know why they killed this man, if not how they killed him.

DOGGETT: Right now we got bigger problems. We need a chopper.

SCULLY: We've got choppers on the way.

MULDER: Tell her all the men here are infected. She's got to get the word to the choppers. Not to land on the platform.

DOGGETT: Well, how they supposed to get us?

(The door is disintegrating.)

MULDER: Well, that problem is rapidly becoming moot!

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, listen - there are three men on board here that are not infected, me, Mulder and a man named Diego Garza who may be mentally unstable, could be why he tried to wreck this radio room just like his friend Simon de la Cruz. He may resist rescue attempt because he believes there are men in flying saucers who are coming to get him. Agent Scully, do you get that? Agent Scully?

(During this, MULDER has picked up a metal pipe and approaches DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: You're breaking up!

(MULDER pushes the radio which sparks on to the ground. MULDER kicks it repeatedly.)

DOGGETT: What the hell are you doing?

MULDER: Destroying their ability to transmit just like Diego and Simon de la Cruz.

DOGGETT: What are you talking about?

MULDER: I'm talking about contact.

DOGGETT: Contact with whom? The mother ship?

(The banging on the door has ceased.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett, listen.

(He puts his hand on DOGGETT's chest. DOGGETT angrily brushes it off.)

DOGGETT: Now you just back off.

MULDER: No, no, no, listen.

(There is silence. MULDER pushes the furniture away from the door and opens it. MULDER and DOGGETT exit - there's no one around.)

DOGGETT: Where they go?

MULDER: I don't know, and I don't want to stick around to find out.

(They look around for crew members.)

MULDER: Let's go, Agent Doggett.

(MULDER runs through the rig, and climbs a metal ladder, DOGGETT follows him.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder! I can't leave him.

MULDER: Who?

DOGGETT: Diego Garza.

(DOGGETT runs off towards DIEGO GARZA.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett!

DOGGETT: ¡Diego! ¡Diego! ¿Donde estás? (Translation: Diego, Diego, where are you?)

(DOGGETT sees him in the shadows.)

DOGGETT: Diego, get up. Come on, let's go.

(He grabs GARZA, who slumps to the floor. He is covered in horrific burns.)

MULDER: Is he coming?

(DOGGETT gets up.)

DOGGETT: No.

(They hear choppers approaching and run off to rendezvous with them.)

CUT TO:

(Choppers are approaching the oil rig)

VOICE ON RADIO: Come in Galpex-Orpheus.

MULDER: Agent Doggett, I think I know why they let us go.

DOGGETT: What?! Agent Mulder, what are you talking about? What's going on?

MULDER: They're going to blow the rig.

DOGGETT: Who?

(They see several crew members approaching them. All around pipes and valves are vibrating loudly as though pressure is building up inside them.)

DOGGETT: Let's go.

(They run. As they run along a walkway, flames arise in front of them. They double back. There are flames everywhere. They run into crew members again. Changing direction they emerge out on the outside edge of the rig. The chopper is there. A loudspeaker message from the chopper: "Abandon rig!". The chopper pilot points down towards the sea. Flames are now appearing all over the rig.)

DOGGETT: What's he saying?

MULDER: I think he wants us to jump.

(They both hesitate, looking down at the distance to the water's surface below them.)

DOGGETT: Now, wait a minute Agent Mulder, I'm in charge here. On two count.

MULDER: How about a 20 count?

DOGGETT: One! Two!

(As they both jump there are explosions and flames just above them. We see them falling in slow motion. Then the rig starts to collapse into the sea. Explosions are happening all over the rig.)



SCENE 18

(Back at the FBI. There's a shot of someone's feet approaching the X-Files office. It's DOGGETT. He checks his watch then enters the office and picks up a cardboard box.)

MULDER: Where's the fire, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: I've been called up to see Deputy Director Kersh. As have Agent Scully and AD Skinner. I think it's all hitting the fan.

MULDER: You mean Galpex Oil?

DOGGETT: Word came down that Galpex has lost the right to drill that entire Texas oil province.

MULDER: That oil should stay right where it is. You should do everything in your power to make sure that it does.

DOGGETT: Me?

(The phone rings.)

MULDER: That is the Deputy Director calling to tell you there is no need to see you. That the blame has been properly assigned for what happened out on that platform. I'm out. 86'd, Agent Doggett.

(MULDER puts on his jacket.)

DOGGETT: What do you mean. You're out of the FBI?

MULDER: Kersh could barely contain his happiness. He stuck it to me.

DOGGETT: So, you taking the fall?

(MULDER shrugs.)

DOGGETT: Not for me?

MULDER: For you. For the X-Files. You're all the credibility this office has left. You have Kersh's ear and you have seen it now. Out on that platform. You saw it for yourself.

(The phone rings again.)

MULDER: Answer the phone, Agent Doggett. You're in charge here now.

(MULDER shakes DOGGETT's hand, then walks out the office.)

(The phone on the desk continues to ring as DOGGETT looks at it.)

[Fade to black]

[THE END]



                                ALONE


SCENE 1

(Night. A windy rural location. Car draws up outside house. A man gets out. Inside the house there's a monitoring machine, bleeping regularly and showing red figures: 62, changing to 63. DrWeesh adds that this is measuring somebody's heartrate.)

YOUNG MAN: It's freezing out there.

OLDER MAN: You weren't gone long.

(The YOUNG MAN hangs up his coat and goes to the fire.)

OLDER MAN: Did you do what I asked?

YOUNG MAN: Yes.

OLDER MAN: It's important, Gary. Promise me you did it.

YOUNG MAN: You're sick, Dad. You should be in a hospital not stuck out here in the middle of nowhere. You don't owe this guy Stites anything.

OLDER MAN: It's not about owing.

YOUNG MAN: I freeze my butt off, checking and re-checking the locks every night. For what?

OLDER MAN: You don't need to know.

YOUNG MAN: Yeah, that's for sure. I'm gonna fix some dinner.

(The YOUNG MAN leaves the room.)

(The camera looks down from above on the OLDER MAN in his wheelchair. The fire flares, the bleeping grows faster, he notices there's a window open, the read-out on the monitor shows 76 and rising rapidly - 79, 83. The OLDER MAN seems to be suffering some kind of seizure. The bleeping increases to a very fast rate.)

(The camera pans down from over the OLDER MAN to around and to the side of him. He's having trouble breathing.)

OLDER MAN: Oh, Lord.

(Something lunges at the OLD MAN.)

(CUT TO: Kitchen. A microwave bleeps. The YOUNG MAN takes out a package. Then hears the monitor emitting a continuous *flatline* tone.)

YOUNG MAN: Oh, God.

(In main room he sees the wheelchair overturned, the wheel spinning)

YOUNG MAN: Dad?

(He switches off the monitor. Looks around. Sees open door. Goes slowly towards it. Hears something behind him. We see a slithery, snake-like creature, or the tail of a slithery creature. Something suddenly lunges towards him, too fast to recognize. We see razor sharp teeth just as the picture fades to the opening credits.)

SCENE 2

(FBI Basement Office. SCULLY is collecting her things and putting them in a box. She picks up the fused coins from the Dreamland I and II episodes (6X04/6X05) and looks at it with a smile. Then she picks up Queequeg's bone-shaped collar tag. She is sad.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

(SCULLY conceals her sadness and smiles brightly at DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Can I take your coat?

SCULLY: I'm not staying, Agent Doggett. My doctor told me to take my maternity leave. In fact, she insisted on it.

DOGGETT: That's not bad, Agent Scully, you could use some time for yourself.

(SCULLY picks up the box and walks towards DOGGETT. She is holding something in her hand.)

DOGGETT: What is it?

SCULLY: It's a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight. I'd like to give this to you, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Thanks.

(He looks at it. It's about 2 inches in diameter, with a gold edge. The picture is of the moon surface with an eagle touching down, and the earth in the distance.)

DOGGETT: Because?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder gave it to me a few years back. It symbolizes team-work, partnership. (DOGGETT looks at the reverse of the medallion. Inscribed are the words "Commemorating Apollo 11 and it's mission to the moon. July 1969"). It means no-one gets there alone. And after this past year and everything that we've been through, it just, (pauses) I wouldn't be here without you.

(SCULLY embraces DOGGETT and they hug.)

(SCULLY nods a couple of times and moves towards the door.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully. This pregnancy leave - it's just a leave, right? I mean, you are coming back eventually?

(SCULLY smiles, a warm yet wistful smile, and walks out the door.)

(DOGGETT looks unsure, looks around the office - the "I Want to Believe" poster is still there on the wall.)

(Then he hears footsteps and whirls around towards the door, smiling.)

DOGGETT: You're not gone five minutes, Agent Scully, and already I'm starting to feel a stranger in my own off ...

(his voice trails off as he sees the person who is standing in the doorway.)

HARRISON: I'm sorry?

DOGGETT: Can I help you?

HARRISON: I'm here to help you, actually. I'm Leyla Harrison. I've been looking forward to meeting you.

DOGGETT: Uh-uh?

HARRISON: I've got a case here. An X-File, I think. At least the local PD can't explain it. A murder last night in up-state New York. I've booked us on a flight to Buffalo, Niagara. Here's the crime report.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, Ms. Harrison. Who are you?

HARRISON: (Smiling) Oh, gosh. They didn't tell you? This is so embarrassing. I, uh, I'm your new partner.



SCENE 3
ELLICOT, NEW YORK
10:47 AM

(Overhead shot of car drawing up. DOGGETT gets out - as does HARRISON. She gets a clipboard out of her shoulder bag. We see the Coroner's van. A body is transported on a gurney - we see it's the corpse of the OLDER MAN)

HARRISON: I've asked that the body be sent to DC. It was found in the woods about 50 yards beyond the house. Maybe we should begin there.

DOGGETT: Let's begin inside the house.

HARRISON: OK then.

(CUT TO: Inside house. DOGGETT ducks under police tape and puts on gloves. HARRISON reads from a file.)

HARRISON: The deceased is Arlen Sacks, aged 72, caretaker for the estate on which this house is situated. There were no signs of physical trauma but local PD suspect homicide due to the dumping of the body. Mr. Sacks was confined to a wheelchair for the last few months and cared for since then by his son Gary, who's their chief suspect.

DOGGETT: Why?

(He's examining a substance he's picked up on his latex-gloved finger.)

HARRISON: Um, because he's missing too.

DOGGETT: Someone killed this man without leaving a mark. That would suggest premeditation and an attempt to disguise a murder. That doesn't fit with dumping the body in the woods and fleeing the scene, both of which indicate panic, haste.

(DOGGETT goes to window)

HARRISON: That's great. What was that last part again about the premeditation? (DOGGETT is looking at something on his glove.) What is that? Slime?

DOGGETT: There's a small streak of it on the floor over there, too.

HARRISON: So it's not someone, it's something? (DOGGETT looks at her) God, this really is an X-File, isn't it?

DOGGETT: Congratulations. (Harrison takes out her clipboard again, ready.)



SCENE 4

(Outside in a wooded area. HARRISON is following DOGGETT.)

HARRISON: I gave the slime to the Buffalo PD. I told them we wanted to see the results right away.

DOGGETT: How much field experience do you have, Agent Harrison?

HARRISON: Um, actually this is my first time in the field.

DOGGETT: Let me guess - Deputy Director Kersh handed you this job, filling in for Agent Scully.

HARRISON: Yes, yes he did.

DOGGETT: I don't know how to tell you this, Agent Harrison. You're being used. Deputy Director Kersh is no friend of the X-Files.

HARRISON: I don't think you understand something, Agent Doggett. I begged for this assignment.

(DOGGETT stops in his tracks and turns to HARRISON.)

DOGGETT: You begged for it.

HARRISON: I was in accounting. I processed Agents Mulder and Scully's travel expenses.

DOGGETT: Then you are qualified.

HARRISON: Maybe I'm not. But I know the X-Files, Agent Doggett. Inside and out. Other people don't even want to admit these questions exist but you face them every day. I am just so excited to be part of this. Aren't you?

(DOGGETT is impassive.)

(The camera enters a taped-off area in the woods, and DOGGETT kneels down.)

HARRISON: Mr. Sacks' body was found here but they found no footsteps leading to it.

(DOGGETT finds some more slime on his gloved finger.)

HARRISON: Oh my god. There's more of it.

DOGGETT: Looks like it.

HARRISON: You know what that could be? It could be bile.

DOGGETT: (DOGGETT stands up, taken aback) Bile?

HARRISON: From a liver-eating mutant. Mulder and Scully chased one into an escalator once. It died but, but, there was just ... (Harrison is referring to the events in 1X02 Squeeze and 1X20 Tooms)

DOGGETT: This is not a liver-eating mutant, Agent Harrison.

HARRISON: It could be an alien that shed its skin. According to Agent Mulder's case reports they leave behind a mucus-like residue when they, ah, (pause) You don't think it's that either. I'll take a sample of this and have it sent to the lab for comparison. (Possibly referring to 6X01 The Beginning.)

DOGGETT: That's good thinking, Agent Harrison.

(HARRISON goes off)

(We hear an animal-like noise. DOGGETT sees something in the woods. We see a creature's tail. He follows it.)



SCENE 5

(Knock on door, it's SCULLY's apartment. MULDER is at the door.)

MULDER: Hey. Ready to roll?

SCULLY: Yeah. I'll just get my keys.

MULDER: Hey, don't forget this. (He picks up a cushion and stuffs it under his shirt). Relax the back, breathe in, breathe out (makes panting noises).

SCULLY: How do you know all these things, Mulder?

MULDER: I'm unemployed. I have a lot of time on my hands. Oprah. I watch a lot of Oprah.

SCULLY: Thank you for doing this with me.

MULDER: What's the matter?

SCULLY: I don't know, I, uh, maybe it's hormones, or, I just, it's just, I'm just feeling so strange about all this.

MULDER: This having-a-baby this?

SCULLY: No, no, leaving work, I guess. I mean, I, I walked out of that office today feeling like a deserter.

MULDER: You paid your dues there, Scully. More than paid them. You're concerned about Agent Doggett?

SCULLY: You know, the entire time that I was down there I had someone to watch my back.

MULDER: I'm betting that Agent Doggett can take care of himself. He's a big boy. You gotta worry about the little boy. (Smiling) Or little girl. Boy? Or girl?

(SCULLY is enigmatic.)



SCENE 6

(DOGGETT is walking through the woods. He emerges onto a lawn in front of a large secluded house.)

(CUT TO: Inside. It's dark. DOGGETT walks along a corridor. The house seems shut up, plastic sheets covering objects on the wall. He walks into a room where plastic sheets cover everything. He pulls a sheet off a desk with a computer and books on it. There are also some collecting tubes used for blood samples. He picks up a book: "The Sixth Extinction" by Richard Leakey. He opens it - there's a hand-written message inside the cover "For Herman Stites. May you find what you seek."

Cut to view along corridor, camera pushes forward at low level very fast, then moves up and over and then down. Stops at the entrance to the room.

Close-up of DOGGETT who senses something and slowly pulls out his gun. Looking over his shoulder, he turns slowly and walks towards the corridor. He hold his gun in both hands and points to whatever is in the corridor. Agent HARRISON walks around corner into room almost bumping into DOGGETT's gun.

HARRISON: Whoa!

(DOGGETT lowers his gun and leans in towards HARRISON.)

DOGGETT: (Quietly) Agent HARRISON, what are you doing here?

HARRISON: I followed you.

(DOGGETT puts his finger to his lips, and whispers.)

DOGGETT: It's here.

HARRISON: It? What it?

DOGGETT: You're armed, right?

HARRISON: What do you want to me to do.

(CUT TO: Camera shot of HARRISON's gun in her noticeably shaking left hand.)

DOGGETT: I want you to go outside, and I want you to stand by the front door. Whatever it is, I'm gonna to try and flush it out.

(HARRISON looks a little nervous, then walks off.)

DOGGETT: Agent Harrison? (HARRISON turns round) Take the safety off.

(HARRISON clicks off the safety and heads back down the corridor)

(CUT TO: Outside. HARRISON exits the house and closes the front door. She looks around nervously. She hears a slithering sound above her. She turns around, worried, looks up towards the roof from where something suddenly lunges very rapidly at her.)

(Cut to DOGGETT inside. He hears gun-shots. He goes out the house. There's no sign of HARRISON.)

DOGGETT: Harrison! Agent Harrison!

(He sees a trail in the lawn, leading to the woods. He follows it to an area under the trees, covered with fallen leaves. He hears sounds coming from underground. Suddenly the ground gives way beneath him and he falls through. It is a double trap door, which then closes up.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 7

(We are in the woods. There are Police Officers and others searching the area. One of them is AD SKINNER. His cell phone rings. He answers.)

SKINNER: Skinner.

(Cut to SCULLY)

SCULLY: Is it true?

SKINNER: (on phone) Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I can't reach Agent Doggett and someone told me he's gone missing.

(Cut to SKINNER)

SKINNER: He was investigating a murder. He hasn't reported back.

(Cut to SCULLY)

SCULLY: Why wasn't I told?

(Cut to SKINNER)

SKINNER: Agent Scully, don't worry.

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm heading into the Bureau right now.

SKINNER: No, you're not.

(Cut to SCULLY)

SCULLY: Sir, are you ordering me not to go looking for Agent Doggett?

SKINNER: (on phone) I've got every available law enforcement officer out here.

(SCULLY doesn't look pleased.)

(Cut to SKINNER)

SKINNER: You are on maternity leave now. Just trust that we are doing everything that we know to do.

(Cut to SCULLY)

SCULLY: I know that you are. But what if it's not enough?

(SKINNER doesn't know what to say. SCULLY hangs up. As she puts down the phone, we see a *very* pregnant Scully.)



SCENE 8

(DOGGETT is lying unconscious on the ground. He comes to and sits up - his head clearly hurts. He gets to his feet holding his gun and flashlight. He is in a dimly lit underground chamber with a tunnel leading off. He looks up and points his flashlight to the ceiling, showing the deep shaft down which he fell. He switches on his cell phone - "No service").



SCENE 9

(Autopsy room. MULDER enters. SCULLY is in scrubs. She hands a sample to an assistant.)

ASSISTANT: I'll just take this to the lab.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(The Assistant leaves - MULDER and SCULLY pause until she has left the room.)

MULDER: It seems like old times. You in scrubs, slicing and dicing.

SCULLY: What are you doing here, Mulder?

MULDER: Actually, I, I wandered away from my tour. (He indicates his visitors badge.) Better question is what are you doing here?

SCULLY: I found something that may prove helpful in locating Agent Doggett. This is Arlen Sacks, the murder victim Doggett was investigating. This old man was not murdered, Mulder, he died of heart failure evidently after he was blinded by a chemical substance of some kind. The orbits have residual traces of a slimy substance, (She takes a swab and wipes the corpse's eye.) known as hydrolytic enzymes.

MULDER: Venom. Produced by reptiles.

SCULLY: How do you know that.

MULDER: Before Agent Doggett and his partner went missing they sent in samples to be analysed. Hydrolytic enzymes. Skinner told me.

SCULLY: I, uh, I also found some bacteria in the venom which I am going to do a culture on.

MULDER: Let somebody else do it. (Making a point) There are other concerns right now.

SCULLY: I know. But this is an X-File, Mulder, and you are out of the Bureau. If now I go home, where is Skinner going to find someone qualified to look into this.

MULDER: I know where he could find somebody ...



SCENE 10

(DOGGETT exploring tunnels - opening what looks like a cell door which squeaks on rusty hinges. He steps on something - look like lumps of meat. He crouches down and picks up what seems to be the head of a dog/wolf minus its skin and flesh. He hears a slithering sound and quickly stands up and shines his flashlight around. There's no sign of it. He stands still and slowly looks over his should but sees nothing. He turns back and something lunges at him, squirting liquid in his face and knocking him to the ground. The creature runs off, climbing the walls and ceiling. We see it's a lizard-like creature with black skin. DOGGETT fires five times as it escapes. The liquid that the creature squirted at him is beginning to take effect. DOGGETT rubs his eyes, then we see his POV - his vision is blurred. The metal door opens, squeaking on its hinges. He turns and points his gun.)

HARRISON: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Right here.

(They walk towards each other.)

DOGGETT: Are you alright?

HARRISON: It's burned my eyes with something. My vision's all blurry.

DOGGETT: Makes two of us.

HARRISON: Three, actually.

(They are walking down another tunnel. There's someone sitting propped up against the wall, his face looks badly burned.)

HARRISON: I think this is Gary Sacks, the son of the murder victim.

DOGGETT: (to HARRISON) How did you get down here?

HARRISON: It dragged me down here. Not sure. So what do we do now.

DOGGETT: I don't know.

HARRISON: Mulder and Scully investigated a case once in Florida, that involved subterranean men who took people underground. (Referring to 5X04 Detour)

DOGGETT: No. This is not a man. I fell through some kind of trap. I guess that someone put that there to provide live meals for this thing.

HARRISON: You're not saying that includes us?

DOGGETT: I don't intend to wait around to find out. These tunnels were built by bootleggers back in prohibition. There's got to be one that leads back to the house.

HARRISON: There's something up there, I think, some kind of light. (They look up, and make out a blurry light high above them.)

DOGGETT: I can't tell how high up that is.



SCENE 11

(A dark blue car draws up at the crime scene in the woods. MULDER gets out.)

SKINNER: Mulder, you're not supposed to be out here.

MULDER: I'm not out here. (Looking around) What happened to the search?

SKINNER: The police in West Ellicot found Doggett's car parked at a convenience store about half an hour from here.

MULDER: How did it get there?

SKINNER: I don't know, but we are re-directing our searches.

(MULDER looks around then walks away.)

SKINNER: Where are you going?

MULDER: I think I'll take a walk in the woods.

SKINNER: We've already had 40 people looking around out there, Mulder.

MULDER: Now, what the hell, I'm out of a job already, right?

(CUT TO: DOGGETT climbing up the brick-built shaft towards the light. HARRISON watches anxiously)

(CUT TO: MULDER in woods, where the body was found.)

(CUT BACK TO: Agent DOGGETT, still climbing up the shaft.)



SCENE 12

(Outside STITES' house. MULDER appears from out the woods and stops on the lawn.)

(CUT BACK TO: Shaft - Agent DOGGETT is still climbing.)

(Back outside the house - MULDER picks up something on the ground on the edge of the lawn.)

MAN: (Offscreen) I thought all you people left.

MULDER: You are?

MAN: Herman Stites. I own this property.

MULDER: You're just the man I want to speak to, Mr. Stites. Have you seen anything unusual around here?

STITES: Unusual? How?

MULDER: Dangerous animals, reptiles.

STITES: I'm confused. I thought the police were looking for a man. Arlen's son, Gary.

MULDER: That is what they are looking for.

(CUT TO: DOGGETT, nearly at the top of the shaft. He looks back down on HARRISON - a blurred figure standing a long way below. He goes back to climbing but suddenly loses his grip and slides back down a short distance, hanging on with his hands.)

HARRISON: Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: I'm alright.

(Camera pans up above ground.)

MULDER: I don't think Gary Sacks committed the crime, Mr. Stites. I think he is a victim himself.

STITES: I didn't catch your name, Agent.

MULDER: Kersh. Alvin Kersh.

STITES: I am a scientist, Mr. Kersh.

MULDER: What kind of scientist are you?

STITES: Biologist. So I know something about animals. They don't generally carry men off into the woods like poor Mr. Sacks.

MULDER: I don't think this was an animal. I think it was a man using some kind of reptile venom to blind them first.

STITES: That would be quite a trick.

MULDER: Well, you would really have to know what you were doing. You would have to be, say, a scientist.

STITES: Are you accusing me of something, Mr. Kersh?

MULDER: No. I'm just thinking out loud, Mr. Stites.

(MULDER walks back to the woods. STITES looks at MULDER, thoroughly pissed off.)

(CUT BACK TO: Overhead shot of DOGGETT very close to the top of the shaft. He pushes up a metal grating and gets one hand on the ground. He sees feet approaching, a figure - it is STITES.)

DOGGETT: I need a hand.

(STITES stands on DOGGETT's left hand. DOGGETT grimaces in pain and lets go. He falls back down the shaft into the chamber below.)

(Fade out and then back in.)

HARRISON: Agent Doggett. What happened?

DOGGETT: I lost my grip, with a little help from the man upstairs.

(They hear a sound from above. STITES is standing on the edge of the shaft.)

DOGGETT: Hey! Hey!! Hey!! I'm a Federal Agent!

(STITES starts replacing the metal grating.)

HARRISON: I don't understand. Why would he want to keep us down here?

DOGGETT: You wanted to face the unknown, Agent Harrison, well you're facing it now.

HARRISON: But who is he?

DOGGETT: Some kind of scientist, I think. I saw some books and papers on biology in his library.

HARRISON: It could be some kind of symbiotic relationship between this man and this creature. Mulder and Scully ...

DOGGETT: (Interrupting) Mulder and Scully aren't here, Agent Harrison, we are. And wild speculation isn't going to help us find the way out.

HARRISON: You think I'm pretty foolish, don't you.

DOGGETT: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you want to take leaps unsupported by the facts. Now what I want you to do is, stay with that guy right there while I look for another way out. And if this thing comes near you (he gives her his gun) I want you to shoot.

(HARRISON nods. DOGGETT walks off and HARRISON turns to Gary Sacks.)

HARRISON: Agent Doggett!

(DOGGETT comes back.)

HARRISON: He's gone.

DOGGETT: What do you mean, he's gone?

HARRISON: I don't know. It must have taken him.



SCENE 13

(Night. We are looking at the tarmacked ground. Small objects fall to the ground. The camera pans up. It's MULDER sitting in his car, spitting out sunflower shells. He is watching STITES' house. His cell phone rings.)

(This scene switches back and forth between MULDER and SCULLY as they speak.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?

MULDER: I'm spitting sunflower shells on Herman Stites' driveway. What are you doing, Scully?

SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Skinner who is furious. This man Stites just called him saying you've been impersonating Deputy Director Kersh and making baseless accusations.

MULDER: Well, what's he mad about? Me impersonating Kersh or me harassing Stites?

SCULLY: Mulder, the victim had reptile venom in his eyes, are you now saying that it was a man who did this?

MULDER: What are you saying it is, Scully?

SCULLY: I know this may be hard to believe coming from me but some kind of reptile attack is the only explanation consistent with the scientific evidence.

MULDER: I don't think it is a monster we are dealing with here, I think it is a man.

SCULLY: Now why do you say that?

MULDER: You re-gifted.

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

MULDER: My Apollo medallion.

SCULLY: You found it?

MULDER: Yeah. I found it on the grass on Stites' estate. Doggett must be around here somewhere.

(The door behind SCULLY opens, so she turns round, it's the assistant.)

ASSISTANT: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I gotta go.

(CUT TO: SCULLY. She hangs up and follows the assistant out. MULDER clicks off his cell phone.)

(Cut to a computer monitor - it shows what looks like a bacterial culture in close up. The culture is stained pinkish-red.)

SCULLY: What am I looking at?

ASSISTANT: As you asked, we cultured the bacteria from the hydrolytic enzymes that were sprayed in the old man's eyes.

SCULLY: It looks like they're breaking down the tissue. (The computer screen zooms in on the culture.)

ASSISTANT: That's exactly what they're doing. The venom blinds its victim, then the bacteria excretes protease and collagenase throughout the victim's body.

SCULLY: Digestive enzymes.

ASSISTANT: Muscle, bone, all of it is slowly liquefied for easy digestion while the victim's skin is made hard and brittle forming a sac or shell from which the reptile can drink.

SCULLY: So the reptile sprays its victim, then all it has to do is wait.

ASSISTANT: There are precedents for this sort of thing in nature.

SCULLY: Yeah, but there are no species that can do all of this. At least not yet.

ASSISTANT: (Turning to SCULLY) What do you mean?



SCENE 14

(DOGGETT feeling his way along the tunnel, using his torch. His vision is very blurred.)

DOGGETT: Talk about the blind leading the blind.

(HARRISON is following him, holding on to him.)

HARRISON: I owe you an apology, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: You're doing fine, Agent Harrison. Hang tough.

HARRISON: You're right. I am not qualified.

DOGGETT: We're going to find a way out of here, Agent Harrison.

HARRISON: I don't think I am.

DOGGETT: What is it?

HARRISON: Whatever happened to Sacks, I think it's happening to me. I'm completely blind now.

(They hear a sound. It is the creature again. It squirts more liquid. DOGGETT fires six bullets. The creature slithers off. He runs after it, round a corner and finds a door in front of him. It's locked.)

HARRISON: Oh god. Agent Doggett!

(DOGGETT returns to HARRISON.)

HARRISON: I think it's Gary Sacks.

(A man is lying on the ground, his skin is very red and glistening.)



SCENE 15

(MULDER is in his car. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: Mulder.

SCULLY: You were right about Herman Stites, Mulder.

MULDER: What did you find.

SCULLY: Well, Stites is a crypto-biologist, specialising in reptile genetics. Listen to this. It says here that he published a monograph last year claiming to be on the verge of creating a new species of reptile.

MULDER: You don't think he succeeded, do you?

SCULLY: I don't know. He dropped out of sight and never published a follow-up. But Mulder, the bacteria inside this venom - if Stites is genetically altering reptile breeds it may explain the peculiar properties.

(MULDER sees something moving in the woods.)

SCULLY: Mulder, are you listening to me?

(Something is moving through the trees.)

SCULLY: Mulder? (Worried) Mulder?

MULDER: I think Mr. Stites may have a lot more than that to explain.

(He clicks off his cell phone and moves out of the car, runs towards what he has seen.)

SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!

(MULDER sees the creature on the lawn in front of STITES' house. He chases after it. It has a human-like head. MULDER sees it climb up the walls on to the roof. He runs to the front door which is locked. He bangs on it.)

MULDER: Mr. Stites! Mr. Stites, open up!



SCENE 16

(Cut to inside the house. The creature is coming down the stairs. It changes into a naked STITES. We hear Mulder banging from the outside.)

MULDER: Mr. Stites! Open the door!

(Cut to outside)

MULDER: Mr. Stites!

(STITES looks towards the door. There is something on his face - it seems to be a small area of skin that hasn't transformed back from the reptile. He wipes at it and it reverts back to human skin.)

MULDER: Mr. Stites!

(He bangs on the door again. Then he walks away and starts dialling a number on his cell phone. The door opens. STITES is standing there in a shirt and trousers.)

STITES: What do you want?

(MULDER pushes his way into the house and STITES closes the door.)

MULDER: Where is it, Mr. Stites? This thing you're protecting, this creature of yours. I don't think you meant for it to, but it got out last night and attacked the caretaker and his son and then it attacked my colleague. (STITES doesn't respond.) Now, I can have 50 men in here to comb this place within the hour. (STITES still doesn't respond.) Where are they, Mr. Stites?



SCENE 17

(Cut to HARRISON, sitting on the ground. DOGGETT goes up to her. She gasps in fear.)

DOGGETT: It's alright. It's just me. It don't make any damn sense. There's no exit except that door.

HARRISON: Maybe it does.

(They hear banging on the door.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett!

DOGGETT: Right here.

(He helps HARRISON up. MULDER comes round the corner followed by STITES.)

MULDER: It's alright, Agent Doggett. We're gonna get you out of here.

DOGGETT: Who's that with you?

MULDER: It's the man who lives here.

DOGGETT: He's been protecting this thing. He's kept us down here.

MULDER: Agent Doggett, I know ...

HARRISON: It's him. He's not protecting it, he *is* it.

(They turn to see STITES has disappeared. MULDER runs to the door. It's locked.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder.

MULDER: Agent Doggett. I don't have a weapon. I'm coming to get yours.

(There's a sound of movement above them.)

MULDER: Or, I'm not.

(DOGGETT takes out his gun.)

DOGGETT: Mulder, I can't see. Mulder, where is it?

MULDER: It's right above you. It's coming this way.

DOGGETT: Where, Mulder? I can't see.

MULDER: Get down. Aim at the sound of my voice.

DOGGETT: No! I'll shoot you.

MULDER: You're not going to shoot me.

DOGGETT: I can't see!

MULDER: Aim at the sound of my voice.

DOGGETT: Where is it!

MULDER: Aim at me!

DOGGETT: No!

MULDER: I'll tell you when to fire. Fire!

(DOGGETT fires instantly, twice.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder! Agent Mulder!!

(Mulder appears right beside DOGGETT.)

MULDER: Right here. Right here, Agent Doggett. (DOGGETT is relieved.)

(MULDER crosses to the body of the creature. It transforms back to STITES. There are two bullet wounds in his upper chest.)



SCENE 18
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

(DOGGETT is leaving a hospital room. He looks back through the window. MULDER and SCULLY approaching the corridor.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Is this it? (pointing towards SCULLY's abdomen)

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other, smiling.)

SCULLY: No. No.

MULDER: We just came by to visit Agent Harrison.

SCULLY: How is she?

DOGGETT: She's on the same anti-venom treatment I got. Her eyesight's pretty much back, the doctors say she's gonna be fine physically.

SCULLY: Skinner said she won't be returning to the X-Files.

DOGGETT: That was her choice. So it's gonna be me for a while.

(SCULLY looks thoughtful.)

MULDER: I want to return something to you that I think you deserve to keep.

DOGGETT: I appreciate the gesture but if it's all the same to you, there's someone else who should have it.

(Cut to HARRISON, smiling, holding the Apollo medallion.)

HARRISON: No way. This means, I can't tell you what this means to me.

(MULDER looks a little awkward.)

HARRISON: Can I ask you something?

(SCULLY looks impassive, perhaps not sure what's coming.)

MULDER: Sure.

HARRISON: When you went to Antarctica to save Agent Scully from being taken by that spaceship and you ran out of gas in your Sno-cat. How did you get back?

(SCULLY looks enquiringly at MULDER, who is looking perplexed. Throughout the following dialogue, MULDER and SCULLY talk across each other, SCULLY is being scientific, MULDER is being MULDER, HARRISON is enjoying the banter. The whole scene is *very* enjoyable to watch.)

SCULLY: Um, well, first of all, it was never (coughs) actually proven that it was a spaceship ...

MULDER: It wasn't?

SCULLY: Well, no, what happened was that we fell off of something that ...

MULDER: Something?

SCULLY: ... that rose out of the ice.

MULDER: Well what do you think that was?

SCULLY: Well, I don't know what it was. But we never got, we didn't actually get to see a spaceship.

MULDER: I can't believe that you're saying it's not a spaceship.

SCULLY: Well, it couldn't have been a spaceship.

MULDER: Course it was a spaceship.

SCULLY: Well, we don't know it was a spaceship. But you don't have a picture of it or anything.

MULDER: You know it was a spaceship. You saw it.

SCULLY: No, no, no, no, remember, I was unconscious and when I woke up there was no spaceship.

MULDER: Now, come on, Scully. It was a spaceship.

SCULLY: Mulder, n-n-n-no.

SCULLY: And you were frozen, and I hugged you .... (Their voices trail off.)

(Camera pans out to corridor. DOGGETT is standing looking in as MULDER and SCULLY continue their debate. He looks sad and walks away down the corridor. Alone.)

[THE END]


                              ESSENCE



DUE TO SOME VIOLENT CONTENT PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED


SCENE 1

(Images of a warm red uterus, an ovum surrounded by eager sperm.)

MULDER: (voiceover) We call it the miracle of life. Conception: A union of perfect opposites-- essence transforming into existence-- an act without which mankind would not exist and humanity cease to exist.

(Image of an ova in a cold blue environment. A medical probe pierces it, allowing a chosen sperm to enter.)

MULDER: (voiceover) Or is this just nostalgia now? An act of biology commandeered by modern science and technology? Godlike, we extract, implant, inseminate... and we clone.

(The zygote splits and replicates its chromosomes.)

MULDER: (voiceover) But has our ingenuity rendered the miracle into a simple trick? In the artifice of replicating life can we become the creator? Then what of the soul? Can it, too, be replicated? Does it live in this matter we call DNA? Or is its placement the opposite of artifice, capable only by God.

(We see a foetus in the warm red environment, its heart beating in an ultrasound view.)

MULDER: (voiceover) How did this child come to be? What set its heart beating? Is it the product of a union? Or the work of a divine hand? An answered prayer? A true miracle? Or is it a wonder of technology-- the intervention of other hands? What do I tell this child about to be born? What do I tell Scully?

(The foetal hand suddenly slaps against the screen.)

MULDER: (voiceover) And what do I tell myself?

(The foetus is happily nesting in its warm fluid-filled environment, connected to its mother by the umbilical cord.)

SCENE 2

CHRIS CARTER: Previously on the X-Files:

(From Three Words 8X18. We see the CD marked "Fight the Future." DOGGETT talking to KNOWLE ROHRER. The bumps on KNOWLE ROHRER's neck.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: The invasion has begun.

DOGGETT: What invasion?

KNOWLE ROHRER: They're already here. (From DeadAlive 8X15. BILLY MILES lying in his hospital bed, his skin bloated and disgusting.)

SCULLY: Billy Miles shed his skin and literally became a new person.

(BILLY MILES sloughs his skin in the shower, then turns to face them in the hospital hallway.)

SCULLY: And I don't mean the same person. (From Per Manum 8X08. SCULLY meeting DUFFY HASKELL in the X-Files office.)

DOGGETT: This is Duffy Haskell.

DUFFY HASKELL: My wife was a multiple abductee. Dr. Lev stole the alien baby out of her womb. (Mucous being sucked out of the cute newborn baby alien's nose.) (SCULLY is talking to her first obstetrician, DR. PARENTI.)

DR. PARENTI: I looked at this ultrasound you sent me. It looks fine to me, as does your own ultrasound. It's normal to be worried. (DR. PARENTI about to conduct an autopsy on the alien baby.) DUFFY HASKELL: (on phone) They called me back into the FBI to poke holes in my story.

DR. LEV: (on phone) As we knew they would. (SCULLY in the hospital caressing her stomach.) (From DeadAlive 8X15. KRYCEK and SKINNER in MULDER's hospital room.)

KRYCEK: Make sure Scully doesn't come to term.

SKINNER: You're out of your mind.

KRYCEK: She can't have that baby. (From Per Manum 8X08. DOGGETT reassuring SCULLY in her hospital room.)

DOGGETT: You're okay, Agent Scully. You're fine. Your baby's fine. (MULDER and SCULLY standing forehead to forehead in her apartment. Very intimate.)

MULDER: Never give up on a miracle.



SCENE 3

(SCULLY's apartment. MARGARET SCULLY is decorating the living room with balloons  pink and blue.)

MARGARET SCULLY: You know, it would be a whole lot easier for everyone if you would just tell us the sex, Dana.

(No answer.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Did you hear me?

(SCULLY comes out of another room carrying a cup of tea.)

SCULLY: Yes, I heard you, Mom-- for about the thousandth time, you can wait. Didn't you have to wait with us?

MARGARET SCULLY: Well, I know it's a boy. I can just tell by the way you're carrying. It's a boy.

SCULLY: Well, see, you obviously don't need me to tell you because you already know.

MARGARET SCULLY: (hopefully) Then it's a boy?

(SCULLY doesn't answer and rinses her tea cup, frustrating her mother further.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Oh, it's the least you could tell your mother considering everything else you're keeping a secret.

[CarriK: Translation - Everything else you're keeping a secret, like  THE FATHER?!]

(The doorbell rings. SCULLY looks at her watch.)

SCULLY: We told people noon, right?

MARGARET SCULLY: Mm-hmm.

(SCULLY opens the door. A woman, about 40, red hair is holding two bouquets of flowers, one pink one blue.)

WOMAN: Hi. Your mom said to cover all the bases. I'm Lizzy Gill.

(MARGARET SCULLY comes over and takes a bouquet.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Hi, Lizzy. Let me give you a hand with that. I asked Lizzy to help out today.

SCULLY: (friendly, but uncomfortable) Oh. Hi.

LIZZY GILL: These are going to need some water. Congratulations, by the way.

(LIZZY walks confidently into the apartment.)

SCULLY: (quietly) Mom... what do we need help with?

MARGARET SCULLY: I don't know. It's just, well you shouldn't have to worry. You have to let people do for you. She's a very highly recommended baby nurse, by the way.

SCULLY: Oh, Mom.

(Later, the baby shower is underway. SCULLY opens a large box containing two dolls, one in pink, the other in blue and holds them up for all to see. She does not look like she is having the most wonderful time of her life.)

SCULLY: This has got to be a conspiracy.

(The assembled women, including SKINNER's ASSISTANT, all aww and coo.)

WOMAN: Aw... Maybe it'll be twins.

SCULLY: Thank you, but I would settle for one very healthy boy.

WOMEN: Oh?

SCULLY: Or girl.

WOMEN: Aww!

OLDER WOMAN: So many secrets, Margaret.

MARGARET SCULLY: What do you expect? My daughter works for the FBI.

(The WOMEN laugh. MARGARET SCULLY accidentally knocks over a wine glass with the empty box.)

WOMAN: Oh! Oh, dear!

(LIZZY is right there with a towel.)

LIZZY: I got it. Here. Moving in... the white tornado.

MARGARET SCULLY: Thank you, Lizzy.

LIZZY: No problem.

(MARGARET SCULLY looks intently at SCULLY.)

MARGARET SCULLY: Just think about it.

(SCULLY nods.) (LIZZY carries the sodden towel into the bathroom and drops it onto the hamper. After a glance at the laughing party in the living room, she quietly and deliberately closes the hall door and opens SCULLY's medicine cabinet and removes a prescription bottle. She checks the label, then dumps the contents of the bottle into the toilet and flushes it. She takes a folded paper out of her pocket and drops an equal amount of replacement capsules into the bottle and returns it to the cabinet.)



SCENE 4
ZEUS GENETICS
GERMANTOWN, MARYLAND

(Night. DR. LEV is working alone in the lab filled with jars of deformed foetuses. BILLY MILES enters, his face calm and intent.)

DR. LEV: Excuse me? Can I help you?

BILLY MILES: Dr. Lev, isn't it?

DR. LEV: I'm sorry. I don't know who you are or how you got in here but we don't allow visitors.

(BILLY MILES looks around at the contents of the jars.)

BILLY MILES: I won't be visiting long. I've just come to verify it's true.

DR. LEV: Verify that what's true?

BILLY MILES: That your work's been fruitful. I can see that it has by the abomination you're holding in your hands.

(DR. LEV is holding a barely alive alien baby. It is pitifully gasping for air.)

DR. LEV: You'll have to leave now.

BILLY MILES: Your work here is done.

(BILLY MILES swings his fist. Blood spatters on the jars and we hear DR. LEV's dead body falls to the ground. BILLY MILES tosses the clear liquid contents of a flask onto the body and the floor. He lights a match, ignites the fluid, and leaves the room as it is engulfed in flames.)



SCENE 5

(DOGGETT house. Next morning. DOGGETT is watching NASCAR on the FOX network and cleaning his gun. This should send his AutumnT Manly Man Meter through the roof. [CarriK: I'm from Charlotte, NC, but I have never been nor have any desire to go near our Motor Speedway. Several NASCAR fans have pointed out that on the east coast, Doggett should have had to wait until at least 1:00 PM on Saturday to watch the game. All the fans have to have time to recover from the Friday night Pabst Blue Ribbon beer binges.] All that aside, DOGGETT looks Manly. The cars on the TV are driving around in circles.)

MIKE THE NASCAR ANNOUNCER: Dale Jarrett right in the pack battling hard against Ricky Craven for seventh place. Jeff?

JEFF THE NASCAR ANNOUNCER: Yeah, Mike, I was down in the 88 car pit when Dale Jarrett came in. His car was just a little bit on the tight side still. Steve Allen, the gas man, took one round out of the left rear. They said if they can get the car to free up a little bit more...

(There is a knock at the door. DOGGETT sets down his gun and goes to open the door. It is MULDER, dressed casually.)

JEFF THE NASCAR ANNOUNCER:  he'll be a force to contend with before the end of the day. Now, Phil Davis has...

DOGGETT: (smiling) The last person I'd expect to see knocking on my door on a Saturday morning-- Agent Mulder.

MULDER: You can drop the "Agent," Agent Doggett. It's just plain old Fox Mulder now.

(DOGGETT is a little uncomfortable.)

DOGGETT: Right. You want to come in, Fox? I was just watching a race.

MULDER: That's what I was doing. Slightly different race though.

MIKE THE NASCAR ANNOUNCER: ... from sixth place on back.

JEFF THE NASCAR ANNOUNCER: Boy, that 32 car is really...

(MULDER picks up the remote and switches the channel to a news report. NEWS 10. Footage is of a burning building from the night before.)

NEWSCASTER: ... exclusive footage of a medical research clinic in Germantown, Maryland, which burned down last night in what firefighters characterize as an accelerated blaze. Accelerated because of the white-hot intensity of the fire, which officials are now calling a definite case of arson.

MULDER: Zeus Genetics. That ring a bell?

DOGGETT: Yeah. That's where Scully believed they were doing tests on women-- putting alien babies in them or something like that-- against their will. Wasn't ever completely explained.

MULDER: Looks like somebody's attempt to make sure it never will be.

DOGGETT: I'd say that's more than an attempt. Looks like there's going to be nothing left.

MULDER: I think that's the idea-- to cover up the kind of research that was going on there. That's why I came to talk to you.

DOGGETT: What do you want from me?

MULDER: How about a ride?



SCENE 6
FBI EVIDENCE ANALYSIS CENTER

(Agents are looking through the debris of the fire. AGENT CRANE, one of those who helped search for MULDER at the beginning of Season 8, pulls a badly charred piece of equipment from a plastic bag and looks at it in disgust. DOGGETT comes up beside him.)

DOGGETT: Hey, Gene.

AGENT CRANE: Not the way I want to be spending my Saturday afternoon, John. I had to leave my kid's ball game.

(DOGGETT is a little surprised at AGENT CRANE's hostile tone.)

DOGGETT: Sorry about that. I didn't say you had to come do it yourself.

AGENT CRANE: Fire Marshall thought I was kidding when I told him I wanted to sift all this. Seeing it, I thought I was kidding, too.

(AGENT CRANE sees MULDER on a cell phone in the doorway across the room.)

AGENT CRANE: He put you onto this, didn't he? What the hell are you doing, John? You don't have to answer to him. He's out of the Bureau.

DOGGETT: Well, he thinks there's something here.

AGENT CRANE: I'm certain there is. Just not anything the FBI needs to be looking for.

(MULDER hangs up and calls to DOGGETT.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT reluctantly walks over to him.)

MULDER: Hey, I hope you don't mind me dropping your name with the local PD. They just told me that they contacted everyone at Zeus Genetics except for one man-- a Dr. Lev-- a founder, and head of clinical research.

DOGGETT: And what? You think we're going to find his body here in the ashes?

MULDER: That would probably stand to reason.

DOGGETT: What is it exactly we're looking for being I'm starting to piss a lot of people off, Mr. Mulder?

MULDER: Pissing people off comes with the territory, Agent Doggett. It's part of working on the X-Files.

DOGGETT: Well, at the risk of pissing you off I think I've wasted about enough of my weekend.

(DOGGETT starts to leave.)

MULDER: Hey, I told you Dr. Lev was a founder of the clinic. Would you like to know who his cofounder was? Dr. Parenti. Agent Scully's obstetrician through the first two-thirds of her pregnancy.

DOGGETT: And you think he burned down this clinic?

MULDER: I don't know, but if I'm the Agent assigned to the X-Files, I sure as hell would want to ask him. (pause) Worst it could do is piss him off.



SCENE 7
PARENTI MEDICAL GROUP
11:47 AM

(Medical office building. MULDER finishes picking the lock to an outer reception area and opens the door. DOGGETT is right behind him.)

MULDER: Knock, knock.

DOGGETT: Right. We get caught in here what are you going to say then?

(MULDER smiles and hands the lock pick kit back to DOGGETT.)

MULDER: I'll just say I'm with you, Agent Doggett. It's Saturday anyway, right? We're just having a look around.

(They enter the office and split up to look around. DOGGETT enters the room with the foetuses in jars.)

DOGGETT: Hey, Mulder.

(MULDER, in another room, hears DOGGETT. He goes out into the hall to find him, but DR. PARENTI opens another door and stops MULDER.)

DR. PARENTI: Who are you?

MULDER: Me?

DR. PARENTI: (very agitated) Yes, you, sir. What do you think you're doing in this office?

MULDER: I'm with an FBI agent who would like to ask you the exact same question. Dr. Parenti, isn't it?

(MULDER notices a WOMAN in the room behind DR. PARENTI. She is on a gynaecological examination table, her feet in the stirrups. She sits up a little, concerned at the noise in the hallway. DR. PARENTI closes the door to shield her from MULDER's inquisitive view.)

DR. PARENTI: I'm in the middle of a very delicate medical procedure. Whatever you want, you don't just come barging in here. I don't care who you are.

(DOGGETT calls to them from the open door of the foetus room.)

DOGGETT: This medical procedure... it have anything to do with this?

(DR. PARENTI goes into the foetus room.)

DR. PARENTI: (very nervous) Please...

DOGGETT: Why don't you tell us what we're looking at here, Dr. Parenti?

DR. PARENTI: You people have no right to be here. I want you to leave.

MULDER: What is this? Some kind of showroom?

DR. PARENTI: Do you know what I've been through in the past 24 hours? Close friend and colleague is missing. Much of my life's work has been destroyed.

DOGGETT: How about you explain what you are doing? What these things are.

DR. PARENTI: They are what we are all working so hard to prevent-- children with non-survivable birth defects.

MULDER: Does that work include experimentation with alien embryos? Work that you would destroy to cover up such allegations?

DR. PARENTI: Where do you get these ideas?

MULDER: From a friend of mine-- a former patient of yours-- Dana Scully.

DR. PARENTI: If I'm such a Dr. Frankenstein how is it that Ms. Scully is carrying a perfectly healthy child? In her own medical opinion.

MULDER: Is she?

(MULDER and DR. PARENTI stare at each other.)

DOGGETT: I'd say this man's suitably pissed off. Why don't we let him get back to work. Let's go, Mulder.

DR. PARENTI: Thank you.

(MULDER allows DOGGETT to lead him out of the office.)



SCENE 8

(SCULLY is in her bathroom. She takes a pill from the prescription bottle. Just as she is about to swallow it, LIZZY GILL opens the bathroom door, startling her.)

LIZZY GILL: Dana?

SCULLY: Mmm, hmm-mm...

(SCULLY finally swallows with a glass of water.)

LIZZY GILL: Oh, sorry.

SCULLY: Horse pills.

LIZZY GILL: I'm about to leave. Your dinner's in the oven. And I just wanted to say that I hope this is working out. I know it's important to your Mom.

SCULLY: It is. And, uh... I appreciate your help. I didn't quite realize, uh... how much I needed it.

LIZZY GILL: Well, I'll see you.

(SCULLY returns the bottle to the cabinet and takes another sip of water as LIZZY GILL shoulders her purse and leaves with a smile.)

(Outside the building, LIZZY GILL gets into a car driven by DUFFY HASKELL, the man from Per Manum.)

DUFFY HASKELL: How's it going? You look unsure.

LIZZY GILL: No. I think she trusts me.

DUFFY HASKELL: Good. We're almost at the end.

(LIZZY looks a little nervous.)



SCENE 9
FBI ANALYSIS CENTER
8:22 PM

(A TECHNICIAN is carefully dropping an acid solution onto a piece of burned evidence from the Zeus Genetics fire. MULDER enters.)

MULDER: You found something, didn't you?

(DOGGETT and AGENT CRANE are looking over a file. AGENT CRANE is less than pleased to see MULDER.)

AGENT CRANE: You still answering to him?

DOGGETT: We found teeth and a porcelain bridge. We're waiting on Dr. Lev's dental records to make positive ID.

MULDER: Anything else?

DOGGETT: Unidentifiable biological material fused with laboratory grade silica.

(MULDER looks up from the file that DOGGETT just handed him.)

DOGGETT: I know what you're thinking. But there's lots here that's unidentifiable. Doesn't mean it's alien.

MULDER: Let's ask Dr. Parenti  if it's okay with Agent Crane.

(AGENT CRANE chooses not to listen to them. MULDER leaves. DOGGETT follows. Good dogg.)



SCENE 10

(DR. PARENTI's office. DR. PARENTI is alone in his lab. He carefully places a jar containing a dead foetus into a cardboard box. He hears a noise in the front office.)

DR. PARENTI: Hello? Hello?

(BILLY MILES enters the lab. His face is cold, expressionless. DR. PARENTI is defiantly nervous.)

BILLY MILES: Packing, Dr. Parenti?

DR. PARENTI: I'm sorry. This office is closed.

BILLY MILES: (nodding slowly) Yes, it is.

(Outside, DOGGETT's truck pulls up, and he and MULDER get out and head toward the building.)



SCENE 11
PARENTI MEDICAL GROUP
8:57 PM

(MULDER sharply jerks up on one of the exterior doors. It opens and he and DOGGETT enter the building. They find DR. PARENTI's office door open.)

MULDER: The man loves his work.

DOGGETT: Dr. Parenti?

MULDER: Agent Doggett. Look at this.

(MULDER shows DOGGETT that the door handle is completely broken. It spins 360 degrees without any resistance.)

(MULDER and DOGGETT again split up to look through the offices. DOGGETT slowly enters a hall, his gun ready.)

DOGGETT: Dr. Parenti.

(He cautiously enters DR. PARENTI's office and lab.)

DOGGETT: Dr. Parenti.

(He sees something on one of the wire shelves.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is that?

(Slowly he walks to the jar. DR. PARENTI's severed head is inside the jar.)

(MULDER is looking around a different room. He hears DOGGETT call him.)

DOGGETT: (voice) Hey, Mulder.

(Suddenly, the door beside MULDER opens, and he find himself facing BILLY MILES.)

(DOGGETT is looking for MULDER.)

DOGGETT: Mulder, better come see this.

(DOGGETT looks around the main office. There is no answer.)

DOGGETT: Mulder?

(Without warning, MULDER is thrown bodily through one of the plate glass walls by BILLY MILES. DOGGETT holds his gun on BILLY MILES.)

DOGGETT: Right there! Don't move! Stop! Stop there!

(BILLY MILES ignores DOGGETT and crosses to where MULDER is lying motionless on the floor.)

DOGGETT: Stop there or I'll shoot!

(As BILLY MILES bends down to look at MULDER, DOGGETT sees the bumps on the back of BILLY MILES' neck. BILLY MILES looks up at DOGGETT and begins advancing on him. DOGGETT fires twice, hitting BILLY MILES twice on the center- left part of his chest. The wounds bleed red. BILLY MILES' body reacts to the bullets' impact, but, undaunted, he keeps coming. DOGGETT ducks back into DR. PARENTI's office and slams the door. He stands against the inner wall, breathing heavily, gun ready. After a moment, of silence, he opens the door again. BILLY MILES is gone. MULDER is unconscious.)



SCENE 12

(Later. SCULLY's apartment. MULDER is sitting at SCULLY's kitchen table as she finishes closing up the gash on his right temple with some suture-tape-things.)

SCULLY: Hold still, Mulder. This should just about do it.

(MULDER winces in pain and swats her hand away.)

MULDER: Ahh! Scully.

SCULLY: Sorry.

MULDER: (smiling up at her) I see why you gave up a career in medicine for the FBI, Scully. You've got manos de piedra.

(He laughs as she playfully swats his nose with a hydrogen peroxide-soaked cotton ball. She begins gently wiping the wound with the cotton ball.)

SCULLY: Sorry.

MULDER: Imagine if he'd really connected.

SCULLY: Who?

MULDER: Billy Miles.

SCULLY: Billy Miles? He did this?

(SCULLY picks up a towel and crosses to the freezer. DOGGETT is also in the kitchen.)

MULDER: Ask Agent Doggett. He saw him.

DOGGETT: If you ask me, the kid was whacked out on something. Whatever it was, he's feeling no pain.

MULDER: Ask me, the kid isn't a kid.

DOGGETT: Oh, don't tell me he's an alien.

(SCULLY hands MULDER a small baggie of ice and the towel. MULDER takes the ice, but manfully ignores the towel. SCULLY tosses it on the table. MULDER winces as he touches the cold bag to his wound.)

MULDER: He is a type of alien. A human replacement. One who looks human. Look at his strength. The way he took those slugs.

DOGGETT: I've seen plenty of guys whacked out on chemicals, keep on coming.

MULDER: Well, then, you're ignoring who Billy Miles is. You, of all people, Agent Doggett who's supposedly running the X-Files.

DOGGETT: You're ignoring the fact that he bled red blood. Now, every single X-File I read-- and I read them all, Mulder-- what you call "aliens" bleed green, right?

(MULDER gives up on the ice and sets it down. He crosses to SCULLY's cabinet and gets a glass and fills it with water.)

MULDER: Well, Billy Miles is a whole new deal. He's an alien abductee who was returned after hideous procedures were performed on him. And who miraculously returns to so-called perfect health when his body completely sheds its skin.

(MULDER drinks the water as SCULLY sits down. She looks tired.)

DOGGETT: Same thing happened to you.

MULDER: Same thing would've happened to me if I'd been left alone.

(He looks at SCULLY.)

MULDER: If Scully hadn't treated me.

SCULLY: What I want to know is what Billy Miles was doing at that medical office.

MULDER: Same as when he torched Zeus Genetics and destroyed their experiments with alien biology and the doctors performing them.

SCULLY: And what were you doing there,  (she gives him "the look") Mulder?

MULDER: Looking for answers.

SCULLY: To what?

MULDER: One of those doctors was your doctor.

SCULLY: Mulder...

MULDER: Listen, Scully, I'm sorry, but I just need to know that this baby of yours is going to be all right.

SCULLY: My baby is fine, Mulder. I've had it checked over and over again with my new doctor that I trust implicitly.

(The door to the apartment opens and LIZZY GILL enters carrying some dry cleaning. She is surprised to see MULDER and DOGGETT.)

LIZZY GILL: Oh, I'm sorry, Dana. I didn't...

SCULLY: Come on in, Lizzy. It's all right. We just need some space to talk.

LIZZY GILL: It's okay. I've got plenty to do. Excuse me.

(LIZZY GILL cheerfully heads back into the bedroom/bathroom area of the apartment. MULDER looks questioningly at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: It's okay. She's just helping me out here at my mother's insistence.

(MULDER crosses to SCULLY and looks at her intently. He speaks gently and honestly.)

MULDER: That's... that's all I'm trying to do. Just make sure nothing happens to you; that this baby you're carrying is born without any surprises.

(SCULLY looks from DOGGETT to MULDER, then sighs.)

(LIZZY GILL is watching from the bedroom. She slowly closes the door and picks up the phone.)

LIZZY GILL: (on phone) Hi. It's me. We've got trouble.

(DUFFY HASKELL is in a very large warehouse room with lots of medical equipment.)

DUFFY HASKELL: (on phone) Where are you?

LIZZY GILL: (on phone) I'm at her apartment. She's with her two partners. They're asking all the right questions.

DUFFY HASKELL: (on phone) Lizzy, listen to me. She trusts you. You've got to play to that. You have to keep a cool head.

(DUFFY HASKELL turns to see BILLY MILES standing right behind him.)

DUFFY HASKELL: Who are you?

(With one swipe of his arm, BILLY MILES knocks DUFFY HASKELL's head from his shoulders. The head and the phone and the body fall to the ground. BILLY MILES stares emotionlessly at the remains.)



SCENE 13
DOWNTOWN WASHINGTON, DC
5:18 PM

(DOGGETT arrives at the warehouse and parks his silver Chevrolet truck nest to the police cars. He enters the building and crosses to SKINNER who is speaking to two MEDICAL EXAMINERS.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director.

(SKINNER dismisses the MEDICAL EXAMINERS.)

SKINNER: Heads have been rolling, Agent Doggett, all in your direction. PD got the call. Passer-by saw the door of the building wide open. Name of the victim flagged a previous FBI investigation.

(SKINNER kneels down and unzips the body bag exposing DUFFY HASKELL's head severed from the body.)

DOGGETT: Duffy Haskell.

SKINNER: Yeah. Came to see you and Scully on a case involving pregnant women carrying alien babies. Coroner says that the way his neck is severed defies logic and use of any conventional-type weapon.

(SKINNER zips the bag and they begin walking through the lab.)

DOGGETT: What is this place?

SKINNER: An illegal medical facility for the purpose of human cloning. It goes on from here. In fact, it occupies the entire warehouse.

DOGGETT: You read about these things but you don't imagine they exist.

SKINNER: Yeah, just like aliens.

DOGGETT: Come on, what are you saying? That that's what was going on here? That they're making alien babies?

SKINNER: No, nobody's saying that, Agent Doggett. At least not yet. But what I do have to tell you is not going to put your mind any more at ease. We found prenatal records here. A Dr. Lev and a Dr. Parenti working with this Duffy Haskell monitoring Scully's pregnancy.

(MULDER enters the warehouse and watches SKINNER and DOGGETT from the doorway.)

DOGGETT: This Dr. Parenti, it's true he's one of Scully's doctors but from everything I know, Scully's checked out fine.

SKINNER: You seem to be missing the point.

MULDER: And what point would that be? [Closed Captioning: You fellas are starting the party without me?]

(SKINNER glances at DOGGETT, then crosses to MULDER.)

MULDER: What?

SKINNER: Talk to you a minute?

(MULDER follows SKINNER outside.)

MULDER: You said there'd been a murder.

SKINNER: Yeah, we'll get there. Some business we need to clear up. Personal business. About Scully's baby, about who the father is.

MULDER: (smiles) Ahh... Yeah, I hear there's a pool running down at the FBI, placing bets.

SKINNER: I've had my suspicions. That is, until I found out that you had questions. Questions about Scully's pregnancy itself.

MULDER: You want to know who the father is, that's Scully's business. But if you're asking me how a woman who was diagnosed as barren and unable to conceive is about to give birth in a couple days, that's an answer I can't honestly give.

SKINNER: Well, I need answers. In light of what we found in there and in light of Scully's due date I need good, hard answers. Fast.

(SKINNER pulls out his cell phone. MULDER is uncomfortable.)

MULDER: Sir, just... Let me.

(MULDER takes SKINNER's phone and dials.)

(Inside SCULLY's apartment, the phone rings. SCULLY is in the shower. We can see her very pregnant silhouette through the glass shower door. She is washing her hair.)

SCULLY: Lizzy, are you going to get that?

(There is no answer. The phone continues ringing.)

SCULLY: Lizzy?

(SCULLY gets out of the shower and come to answer the phone, a blue robe over her wet body. She is a little breathless.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?

MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, it's me. Are you all right?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. I just ran from the shower.

(SCULLY looks up at a sound. Her bedroom/bathroom door is closed slowly and silently.)

MULDER: (on phone) I need to see you. I've got Skinner with me. It's not something that can really wait.

SCULLY: (on phone) What?

MULDER: (on phone) It's about your pregnancy. Skinner's got some questions based on some new information.

SCULLY: (on phone) What...? Mulder, what are you talking about?

MULDER: (on phone) Evidence of interference by someone.

(SCULLY hangs up the phone and quickly walks back to the bathroom and opens the door. LIZZIE GILL is in the process of switching out the prescription pills again.)

SCULLY: What are you doing? What do you think you're doing with these?

(SCULLY grabs the bottle from her. Some of the pills fall into the sink basin. LIZZIE GILL looks guilty and frightened.)

SCULLY: (furious) Who are you? Who are you?!



SCENE 14
WASHINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL

(Night. Hospital emergency examining room. SCULLY is getting dressed again. Her doctor, a blond woman, 40's, DR. SPEAKE, enters with a smile.)

DR. SPEAKE: I want you to know you can stop worrying, Dana. Your baby is fine.

(MULDER and MRS. SCULLY get to the open door of the room and listen. MRS. SCULLY has her arms crossed in front of her, then hands pressed to her mouth.)

DR. SPEAKE: Everything is absolutely as it should be, 100%. The pills you were worried about were just vitamin supplements. Nothing harmful. Nothing you'd be afraid to give any expectant mother. I know it doesn't make sense but it's a relief, I'm sure.

(DR. SPEAKE leaves the room as MARGARET SCULLY enters. MULDER waits in the open doorway.)

MARGARET SCULLY: I am so sorry, Dana. I brought Lizzie into your home. This is all my fault.

(SCULLY is not looking at her mother. MARGARET SCULLY hugs her.)

MARGARET SCULLY: I'm so sorry. You know I'd never let anything happen to you. I'd never knowingly let anybody hurt you.

SCULLY: I know, Mom.

MARGARET SCULLY: I'm so worried about you. You keep everything so bottled up.

(SCULLY nods and looks at her mother, then over at MULDER who is watching her. They are interrupted by SKINNER coming down the hall.)

SKINNER: Mulder! How is she?

(In the room, MARGARET SCULLY helps SCULLY put on her coat.)

MULDER: She's fine, according to her doctor. Apparently, it was a false alarm. Whatever this woman was up to...

SKINNER: Well, we won't be able to hold the woman based on those findings. But Agent Doggett's been talking to her. I think you ought to hear what she has to say.

(MULDER glances into the room, then reluctantly follows SKINNER. SCULLY watches them leave.)



SCENE 15

(SKINNER's office. LIZZIE GILL is at the table with DOGGETT, SKINNER, and MULDER.)

LIZZIE GILL: I knew people would kill for what I know but  not like this.

DOGGETT: Not going to let that happen. Just what you told me and Agent Crane.

LIZZIE GILL: For the past ten years I've been working as a research scientist trying to produce human clones-- long before the media circus with sheep and cows. The work was painstaking, largely unsuccessful but there was a lot of interest and a lot of money.

MULDER: Money from who?

LIZZIE GILL: Orders came from government men. But they're all dead now.

MULDER: But the work continued.

LIZZIE GILL: We were surprisingly successful with a clone from a human egg and alien DNA. DNA that the government had since 1947.

SKINNER: What do you mean by success?

LIZZIE GILL: Alien babies. Birthed by human mothers desperate to conceive. They didn't live more than a couple of days, but tissue and stem cells is what we were after for other experiments.

(MULDER briefly rubs his temples.)

MULDER: What other experiments?

LIZZIE GILL: I don't know anything about that. But I know it was something good.

MULDER: What did you do to Scully?

LIZZIE GILL: We were trying to protect her.

MULDER: (leaning forward) What did you do to her?!

LIZZIE GILL: No, you don't understand.

MULDER: (yelling) Tell me what's wrong with her! Tell me what's wrong with her baby!

(LIZZIE GILL looks to DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Listen to her. What she's saying.

LIZZIE GILL: There's nothing wrong with her. That's what I'm trying to tell you. The child she is carrying is very special. One could only hope to create that in a lab. A perfect human child but with no human frailties.

(MULDER stares at her a moment, then angrily walks out of the room. SKINNER indicates that DOGGETT should go after him. DOGGETT follows MULDER out of the room into the hallway.)

DOGGETT: Mulder!

(MULDER ignores DOGGETT. AGENT CRANE comes out of another office and stops DOGGETT.)

AGENT CRANE: Agent Doggett! I got something, John. This guy Billy Miles called in from a Dr. Parenti's office. He wants to give himself up.

(DOGGETT looks down the hall and sees MULDER getting into the elevator and the doors close. He sighs and looks at the message.)

DOGGETT: All right, let's get over there.



SCENE 16

(SCULLY's apartment. She is getting comfortable on her couch with a book. There is a knock at the door.)

SCULLY: Yes?

MULDER: (from the hall) It's me.

(SCULLY gets up and opens the door. MULDER enters, full of nervous energy.)

SCULLY: What's wrong?

MULDER: You here alone?

SCULLY: Yes. My Mom just went to the...

(MULDER puts his hand on her shoulder and begins steering her toward the bedroom.)

MULDER: Whatever you can't get elsewhere, just throw it together.

(SCULLY stops him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, to go where? No, just stop! Can you tell me what's wrong? Is it something to do with my baby?

MULDER: No, your, your baby is fine. It's you who's in danger now, Scully.

SCULLY: From who? Mulder, from what?

MULDER: I don't know, I'm not sure. I'm not sure about anything. I just know I got to get you out of here.

SCULLY: Look, Mulder, look, I can't take this! I can't live like thisas, as the object of some unending X-File.

MULDER: This isn't about the X-Files, Scully. It is only about you. Now, you are going to have this baby and I'm going to do everything I can to protect it. I just can't do that here.

(MULDER and SCULLY look at each other. She takes a moment to consider his words, and then crosses to her bedroom.)



SCENE 17

(Parenti Medical Group office. An FBI SWAT team including DOGGETT and AGENT CRANE bust into the office and begin searching the lab. Of course no one turns on a light.)

DOGGETT: Billy Miles! Billy... Billy Miles.

(He finds nothing.)

AGENT CRANE: Agent Doggett. Anything?

(No BILLY MILES. The office is empty.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY's bedroom. MULDER is watching her pack a small dufflebag. His cell phone rings.)

MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.

DOGGETT: (on phone) It's John Doggett. I'm at Dr. Parenti's office. Billy Miles called us looking to turn himself in, only he ain't here.

MULDER: (on phone) Agent Doggett...

DOGGETT: (on phone) I know. Something's wrong. Something doesn't make any sense.

(The lights in the apartment building go out. MULDER looks at SCULLY.)

MULDER: Leave the suitcase.

(SCULLY picks up her coat and puts it on as she and MULDER leave the apartment. At the same time, they glance behind them. Just as they turn a corner in the hall, BILLY MILES comes down the hall from the other direction and enters SCULLY's apartment.)

(Outside, MULDER helps SCULLY waddle down the back stairs toward the street. She gets out her car keys and MULDER takes them from her as they cross the street to reach her car.)

MULDER: Get in, go around.

(MULDER opens the drivers side, gets in, then reaches over to unlock SCULLY's door. She gets in and puts on her seatbelt as he starts the engine. The car is blocked in. MULDER bumps the cars in front of and behind them, but can't get enough room to pull out. BILLY MILES comes out of the front of the building and begins walking quickly toward them. SCULLY nervously locks her door.)

SCULLY: Mulder, lock your door.

MULDER: I don't think that matters much, Scully.

(MULDER locks the door anyway. BILLY MILES keeps heading toward them. He doesn't look both ways before crossing the street. Suddenly, BILLY MILES is knocked to the ground and run over by a speeding car. MULDER and SCULLY stare in surprise. The car backs up beside MULDER's door and the tinted window slides down. The driver is everyone's favourite rat, KRYCEK! Now MULDER and SCULLY are really surprised.)

KRYCEK: We haven't got much time. Get in.

(SCULLY looks back into the street. Speedbump!BILLY MILES is slowly getting up. Blood is pouring from his face.

SCULLY: Mulder?

KRYCEK: Let's go!

(MULDER and SCULLY get out of the car quickly. MULDER opens the back of KRYCEK's car for her, then gets into the passenger seat. Tires squealing, KRYCEK reverses back down the street, then turns onto the main road. BILLY MILES watches them go.)



SCENE 19

(SKINNER's office. SCULLY is sitting on a couch looking rather depressed, her hand covering her eyes. SKINNER and MULDER are standing next to KRYCEK's chair, DOGGETT standing next to the desk near them.)

KRYCEK: You should all know exactly what it is you're up against... what Agent Scully's up against.

DOGGETT: You realize you're all listening to someone who tried to kill me. He left you for dead.

[CarriK: Welcome to the X-Files, Doggett. Better stop taking these murder attempts personally.]

MULDER: Tell us about Billy Miles.

KRYCEK: There are others just like him. You can call them what you want. They're human replacements, alien replicants. They're virtually unstoppable.

SKINNER: What do they want?

KRYCEK: They want to knock out any and all attempts by us to survive the final days- - when they come back to retake the planet.

DOGGETT: So, what, they're wandering around among us  looking for trouble? Some kind of alien lawmen?

KRYCEK: You saw what they did to those doctors. They're fearless. And they answer to no one except their own biological imperative  to survive.

(MULDER looks over at SCULLY. Pause.)

MULDER: What about Scully? What do they want with her?

SCULLY: They want my baby.

(SCULLY is exhausted. She looks at KRYCEK.)

SCULLY: Why?

KRYCEK: They didn't even know about it. I don't know exactly how they could have found out just how... how important it is... how special.

SCULLY: My baby is normal.

KRYCEK: Your baby was a miracle. Born of a barren mother's barren womb.

MULDER: Are you saying that they're afraid of it?

KRYCEK: They're afraid of its implications. That it could somehow be greater than them. Something... more human than human.

SCULLY: (whisper) I don't believe this.

SKINNER: You wanted to destroy her child.

KRYCEK: I wanted to destroy the truth before they learn the truth.

MULDER: That there's a God... a higher power.

DOGGETT: I don't believe this crap; I don't believe you're all sitting around here listening to it even when you know this man's a liar. Worse than that.

KRYCEK: You can believe what you want but I don't think you can take the chance that I'm wrong.

(Long pause. MULDER believes. DOGGETT does not.)

KRYCEK: There is no hospital that's safe enough. She may never even make it out of this building.

DOGGETT: Why don't you just shut up?

MULDER: Agent Doggett. Get on the phone. If we're going to get Scully out of here we're going to need some help.



SCENE 20

(Hours later. REYES is in the back seat of a taxi. The CABBIE adjusts his rearview mirror so we can see her.)

REYES: (on phone) Agent Doggett? Agent Doggett, can you hear me? I'm in the cab on my way from the airport.

(DOGGETT is walking through a hall in the FBI building.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) I'll meet you down in the parking garage. I have a car there waiting for you.

REYES: (on phone) Where are we going?

DOGGETT: (on phone) I'll tell you when you get here.

(DOGGETT gets to the elevator and hangs up. He sees SCULLY, flanked by MULDER and SKINNER and followed by KRYCEK approaching.)

KRYCEK: If I'm so full of crap, why all the precautions?

SKINNER: Precisely because you are so full of crap, Krycek.

(SKINNER taps KRYCEK on the chest, then joins SCULLY, MULDER, and DOGGETT in the elevator.)

SKINNER: Your ass stays here.

(KRYCEK smirks at SKINNER as the doors slide shut.)

REYES: (on phone) Agent Doggett, where are you?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Coming around to you.

REYES: (to the driver) Stop the car.

(REYES gets out of the cab. DOGGETT pulls up beside the cab in a beige sedan. He gets out and quickly pays the cabbie.)

DOGGETT: Go. Get out of here.

(The cab pulls away as DOGGETT pulls out his phone.)

REYES: I'm guessing I don't have time to go to the little girls' room?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Okay, bring her down.

(About 50 yards down the deck, the cab screeches to a halt, almost hitting BILLY MILES. BILLY MILES ignores the cab and walks toward the elevators. DOGGETT and REYES begin running toward the elevators.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Mulder, Skinner, he's in the garage!

(The elevator has reached the parking garage. MULDER and SCULLY are in the process of getting off. SKINNER is still on the phone with DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Go back! Go back!

(SKINNER yells to MULDER and SCULLY.)

SKINNER: Get back in the elevator!

(MULDER and SCULLY quickly get back into the elevator. The doors close just as BILLY MILES reaches them. Undaunted, BILLY MILES heads for the stairs. DOGGETT and REYES reach the elevators. One is on an upper level, the other rising. DOGGETT notices the door to the stairs closing.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) He's on the stairs coming up.

(SKINNER, MULDER, and SCULLY get back to the fifth floor. KRYCEK is still there, waiting for them. He smiles.)

KRYCEK: Hey, look who's back.

SKINNER: He's in the building.

(MULDER stops the doors from closing.)

KRYCEK: What do you want me to do?

MULDER: You're going to protect her.

(MULDER gently pushes SCULLY out of the elevator toward KRYCEK. Both SCULLY and KRYCEK are surprised. SCULLY and MULDER look at each other as the doors close again. BILLY MILES comes out of the stairwell onto the fifth floor. He sees no one, but sees the elevator rising to the roof. He goes back into the stairwell to follow. KRYCEK leads SCULLY back out of an office they used as a quick hiding place. BILLY MILES gets to the roof and looks around. He sees SKINNER walking on the other side of the roof.)

(KRYCEK leads SCULLY out the stairwell door to the parking deck. He hands her off to DOGGETT. REYES opens the passenger door of the sedan, and SCULLY gets in and puts her seatbelt on.)

KRYCEK: Drive safely.

(SCULLY's expression indicates she could care less about KRYCEK's concern. REYES gets in the driver's side and starts the car. DOGGETT and KRYCEK watch them drive away down the deck.)

CUT TO: (On the roof, BILLY MILES sees SKINNER walking toward the edge. BILLY MILES parallels him, then crosses toward him around assorted rooftop machinery.)

CUT TO: (REYES and SCULLY get closer to the parking deck exit.)

CUT TO: (SKINNER looks nervously over the side of the building and sees a garbage truck pull up right below him. BILLY MILES is getting closer)

CUT TO: (AGENT CRANE steps in front of the car, his arms up, forcing REYES to stop right at the exit.)

CUT TO: (Just as BILLY MILES is about to do his decapitation head chop on SKINNER, MULDER runs toward them and pushes BILLY MILES over the side of the building. BILLY MILES falls six stories and lands in the back of the garbage truck. AGENT CRANE watches as BILLY MILES falls, then opens the gate for REYES and SCULLY. MULDER and SKINNER watch as the truck compacts BILLY MILES with a crunching sound. Eww. AGENT CRANE signals the driver of the truck.)

AGENT CRANE: Go!

(The truck pulls away and AGENT CRANE signals REYES.)

AGENT CRANE: Go!

(From the roof, MULDER and SKINNER watch as REYES and SCULLY drive off into the night. AGENT CRANE also watches them go. We see a very suspicious bump on the back of AGENT CRANE's neck.)

Scenes from Essence (8X20)

(BILLY MILES walking threateningly toward MULDER and SCULLY sitting in her car outside her apartment building.)

MULDER: Tell us about Billy Miles.

(BILLY MILES throwing MULDER through the glass wall.)

KRYCEK: Call them what you want-- human replacements or alien replicants.

(DOGGETT see the bump in BILLY MILES neck.)

(BILLY MILES beheads DR PARENTI with one swipe of his hand.)

KRYCEK: They're virtually unstoppable.

(KNOWLE ROHRER speaking to DOGGETT at the track.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: I tell you things, but this is a whole other level.

(MULDER in SCULLY's apartment.)

MULDER: It's you who's in danger now, Scully.

(SCULLY getting dressed in the hospital room.)

SCULLY: They want my baby. Why?

KRYCEK: Your baby was a miracle.

MULDER: If we're going to get SCULLY out of here, we're going to need some help.

(REYES is driving SCULLY through the parking deck.)

KRYCEK: She may never even make it out of this building.

(SKINNER steps aside as MULDER pushes BILLY MILES off of the top floor of the parking deck and into a compacting garbage truck.)

KRYCEK: You should all know what it is you're up against. What Agent Scully's up against. There are others just like him.

(AGENT CRANE turns and watches SCULLY and REYES drive away. He also has a bump on his neck.)



SCENE 1
DISTRICT PATHOLOGY LAB
WASHINGTON, DC
4:05 AM

(DR. LANGENHAHN enters the morgue and turns on the lights. A faucet nearby has a slow drip. He goes to the sink and washes his hands. The doors open and the PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT wheels in a cart with a large flat metal box on it.)

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: Dr. Langenhahn, here's the body.

DR. LANGENHAHN: They weren't kidding were they?

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: They said they did about the best they could considering it was all mashed in with that garbage.

(He lifts the heavy box on to the examination table.)

DR. LANGENHAHN: How mashed up is it?

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: Basically, it's hamburger.

(DR. LANGENHAHN has put on latex gloves. He opens the box and is revolted by what he sees inside.)

DR. LANGENHAHN: Ohh... Ugggh. And they want me to do what exactly?

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: Your order was to establish and confirm real fact of death.

(DR. LANGENHAHN glances at the contents of the box and gives an exaggerated yawn.)

DR. LANGENHAHN: I'd say he's dead. How about you?

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: Yes, sir.

DR. LANGENHAHN: Good. I'm going home. You fax me the paperwork by 9:00. I'll sign it, everybody's happy.

(DR. LANGENHAHN notices something in the bloody mess of tissue.)

DR. LANGENHAHN: Ah, crying out loud. See this? They left some... garbage... in with it.

(He gets a long pair of forceps and lifts up a metallic object and examines it.)

PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT: Looks kind of like a vertebra. Only metallic.

DR. LANGENHAHN: Note it on the report... and fax me.

(DR. LANGENHAHN sets the metallic vertebra down on the table and leaves. The PATHOLOGIST'S ASSISTANT closes the box, picks up his laptop and turns out the light as he exits the room. All is still and quiet for a moment, then the vertabra suddenly spins. When it stops, there is another vertabra attached to it. It spins again. Four vertabra. Then six. Then eight. It is replicating itself.)

SCENE 2

(REYES' beige sedan driving along a rural road. DC License plate 42-BIEN. SCULLY wakes up in the passenger seat. For a moment she is disoriented.)

SCULLY: Oh, god. I was hoping this was all a dream. When did the sun come up?

REYES: About six hours ago. Somewhere back in North Carolina.

SCULLY: Where are we?

REYES: We just crossed into Georgia. Long way from home, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Well under the circumstances...

(REYES glances at SCULLY's belly.)

REYES: Right. We can't be too safe.

(REYES looks very jittery.)

SCULLY: Are you all right, Agent Reyes?

REYES: I should ask how you're doing. I mean... You're the one who's going to have this baby.

SCULLY: That's it, isn't it? What you're really worried about?

REYES: Aside from whatever danger we're in... Where we're going doesn't sound like... there's all that much in the way of a  facility. You know what I mean? I've never delivered a baby.

SCULLY: Well, I've never had one. That makes us both beginners.

(REYES gives her a nervous smile.)



SCENE 3

(SKINNER's office. MULDER is showing a grainy black and white picture of BILLY MILES wearing what look like medical scrubs. Nice continuity, Mulder still has the tape stitches that SCULLY put on him in the last episode.)

MULDER: This is a video grab from the DC morgue. It's Billy Miles.

SKINNER: How can that be?

DOGGETT: It can't be. It's impossible.

MULDER: Yeah. It can't be, but it is. Walking out of the morgue looking like a new man.

DOGGETT: His body was taken to the morgue in a little box, for god's sake.

(KRYCEK is sitting on the leather couch against the wall.)

KRYCEK: Like I told you. You can't stop him.

(SKINNER gets up from his desk and crosses threateningly toward KRYCEK.)

SKINNER: Yeah, you know, you keep saying that, Krycek. So why don't you explain it to us because I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding it myself. Billy Miles was scraped out of the back of a garbage truck. I saw him go in, I saw him come out.

(SKINNER tosses the picture into KRYCEK's lap. KRYCEK glances at it casually.)

KRYCEK: Well, I don't know if I can explain it in any technical sense, but... that's Billy Miles, without a doubt.

(KRYCEK hands the picture back to SKINNER.)

SKINNER: (angry) You're sitting there for one reason, Krycek. Because you can explain it.

KRYCEK: I told you-- he's a human replacement. Some new kind of alien 

(DOGGETT looks up.)

KRYCEK: . created to aid in the repopulation of the planet.

MULDER: Which Scully is a threat to.

KRYCEK: If she has that baby.

DOGGETT: Well, I don't care who he is or what you think he's made of there's no way he's going to find her. No way.

KRYCEK: Well, maybe he's not but there are others out there just like him. And it's only a matter of time before they will.

(There is a knock at the door, and AGENT CRANE enters.)

AGENT CRANE: Agent Doggett? See you a moment?

(DOGGETT glances at the other men in the room then joins AGENT CRANE in the hallway. He sighs when he recognizes the man waiting in the office across the hall.)

AGENT CRANE: There's someone here to see you. His name is Knowle Rohrer. He says you know each other and what he's here for can't wait.



SCENE 4

(Night. REYES and SCULLY arrive at a deserted and dilapidated resort area. Rather depressing. REYES turns off the headlights of the car, but the area is still well lit from the night sky above. Both women get out of the car. SCULLY, her hands on her lower back, looks around as REYES gets some supplies out of the back seat.)

REYES: End of the road.

SCULLY: Yeah. Literally. Anybody finds us out here, it really will be a miracle. Where exactly are we?

REYES: Democrat Hot Springs. According to Agent Doggett this is where people used to come for the waters-- until the springs dried up and they quit coming. He was born here.

SCULLY: Really? Well that's... comforting. I guess. (She doesn't sound comforted.) So, where do you want to set up?

(REYES confidently leads them to one of the buildings.)

REYES: Over here.

SCULLY: Any particular reason?

REYES: I think I told you, I feel these energies about people and stuff and places. I found it works best to go with my instincts.

(They enter one of the abandoned buildings. On the window of the building are painted the words, "Water from the rock, Exodus 7:16." REYES' flashlight shows a thick layer of dust covering everything, including the old iron daybed in the middle of the room.)

SCULLY: I'm getting a feeling myself.

(Her tone indicates that the feeling is that "This place sucks." SCULLY crosses to a cobweb-covered sink. She turns the handle. Nothing happens.)

SCULLY: Well, there's no water from this rock. We're going to need some water and a place to boil it. Along with sterile supplies and a clean place to do this delivery.

(Again, REYES looks very nervous. She smiles weakly at SCULLY.)

REYES: I'm a little stiff from the drive.

(REYES hands SCULLY the flashlight. SCULLY sighs and begins looking around the filthy room.)

SCULLY: Okay.

(REYES goes outside again to smoke. She looks up and sees a stationary bright light in the sky. It could be a very bright star. She looks at it a moment, takes another drag, then stubs out the cigarette with her foot and heads slowly back into the building.)



SCENE 5

(X-Files office. DOGGETT is talking to KNOWLE ROHRER.)

DOGGETT: It's not like you, Knowle coming to see me when you make me work so hard to see you.

KNOWLE ROHRER: This couldn't wait, John. It's about this thing you're pursuing.

DOGGETT: This thing?

KNOWLE ROHRER: This man you're after. I think you know what I'm talking about.

DOGGETT: I think I'm confused, Knowle-- if it's a man or if it's a thing.

KNOWLE ROHRER: It's military, John. It goes all the way to the top. I can't overstate the sensitivity. Let me say there was a rumored program out of the cold war. A plan to create a super-soldier.

DOGGETT: Well, this kid I'm talking about was pretty damn super. Got right up out of a gutbucket and hit the ground running. Kid wasn't exactly what I'd call military material. In fact, they say he was an alien abductee.

KNOWLE ROHRER: You got it half right, John.

DOGGETT: Which half?

KNOWLE ROHRER: What you're chasing is a prototype.

DOGGETT: Uh-huh. And this so-called prototype... what is he after?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Oh, I think you know that, too, John. He's after your partner, Scully. You may not be aware that she was part of a program herself. Six years ago, Agent Scully was taken in a military operation staged as an abduction. They put a chip in the back of her neck to monitor her. It was also used to make her pregnant with the first organic version of that same super-soldier.

(DOGGETT gives a short nervous laugh.)

DOGGETT: What do you want from me?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Help us catch him so we can put him down before he finds her.

DOGGETT: You assume I know where she is.

KNOWLE ROHRER: Who does? Your superior?

(DOGGETT doesn't answer.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: Whoever knows, his life's in danger, too. I want you to know.



SCENE 6

(5th Floor of the FBI building. MULDER has left SKINNER's office and is waiting at the elevator. He looks up at the panel. The car appears to be held up on the 4th floor. MULDER sighs and takes the stairs. Just as the door closes behind him, the elevator doors open and BILLY MILES comes out and walks purposefully down the hall.)

(Inside SKINNER's office, KRYCEK looks up, then stands. SKINNER is behind his desk looking through a file.)

SKINNER: Sit down, Krycek.

(KRYCEK drops something, a soda can?, in the trash can and looks out the open single door. He then turns and leaves the office by the double doors.)

SKINNER: Hey! What'd I tell you?! Hey!

(The single door opens and BILLY MILES enters and stares at SKINNER. SKINNER sensibly runs out the double doors after KRYCEK. KRYCEK has entered the elevator. SKINNER is running down the hall followed by BILLY MILES.)

SKINNER: Krycek! Krycek! Hold the door!

(KRYCEK presses a button and calmly allows the doors to close.)

SKINNER: Hold the door, Krycek! Krycek!

(At the last possible second, SKINNER gets his hand in the door and manages to wedge himself inside. The doors close. SKINNER glares at KRYCEK. The elevator begins to move down, but screeches to a halt as BILLY MILES' hand crashes through the door, striking SKINNER on the head. KRYCEK looks on nervously as the hand is dragged back out of the elevator by its downward motion. SKINNER is lying on the floor of the elevator, a bloody gash on his forehead.)



SCENE 7

(SKINNER's hospital room. MULDER is looking with concern at SKINNER who is sleeping in a pink? hospital gown.. There is a bandage on the gash in his head. Clock reads about 10:40. DOGGETT looks in the room.)

DOGGETT: Mulder.

(MULDER pats SKINNER gently on the shoulder and joins DOGGETT in the hallway.)

MULDER: You heard about this, right?

DOGGETT: How is he?

MULDER: He's got a concussion. They're going to keep him here for observation. Where were you when this all happened?

DOGGETT: In my office, talking to somebody who warned me this might happen.

MULDER: Who?

(DOGGETT sighs.)

MULDER: Skinner could've been killed. He's lucky he wasn't.

DOGGETT: He's an old friend. He tells me stuff I'm not supposed to know. I didn't want to believe it.

MULDER: What exactly did he tell you?

DOGGETT: He said that Billy Miles isn't what you think he is. He's a product of a government program looking to build a super soldier. He said Agent Scully's a part of that program, too; that her pregnancy was triggered by a chip they put in her neck.

(This really pisses MULDER off.)

MULDER: I want to know who the hell you've been talking to

(A nearby NURSE looks up at the sound of MULDER's raised voice. Irritated, MULDER leads DOGGETT farther down the hall and lowers his voice.)

MULDER: .--- who this trusted source of yours is who's been spinning this fantasy.

DOGGETT: His name's Knowle Rohrer. He's deep inside US Intelligence. I don't know much more than that.

MULDER: Did he ever lie to you? Give you bad information, false leads?

(DOGGETT pauses and avoids MULDER's eyes.)

MULDER: (incredulously) Well, you have to think about it?

DOGGETT: He says Scully's in danger. He wants to stop this guy. How's that so different than what we're saying?

MULDER: You didn't tell him where she is, did you?

DOGGETT: No, but I'm beginning to think that the fact that I know is going to catch up with me if AD Skinner's any indication.

MULDER: (emphatically) You don't tell anybody where she is. That's the deal, right? Not even me.

DOGGETT: What if something happens to me?

(MULDER's turn to sigh.)

MULDER: This, uh, trusted source of yours told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles. Did he happen to tell you how he plans to do this?

DOGGETT: No.

MULDER: Right. Well, what do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he really is?



SCENE 8

(Democrat Hot Springs. Day, SCULLY is standing outside near the car, beige trench coat, hands on her lower back. REYES calls to her from the doorway of the building.)

REYES: Dana... Come see what you think.

(SCULLY waddles into the building. She gasps in surprise.)

SCULLY: Oh, my goodness. Look at this. Look at you. Wow.

(The transformation is indeed incredible. The hardwood floor gleams it is so clean. Everything has been thoroughly cleaned. Sunlight streams through the windows. SCULLY lowers herself onto the iron daybed which now is covered in a set of sheets. Another clean set of sheets sits on the edge. Unlit candles are strategically placed around the room.)

REYES: (proudly) I found them folded up in a cabinet upstairs. And a nice porcelain basin and a whole box of candles.

SCULLY: Do we have matches?

REYES: (embarrassed smile) I've got a lighter.

SCULLY: Yeah.

REYES: Now all we need is some mood music. Like whale song.

SCULLY: Whale song?

REYES: Yeah, they've got these recordings of whales talking to each other, calling back and forth.

(SCULLY stares at her as REYES closes her eyes and makes some very bizarre whale moans.)

REYES: I... I don't know. It's like... it's almost metaphysical.

(REYES notices SCULLY's skeptical gaze and smiles.)

REYES: You're looking at me like... I don't know, I probably sound like a goof.

SCULLY: No, no, it's not that. Um, I was thinking that you reminded me of someone that I was close to-- my sister.

REYES: You're not close to her still?

SCULLY: Uh, she was killed... about five years ago... in my home. (She sighs, and catches her breath.) It was a terrible time.

(REYES gently rests her hand on SCULLY's shoulder.)

SCULLY: Oh, it's, uh... It's okay. Oh, thank you. Thank you for, um... putting this together and... it's not what I planned but, um... it's very nice.

(REYES smiles. All is okay. She looks up at movement outside through the stained glass window of Moses getting water from a rock.)

SCULLY: What?

REYES: There's someone out there. Stay here.

(REYES pulls her gun from the holster at the small of her back and goes outside. She sees nothing. She walks down the dirt street, sees nothing, and finally lowers her weapon. She turns back suddenly at the sound of a vehicle approaching. A dirty green SUV whips around the corner and drives quickly toward REYES who stands her ground, gun ready. At the last second, the SUV stops. The windows are so dirty we can't see inside.)

REYES: Get out of the car! I'm a Federal Agent!

(SCULLY is watching from the door of the building, but pulls back out of sight as the door of the SUV opens. There is what looks like a Forest Service emblem on the door. The uniformed GAME WARDEN, an outdoorsy-looking woman in her 40's gets out, her hands up. She speaks calmly and with authority. Very authentic Southern accent. CarriK knows.)

GAME WARDEN: I don't care who you are. Let's start by putting that weapon away. Just point it down now.

(REYES lowers the gun cautiously.)

REYES: I'm a Federal Agent.

GAME WARDEN: I heard you the first time. Just let me see some identification.

(REYES and the GAME WARDEN enter the building.)

REYES: Dana?

(SCULLY enters the room slowly, holding up her badge.)

SCULLY: I'm sure that this looks untoward but my life is in danger. And my baby's. There's a man who's pursuing us and it is very important that he not find us here.

GAME WARDEN: We get hunters in here taking deer and game off-season. I've heard every excuse in the book but this one's far too original. You don't, uh, plan to have it here?

REYES: It's not as crazy as it sounds. I mean, I hope it's not. She's a doctor; she can coach me.

GAME WARDEN: And what if something goes wrong? If you're a doctor you know the risks. You're unprepared here.

SCULLY: This man... he's extremely dangerous.

(SCULLY and the GAME WARDEN look at each other a moment. The GAME WARDEN nods.)

GAME WARDEN: I got a first aid kit in my truck. It's pretty basic but better to have than not. I'll be back with some towels and proper swaddling.

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY and REYES looks at each other as the GAME WARDEN leaves.)



SCENE 9
FBI PARKING GARAGE
2:56 AM

(DOGGETT parks his car and looks over at MULDER in the passenger seat.)

MULDER: Hey. You know, how is it that this friend of yours is so desperate for your help? And then when we want to reach him, all of a sudden he's unreachable, nowhere to be found?

DOGGETT: I don't know, maybe he got wind. Maybe he got spooked. But I'm beginning to think it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

MULDER: You told me that he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles. Are you telling me now that you think he's a liar?

DOGGETT: He is or he isn't. What the hell difference does it really make?

MULDER: It doesn't make any difference at all. Unless you want to protect Scully and that baby.

DOGGETT: And then what? How long can you keep this up? How long until the next Billy Miles rears his head? The next threat? The next phantom? You ever stop to ask yourself?

(MULDER listens and is uncomfortable.)

DOGGETT: All the sacrifice, the blood spilled-- you've given nearly a decade of your life. Where the hell is it all going to end?

(MULDER thinks for a moment.)

MULDER: (softly) I don't know. Maybe it doesn't.

(MULDER looks over as another car whips through the garage. He closes his door then leans down out of sight.)

MULDER: Start the car.

DOGGETT: What?

MULDER: Alex Krycek just pulled in.

(DOGGETT starts the engine and follows KRYCEK's car to an upper level. KRYCEK parks. There is someone else in the car. DOGGETT stops the car close enough to see, but not be conspicuous.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is he doing here? How did he get security clearance?

MULDER: You recognize his passenger?

(DOGGETT does recognize the passenger.)

DOGGETT: Yeah. It's Knowle Rohrer.



SCENE 10

(Night. Democrat Hot Springs. SCULLY is sitting next to a table with a few fat candles burning. She is blotting her face with a damp cloth. REYES brings over a bucket of water and pours it into the porcelain basin.)

SCULLY: Thank you. Thank you.

(REYES looks down at SCULLY affectionately.)

REYES: I have to say with everything I know you must be feeling you look amazingly beautiful, Dana.

(SCULLY doesn't know how to respond.)

SCULLY: And what about what you're feeling? Any vibrations, Agent Reyes?

REYES: I don't know.

(REYES reaches down and puts on her jacket.)

SCULLY: What?

REYES: I don't know if I'm just being paranoid... (sighs) but something feels off.

(SCULLY looks at her curiously.)

REYES: We need some more water.

(REYES goes outside with the bucket. She looks up and sees the same bright light in the sky in the exact same place as from the night before. She gazes at it for a moment in confusion, then goes to the old-fashioned pump nearby and begins filling the bucket. We see movement behind her. As she looks up, BILLY MILES grabs her and flings her against the side of a barn. She picks up a handy pitchfork and holds it nervously as BILLY MILES approaches her. Suddenly, there is a loud gun blast. BILLY MILES is thrown to the ground, a large bloody hole in his torso. He doesn't move. The GAME WARDEN comes around the side of the building, a large shotgun still trained on BILLY MILES. REYES breathes heavily.)

(REYES and the GAME WARDEN are dragging BILLY MILES' body down the dark dirt street. SCULLY comes out of the building to meet them.)

REYES: Go back inside, Dana.

(They drop BILLY MILES and the GAME WARDEN runs to her truck.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

(SCULLY looks down and sees who it is.)

REYES: Dana, it's okay. He's dead.

(SCULLY is upset.)

SCULLY: No, it's not okay. What do you mean?

REYES: Exactly what I said. Now go on inside. We'll take care of this.

SCULLY: They said that he couldn't be stopped!

REYES: Dana, he's got no vitals. He's lost too much blood.

(SCULLY looks down at the body again. REYES notices BILLY MILES neck and folds back the collar, exposing the lumps. The GAME WARDEN has brought her truck around.)

GAME WARDEN: Is this the man you're afraid of? How did he find you out here? I do have to report this thing.

SCULLY: No, you can't do that.

GAME WARDEN: I don't have any real choice.

(SCULLY is looking inward.)

SCULLY: No, I mean, I, um... I just felt a contraction.

(The GAME WARDEN looks back at REYES who looks very nervous.)



SCENE 11

(FBI parking garage. DOGGETT and MULDER are still watching KRYCEK's car. They see movement.)

DOGGETT: Something's happening.

(KNOWLE ROHRER gets out of the car and heads for the elevators.)

DOGGETT: Where's he going?

MULDER: Not to see you, that's for sure.

DOGGETT: Who the hell's he going to see?

(DOGGETT gets out of the car and turns back to MULDER.)

MULDER: You go ahead. I got Krycek.

(DOGGETT runs up the stairs. He stops at the third floor and looks briefly out into the hall. Sees nothing. He runs up to the fourth floor and enters the hall. Nothing. He hears the elevator ding. KNOWLE ROHRER exits the elevator, and as DOGGETT watches from around a corner, he enters KERSH's outer office and knocks. AGENT CRANE joins him from inside KERSH's office. What sounds like KERSH's voice is coming out of the office. KNOWLE ROHRER and AGENT CRANE listen, then heads back to the elevator. After they are out of sight, DOGGETT runs to SKINNER's fifth floor office and picks up the ASSISTANT's phone and starts to dial.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT turns, hangs up, startled to see SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: What are you doing here?

SKINNER: They let me out of the hospital tonight. What are you doing here?

DOGGETT: I got Mulder down in the parking garage watching Alex Krycek.

(DOGGETT picks up a phone again and dials.)

SKINNER: What the hell is Krycek doing here?

(SKINNER really, REALLY doesn't like KRYCEK.)

DOGGETT: That's what I'm trying to figure out.

(MULDER, still in the car, watching KRYCEK answers his cell phone.)

MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?

DOGGETT: (on phone) He's here with Agent Crane.

MULDER: (on phone) Agent Crane? How the hell does he know Agent Crane?

DOGGETT: (on phone) That's a damn good question. He doesn't.

(SKINNER picks up the other extension and listens in.)

MULDER: (on phone) You been wondering who's getting these guys past security, how Billy Miles is in the FBI? Agent Crane is in on this with your friend, which means he's in on it with Krycek. They've been in on it all along.

DOGGETT: (on phone) I don't understand. In on what?

MULDER: (on phone) Fooling us, Agent Doggett. Into chasing after Billy Miles. Into believing that we could protect her.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Scully?

MULDER: (on phone) Yes, they know where she is.

DOGGETT: (on phone) No, no, no. Only I know where she is.

MULDER: (on phone) You and Agent Reyes. You called her from a phone inside the FBI, didn't you?

SKINNER: (on phone) There's no way Crane can tap calls in here, Mulder. He'd have to have access to the communications system.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Skinner's here with me.

MULDER: (on phone) Maybe this goes even higher. Listen to me, I've got to get to Scully. You've got to tell me where she is, where you sent her.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Look. We can nail these guys here, Mulder. We can put an end to it.

MULDER: (on phone) No, you listen. You've got to get out of there. You've got no guarantee these guys aren't alien replacements, too.

(DOGGETT sighs and rubs his temples.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Northern Georgia. A place called Democrat Hot Springs.

(MULDER looks over to KRYCEK's car. It is empty. Suddenly, the car window shatters beside him. KRYCEK grabs MULDER's phone.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Mulder!

(KRYCEK crushes MULDER's phone under his foot. There goes another one. KRYCEK cocks the gun and holds it on MULDER. At least he won't have to fill out a report on this one.)

KRYCEK: Get out of the car.

(MULDER resignedly climbs out the driver's side to avoid the shattered glass.)

KRYCEK: Doesn't seem fair now. Doesn't seem right. Coming down to this.

MULDER: What do you know about fair or right, Krycek? You're a coward.

(MULDER slowly walks around the car to face KRYCEK.)

KRYCEK: I could've killed you so many times, Mulder. You've got to know that. I'm the one that kept you alive. (his voice cracks a little) Praying you'd win somehow.

MULDER: Then there really is no God.

KRYCEK: You think I'm bad. That I'm a killer. We wanted the same thing, brother. That's what you don't understand.

MULDER: I wanted to stop them. All you wanted was to save your own ass.

KRYCEK: No. I tried to stop them. Tried to kill  Scully's baby to stop them. It's too late. The tragedy's that you-- you wouldn't let it go. That's why I have to do this. 'Cause you know how deep it goes. Right into the FBI.

MULDER: You want to kill me, Alex, kill me. Like you killed my father. Just don't insult me trying to make me understand.

(KRYCEK's finger slowly and reluctantly tightens on the trigger. His face is contorted with indecision. MULDER is calm. He and MULDER stare at each other. A gun is fired. KRYCEK gasps in pain and falls, dropping his gun. There is a bullet wound in his right arm. He looks up and sees SKINNER a few yards away, gun in hand. KRYCEK reaches down to pick up his gun and screams in pain and falls to the ground again as SKINNER shoots him in the right arm again. His arm is now useless. Weakly, KRYCEK uses his prosthetic left arm to push his most definitely unregistered gun toward SKINNER.)

KRYCEK: It's going to take more bullets than you can... ever fire to win this game. But one bullet... and I can give you a thousand lives.

(He looks up at MULDER.)

KRYCEK: Shoot Mulder.

(SKINNER looks at MULDER. MULDER looks at SKINNER. SKINNER raises his gun and fires. KRYCEK, the Ratboy, falls to the ground, a bullet hole between his eyes. Goodbye, Krycek. Without any regret, MULDER glances at SKINNER, then walks to the driver's side of the car.)

MULDER: I'm going to go to the airport. I need that location from Agent Doggett.

MULDER: Skinner, are you with me?

SKINNER: You just go. I'll get him.

(As MULDER starts the car and drives away, SKINNER glances down at KRYCEK's dead body, then slowly turns and walks away.)



SCENE 12

(Democrat Hot Springs. SCULLY is sitting on the daybed and groaning heavily. The GAME WARDEN dampens a cloth and runs to kneel between SCULLY's legs.)

GAME WARDEN: They're two minutes apart now. It's not going to be long.

(REYES holds up what looks like a gray t-shirt. Mulder's?)

REYES: How's this?

SCULLY: That's great.

(REYES looks down in horror at the GAME WARDEN's exposed neck. She has the bumps.)

(CUT TO: Inside the FBI building. DOGGETT is looking around KERSH's office? He goes out into the hall in time to see AGENT CRANE and KNOWLE ROHRER come out of the elevator. DOGGETT holds his gun on them.)

DOGGETT: Right there! Both of you!

(They begin walking toward him.)

DOGGETT: I'm prepared to use force!

(They keep coming. DOGGETT runs. This will not win him points on AutumnT's Manly Man Meter. He runs down the stairs and meets up with SKINNER who pulls him toward the parking deck.)

SKINNER: Come on! Agent Doggett... come on!

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. SCULLY is now wearing the gray t-shirt. Nervously, REYES sets a bucket of cold water next to a bucket of boiling water on a table and hands the GAME WARDEN a glass of water dipped from the cold bucket.)

REYES: Here you go.

(The GAME WARDEN hands the glass to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY, now wearing the gray t-shirt, takes a sip of water and hands the glass back to the GAME WARDEN.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(REYES picks up the bucket of boiling water and flings it into the GAME WARDEN's face. The GAME WARDEN screams in agony. REYES pulls out her gun.)

REYES: Move!

(SCULLY is very confused and very in labor.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes... what?

(REYES cocks the shotgun gun, holding it on the GAME WARDEN who is in a great deal of pain.)

REYES: Move out of here!

(Screaming, GAME WARDEN crawls outside, followed by REYES.)

SCULLY: What's happening?

(The GAME WARDEN is kneeling on the porch. Her face is badly blistered from the heat of the water, but her voice is strong.)

REYES: Who are you?!

(Cars and trucks begin arriving around the building.)

GAME WARDEN: This baby will be born.

(REYES lowers the shotgun in shock as she watches BILLY MILES stand up from where he had been lying dead in the street. "People" begin getting out of the cars and walking toward the building. From inside the building SCULLY screams.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes!

(CUT TO: FBI parking garage. DOGGETT and SKINNER come running out of the stairwell.)

SKINNER: The Blazer!

(DOGGETT and SKINNER get in the SUV. SKINNER starts the engine.)

SKINNER: Get Mulder on the phone!

(SKINNER pulls the SUV out of the parking space. AGENT CRANE and KNOWLE ROHRER come out of the elevator and split up to pursue DOGGETT and SKINNER. SKINNER guns the engine and runs into AGENT CRANE who shatters the windshield as he is tossed over the top of the vehicle. They look behind. Nothing. DOGGETT has just enough time to take a sigh of relief before AGENT CRANE leans over from his perch on top of the moving vehicle and shatters the passenger window.)

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. REYES comes back into the building and kneels between SCULLY's legs. SCULLY is gasping and sweating.)

SCULLY: What's happening?! What?

(REYES is trying to be calm and comforting.)

REYES: It's okay, Dana.

SCULLY: What... What...

REYES: It's going to be okay.

(SCULLY looks up at the door as a group of people led by BILLY MILES silently enter.)

SCULLY: (groaning in horror) No!

(REYES grimaces sadly as she sees them enter. SCULLY gasps in agony and terror. Another labor pain hits her)

(CUT TO: FBI parking garage. DOGGETT and AGENT crane are struggling as SKINNER tries to maneuver the SUV down the ramp of the parking deck. KNOWLE ROHRER is following them in his car.)

SKINNER: Get him off!

(DOGGETT gasps for breath as AGENT CRANE gets him around the neck.)

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. BILLY MILES and the other Replicants are standing around SCULLY's bed as she is in the final stages of labor, groaning in agony. REYES is concentrating only on SCULLY and the baby. SCULLY is staring at the Replicants in fear.)

SCULLY: This is my baby!

REYES: You've got to push, Dana.

SCULLY: (begging pitifully) Please don't let them take it!

(CUT TO: FBI parking garage. KNOWLE ROHRER, his face grim, speeds through the deck in a dark sedan.)

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. Labor intensifies.)

REYES: Come on, Dana. Push!

(SCULLY screams.)

(CUT TO: FBI parking garage. DOGGETT continues to struggle with AGENT CRANE as SKINNER drives.)

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. SCULLY groans.)

SCULLY: Please don't let this happen.

REYES: Dana, push!

(SCULLY screams defiantly at BILLY MILES, the GAME WARDEN, and the other Replicants.)

SCULLY: It's mine!

(CUT TO: FBI parking garage. DOGGETT still struggles with AGENT CRANE.)

SKINNER: Hold on!

(SKINNER steers the SUV close to a concrete support. AGENT CRANE is knocked off. A moment later, KNOWLE ROHRER hits AGENT CRANE with his car, sending him flying. Then, KNOWLE ROHRER crashes his car into the wall. CAR explodes in a fiery inferno. It doesn't look intentional.)

(CUT TO: Democrat Hot Springs. SCULLY is yelling desperately.)

REYES: Harder! Push, Dana!

(SCULLY is silent a moment, straining, whimpering. The Replicants are watching.)

REYES: Keep breathing, Dana. Keep breathing.

SCULLY: (pleading) Please don't let them take it!

REYES: Push! Push. Push, Dana, push!

(SCULLY does, crying out in pain. A newborn baby's cry joins hers. REYES is suddenly very busy between SCULLY's legs. Gasping both in relief and fear, SCULLY grips the iron bed as she looks up at BILLY MILES and the others who stand watching, silent and still. The baby cries in the background.)

(CUT TO: Helicopter above Democrat Hot Springs. MULDER on headset gives instructions to the pilot.)

MULDER: Down there. Get me down there.

(The helicopter lands and MULDER gets out. The Replicants are all getting back into their cars and trucks and leaving. MULDER runs between them trying to get someone to talk to him. They all ignore him.)

MULDER: Hey! Scully! Scully! Where is she?! Scully! Where is she?! (yelling) Scully! Where is she? Tell me where she is!

(REYES come out of the building.)

REYES: Mulder!

(MULDER runs to REYES. The helicopter still hovers a few feet from the ground.)

MULDER: How is she?

(REYES is exhausted.)

REYES: She's inside. She needs to get to the hospital.

(MULDER looks at her for a second with concern only for SCULLY, then enters the building.)



SCENE 13

(KERSH's office. DOGGETT is sitting in front of the desk. KERSH is tense and furious.)

KERSH: I'm to take this story seriously? These incidents at the FBI. This account of Agent Scully's birth. I'm to submit this report as quality investigative work? As representative of actual fact?

DOGGETT: I signed the report there, sir.

KERSH: Yeah, I see it, John. And I see her signature here, too. On an X-File.

(We now see that REYES is sitting beside DOGGETT.)

KERSH: (sarcastically) I'd like to know when you assigned yourself, Agent Reyes.

REYES: Agent Doggett assigned me, sir.

KERSH: Agent Doggett cannot just assume the authority of this office.

DOGGETT: I assume it because this office is under investigation. For the late-night meeting between you, Agent Crane, and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer.

REYES: Both men were presumed dead but are now missing. In actual fact.

(KERSH looks rather nervous. DOGGETT opens the door for REYES.)

KERSH: You investigate what I tell you.

DOGGETT: And you put me on the X-Files. That's what I'm investigating.

(DOGGETT closes the door behind him and REYES as they exit.)



SCENE 14

(MULDER uses his key to enter SCULLY's apartment. He looks around the living room as he fingers the key thoughtfully. He walks toward the bedroom and stands near the doorway. The LONE GUNMEN are there, looking at something in the bedroom. They are all holding gifts. As one, they look up at MULDER. FROHIKE looks back into the room.)

FROHIKE: Get some rest.

[CLOSED CAPTIONING: SCULLY: Yeah.]

(The LONE GUNMEN join MULDER in the living room. Everyone is speaking softly.)

FROHIKE: We didn't hear you come in.

LANGLY: We were just dropping off gifts.

BYERS: We just wanted to...

MULDER: See it with your own eyes.

FROHIKE: It's incredible, you know? You arriving in time to save Scully. Getting her to a hospital.

BYERS: We still don't know how you did it. Speaking with Agent Doggett he said they never reached you with specific coordinates.

(Pause. MULDER has a small smile.)

MULDER: There was a light. I followed it.

(The GUNMEN set their presents on a table.)

LANGLY: Guess we got our next headline.

(The GUNMEN leave. MULDER waits a moment, then enters the bedroom, smiling. SCULLY is sitting on the edge of the bed against the headboard. She is wearing white satin pajamas and a loose blue robe. She is holding a small bundle of blankets.)

MULDER: How's everybody doing?

SCULLY: We're doing just fine.

(Smiling, SCULLY rises from the bed and carries the baby to MULDER He gently pushes the blanket away from the baby's face.)

MULDER: Hey, now.

(The BABY begins fussing softly.)

MULDER: (with tender authority) None of that.

(SCULLY smiles, looks up at MULDER and then gently transfers the baby to MULDER's arms. MULDER is nervous but awed and delighted. The baby calms in his arms. MULDER is beaming. He glances from the baby to SCULLY.)

MULDER: (breathlessly) Hi.

(He hums softly. He looks up at SCULLY again.)

MULDER: What are you going to call him?

SCULLY: William.

(He looks at her.)

SCULLY: After your father.

(They gaze at each other for a long moment. She smiles warmly. He looks back down at the baby.)

MULDER: Well, I don't know. He's... he's got your coloring and your eyes. But he looks suspiciously like Assistant Director Skinner.

(MULDER and SCULLY laugh, then SCULLY frowns in confusion.)

SCULLY: I don't understand, Mulder-- they came to take him from us-- why they didn't.

(SCULLY's theme begins playing.)

MULDER: I don't quite understand that either. Except that maybe he isn't what they thought he was. That doesn't make him any less of a miracle though, does it?

SCULLY: From the moment I became pregnant, I feared the truth... about how... and why. And I know that you feared it, too.

MULDER: I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know.

SCULLY: Which is what?

(Still holding the BABY between them, MULDER leans down and kisses SCULLY on the lips. And keeps kissing her. SCULLY reaches out to hold MULDER's arms and returns the lover's kiss. The Triangle kiss was passionate, but it wasn't really her. The Millennium kiss was sweet, but could be interpreted as friendly. This is the one. No questions left. The kiss continues as the screen fades to credits 10 seconds later. Thank you, Chris Carter. CarriK's Husband gets nervous as he sees CarriK's pupils turn into bassinets.)

[THE END]

                                   NOTHING IMPORTANT HAPPENED TODAY 

DUE TO SOME VIOLENT CONTENT, PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED.


SCENE 1
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND
9:27 PM

(Fade in. A warmly lit Baltimore bar. We see a man's hand, that of CARL WORMUS, inside a tumbler of Scotch, removing an ice cube out of his drink. He is sitting at the bar and tosses the ice onto the ground behind him. He turns to see a woman, SHANNON MCMAHON, walking into the bar. We do not see her face, just her torso and her arm from the side. She is dressed up in a low-cut black dress. She slides into a seat at the bar. We can now see her strong face and long dark hair.)

SHANNON MCMAHON: (To the bartender) Vodka on the rocks.

(The bartender pours her drink for her on the bar.)

(CARL WORMUS rises up and moves over to SHANNON MCMAHON and sits at the seat next to her.)

CARL WORMUS: Hi. How are ya?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Thirsty.

CARL WORMUS: (Turning to the bartender for another drink) Um, straight up. And no ice this time.

(Turning back to SHANNON MCMAHON)

CARL WORMUS: I tell this guy about the ice and then he pours me a scotch rocks.

SHANNON MCMAHON: What's wrong with the ice?

CARL WORMUS: It's the water, actually, in the ice. I'm kind of an expert on it.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Well, what's wrong with it?

CARL WORMUS: No big secret. It's been in the news. Government additive. Something they call chloramine.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Yeah, they say that's good for us, it's like fluoride or something.

CARL WORMUS: Well, that's what they say. Look, um, I didn't sit down here to scare you. (He smiles) On the contrary.

SHANNON MCMAHON: (with a smile) Would you like to get some air?

(CUT TO: Night. Outside. CARL WORMUS and SHANNON MCMAHON are seated in the front of his silver convertible, driving along a road.)

CARL WORMUS: Long way to go for a drink, huh?

(No response.)

CARL WORMUS: Do you like living out here?

(SHANNON MCMAHON just smiles, without saying a word. He grins, but seems to be getting impatient.)

CARL WORMUS: How much farther?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Just over the bridge.

(CUT OVER TO: A bridge over the river. It is a drawbridge over the Potomac River and now it is in the process of rising up. The barricade is being closed and we see the lights of the CARL WORMUS's car approaching at speed.)

(CUT BACK: In the car. CARL WORMUS is slowing the car down because of the rising bridge. SHANNON MCMAHON slowly puts her left hand down on the CARL WORMUS's right leg. He smiles, as she does it. All of a sudden, she presses her hand down firmly on his leg pressing his foot down on the accelerator. The car begins speeding up.)

CARL WORMUS: (Alarmed) What the hell you doing?

(SHANNON MCMAHON just stares ahead of her.)

CARL WORMUS: Let go! (She leans over and grabs the steering wheel. The car is still speeding up as it nears the barricade.)

CARL WORMUS: You'll gonna kill us!

(The car crashes through the barricade and flies off the bridge, straight into the water. Once in the water, it sinks to the bottom of the river quickly. SHANNON MCMAHON appears to be unconscious, just sitting in her seat motionless. CARL WORMUS struggles to release his seatbelt to swim to the surface. With a little effort he manages to release himself and begins rising up. Suddenly, SHANNON MCMAHON opens her eyes, outstretches an arm and grabs him by his ankle. CARL WORMUS desperately tries to escape her grip and get to the surface, but SHANNON MCMAHON pulls him back down towards the car. We see CARL WORMUS's outstretched arm slowly drift down out of the shot.)

SCENE 2 CUT TO:

(Scenes from the last two episodes from Season 8, Essence, 8X20 and Existence, 8X21.)

CHRIS CARTER: (Voiceover) Last season on The X-Files ...

(KNOWLE ROHRER and DOGGETT talking in the X-Files office.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: There was a rumoured program out of the cold war. A plan to create a super-soldier.

(A series of shots showing BILLY MILES beheading DUFFY HASKELL, a shot of a deformed embryo inside a jar and a shot of SCULLY lying on an examination table in the hospital. This shot is from Per Manum, 8X08.)

DOGGETT: I didn't want to believe it. He said Agent Scully's a part of that program too.

CUT TO:

(KRYCEK talking to MULDER, SCULLY, SKINNER and DOGGETT in an FBI office.)

KRYCEK: Your baby was a miracle.

SCULLY: My baby is normal.

CUT TO:

(BILLY MILES falling down from the roof of an FBI building.)

KRYCEK: She may never even make it out of this building.

(DOGGETT and SKINNER in the car in the FBI parking garage with AGENT

CRANE on the roof of their car and KNOWLE ROHRER in pursuit.)

SKINNER: Get him off!

CUT TO:

(SCULLY and REYES in their hiding place in Democrat Hot Springs. Surrounded by a bunch of alien replicants. BILLY MILES is one of them.)

SCULLY: This is my baby! Please don't let them take it!

REYES: Push, Dana!

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT and REYES in KERSH's office.)

DOGGETT: This office is under investigation. For the late-night meeting between you and an intelligence operative named Knowle Rohrer.

KERSH: You investigate what I tell you.

(DOGGETT and REYES standing in the doorway of the office.)

DOGGETT: You put me on the X-Files.

CUT TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY at SCULLY's home in her bedroom holding their new son WILLIAM between them.)

MULDER: I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know.

(MULDER leans closer to SCULLY and they kiss.)



SCENE 3
WASHINGTON, D.C.
48 HOURS LATER

(Day. A beautiful shot of the Washington Monument.)

CUT TO:

(Inside SCULLY's apartment. There's a person taking a shower in her bathroom. Although we do not see the figure's face we know that it is MULDER. Then we hear baby's cries, as the camera pans out of the bathroom into the bedroom where SCULLY's little boy, WILLIAM, is crying louder and louder. SCULLY closes the bathroom door so that MULDER does not hear the cries and picks up her little son.

SCULLY: (To William) It's going to be okay ...

She pats him on his back and walks with him into the living room, gently holding him in her arms. On the living room floor we see several packed suitcases.)



SCENE 4

(DOGGETT's house. We hear an alarm clock ringing. He's lying on his stomach in his bed asleep. He wakes up. When he rolls over onto his back he winces at the sight of bruises on his chest.)

(CUT TO: REYES's hotel room. She's also asleep. A phone rings and she wakes up. REYES slides over the bed to answer the ringing phone. She's also chest-naked and we see her from behind her.)

REYES: (on phone) Hello?

MAN ON PHONE: (voice) Monica, it's me. Did I wake you?

REYES: (still waking up, recognizing the voice of the man on the phone) Brad. Um-hmm, no, I'm awake.

(CUT TO: The office of ASSISTANT DIRECTOR BRAD FOLLMER.)

FOLLMER: (on phone) You're in town?

REYES: (on phone, voice) Yeah, I, I came in on short notice.

FOLLMER: (sitting down into his chair, on phone) Listen, if you're coming into the Hoover Building can you stop by my office on your way in?

(CUT BACK: to REYES. Camera pans around her face.)

REYES: (on phone) Yeah. Sure. I can do that.

FOLLMER: (on phone, voice) Good. Looking forward to it.



SCENE 5

(CUT BACK: to DOGGETT's house. The kettle on the stove whistles. He pours some boiling water into a cup. As he's making his breakfast, he listens to a news report on TV.)

TV ANNOUNCER: ... last night. The 38 year old body of Carl Wormus, a deputy administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency was pulled from the Potomac by divers this morning ...

(On TV, we see images of CARL WORMUS's car being pulled out of the water.)

CUT TO:

(FOLLMER's office, he's watching the same news report as DOGGETT.)

TV ANNOUNCER: ... it appears Wormus drove his car through a barricade on the drawbridge into the river. A police spokesperson said it appears he was alone in the car ...

(When he hears some noise from the outer office, he shuts the TV off, and walks over to the door leading out of his office. He opens it, surprising REYES who's been leaning over his assistant's desk.)

FOLLMER: Monica?

(REYES turns around, surprised.)

REYES: Hi.

FOLLMER: What you doing?

REYES: (Shyly) I was leaving you a note. Your assistant was out and ... I didn't want to knock. I was gonna call you, uh. Um, hi, Brad.

FOLLMER: (inviting her into his office) Come on in.

(REYES walks into the office, FOLLMER entering after her and closing the door behind them. REYES turns to face FOLLMER just at the moment as he leans toward her and kisses her on her lips. She pulls back a little.)

FOLLMER: (surprised) What?

REYES: We're at work.

FOLLMER: (with a grin) You used to ask me to close the door at work back in New York.

REYES: Is that all you called me here for, Assistant Director?

FOLLMER: I probably shouldn't tell you how hot you look either, because you do. How long's it been? Two years?

REYES: (nodding) Yeah. We should catch up, Brad. Really. I've got to get downstairs.

(REYES is on her way out of the office, but FOLLMER's words stop her.)

FOLLMER: I've got something for you.

(REYES turns around to FOLLMER as he sinks into his chair, pulling two videotapes out of his desk drawer.)

FOLLMER: Forgive me, but... uh... it didn't take a whole lot of digging to figure out why you're here in D.C., Monica.

REYES: (seeing the tapes) What are those?

FOLLMER: Something you're gonna see... but I wanted to show you first. They were taken from security cameras in the FBI parking garage. One of them (putting one of the tapes on his desk) ... shows you arriving in a cab meeting with John Doggett.

REYES: Yeah, I'm working with him. He called me up here on a case.

FOLLMER: (still holding the second tape) I heard. Believe me, (leaning back in his chair) this whole thing about a chase and a crash and a fire. And now Doggett's internal investigation of Deputy Director Kersh ... it's ... big news.

REYES: What's so important to show me?

(FOLLMER does not respond. He sits at his desk looking back at Monica.)

REYES: What's on the other tape?



SCENE 6

(CUT TO: Elevator doors opening. We see DOGGETT standing inside the elevator. DEPUTY DIRECTOR KERSH was waiting for the elevator and now enters, glaring at DOGGETT, who's glaring back at him. The doors close and as the elevator begins moving as KERSH stands beside DOGGETT.)

KERSH: (Smugly) How's your investigation going, John? Have you turned up any incriminating evidence on me yet?

DOGGETT: It's only Monday morning, sir. It's nothing personal, Deputy Director. I hope you know that.

KERSH: I know, John. I think we've pretty much always seen eye to eye. I'm sure if you can't find anything on me, John, nobody can.

(The elevator doors open and as KERSH walks out of the elevator, DOGGETT stares hardly after him.)



SCENE 7

(CUT TO: The X-Files office. REYES is watching the video footage. She looks up as DOGGETT walks in.)

REYES: Hi. How you doing?

(DOGGETT, clearly frustrated by something, says nothing and walking into the office he puts his coat off.)

REYES: That good?

DOGGETT: (Frustrated, rolling up his sleeves) I didn't ask to be put down on the X- Files. Deputy Director Kersh put me down here. I'm just doing my job. What did they think? That I'd be thankful? That I'd do anything less?

REYES: It's not gonna be easy, John.

DOGGETT: Hell no it isn't. I'm going after the Deputy Director, the one man removed from the head of the FBI.

REYES: No, I mean it may be impossible.

(His interest piqued, DOGGETT walks over to REYES. He looks at the TV screen and sees a video-recording of an empty parking garage.)

DOGGETT: What's this?

REYES: A security tape two nights ago from the FBI garage. You're not on it.

DOGGETT: What are you talking about?

(He grabs a remote controller and begins scanning the tape. It shows that the garage is empty.)

DOGGETT: No. This is the wrong damn tape.

REYES: I've been backwards and forwards on it. There's nothing there.

DOGGETT: (Insisting) We were chased. AD Skinner and I were attacked and chased. This man Knowle Rohrer drove his car into the garage wall and it blew up in a ball of flames.

REYES: Not on this tape.

(DOGGETT ejects the tape out of the recorder and looks at it.)

DOGGETT: Where'd you get this?

REYES: From someone who wanted to give me a heads-up.

DOGGETT: They can't just make this all go away. There's evidence down in that parking garage, there were victims.

REYES: I went down to that garage, John. Whatever happened, they've had 48 hours now to clean it up.

DOGGETT: There were witnesses.

REYES: Witnesses who are gonna stand up to this tape?

(DOGGETT stares at her for a moment, then puts his coat back on and walks out of the office. REYES, frustrated, watches him go. She exhales heavily.)



SCENE 8

(DOGGETT opens the door to MULDER's apartment.)

DOGGETT: Mulder?

(Hearing no one, he walks into the apartment. It's empty. Completely empty. No furniture. No fish tank. Nothing. Camera pans around him. Empty walls. Empty floors.)

DOGGETT: Mulder, you here?

(DOGGETT looks around and seeing the whole apartment empty, he turns and walks out.)



SCENE 9
GREATER MARYLAND WATER
RECLAMATION FACILITY

(Camera pans around a big dark tank full of water. There's a worker, ROLAND MCFARLAND walking around it, wearing overalls and a white hard-hat. He does not notice several bubbles floating to the surface of the water. As he goes to the side of the tank, SHANNON MCMAHON's head emerges from the water. She intently watches ROLAND MCFARLAND walking away, just keeping her nose below the water. He walks toward a phone and she swims to the far edge of the tank. The ROLAND MCFARLAND picks up a phone receiver and makes a call.)

OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE: Naval telecommunications command.

(He's holding a newspaper in his hand, containing the obituary of CARL WORMUS.)

ROLAND MCFARLAND: Yeah, I need to make a shore to ship call, to the U.S. Valor Victor.

OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE: Sir? ...

(He turns around to the tank and notices the naked SHANNON MCMAHON walking away from the tank, her back turned to him. He drops the phone receiver, takes out his gun and runs after the woman.)

OPERATOR'S VOICE ON PHONE: Sir? ...



SCENE 10

(SCULLY's apartment. There's a knock at the door. SCULLY answers it. DOGGETT's standing there, looking panicked.)

SCULLY: What? What's the matter?

DOGGETT: What's the matter? I've been trying to call you.

SCULLY: Yeah, the phone's off the hook because of the baby.

DOGGETT: I got panicked that you're not going to be here, that you left, too.

SCULLY: (after an uncomfortable pause) Come in.

(SCULLY closes the door behind him.)

DOGGETT: I've been looking for Mulder. I went to his apartment.

SCULLY: I know.

DOGGETT: Where'd he go?

(SCULLY looks as if she's going to cry. Music is sad, perfectly reflecting a mood of this scene.)

DOGGETT: (emphatically) Dana... where'd he go?

(SCULLY looks down a moment, then back at DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: He's gone.

(DOGGETT is stunned.)

SCULLY: He's just ... gone.

(DOGGETT looks away for a moment, then back at SCULLY. He sighs.)



SCENE 11

(Back at the water reclamation facility ROLAND MCFARLAND is still walking around and looking for SHANNON MCMAHON. Seeing no one, he turns around, then turns back at a noise in front of him. SHANNON MCMAHON is standing there, naked. The next shot is from under the water as SHANNON MCMAHON and ROLAND MCFARLAND hit the water surface of the tank and she pulls him down, deep into the water, holding his sleeve in her hand. He's struggling to get out of her grasp, but she continues pulling him down into the blackness ...)



SCENE 12

(SKINNER's office. Day. REYES is sitting there in front of SKINNER's desk. SKINNER is sitting in his chair behind his desk.)

SKINNER: (to REYES) I don't know where Mulder is. I don't know that I'd tell you if I did.

(The door opens and DOGGETT enters the office.)

REYES: (to DOGGETT) I checked with movers, airlines, car rental agencies... no Mulder.

DOGGETT: Somebody get to him, that it? That doesn't seem possible, does it? (he turns to SKINNER) Okay, so where does that leave us? Just me and you, our word against Kersh and the FBI.

REYES: You'd better sit down, John. It's more complicated than that.

DOGGETT: What's more complicated?

REYES: This investigation.

DOGGETT: What about it?

(SKINNER takes off his glasses and looks down.)

SKINNER: I wanna ask you to drop it.

DOGGETT: No, not from you. Not from you. Not, not after what we've been through. I mean, we barely escaped with our lives.

SKINNER: That's something worth thinking about.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, you're not that reasonable. What, did they get to you too?

SKINNER: No one got to me, John, they didn't have to, that's the point.

DOGGETT: (walking closer to SKINNER's desk) You're afraid of them.

SKINNER: (leaning back in his chair) I'm not afraid of them.

DOGGETT: Well, you're afraid of something. What? The real tape showing up, them calling you a killer for you having to shoot Alex Krycek?

SKINNER: No, I'll stand by my actions, Agent Doggett, but I won't stand by yours if you're gonna continue to push and push until you get somebody killed. You wanna know what I fear? I fear for Mulder and Scully. I fear for the life of that child if you don't stop pushing it, John.

DOGGETT: You don't think I fear for those things, same as you?

SKINNER: If you did, you'd let it go.

DOGGETT: So what I'm hearing is... if I don't drop it, I'm alone on this.

(SKINNER says nothing. DOGGETT sighs. He looks down at REYES, who is also silent and staring back at DOGGETT. DOGGETT is on his way out of the office when REYES turns to him.)

REYES: John.

(DOGGETT turns around in the doorway.)

REYES: You're not.

(REYES stands up and looks at SKINNER. SKINNER looks down, avoiding looking into her moist eyes. REYES turns around and walks toward DOGGETT and out of the office. DOGGETT closes the door behind them.)



SCENE 13

(Back at in the Baltimore bar. FOLLMER is sitting there over his martini. He notices REYES approaching him. She sits at a seat next to him.)

FOLLMER: Hi. I hope it wasn't too presumptuous of me. I've ordered you a Martini.

REYES: No, the presumption's all mine. Anyway, I called and asked you out, didn't I?

FOLLMER: You, uh, actually a little confused me this morning in my office. I had this crazy notion that you're avoiding me.

REYES: Maybe I was trying to avoid myself.

(She smiles.)

REYES: And those tapes you pulled out of your desk drawer weren't exactly Pamela and Tommy Lee now, were they?

(She laughs.)

FOLLMER: I'd heard that you and John Doggett are tight.

REYES: You make it sound like I go home from work with Post-Its on my ass. It's nothing like that.

FOLLMER: Then I don't get it. Why risk your name and your career getting caught up in this... rabid investigation of his?

REYES: There isn't going to be an investigation. Not anymore.

(FOLLMER eats a nut and stares ahead, pensively.)

FOLLMER: I wouldn't have thought Agent Doggett would be thrown off so easy. Not what I've heard about him.

REYES: Whatever you may think about him, Brad, he's not a fool, you know.

FOLLMER: Now you're pissed off at me.

REYES: No, I'm pissed off because this means I'll be shipping back to the New Orleans field office.

FOLLMER: What are you talking about? The way I heard it you're with the X-Files?

REYES: If this investigation drops, they're gonna drop the X-Files right along with it. You know me, where my interests lie, this was my dream assignment. Not to mention how excited I was to be appointed here in D.C.

FOLLMER: But you just got here.

REYES: Yeah, I know.

(They look at each other.)



SCENE 14

(SCULLY's apartment. After looking through the peephole, SCULLY opens the door, revealing DOGGETT standing in the hallway. She is holding her baby in her arms.)

DOGGETT: I'm really sorry. I... Dana, I need your help.

SCULLY: I don't know how to find him.

(She lets him into her apartment, and walks into her bedroom to put William to sleep. Doggett closes the door behind him.)

DOGGETT: It just doesn't make any sense. Mulder leaving you here all alone, just walking out on you, not telling you where and why.

SCULLY: (voice from her bedroom) It makes sense in its own way. That's all I can tell you.

DOGGETT: Then tell me why you can't trust me. Everything I did to try and protect you when you thought your baby was in danger. What changed? Why is it suddenly I'm now the enemy?

(SCULLY walks out of the bedroom and looks at DOGGETT closely.)

SCULLY: Let it go, John. Drop it. Please.

DOGGETT: (insisting) These people tried to kill me. They tried to kill AD Skinner. They wanted to kill Mulder, too. They're still out there, Dana.

SCULLY: Exactly right, and they are unstoppable, and they are inside the FBI.

DOGGETT: You know something you're not telling me. Mulder knows something. How long can you hide it from me? Knowle Rohrer, this old military buddy of mine. He told me your pregnancy was a result of a Government cloning experiment to try to create what he called a Super Soldier.

SCULLY: I don't want to hear this. Look, there is nothing to any of this.

DOGGETT: Knowle Rohrer, my buddy, was one of the men that tried to kill us in the FBI garage.

SCULLY: (slowly, to stress what she's saying) My baby... my son... is fine.

DOGGETT: I hope to God that's true. I just don't want to pretend.

SCULLY: I'm going to ask you to leave.

(DOGGETT's jaw drops.)

SCULLY: I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here.

(Again, DOGGETT is stunned by this, but he does what she is asking him to do. Doggett leaves without looking back at SCULLY, who watches him go. Fear is clearly visible in her eyes.)



SCENE 15

(DOGGETT's apartment. The TV is on. He takes a picture of his old Marine buddies off the wall and looks at it. He sits down and picks up the phone to make a call.)

OPERATOR'S VOICE: Directory assistance, may I help you?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Let's try Maryland, Virginia.

OPERATOR'S VOICE: (on phone) What district?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Number for a Ryan Bracker. B-R-A-C-K-E-R.

(We hear a phone ringing through Doggett's receiver.)

DOGGETT: Yeah hi, I was given this number for a Roger Erickson, formerly with the US Marine Corps.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Roger, hey, it's John Doggett, Bravo Company.

VOICE ON PHONE: How you doing?

DOGGETT: Eh, I'm good. It's good to hear you. Listen, you remember Knowle Rohrer? What's the story with him? Didn't he get involved with something when he got back Stateside.

DOGGETT: Yeah, let's get you a beer sometime.

(He puts down the phone. We cut back to Doggett making another call.)

VOICE OF SHANNON MCMAHON: (on phone) This is Shannon. Leave a message and I'll return your call ...

(The answerphone picks up ...)

DOGGETT: (on phone) Yeah, hi, this is John Doggett. I'm trying to reach Shannon McMahon who was with Bravo Company U.S.M.C. (We see the close up of a SHANNON MCMAHON's face on the Marine picture Doggett took off the wall) If this is she can you please contact me to the FBI in Washington, D.C. as soon as possible?

CUT TO:

(FBI Headquarters. The elevator bell rings. REYES is standing in the hallway waiting for the elevator. The doors open as it arrives and SHANNON MCMAHON, SHANNON MCMAHON, wearing a dark business suit, emerges from inside of the elevator and walks purposefully down the hallway. REYES gets into the elevator and watches her go down the corridor.)



SCENE 16

(SCULLY's apartment. She's putting WILLIAM to sleep. She gently lowers him into his cot. He's almost asleep.)

SCULLY: Sleepy time, sweet William. See you in a couple of hours. (SCULLY is very gentle with him.)

(She lies down in her bed to rest, pulling a blanket over her. As she closes her eyes, we see and hear William's mobile with star-shaped ornaments over the cot start eerily moving on its own.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 17

(The X-Files office. REYES is there, sitting at a table and editing a report. As she is doing this she breaks a tip of her pencil.)

REYES: Uh... (She looks at the broken tip of the pencil.)

(REYES opens the desk drawer. Seeing no pencils, she looks around the table. Still seeing nothing, slowly, she looks up over her head where 10 of MULDER's old pencils are still stuck in the ceiling, surrounded by many holes. A variation of The X-Files theme plays in the background. [Thank you Mark Snow.] REYES takes off her shoes and climbs onto the desk and reaches for one of the pencils. As she's standing there, she hears someone from the hallway.)

REYES: Hello?

(With no response, she climbs off the desk and walks into the empty hallway. She rushes to the elevator. Its doors are just closing, but she doesn't manage to see who's inside. She turns around and notices an envelope lying on the hallway floor. She kneels down to pick it up. It contains CARL WORMUS' newspaper obituary.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY's apartment. WILLIAM's crying in his cot. SCULLY, lying on her bed, leans over and sees the mobile spinning. She sits up, clearly disturbed. The mobile is still moving as she stands up and walks over toward WILLIAM's cot. She reaches over and stops the mobile from moving. WILLIAM begins crying and mobile starts spinning again. SCULLY looks scared.)



SCENE 19

(The X-Files office. REYES answers the ringing phone.)

REYES: Monica Reyes.

(SCULLY is standing in her bedroom.)

SCULLY: It's, er, Scully. (SCULLY'S voice sounds very worried. REYES picks up on this.)

REYES: Dana, are you all right?

SCULLY: Is Agent Doggett there?

(DOGGETT takes the cell phone from REYES.)

DOGGETT: Dana. Something wrong?

SCULLY: Yeah. Yeah, something. Um, I think I might have been wrong, telling you to drop your investigation.

DOGGETT: Well, I didn't drop it. As a matter of fact, we found something that sure as hell fits with what we are working on.

SCULLY: What is it?

DOGGETT: A body.



SCENE 20
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
6:28 PM

(SCULLY enters the autopsy room. DOGGETT and REYES are already there, standing over the dead body on the table, covered by a sheet.)

DOGGETT: Thanks for coming.

DOGGETT: The deceased's name is Carl Wormus. Deputy Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.

REYES: Drove though a barricade and off a bridge two nights ago.

SCULLY: (Looking through some medical papers) And?

DOGGETT: And somebody at the FBI thought it was important enough to stick his obituary right under our noses.

SCULLY: Who?

REYES: We don't know.

SCULLY: (Examining some figures on the papers) Well, his blood alcohol level was up 0.15. He was drunk, he crashed and drowned.

DOGGETT: There's got to be something more.

(DOGGETT's cell phone begins ringing. DOGGETT picks it up, walking aside from SCULLY and REYES.)

DOGGETT: (on phone) John Doggett.

SKINNER: (on phone) What the hell are you doing?

DOGGETT: (on phone) Excuse me?

SKINNER: (on phone) Do you know how many people are just waiting to see you screw up. To see you make a mistake like this.

DOGGETT: (on phone) I didn't know I made a mistake.

SKINNER: (on phone) This EPA guy you checked out of the morgue in Maryland without any jurisdiction.

DOGGETT: (on phone) Oh, come on.

SKINNER: (on phone) All your friends, John. All your former buddies at the FBI.

DOGGETT: (on phone) What are you talking about?

SKINNER: (on phone) They're not your pals any more. Not since this investigation here, since you launched an attack on one of your own. Just watch your back, John.

(DOGGETT hangs up and walks over to SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: Definitive answer how this guy died, what'll that take?

SCULLY: Careful autopsy.

DOGGETT: How fast can you do it?

SCULLY: That's not what I'm saying.

DOGGETT: I understand if you don't want to do this, Dana, but you're the only person we can trust.



SCENE 21

(DOGGETT's house. The doorbell rings. Knocks on the door. Coming to the door, DOGGETT looks through the peephole. FROHIKE looks into the peephole from the outside.)

FROHIKE: Collecting for the needy and unemployed. Open the door.

(DOGGETT opens the door for THE LONE GUNMEN.)

DOGGETT: Thanks for doing this, guys.

BYERS: Yeah, like we got anything better to be doing these days. (Referring to the events after the finale of their own series no doubt, and its cancellation.)

(BYERS and FROHIKE enter DOGGETT's house, in suit and leather jacket respectively as usual. LANGLY stands outside with his back to the door. He's wearing an Ozo T-shirt.)

FROHIKE: Just to let you know, we may need to get you up for some coin.

DOGGETT: (Looking toward LANGLY) What happened to him, you guys?

(DOGGETT looks at LANGLY. When LANGLY turns around DOGGETT sees that he has a completely blue face. LANGLY walks closer.)

(LANGLY's face is still quite blue because of the disguise LANGLY used in the finale of their own spin-off series, The Lone Gunmen, screened last year from February 2000 onwards. They obviously managed to escape from the clutches of MORRIS FLETCHER.)

LANGLY: (With a resigned look on his face) Don't ask.

(Later, they are all inside with THE GUNMEN working on the laptop. We see a Carl Wormus file on the screen.)

BYERS: We were able to hack into the Department of Interior's mainframe and get the EPA files you wanted. On this man Carl Wormus ...

DOGGETT: And?

FROHIKE: Hey, what are we mind readers? That's all that you asked us to do.

BYERS: What exactly was it you are looking for, if we may ask?

DOGGETT: I don't know. I was hoping you'd find something.

LANGLY: (working on laptop) Well, if he had any secrets he took 'em to his grave. Nothing hinky in these files except for some rabid obsession with water.

DOGGETT: With water?



SCENE 22

(The autopsy room. SCULLY takes off her protective glasses. REYES is there with her.)

SCULLY: Water. Asphyxiation produced by the inhalation of water>. There are contusions on the forehead and on the chest but that isn't in fact hat killed him. (Conclusively) This man drowned. You're looking at me like you hope that there's something more, but there isn't.

REYES: I'm sorry, that's not it. I'm just impressed that you can do this.

SCULLY: This is what I do, Agent Reyes.

REYES: But you're here doing it now. Something did happen, didn't it.

(SCULLY looks down.)

REYES: I know what you're afraid of. That there's something wrong with your baby.

SCULLY: We can let our fears get the better of us. We can, uh, imagine things, make connections with things that aren't there. Like with this man.

REYES: If you ever feel the need to talk to someone, Dana, I'm here. I'd never betray a confidence.

SCULLY: (looking down at the table) There is something.

REYES: (As if SCULLY's about to reveal something) What?

SCULLY: (Moving over to the body) Right here on the ankle.

(REYES looks closely at the lower right leg of Wormus' body.)

REYES: Are those... fingerprints?

SCULLY: Yeah, that's what they look like.

REYES: Was someone holding him down?

(SCULLY takes a magnifying glass.)

SCULLY: I don't know how, or who.

(SCULLY starts inspecting the ankle.)



SCENE 23

(FBI Headquarters. KERSH's office. FOLLMER is sitting in front of KERSH's desk, KERSH is seated behind his desk.)

FOLLMER: I don't know if you're aware where Agent Scully is. She's at Quantico. Called in by John Doggett to autopsy a body he's got not authority to touch.

(FOLLMER hands KERSH a report. KERSH examines is closely.)

FOLLMER: If I may be blunt, Sir, Doggett's put his tit in the wringer.

KERSH: Maybe. So what?

FOLLMER: All of think he's lost all judgment. That not one man's actions should affect the entire FBI. We're feeling he should be called out for this.

KERSH: Punished?

FOLLMER: Yes, Sir.

KERSH: Thank you, Assistant Director. It's a difficult situation to be in, I appreciate you doing this.

FOLLMER: It was a right thing to do.

KERSH: (handing the report back to FOLLMER) Let me know how it goes.

FOLLMER: (surprised) Me? No, no, I can't, Sir. There... there is a conflict. I, I can't do this myself.

KERSH: I can't very well do it. How would it look? I'm under investigation by Agent Doggett. You have no personal axe to grind.



SCENE 24

(SCULLY's apartment. MARGARET SCULLY is there caring for and watching WILLIAM. She put's William down in his cot. He almost waves at her. The doorbell rings. MARGARET SCULLY goes to the door and looks through the peephole.)

MARGARET: Hello? Can I help you?

(SHANNON MCMAHON is standing in the hallway.)

SHANNON MCMAHON: Hi, I'm looking for Dana Scully.

MARGARET: Uh, I'm sorry, she's not here right now. Can I tell her who's calling?

SHANNON MCMAHON: We work together. Do you know where I can find her?

MARGARET: No, um, would you like to leave a message?

(MARGARET sees as the doorknob shakes.)

SHANNON MCMAHON: I'll leave a note if you wouldn't mind opening the door.

MARGARET: Why don't you just leave your name and I'll have Dana call you.

(No answer. After a moment MARGARET looks through the peephole. She unchains and opens the door and looks out into the hallway. It's empty. MARGARET turns back around, a worried look on her face.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 25

(SCULLY takes a photo of CARL WORMUS's dead body with an evidence camera and hands it to REYES.

SCULLY: I need to get this body into refrigeration if you want to preserve it as evidence. Whatever he's evidence of ...

REYES: Whatever it is I can't reach John to even tell him about it.

(SCULLY starts taking off her scrubs. Monica is leafing through some polaroids.)

SCULLY: Monica, I don't know what to say, but good luck. I gotta go. I gotta get home.

(They both walk out into the hallway.)

(REYES notices SHANNON MCMAHON turning around the corner into the hallway.)

SCULLY: Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers. We could temporarily put him up there.

REYES: Behind us. Just keep walking.

(They both walk to the elevator, REYES without turning back and SCULLY catching a glance at SHANNON MCMAHON.)

SCULLY: Who is she?

REYES: I've never seen her before this morning. Now I've seen her twice.

(When they reach the elevator doors they both turn around, but SHANNON MCMAHON is gone. The elevator doors open to reveal FOLLMER with 4 of his AGENTS inside. They exchange uncomfortable glances and FOLLMER walks out of the elevator and grabs REYES by her wrist as they walk through the hallway.)

FOLLMER: Where's Agent Doggett?

REYES: What are you doing, Brad?

FOLLMER: What am I doing? I'm doing my best to cover your ass.

REYES: What are you talking about?

(FOLLMER takes the polaroids from MONICA and holds them up to her.)

FOLLMER: (Going through the polaroids) This ... and this ... I'm talking about these.

(FOLLMER takes REYES by the wrist and leads her toward the autopsy room.)

REYES: Let go of me.

SCULLY: What's going on here?

(They reach the autopsy room. It's empty. The body's gone. SCULLY and REYES both stare at the empty autopsy table. FOLLMER walks toward it.)

FOLLMER: Okay, where'd he go?

REYES: Who? Where'd who go?

FOLLMER: Where did Doggett take the body?

REYES: You're not making any sense, Brad. Agent Doggett didn't take any body anywhere.

(FOLLMER doesn't believe her.)

REYES: What? You're looking at me like you don't believe me. Ask Agent Scully.

(REYES turns to SCULLY standing on her side. FOLLMER looks at her, too. SCULLY looks at FOLLMER uncomfortably.)

SCULLY: I'm gonna go now. I've got a child at home.

(SCULLY walks out of the room and FOLLMER crosses over to REYES.)

FOLLMER: Body or no body, you were here, doing an autopsy. Doggett was here, without authorization.

REYES: Without authorization?

FOLLMER: He's out of control you know, Monica. Forget the X-Files, he'll take you down with him.

REYES: (Realising what his comment has revealed.) This was you, wasn't it? You floated that obituary to me... to set Agent Doggett up, using me.

FOLLMER: (Surprised) What obituary? I don't know what you are talking about. You came to me for help, remember? I'm only trying to help you help yourself.

REYES: I know exactly what you're doing, Brad. Don't forget to piss on all the corners before you leave.

(REYES turns her back to him and begins to leave.)

FOLLMER: (Strongly) I didn't float any obituary!

(REYES leaves.)

FOLLMER: What is she talking about?

(FOLLMER stares after her from the doorway.)



SCENE 26

(DOGGETT's house. The doorbell rings. FROHIKE goes to the door but despite even FROHIKE's impressive stature, he can't reach the peephole to look through it.)

FROHIKE: Son of a...

(Annoyed, he opens the door anyway.)

FROHIKE: Yeah?

(Opening the door he sees REYES standing in the doorway.)

FROHIKE: Oh, hello.

REYES: Considering the recent violence against Agent Doggett, you might want to want to know who's at the door before you actually open it.

(She walks inside past him.)

FROHIKE: (Resigned) Next time I'll get a chair.

(REYES enters DOGGETT's living room. She sees BYERS and LANGLY there.)

BYERS: Agent Doggett's gone.

REYES: What do you mean gone?

LANGLY: He and Assistant Director Skinner split for Maryland together.

FROHIKE: Show her what we found. Before she makes any nasty remarks.

(They all walk to the laptop on the table. It's displaying some data on the screen.)

BYERS: It took some real hacking but uh, Carl Wormus, the man from Environmental Protection Agency who drowned in his car, he'd been receiving encrypted email data from a water reclamation plant in Maryland. From a worker there named Roland McFarland.

REYES: Encrypted data on what?

LANGLY: Don't know. Whatever it is may have gotten both these men killed.

(A copy of the Baltimore Chronicle appears on screen, along with a photo of Wormus. The headline reads "Worker's Death Ruled Accidental Drowning.")



SCENE 27

(Inside the Water Reclamation Plant. We see lots of valves, pipes and vats. DOGGETT and SKINNER run through the plant and into the administrative offices.)

SKINNER: (Looking around) There's no nameplates.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I see that.

SKINNER: This is madness. Even if you're right and this guy can actually help your investigation we don't know if we're in the right area.

DOGGETT: This has got to be McFarland's area.

(SKINNER moves from desk to desk, looking for useful information. He finds a note on a piece of headed paper. It simply bears an email address, cwormus@epa.gov.)

SKINNER: This might be his desk.

(Doggett comes over and looks at the computer under the desk.)

SKINNER: (Anxious) Let's just grab the computer hard drive and get out of here.

DOGGETT: We're not sure if it's his.

SKINNER: Someone could walk in one of these doors any minute and it's not gonna matter.

(SKINNER crosses to the door.)

DOGGETT: Just keep an eye out.

(SKINNER guards the door. DOGGETT is searching a filing cabinet and sees several files marked Chloramine.)

DOGGETT: What's chloramine?

SKINNER: What? Why are you asking me about chloramine?

DOGGETT: If this is McFarland's desk he's got tons of files on chloramine in it.

(SKINNER sees FOLLMER and his AGENTS approaching from outside of the office.)

SKINNER: (Worried) Agent Doggett - grab the files and go.

(DOGGETT takes the files. They run out of the office and down a flight of stairs. FOLLMER opens the door out of the office and indicates to his agents to be quiet. He hears banging noises as DOGGETT and SKINNER run down the stairs. A chase ensues, the camera switching between DOGGETT and SKINNER, and FOLLMER and his AGENTS. who follow them. Just as he gets to a flight of steps going down, SKINNER's shirt gets caught onto some pipe and he catches himself.)

SKINNER: Arghhh!

DOGGETT: Assistant Director?

(They are separated now and FOLLMER catches up with SKINNER, who is still recovering.)

FOLLMER: Looks like you and I are chasing the same man.

(Smiling, FOLLMER walks past him, approaching a big circular tank full of water. SKINNER watches the rest of the agents follow FOLLMER.)

FOLLMER: (Looking around) Agent Doggett?!

(FOLLMER walks over to the tank of water. FOLLMER looks at the gently rippling water surface. Hiding under the water, DOGGETT is holding his breath and holding onto a pipe, looking up toward the surface. Suddenly, DOGGETT is pulled down, and he gasps. Bubbles leave his mouth and float upwards. He looks down and sees SHANNON MCMAHON, naked, who has appeared from further down inside the tank and has grabbed him around his ankle. The files he was carrying start to slowly drift upwards towards the surface. Doggett is now fighting to hold onto the pipe. As he drifts down, he tries to swim against the pulling of SHANNON MCMAHON. It is helpless. He gradually sinks down into the darkness.)

SCENE 1

(A hand is seen entering the digits 4, 9, 7 of a 5 digit code into a keypad. We see the masked password on the screen, before a message appears as the fifth and final digit is entered)

Passcode authorisation complete

CUT TO:



SCENE 2

We see polished feet walking down a corridor. The subject continues towards a wall mounted retinal scanner. We can see the subject is a male. He stops in front of the scanner and the red scanning beam flickers as it scans his right eye. A display shows the retinal image on screen, reading "scan complete". A man then turns a key in an illuminated lock, and we hear something unlock. He turns the handle of a large, steel door, and we hear the air depressurise as it slides open. The man then descends some metal steps, and we see somebody waiting for him below. The man we have been following looks about 60, with short white-grey hair and wearing a dark uniform, he is the CAPTAIN. There is a NAVY SEAL guarding the door in front of which the CAPTAIN now stands.)

CAPTAIN: I have an urgent communication to deliver to Dr. Nordlinger.

NAVY SEAL: I can deliver the communication.

CAPTAIN: I was asked to confirm and verify he received the communiqué and report back ...

NAVY SEAL: (Interrupting) That's not proper procedure.

CAPTAIN: Report back Dr. Nordlinger's acknowledgement of the communiqué.

(The NAVY SEAL carries on guarding the door, motionless, as a white steel door behind them opens and a middle aged man in a white lab coat, DR. NORDLINGER, comes out. As the door opens, we can see a large monitor displaying ova manipulation in the background and several scientists in lab coats working at various benches.)

DR. NORDLINGER: What's going on here?

NAVY SEAL: There's some confusion as to the proper procedure Dr. Nordlinger.

(DR. NORDLINGER closes the door behind him.)

CAPTAIN: I have a communication for you.

(He hands DR. NORDLINGER an envelope, marked eyes only. He rips open the top and takes out a handwritten letter. It looks like a list of instructions. Upon closer inspection, it is a coded message, with the plaintext written underneath the cypher text. The message reads:

  EMERGENCY STOP
  RETURN TO OPERATIONS
  BASE DIRECTLY STOP

(DR. NORDLINGER looks down at the message. He looks up at the grey-haired CAPTAIN.)

DR. NORDLINGER: Communication acknowledged and confirmed Captain. We're returning to base.

(The CAPTAIN walks off, leaving DR. NORDLINGER standing outside the door. The camera pans along a corridor, we see signs for hazardous material on the wall. The CAPTAIN enters an area filled with electronic equipment, lit by dim red lighting. It looks as though we could be on a submarine or marine vessel. He calls for his Petty Officer, BAMFORD.)

CAPTAIN: Bamford?

PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD: Captain?

CAPTAIN: Prepare to transmit to Operations Command.

PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD: Transmit what sir?

(The CAPTAIN turns and moves over towards a terminal. PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD again asks the CAPTAIN for his message.)

PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD: Sir, what is the communication?

CAPTAIN: We're coming in.

(PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD looks back at the CAPTAIN, speechless. The CAPTAIN walks over to the ship's wheel and starts to steer the ship back towards Operations Command. The camera pans away from the CAPTAIN. The camera, still focused on the CAPTAIN, then zooms out through a porthole window on a door, until we are outside, in the dark. The camera continues to zoom away until we see we are on a large ship - the Valor Victor, a Merchant Marines vessel from WWII. The whole scene is illuminated by a full moon in the sky.)

[TAGLINE : NOTHING IMPORTANT HAPPENED TODAY]



SCENE 3

CHRIS CARTER: (Voiceover) Previously on The X-Files ...

(Scenes from 9x01, Nothing Important Happened Today:

(Carl Wormus' car speeding off the bridge into the Potomac; Wormus trying to escape from the grip of SHANNON MCMAHON trapped in the car.)

DOGGETT: The deceased's name is Carl Wormus, Deputy Adminstrator for the EPA (REYES looking at the obituary slipped to her.)

DOGGETT: Somebody put his obituary under our noses. (KERSH asking DOGGETT about the progress of his investigation in the lift.)

KERSH: Have you found any incriminating evidence on me yet? (FOLLMER and REYES talking in the bar about DOGGETT)

FOLLMER: I heard that you and John Doggett were tight.

REYES: Whatever you may think of him Brad, he's not a fool. (Clips of SHANNON MCMAHON from the episode.)

SCULLY: Who is she?

REYES: I've never seen her before this morning. Now I've seen her twice (Clips from 8X21, Existence, showing KNOWLE ROHRER being decapitated.)

DOGGETT: Knowle Rohrer, told me that your pregnancy was part of a Government cloning experiment to create a Super Soldier.

(Shots of SCULLY and WILLIAM. DOGGETT telling SCULLY the information ROHRER told him.)

SCULLY: My baby is fine.

(SCULLY seeing the mobile over WILLIAM's crib starting to move.)

REYES: I know what you're afraid of, that there's something wrong with your baby.

(DOGGETT finding the files relating to chloramine in CARL WORMUS' officer.)

DOGGETT: There's tons of files on Chloramine.

(FOLLMER chasing SKINNER and DOGGETT through the plant at the end of the episode. SKINNER catching himself.)

SKINNER: Grab the files and go.

(Finally, we see DOGGETT hiding from FOLLMER in the water and then being pulled down into the darkness by SHANNON MCMAHON.

FOLLMER: Agent Doggett?

[Fade to black]



SCENE 4

(A few seconds after the end of the last episode. FOLLMER is still searching for DOGGETT in the water reclamation plant. He again looks at the water tank. We see DOGGETT still fighting under the water surface.)

FOLLMER: (Shouting) DOGGETT!

(DOGGETT, still fighting for his life, is being pulled further down into the darkness. He struggles, his last few precious breaths escaping as he tries to escape her grip. FOLLMER is looking at the tank, and after seeing nothing, turns to leave with his agents. Just as he turns, the bubbles from DOGGETT break the surface and ripple in the water. FOLLMER is on the metal steps now. DOGGETT is now motionless in the water, sinking down into the darkness.

SHANNON MCMAHON then carefully pulls him towards her, and, placing her mouth over his, breathes into his airway and lungs to keep him alive. DOGGETT is still motionless as we:)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 5
FBI Headquarters
10:21 AM

(Day. An exterior shot of the FBI building in DC. We cut to REYES, opening the doorway into an office. She finds SKINNER seated, and FOLLMER pacing the floor reading a file.

REYES: Sorry I'm late.

FOLLMER: Have a seat Agent Reyes.

(She sits down next to SKINNER. We see we are in FOLLMER's office.)

FOLLMER: Agent Reyes. I thought we might have a little chat. Mr. Skinner here, has been helping me put together the pieces of your X-Files investigation.

REYES: Can we cut the crap Brad?

FOLLMER: I don't know. Can we? there's a lot of crap to cut through.

SKINNER: Agent Reyes. You probably want to zip it and try to cooperate.

FOLLMER: Like it or not, I'm charged with the task of bringing you in.

REYES: Bringing us in? for what?

FOLLMER: 2 unauthorized autopsies. Breaking and entering a state water facility. Wilful misuse of your positions.

REYES: I don't want to go into any of this without my partner here.

FOLLMER: Your partner. Your so called partner, who's running this circus, is right now nowhere to be found.

REYES: What are you doing Brad?

FOLLMER: Giving you and Mr. Skinner an opportunity to put a nice spin on this mess that Doggett's making

SKINNER: Agent Reyes. If you're not going to zip it, at least recognise that he's trying to help you

(Pause)

REYES: We were given a tip we believes lead us to a larger conspiracy.

FOLLMER: Conspiracy? Involving the FBI?

REYES: John Doggett and I are running a legitimate investigation into the FBI. Neither one of us feels ...

FOLLMER: Agent Reyes, I'm trying to help you keep your job. But that's not going to happen if you insist on chasing shadows, chasing conspiracies.

REYES: How do you know there isn't one?

FOLLMER: You're taking on the entire FBI here, Monica. This witch hunt, isn't going to expose, anything, but you, unless you distance yourself from John Doggett.

(REYES gets up to leave)

FOLLMER: What are you doing?

REYES: I'm distancing myself Brad, from you, from your political games. You just want to get John Doggett.

FOLLMER: You're making a big mistake here.

REYES: Yeah, I seem to make one every single time I walk in your door.

(REYES leaves, closing the door behind her.)



SCENE 6

(DOGGETT's apartment. DOGGETT is asleep, and suddenly wakes with a big chesty cough.)

SHANNON MCMAHON: Lie back John, it's OK.

DOGGETT: What the hell's this?

SHANNON MCMAHON: It's Shannon, Shannon McMahon. We were together in Bravo Company, USMC. You tried to contact me.

DOGGETT: What the hell are you doing here now?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Your lungs are full of water.

DOGGETT: You pulled me under.

SHANNON MCMAHON: I did what I had to.

DOGGETT: You held me down, I remember.

SHANNON MCMAHON: They would have caught you, they would have figured it out - what you've started to figure out.

DOGGETT: What are you?

SHANNON MCMAHON: You know what I am. I'm the product of 50 years of military science, the program your old friend Knowle Rohrer told you about. I'm a bio-engineered combat unit. I have no weaknesses - I don't sleep, I can breathe under water. That's how I saved your life John.

DOGGETT: How do you know what I know. What Knowle Rohrer told me?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Knowle Rohrer and I were drafted right out of Bravo Company together. We were... Adam and Eve, the program's first. There are many more now.

DOGGETT: Knowle Rohrer is dead.

SHANNON MCMAHON: They can't kill us. We can't be killed. Knowle Rohrer and I are alike in almost every way. The difference is I hate what I am.

DOGGETT: Why are you here telling me this?

SHANNON MCMAHON: The program's expanding in ways no-one ever dreamed of. I need your help to stop it, John.

DOGGETT: You need my help? What can I do?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Expose the deaths of those two men I killed. What they were doing.

DOGGETT: What were they doing?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Preparing the water supply.

DOGGETT: Preparing it for what?



SCENE 7
PORT OF BALTIMORE
9:17 PM

(Night. External shot of the ship docked in port. Cut to inside the ship. The CAPTAIN is putting on his jacket.)

PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD: What are you doing Captain? Where are you going? We're under strict orders not to leave the ship.

CAPTAIN: Look at us. They've got us tied up in a civilian dock in Baltimore. Why? I think they may be on to us.

YOUNG OFFICER: You're only drawing suspicion if they're not. You can't leave this ship.

CAPTAIN: We can't risk waiting. We can't risk not making contact now. (Reassuringly) I'll be back.



SCENE 8

(SCULLY's apartment. She is putting WILLIAM to bed in his crib. There's a quiet knock at her door.)

SKINNER: Hi. Sorry about the hour.

SCULLY: I've just put him down.

SKINNER: (Troubled) I couldn't talk on the phone.

SCULLY: What is it?

SKINNER: I was told to leave this alone. You and Mulder asked me to leave it be. To let Mulder disappear. We were concerned for the safety of the baby and for Mulder. Why am I risking that now? Why are you? Why are you getting mixed up with Doggett's investigation?

SCULLY: (Looking away) Something happened, with my baby.

SKINNER: What?

SCULLY: I can't explain it. It's er, it's unexplainable, it's, um, not normal.

SKINNER: Whatever it is, I think you've made a terrible mistake. Letting Doggett pull you into this. He's hell bent. And Agent Reyes is following right in his tracks.

SCULLY: I need answers. I need to know. I can't just sit around wondering ...

SKINNER: If you can't tell me, tell Mulder. Tell him what happened.

SCULLY: Mulder can't know. He can't be brought back into this. He can't be brought back into the FBI. It's just too dangerous for him right now.

(Pause)

SKINNER: It's too dangerous for everyone.

(SKINNER leaves and shuts the door behind him. SCULLY looks troubled and upset.)



SCENE 9

(Night. Outside in the Baltimore dock where the vessel it moored. The CAPTAIN is making a phone call on a payphone on the dockside.)

AUTOMATED VOICE: The EPA employee you are trying to reach - Carl Wormus - is not available. If you want to leave a voicemail, stay on the line.

(Unsuccessful, the CAPTAIN hangs up the phone and heads back toward the ship, checking for anyone who may have seen him making the call. Once back on the ship, he goes back to the ship's bridge, where he thinks the PETTY OFFICER is waiting.)

CAPTAIN: (Entering the bridge) Something's wrong. Very wrong.

VOICE (Offscreen) Sir?

(The CAPTAIN notices PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD is not the man in the room. It is KNOWLE ROHRER, who appears to be in full health again after being decapitated at the end of Season 8.)

CAPTAIN: What is this?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Chief Petty Officer Bamford has been released from his post, Sir. I'm your new second in command.

(The CAPTAIN looks very troubled at this revelation.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 10

(Day. SCULLY's apartment. The camera pans around the living room to reveal SCULLY holding WILLIAM on the sofa. She appears to be easing his wind by patting him gently on the back. WILLIAM makes contented noises as she gently pats him on the back. )

SCULLY: Hello?

REYES: Dana, I'm sorry if I woke you. It's Monica Reyes. Dana, there's something I think you really need to be aware of. Something you need to hear. Something I'm not sure I believe.

SCULLY: I'm listening

REYES: It's not me you need to hear it from ...

(REYES passes her cell phone to DOGGETT, who's standing next to her.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, we may have same answers for you, about your baby.

CUT TO:

(Outside DOGGETT's apartment. A knock on the door. DOGGETT answers, and we see SCULLY standing outside. SCULLY enters to find agent REYES and SHANNON MCMAHON inside. REYES is standing at the back of the room. SHANNON MCMAHON is seated.)

REYES: Dana, this is Shannon McMahon.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Hi.

(SCULLY sits down without saying a word.)

SCULLY: Let's start with the water.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Well, you're a scientist, you'll appreciate the science involved. A new additive is being put in the water supply. It's called chloramine, it's not news, well let me say that it's been reported but no-one's asking questions yet.

SCULLY: And what should they be asking?

SHANNON MCMAHON: If you want to deliver something to everyone's home in America, what better way than through what's what's most taken for granted, water.

SCULLY: Look, I've had my fair share of outrageous conspiracy theories okay, so cut the mystery crap and get to the science.

(SHANNON MCMAHON looks at SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine, you can drink it and it's harmless.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Unless someone were to quietly go and change its molecular make-up.

(REYES and DOGGETT are watching and listening in silence.)

SCULLY: Who? And how?

SHANNON MCMAHON: I think you'd be more interested in why.

SCULLY: Alright then, why?

SHANNON MCMAHON: To prime a population to breed a generation of Super Soldiers.

SCULLY: By adding something to our water?

SHANNON MCMAHON: Something which promotes the mutation of offspring. And fertilisation. And pregnancy.

(SCULLY laughs nervously)

SCULLY: What you're saying is absurd.

SHANNON MCMAHON: Is it? It's no more absurd than I am. (She sits forward.) I am a first generation prototype. Now they're seven stages advanced in the stages of science that created me, to the point where now they have successfully given birth to a Super Soldier from a mutated egg.

SCULLY: Huh (SCULLY gets up.) How can we trust any of this? Or you? What you say you are ...

SHANNON MCMAHON: We all have a standard mutation ...

(SHANNON MCMAHON stands up and turns so that her back is to SCULLY. She pulls her hair away from the back of her neck to reveal a white pointed lump on the back of her neck. It's the reptilian ridge were are now very famiiar with.)



SCENE 11

(Day. Back on the ship. We start with a tight shot on the back of KNOWLE ROHRER's neck. It has the same raised ridge as SHANNON MCMAHON's neck does. He senses the CAPTAIN in the doorway staring. KNOWLE ROHRER is looking at papers.)

CAPTAIN: What are you looking at?

KNOWLE ROHRER: Ship's logs.

CAPTAIN: Those logs are classified.

KNOWLE ROHRER: I'm second in command. I'm supposed to know the ship Sir. In case something should happen to you.

(Pause.)

KNOWLE ROHRER: What is the greater mission of this ship, if I may ask? Sir?

CAPTAIN: I don't ask. We don't ask.

(An alarm starts to ring elsewhere on the ship. The CAPTAIN leaves quickly to investigate. Walking along the side of the ship, the CAPTAIN asks a crew member about the alarm.)

CAPTAIN: What's going on?

(Two divers jump off the side of the ship into the water. A crowd of crewmembers are looking over the side of the ship at what must be causing the commotion. The CAPTAIN looks towards the divers intently. We see them swimming over towards what looks like a body floating face down in the water. A small motor launch arrives to meet with the divers. The divers pull the body of PETTY OFFICER BAMFORD from the water. The CAPTAIN sees this and looks worried. He turns to see KNOWLE ROHRER standing about 10 yards behind him, watching him intensely.)



SCENE 12

(SCULLY picks up her stethoscope from her bag on the bed to check SHANNON MCMAHON's heart. DOGGETT is standing at the back of the room. He turns to leave as she starts to take off her grey t-shirt.

(We cut to the living room)

REYES: It doesn't make any sense.

DOGGETT: Yeah, only it doesn't look like there's any harm in it either does it?

REYES: She drowned that man from the EPA. She's drowned 2 men.

DOGGETT: She says they were part of the program - two guys working to spike the water of the state of Maryland's water supply.

REYES: So she killed them as a way of contacting you, you believe that?

DOGGETT: You saw that thing on her back. You said you saw it before. I think we're on to something here Monica, it's freaky, it's mindblowing. You gotta admit that, come on.

REYES: I'm not doubting what she is, only what she says she's doing.

(SCULLY walks in. DOGGETT and REYES turn from each other to look at SCULLY. )

DOGGETT: What did you find?

SCULLY: Nothing, nothing more than a small deformity of the spine. Physically, she seems absolutely normal, as normal as you or I.

DOGGETT: I don't believe this.

SCULLY: What don't you believe Agent Doggett? I just examined her.

DOGGETT: That I'm standing here with both of you telling me that you don't see what's right in front us. She's the key to everything in this case, right to the FBI.

SCULLY: Well for your sake, I hope so, but I hope not for mine.

(DOGGETT's cell phone rings. He answers it.)

DOGGETT: John Doggett.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett, I really don't want to be making this call, I really don't, I've been forced to.

DOGGETT: What are you talking about?

CUT TO:



SCENE 13

(DOGGETT bursts into KERSH's office.)

DOGGETT:You want to turf me now? You want to take my badge and gun?

KERSH: (Standing up with his arms crossed.) Agent Doggett, you can't just burst in here.

DOGGETT: How's it going to look Deputy Director, you suspending me right before I nail you up against a wall as a co-conspirator.

(An off-camera voice interrupts them.)

FOLLMER: Glad you could drop in, Mr. Doggett (He walks over to DOGGETT.) Assistant Director Follmer.

DOGGETT: (Nodding to himself) You're Brad Follmer.

FOLLMER: I was just explaining to the Deputy Director the reasons why you are being suspended, but I think your actions here speak for themselves.

DOGGETT: I see what this is, this is just a little bureaucratic paint job.

KERSH: I'd watch your mouth John.

FOLLMER: What this is, is a testament to your gross subordination and reckless disregard for the FBI.

DOGGETT: You wanna start hearing what's coming of your wishy-washy mouth.

FOLLMER: Paranoia must go with the job. (Smiling) You're starting to sound just like Fox Mulder, Mr. Doggett.

DOGGETT: Now don't you Mr. Doggett me. I don't answer to you, I answer to AD Skinner.

FOLLMER: The job suspension stands, Mr. Doggett.

DOGGETT: Try and stop me.

(With this, DOGGETT leaves the office. KERSH casually watches him go.)



SCENE 14

(A computer screen. We see details from the Department of Justice, Office of Human Resources Employee Database, being viewed on the screen, by AGENT REYES. She is searching the database for all records concerning SHANNON MCMAHON. She submits the search and her file is displayed on screen, along with a photo:

Name:

  McMahon, Shannon C,

Curret Post

  Special Investigator, D.C.

Birthplace

  Snoqualmie Falls, Washington

Education:

  Duke University School of ....

The photograph displayed gives further information:

McMahon, Shannon, C.
Special Investigator, D.O.J. 27172-7091.

(We see we are in the X-Files office. REYES hears a knock on the door, as THE LONE GUNMEN enter.)

FROHIKE: You just never know who's gonna come a knockin' do ya?

REYES: How'd you get in here?

LANGLY: Through the front door with the big happy dude, how'd you get in?

(LANGLY sits down and pulls out a laptop, placing it on the desk.)

REYES: Through a security checkpoint.

(FROHIKE pulls his leather jacket open slightly to reveal a phoney FBI ID)

FROHIKE: Kid's stuff!

REYES: What are you doing here?

FROHIKE: You sent us packing on this investigation of yours, only we had a small funding fiasco.

LANGLY (Downbeat) They cut our internet service.

REYES: Don't tell me you breached FBI security just to log on?

BYERS: I think you want to see this.

(REYES gets up and walks over to LANGLY's laptop.)

LANGLY: Arghhh!

(Some wallpaper with a covergirl wearing a "Stars and Stripes" bikini in red, white and blue appears. BYERS turns away in disbelief.)

LANGLY: Not this!

(LANGLY types rapdily to bring up the correct information. A communications program is brought up onto the screen, with several items listed in red and white.)

FROHIKE: This is what we meant to show you. We are live in the EPA phone system. The numbers in red are calls to deputy administrator *after* he drowned.

REYES: Who'd be calling him at work after the front page news that he's dead?

LANGLY: Someone who doesn't know it.

(Suddenly, a phone is heard ringing on the PC monitoring system. An "incoming call intercept" message appears on the screen.)

BYERS: Whoever it is is calling him again as we speak. Langly! Hook up a patch cord! Hurry!

(LANGLY quickly plugs a cable into the side of the laptop. This is attached to a phone on the desk in front of them. LANGLY fractically types away at the laptop, and the phone on the desk starts to ring.)

LANGLY: Pick up the phone!

(FROHIKE looks unsure.)

(FROHIKE picks up the phone, and after reassurance from BYERS, answers.)

FROHIKE: C-Carl Wormus -

(We hear the CAPTAIN's voice on the phone.)

CAPTAIN: They're trying to reach you. They ordered us to port. One of my men is dead.

FROHIKE: R-right (Unsure) W-what's it you need from us, er, me, on this end?

CAPTAIN: Just what we talked about. Call the FBI.

FROHIKE: Right.

CAPTAIN: You've gotta get to the FBI.

(We see that the CAPTAIN is being watched making the call from the payphone on the dockside. KNOWLE ROHRER is using his extra-sensory hearing to hear what the CAPTAIN is saying from a distance.)

CAPTAIN: Tell them about the lab they've got on board. About the horrors and the inhumanity. To expose these people for what they really are.

(KNOWLE ROHRER stares at the CAPTAIN with piercing eyes, devoid of emotion, his piercing gaze locked straight on the CAPTAIN.)



SCENE 15

(Day. Inside the FBI building. AGENT REYES is walking along a hallway. She stops and enters BRAD FOLLMER's office without knocking. )

REYES: I need to talk to you.

(We see FOLLMER's SECRETARY in the office with FOLLMER. They are going through a folder.)

FOLLMER: I have an appointment.

REYES: Don't do this to me Brad.

FOLLMER: (To his secretary) Give me 2 minutes.

(They exit into another room.)

FOLLMER: Here you are again Monica, walking through my door.

REYES: I need your help.

FOLLMER: I tried to help you before.

REYES: I'm asking you again.

FOLLMER: OK, I'm listening.

REYES: There's a woman working at the department of justice, Shannon McMahon. I need her case files.

FOLLMER: You say that like it's something I can just do. It's not.

REYES: It's important to me.

FOLLMER: Important to you and to Agent Doggett in other words?

REYES: You're on the wrong side of the tracks on this one, trust me.

FOLLMER: Explained to me by Mr. Doggett himself in the Deputy Directors office today.

REYES: Would you listen to me. Peoples lives are in danger here. He's been set up. We're being set up.

FOLLMER: By who? The Justice Department?

REYES: That's why I need those files. I'd ask you to do this for me, but he's a good man.

FOLLMER: He believe he's in the right?

REYES: And you, you always are?



SCENE 16

(Night. REYES is walking quickly towards a car parked which pulls up on the street. It stops with its lights still on. It contains DOGGETT and SCULLY.

REYES: Where's Shannon McMahon?

DOGGETT: She's in my house. Why? What's this about?

REYES: She's lying to you, she's not who you think.

DOGGETT: Where you getting this?

REYES: Everywhere I look. She works for the Department of Justice, did you know that? I got a peak at her case files. Those two men she killed, they'd contacted her at the DOJ as whistleblowers.

DOGGETT: She said they conspired with the Government. They were part of the program -

REYES: They were killed because they wanted to expose the program.

DOGGETT: Then why's she lying? Why come to me?

REYES: Because there's one man she still can't pinpoint, and she wants you to lead her to him.

DOGGETT: How? I wouldn't even know who the hell you're talking about.

REYES: He's the Captain of a Navy ship that spends 12 months of the year at sea. He had been in guarded contact with both dead men about a secret lab on that ship.

DOGGETT: Right now Shannon McMahon is the only sure thing we have in this investigation. If we cut out on her and go to this ship of yours, we risk coming out with both hands empty.

SCULLY: If this is true about this ship and this lab, there may be answers there I can't risk not knowing.

(DOGGETT looks at SCULLY, realising they must go to the ship. REYES jumps in the back seat. DOGGETT drives off.)



SCENE 17

(A close up on a monitor. We can see a heavily magnified image of a human egg being manipulated with a very fine needle pipette, the type used in cell manipulation procedures. The camera pans away from the monitor to reveal a larger lab with more monitors displaying cloning-type human ova manipulation. We hear a small signal, and a voice over an intercom. We can see that Dr. Nordlinger is pacing around the lab.)

VOICE ON INTERCOM: Dr. Nordlinger, a message for you Sir.

(DR. NORDLINGER looks on the monitor which is showing the immediate area on the outside of the security door. He sees only the NAVY SEAL standing outside the door. He slowly opens the door, peering out a first and then opening it wider. Suddenly, the CAPTAIN jumps out from behind the NAVY SEAL and hold a gun to his neck.)

CAPTAIN: I want every hard drive. All the data you've got on this butcher shop you're running here.

(There's a long pause as no-one says anything. The camera then pans to the side of the CAPTAIN, and we see KNOWLE ROHRER standing behind him.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 18

(Night. DOGGETT's car pulls up on the dockside at the side of the ship and comes to a stop quickly. AGENTS SCULLY, REYES and DOGGETT get out and start walking along the dock.)

DOGGETT: Where's this Captain supposed to be?

REYES: We're supposed to meet him in a phone booth at 1:00 AM. It's 10 to ...

SCULLY: Somebody's already there. (They see a figure over by the payphone in the distance.)

DOGGETT: Is he tall or medium?

REYES: I don't know, it wasnt clear.

SCULLY: Sees us

(The figure they have seen starts to walk towards them in the distance.)

DOGGETT: Hold up there!

(The figure continues to walk towards them.)

DOGGETT: I said hold up there.

(The figure is getting close to them now.)

DOGGETT: (Recognising whot the figure is) This ain't no Captain ...

(We see that figure is KNOWLE ROHRER, as his face appears from out of the shadows. DOGGETT pulls out his gun and holds aim on ROHRER.)

SCULLY: Who is it?

DOGGETT: Knowle Rohrer. Run! now!

(REYES and SCULLY run for cover. DOGGETT holds his aim directly at ROHRER.)

DOGGETT: Freeze FBI. (KNOWLE ROHRER gets closer, and DOGGETT starts to shoot, maybe 12 rounds in total. They have no impact. ROHRER continues walking towards DOGGETT, who now looks to an alternative. Just as ROHRER gets to within a couple of metres, DOGGETT gets ready to hit ROHRER with the stock of his gun. As he prepares to strike, ROHRER blocks him and punches him in the face, knocking him to the ground. ROHRER walks over to DOGGETT, and grabbing his by the shoulders, pulls him back up, then throws him several metres through the air back into a wooden crate, which DOGGETT hits with a loud crack. DOGGETT falls to the ground, and again ROHRER picks him up off the ground. He throws him into a metal drum, and then into a crate. ROHRER then grabs hold off of the sides of DOGGETT's head and squeezes, trying to crush his head. He stares blankly into DOGGETT's eyes. We see blood appear from DOGGETT's nose as ROHRER's squeezes with more pressure, followed by the grisly sound of bone cracking. ROHRER is intent on killing DOGGETT. Suddenly, there is a loud whooshing sound, and ROHRER's head is swiftly decapitated with a single blow, falling to land on the ground nearby. We see SHANNON MCMAHON standing behind the now headless body of ROHRER.)

SHANNON MCMAHON: You didn't trust me.

(She helps DOGGETT to his feet. Suddenly, a bloodied hand appears through the front of her stomach, and blood immediately starts to run from her mouth. She looks down in horror. We can see that the headless body of KNOWLE ROHRER standing behind her, before their two bodies fall off the edge of the docks and tumble into the water below. DOGGETT looks down at the water, but nothing appears.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 19

(Later. REYES, SCULLY and DOGGETT walk up onto the ship and start to look around, SCULLY holding her flashlight and DOGGETT and REYES with their weapons drawn ready. DOGGETT explores further, up a flight of stairs with his gun at arms' length. He doesn't see anything.)

DOGGETT: You see anybody?

REYES: Nobody.

SCULLY: This can't be right.

REYES: What happened to the Captain?

(SCULLY and REYES are now exploring inside the ship, walking along a dimly lit corridor, lit with an eerie red glow. They discover an grilled door, which they open. They are now on a metal mesh walkway, upon which they notice the decapitated head of the CAPTAIN. )

SCULLY: I think we found the Captain.

(They walk further along the walkway and find his headless body. DOGGETT meanwhile is exploring elsewhere. He enters a room and finds papers strewn all over the floor. His attention is drawn to a quiet beeping noise coming from a corner of the room. He shines his flashlight towards the wall and walks over. He discovers a crudely assembled bomb, a square of explosive material with a mass of wires in the centre, connected to a digital timer. The timer reads "Detonator Armed - 00:02:07. It continues counting down as DOGGETT realises what is going on.)

DOGGETT: (Realising) They're scuttling the ship (Shouting) AGENT SCULLY! AGENT REYES!

(DOGGETT runs off to find REYES and SCULLY.)

(Meanwhile, we see REYES and SCULLY on a monitor, mounted on the wall of the secret lab. They are standing outside. The door is open and they enter.)

REYES: This must be it.

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT is moving quickly around the ship in an attempt to locate his fellow agents.)

DOGGETT: (Shouting as he searches) MONICA! DANA!

CUT BACK TO:

(SCULLY and REYES are in the lab. SCULLY is slowly walking into the lab, taking in everything around her. Monitors show human ova displayed on screen and there is monitoring equipment all over the lab. REYES is standing in the doorway.)

DOGGETT: (Offscreen) AGENT SCULLY! AGENT REYES!

REYES: In here -

DOGGETT: Move out, we gotta get outta here.

REYES: You see what this is?

DOGGETT: Agent Scully we've got to go. The ship's gonna blow, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: They're manipulating ova. (SCULLY walks further into the room.) Female eggs for transplantation.

CUT TO:

(The digital timer on the bomb is now reading 00:00:51 and falling.)

CUT BACK TO:

SCULLY: Look at these names. These are test subjects. (We see some kind of production line over SCULLY's head containing small clear bags of what look like test samples.)

DOGGETT: Grab them Monica, we've got less than a minute to get out of here.

SCULLY: Just give me a second.

DOGGETT: WE GOT NO TIME!

SCULLY: No let go, let me do this. I have to see if I'm here. My name, my baby's name -

CUT TO:

(The digital timer on the bomb is now reading 00:00:34 and falling.)

CUT BACK TO:

DOGGETT: (Grabbing SCULLY) You want to see your baby again? We got no time Dana. We'll find another way.

(SCULLY realises she has no choice. They all race out of the lab.)

CUT TO:

(The digital timer on the bomb is now reading 00:00:13 and falling.)

CUT BACK TO:

(DOGGETT, REYES and SCULLY are running for their lives now, trying to get off the ship as quickly as possible.)

CUT TO:

(The digital timer on the bomb is now reading 00:00:05 and falling.)

CUT BACK TO:

(DOGGETT, SCULLY and REYES are now running along the dockside as fast as possible, trying to find shelter from the impending blast.)

CUT TO:

(The digital timer on the bomb is now reading 00:00:01 and then reaches 00:00:00. There is an almighty explosion as the bomb explodes, sending a large fireball into the sky. The three agents run towards their parked car, but as they near the shockwave from the explosion passes them and the rental car's windows are blown out. A series of further massive explosions rock the ship as debris and flames are hurled into the air. The agents manage to shelter down behind their car finally, as the explosions continue. They're safe. And alive. Fade to white.)



SCENE 20
WASHINGTON D.C.
48 HOURS LATER

(Night. External shot of the FBI building. We then cut to KERSH's office. A knock on the door. Agent DOGGETT enters.)

DOGGETT: Deputy Director?

KERSH: My sources tell me you've wrapped up your investigation John.

DOGGETT: I have my report ready Sir, yes.

KERSH: How do I come out?

(DOGGETT hands over the report. KERSH goes through the report. He lists the points DOGGETT has reported)

KERSH: Super Soldiers, a Navy ship, a woman at the Department Of Justice who drowned two men, all disappeared now, but which constitute a conspiracy like a cancer in the US Government. (KERSH continues to check the rest of the report.) Not a mention of my name John?

DOGGETT: No Sir, I found nothing on you, nothing damning I can honestly include in my report, let me say. And cause I got nothing to lose, let me say that I know that your hands are dirty on this thing Sir, filthy.

KERSH: That's why you're here? Take a last wild push before the bell.

DOGGETT: There's one thing I can't figure, and then I'll be on my way. Is why you slipped that obituary under my door?

KERSH: You think I did that?

DOGGETT: Over and over in my mind, it had to be you. You're the only one that had a reason.

KERSH: What's my reason?

DOGGETT: You tell me. Are you looking to get me fired or get me killed?

(DOGGETT throws his badge and gun down on KERSH's desk. He turns and heads for the door.)

KERSH: You ever hear of King George the Third?

DOGGETT: (Turning back toward KERSH) You answer my question!

KERSH: He was King of England when America declared Independence in 1776. King George the Third kept a diary. On July 4th 1776, he made an entry in it: "Nothing Important Happened Today".

DOGGETT: What the hell has that got to do with me?

KERSH: Revolutions start, things that change the world forever, and even Kings can miss them if they're not paying attention.

DOGGETT: Are you saying that you left that obituary to help me? To help me find the things that I found? Nah, why would I believe that you'd help me?

KERSH: Agent Mulder believed me.

DOGGETT: Mulder? What the hell are you talking about? Mulder's long gone.

KERSH: Say I told Mulder that he would be killed if he stayed. The same people who threatened to kill me if I didn't go along. Would you believe that John?

DOGGETT: No. Mulder wouldn't hear it, not from you, not from anybody.

KERSH: I said I *told* him to go. I didn't say I persuaded him.

DOGGETT: Oh my God. It was Scully. Scully made him go. That's it isn't it? (DOGGETT contemplates what KERSH has just told him. KERSH sits back in his chair.)



SCENE 21

(We see DOGGETT putting his FBI ID back on his jacket pocket as he walks down the corridor. He calls a lift and it arrives. The doors open and we see that BRAD FOLLMER is in the lift. DOGGETT and FOLLMER exchange glances and FOLLMER smirks as DOGGETT enters. The two men stand side by side avoiding eye contact.)

FOLLMER: You want the basement? I heard you got a stay of execution. Congratulations.

DOGGETT: (Half-smiling) I'm sure you mean that.

FOLLMER: No, I'm sure not. The Deputy Director has you just where he wants you. Don't get me wrong, I'm a friend to The X Files. Kind of a comfort having you down there, Mr. Doggett.

(The lift stops and the doors open. FOLLMER leaves the lift. He passes REYES who enters the lift with DOGGETT.)

REYES: Hi

(FOLLMER smiles at REYES as she passes him.)

DOGGETT: Just so long as you know where to reach us, Mr. Follmer.

(FOLLMER stops in the corridor, acknowleding DOGGETT's offer. The lift doors close.)



SCENE 22

(Deep under water, amidst rocks and plant life, we see the lifeless bodies of SHANNON MCMAHON and KNOWLE ROHRER lying on the seabed. The camera takes us closer to her. As we near her face, her eyes suddenly burst open.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY wakes up suddenly on the sofa, and turns on the light. WILLIAM is stirring in his crib. SCULLY gets up to check him. He is under a blanket, laying on his back, with a dummy in his mouth. She strokes him.)

SCULLY: (Softly) Everything's going to be okay. Go back to sleep.

(She lies back down on the sofa. She turns off the light, looking towards WILLIAM as she drifts off. The camera now focuses on WILLIAM in the crib, looking up at the mobile hanging above him. His small arm reaches up toward the mobile.)

(After fading to black, we hear the mobile start to slowly turn.)

[THE END]

(Before the credits roll, a special memorial was shown on the screen.)

In loving memory of

Chad Keller

October 8,1971 - September 11, 2001


                                    DÆMONICUS



SCENE 1
WESTON, WEST VIRGINIA

(Night. A full moon is reflected in a still puddle of water. Suddenly it is disturbed. A white pick-up truck pulls up on some dirt, it's red brake lights glowing in the dark. We see two men inside. They looks over towards a rural house in the middle of a field. We hear a dog barking in the distance.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the house. The dog is barking loudly, rearing up on its hind legs scratching at the door.)

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: (To the dog) Happy, stop that.

(We see the woman, EVELYN MOUNTJOY, is sat at a table with her husband DARREN. They are playing Scrabble.

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: Hap. (To her husband) What's with her all of a sudden?

(The woman gets to to check the dog.)

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: Don't you look at my letters.

DARREN MOUNTJOY: For God's sake.

(EVELYN walks over to the dog. With her back to him, DARREN MOUNTJOY quickly turns her letter tray around to see her letters. She lets the dog out of the door, which then races across the field towards some foliage in the distance. She closes the door and comes back to the table. DARREN has just taken his turn to place a word on the Scrabble board. We see he has put down the word "TRIUMPHS", using the "S" from the start of another word, probably "SANDBOX".)

DARREN MOUNTJOY: Read 'em and weep my dear!

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: Seven letters. 50 bonus points.

(We suddenly hear the dog barking in the distance. The barking turns to yelping. The dog sounds in distress. The couple look worried.)

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: Darren ...

(Suddenly the lights go out.)

DARREN MOUNTJOY: (To his wife) Get in the basement.

EVELYN MOUNTJOY: What are you going to do?

DARREN MOUNTJOY: Just do what I say.

(DARREN MOUNTJOY races upstairs to get his handgun. Meanwhile, downstairs in the kitchen, EVELYN is suddenly surprised from behind, as a hand is placed over her mouth. We do not see the assailant, who is in shadow. Upstairs, DARREN is loading bullets into his handgun as fast as he can. He starts to descend the stairs, slowly, with his gun raised to one side. As he nears the middle of the stairway, he sees a shadowy figure moving slowly towards him downstairs. He holds his gun out in front of him, aiming at the figure.)

DARREN MOUNTJOY: (Towards the figure) I got a gun!

(The figure continues to move towards him in the dark.)

DARREN MOUNTJOY: Stop!

(He fires two shots at the figure, which falls to the ground, lifeless. He races over to the figure, and finds the victim's hands bound behind the back. He checks further and sees the victim has adhesive tape over their mouth. He pulls it off. He recognises the victim. It is his wife, EVELYN.)

(DARREN stands motionless in shock, not believing what he is seeing. Suddenly, ghostly, ethereal voices fill the house. DARREN turns towards them. We see two large shadowy figures moving towards him. As they emerge from the shadows, we see they have evil, demonic faces.)

[Fade to black]

SCENE 2
WESTON, WEST VIRGINIA

(The next morning. REYES is driving across the field in a car. She holds up her FBI ID to a police officer who lets her pass. The parks behind another car and gets out. She surveys the scene, looking apprehensive.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the MOUNTJOY residence. A police photographer is taking crimescene photos for evidence. REYES is walking around the kitchen and living room. We see the bodies of EVELYN and DARREN MOUNTJOY seated at their Scrabble table. EVELYN is holding the handgun in her right hand, which is resting on the table. DARREN is seated opposite her, and appears to have been shot in the head. We hear the squeaking of the ceiling fan, and see the shadow of it turning on the table below. REYES looks down at the Scrabble board. There is a single word on the board - DAEMONICUS, which runs through the centre square. She touches the "D". She then looks up towards the fan hanging from the ceiling. It isn't moving. DOGGETT enters.)

DOGGETT: Reyes! (REYES turns around abruptly) Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

(The ceiling fan is now turning slowly, squeaking as it turns.)

REYES: They told me I'd find you inside.

DOGGETT: I was out back talking to the Detective in charge. You're the expert here, Monica. Everyone's waiting to hear what you have to say on this.

REYES: What do we know?

DOGGETT: Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy, married thirty-two years, three kids, five grand-kids. Not an enemy in the world. Just that dog out front. Neck's broken. Footprints in the mud. We're looking for two perps.

REYES: Nothing's soiled in the house, nothing at all to suggest motive.

DOGGETT: Well, it all fits the profile, right? This thing is staged to look like some kind of Satanic ritual.

REYES: Placing victims in a suicide posture is ritualistic. And this word is undoubtedly Satanic.

(The camera focuses on the Scrabble board.)

DOGGETT: Daemonicus.

REYES: It means Satan in Latin, or Daemonicus - Demon Possession.

DOGGETT: (Deadpan) And it's worth 50 extra points. That's why they were posed like this. You think these folks were possessed, right?

REYES: That would be the textbook explanation

(DOGGETT turns to leave.)

DOGGETT: Then I'll let 'em know.

REYES: This may be something else.

DOGGETT: Which is what?

(An officer wheels in a gurney for one of the bodies. REYES and DOGGETT turn away.)

DOGGETT: Hey, you say anything you want about Satanic ritual, but don't tell me you think the Devil did this, because we've got prints from out there. This case ain't even close to being an X-File.

REYES: Something strange happened in here just before you came in. I can't explain it.

(Suddenly, the MEDICAL OFFICER jumps up and shouts out in pain.)

OFFICER: Arghh!

DOGGETT: What?

(DOGGETT looks down at the body of EVELYN MOUNTJOY. He pulls open her cardigan, to reveal a bloodsoaked jumper. Suddenly, we see two small snakes writhe out of her jumper. REYES and DOGGETT stand back, surprised and shocked.)



SCENE 3
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(We see the name Dr. Dana Scully being written with chalk onto a blackboard. We see SCULLY standing in front of a large group of FBI training cadets, situated in a large lecture theatre. )

SCULLY: Dr. Dana Scully. I have just been assigned to the Academy as a forensic investigator. For the past eight years I was part of a unit known as the X-Files. (There is muffled laughter.) Some of you may have heard of it.

(We see DOGGETT enter the lecture theatre through an entrance at back of the hall.)

CADET: Ever slay a vampire? (This is met with more laughter from the cadets.)

SCULLY: Sorry to disappoint you, but this is a course in forensic pathology. Hard science. An X-File is a case that has been deemed unsolvable by the Bureau, because such a case cannot be solved it may beg other explanations... a vampire, perhaps. Science, however, tells us that evil comes not from monsters, but from men. It offers us the methodology to catch these men, and only after we have exhausted these methods should we leave science behind to consider more (pause) extreme possibilities.

(We see DOGGETT obviously waiting to talk to SCULLY after the lecture.)



SCENE 4

(REYES is walking along a corridor in the FBI building. She arrives at the morgue. We see SCULLY and DOGGETT talking inside one of the autopsy rooms, a body under a white sheet beside them. REYES stops outside the door and watches them. SCULLY notices REYES waiting and mentions this to DOGGETT, who turns around. REYES then enters.)

REYES: What did you find?

DOGGETT: I asked Agent Scully for expertise on this. Looks like we can rule out the Exorcist after all.

REYES: And why is that?

SCULLY: There is adhesive residue on Mrs. Mountjoy's wrists and face. (SCULLY uses a UV lamp to show REYES the residue.) Do you see that? She was taped and bound and then shot at a range of ten to twelve feet with her husband's handgun.

REYES: The husband shot her.

(REYES has a vision. We see a flash at the husband fires his gun.)

REYES: He was tricked into it.

DOGGETT: That's what we're thinking. Some kind of sick game.

SCULLY: Well, there's also evidence of fingerprint bruising along his collarbone.

(SCULLY shows DOGGETT and REYES on the body of DARREN MOUNTJOY.)

REYES: They held him down. (REYES has another vision, we see the husband shot) Shot him in his chair.

DOGGETT: Again, we're looking for two guys.

(SCULLY picks up a perspex box containing the snakes extracted from the body of EVELYN MOUNTJOY.)

SCULLY: Snakes appeared to be purely symbolic. They're non-venomous species collected locally. They were sewn post-mortem into the body cavity with household thread, by someone who appears to have surgical skill.

REYES: You've made a lot of headway.

SCULLY: But there's something else. There's something that you're not saying.

REYES: When I was alone in that house this morning I had the strong feeling I was in the presence of evil.

DOGGETT: Look, Monica, the only reason you were called in on this thing is you've investigated hundreds of these kinds of cases.

REYES: And not once did I find anything to support evidence of genuine Satanic activity.

DOGGETT: I'm saying...

REYES: I've never felt this before.

(DOGGETT's cell phone rings. He reaches into his pocket and answers it.)

DOGGETT: Excuse me. (He turns away.) John Doggett (His voice fades into the distance.)

REYES: Agent Scully, have you ever sensed what I'm talking about?

SCULLY: I've felt things that I couldn't understand. Things that I was afraid to admit even to myself.

REYES: And what did you do?

SCULLY: I learned not to ignore it... to trust my instincts.

DOGGETT:

(DOGGETT ends his call and turns back towards SCULLY and REYES.)

REYES: What is it?

DOGGETT: Mental hospital, 100 miles from here. They think one of their patients did this.



SCENE 5

(We see a very rugged landscape. Clouds are moving at a very high speed. We hear thunder rolling overhead. We see a car away in the distance moving in front of a line of trees.)

CUT TO:

(The white pickup from earlier is driving through dense undergrowth. It comes to a halt on a dirt track running through the trees. Inside the truck, we see two demonic masks lying in the middle of the front seat. Two men are sitting either side. They pick up the masks and get out. One of the men is carrying some rope. They walk off into the undergrowth.)



SCENE 6
CHESSMAN STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL
KITSONVILLE, WEST VIRGINIA

(We are in a large, atrium area, the floor covered in with a chessboard design. DOGGETT and REYES are talking to one of the female doctors, DR. MONIQUE SAMPSON.)

DR. SAMPSON: We're pretty shaken up. We're still trying to figure out how he could have escaped.

DOGGETT: Why do you think this escaped patient Dr. Richmond was involved in these murders?

DR. SAMPSON: Dr. Richmond was committed here because he killed three patients. He'd sewn strychnine tablets in their stomach lining in. And I heard about the snakes.

REYES: The police believe two men committed this crime, Dr. Sampson.

DR. SAMPSON: Two men?

DOGGETT: Do you have any idea who the second man might be?

DR. SAMPSON: No, he didn't exactly keep pen-pals.

REYES: Did Dr. Richmond display any knowledge of Satanic lure, or speak of demonic possession?

DR. SAMPSON: No, he was perfectly cogent. He didn't suffer from those kinds of delusions.

REYES: I'm not really asking about delusions.

REYES: When you last spoke to him did he seem himself?

DR. SAMPSON: Seem himself?

REYES: I mean did he display personality other than his own? Speaking tongues or in any language which he didn't know?

DR. SAMPSON: You're asking me if he was possessed? This is the 21th century, Miss Reyes. We stopped looking a long time ago to demons to explain mental illness.

REYES: I'm not really talking about mental illness.

(REYES smiles, believing DR. SAMPSON is not taking her seriously. DOGGETT is trying very hard to avoid eye contact. DR. SAMPSON really doesn't know what to say. She excuses herself.)

DR. SAMPSON: Excuse me a moment.

DOGGETT: You know, Monica, a room here just came open.

REYES: You heard what she said. Dr. Richmond didn't know anything about Satanic ritual.

DOGGETT: And that proves he was possessed?

REYES: You explain to me how else he commits a crime that's a perfect example of it?

DOGGETT: Well let's try the obvious - it was his accomplice.

DR. SAMPSON: Agents... I, uh, think the man you're looking for might be Paul Gerlach.

DOGGETT: Is he a patient here?

DR. SAMPSON: No, he's a guard. He's been here for 12 years and no one can find him.

REYES: Who would be the last person who saw them together?

(The camera looks down on the chessboard design floor from high above. DOGGETT, REYES and DR. SAMPSON walk off. The game has started.)



SCENE 7

(Two men are seen walking through some marsh. They come across a dry are and one of the men stops, dropping the rope he was carrying. The other man continues walking ahead. He is wearing the demonic mask from earlier. He stops and turns, finding the other man standing facing him about 20 metres away. The other man then reaches into a coat pocket and pulls out a handgun, aiming it at the man standing in front of him. He too is wearing a demonic mask. The eyes of his victim stare straight towards him. He pulls the trigger. A shot rings out.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 8

(A padded cell in the hospital. A patient is sitting on his knees, staring at the wall in front of him. It is JOSEF KOBOLD, a former professor. DOGGETT and REYES enter.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Kobold? My name is John Doggett, this is Monica Reyes. We're with the FBI.

(KOBOLD doesn't move.)

REYES: The patient in the cell next to you escaped last night. Did you see or hear anything? You share the same guard, Mr. Kobold. Do you know anything about their relationship? Why he would have helped him to escape?

KOBOLD: You mean than the guard forced a patient to escape, or did the patient force the guard? Or are they both of one mind, like a snake, eating its own tail? (DrWeesh: A reference to the ouroboros, the symbol of the Millennium Group.)

DOGGETT: You know something about this, Mr. Kobold? If you do we need your help. To stop them before they hurt more people.

KOBOLD: You're too late for that.

DOGGETT: If you're afraid to help us, Mr. Kobold, we can protect you. No harm will come to you.

KOBOLD: Do you believe in the power of the Devil, Mr. Doggett?

DOGGETT: I believe that the Devil's a story made up to scare people.

(KOBOLD's face tightens up, DOGGETT having not reassured him.)

KOBOLD: Then how can you possibly protect me?

(DOGGETT looks troubled.)



SCENE 9

(DOGGETT and REYES are walking along a corridor.)

DOGGETT: Consider the source, Monica.

(They walk out of shot.)



SCENE 10

(Back in the woods. A man is cleaning his bloodstained hands in the headlights of the white pickup truck. He hear an owl. He drops the rag on the ground. Inside the truck, we see he is wearing one of the demonic masks. It is the killer from earlier. The ethereal, ghostly voices suddenly start. The man stares ahead.)

CUT TO:

(JOSEF KOBOLD is sitting on his knees in his cell. We hear the voices here too. They seem to be coming from him. He is uttering words quietly.)

KOBOLD: Daemonicus. Daemonicus. Dae...

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(In the mental hospital. DR. SAMPSON is walking quickly down a corridor with DOGGETT and REYES.)

DR. SAMPSON: He's been calling for Agent Doggett for the past hour. He's extremely agitated.

REYES: Has he said why?

DR. SAMPSON: He keeps saying "Prince of the Apostles" over and over again. I don't know what it means. I had to restrain him for his own safety and I thought it was best not to sedate him until you speak to him.

(They enter a padded cell. There is a gurney in the cell, with JOSEF KOBOLD lying restrained on it.)

DOGGETT: Mr. Kobold, it's John Doggett.

(KOBOLD is restrained by his wrists and ankles. There is also a restraint running across his forehead, making it nearly impossible for him to look at DOGGETT and REYES.)

KOBOLD: He's speaking to me. Whispering in my ear.

REYES: What's he saying to you, Mr. Kobold?

KOBOLD: He's... killed again.

REYES: Who?

(Turning his head slightly to make eye contact with the agents.)

KOBOLD: I don't know. But I can show you.



SCENE 12

(Day. A wooded area with a dirt track running through it. Three cars pull up. 2 police cars escorting DOGGETT's hire car, one in front and one behind. DOGGETT opens the back door. A manacled JOSEF KOBOLD gets out, taking in the air.)

KOBOLD: You can't know what it feels like, being free of that cage, and to see the sky above me.

DOGGETT: Right, where is he, Mr. Kobold?

(KOBOLD signals somewhere up ahead to DOGGETT.)

KOBOLD: There, I can take you.

(KOBOLD tries to move off, but DOGGETT stops him.)

DOGGETT: That's far enough. Take him back to his cage now. Agent Reyes?

(DOGGETT and REYES are now walking down the dirt track.)

REYES: You think he's making it up?

DOGGETT: Yeah.

REYES: That was a pretty convincing show back there.

DOGGETT: He's play-acting, Monica. Just because he's good at it doesn't make it true.

REYES: Why do it?

DOGGETT: He wanted some fresh air. Maybe he gets off sending the FBI on snipe hunts.

(REYES has stopped, and it looking over at something.

REYES: I don't think that's it.

(DOGGETT stops and looks over. He see a blood stained hand hanging down from a tree. We see it is the demonic killer's victim, hanging upside down high up in a tree, silhouetted against the bright sun.)



SCENE 13

(Autopsy room. The demonic mask of the victim is being cut off by SCULLY using a scalpel. She exposes his face.)

DOGGETT: This is the security guard, Paul Gerlach.

SCULLY: It appears he was shot in the chest. His body was staged post-mortem, just like the others.

DOGGETT: Someone wants to play games.

REYES: Or not. Prince of the Apostles. Kobold kept repeating it in his cell.

SCULLY: Saint Peter. He was said to have been crucified upside down.

REYES: A symbol later adopted by the Satanists to mark the power of Antichrist.

DOGGETT: Which you take as proof that the Devil possessed the surgeon who somehow put him in contact with Kobold.

REYES: It's part of the literature. He could be a medium. A willing host for Satan. May be communicating with Kobold.

DOGGETT: Well that's convenient.

REYES: He brought up the Devil and the snakes. No one told him the details of the crime and yet he knew.

DOGGETT: That's 'cause he planned it. I pulled his file. This guy's a master manipulator. He was a history Professor at the University of Miami, committed for grinding up six coeds, that he tricked into his basement. He used their flesh as fertiliser in his garden.

REYES: If Kobold's part of this then why is he still behind bars? Why not escape when he had the chance?

DOGGETT: I don't know yet. You believe this guy, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I haven't formed an opinion about it yet, actually.

DOGGETT: That's great. That's great.

DOGGETT: Where are you going, Monica?

REYES: This man Kobold can help us, John. I'm going to prove it to you.

(REYSE leaves the room. DOGGETT looks over at SCULLY.)



SCENE 14

(Fast moving clouds. We hear thunder. We fade in to see the face of JOSEF KOBOLD, kneeling in his cell as before. A guard unlocks the cell door. REYES enters the cell, DOGGETT stands in the doorway.)

REYES: Professor.

KOBOLD: You found the body.

REYES: Yes. Professor Kobold, we need your help. To find him before anyone else gets hurt.

KOBOLD: I can't.

DOGGETT: You can't or you won't?

KOBOLD: I can't. In here. He whispers to me in a thousand voices. (Pained) But they're so hard to hear.

REYES: What can we do, to help you here?

KOBOLD: I need a larger room. One with space. And windows. To see the sky.

(DOGGETT sees through this straight away. REYES appears to be ready to help KOBOLD with his wishes. DOGGETT and REYES turn and leave the cell. In the corridor leading from the cell, DOGGETT questions REYES.)

DOGGETT: You're not going along with this are you? Giving this guy what he wants?

REYES: That's my general idea, yeah.

DOGGETT: You're making a mistake.

REYES: Look, even if you're right, even if this man is faking it, he can help us. I'm not willing to turn my back on that. Are you?

(DOGGETT stands for a moment, assessing her point.)



SCENE 15

(Day. Outside the hospital on a street. DR. SAMPSON unlocks her black estate car gets in. She drives off. We see the white pickup truck on the opposite side of the street. It pulls off, following DR. SAMPSON.)



SCENE 16

(A plain white room, much larger than KOBOLD's old cell. KOBOLD is sitting on a stool in front of one of the large windows. The room is bathed in sunlight. DOGGETT and a guard enter the room.)

DOGGETT: That's Officer Custer. He's going to keep an eye on you.

KOBOLD: I'm familiar with Officer Custer.

OFFICER CUSTER: I'm outside the door if you need anything, Professor.

KOBOLD: Agent Reyes believes me. But you don't, Mr. Doggett.

DOGGETT: It doesn't matter what I believe.

KOBOLD: I'm wondering, why a sceptic such as yourself would accept an assignment to an obscure unit of the FBI devoted exclusively to the investigating of paranormal phenomena.

DOGGETT: You been checking up on me, Professor?

KOBOLD: Ordinarily men do not pursue occupations against their own inclinations unless there's some strong countervailing reason. Seeking the love or approval of a woman, perhaps? Agent Reyes may have affection for you, but you for her? Of course it could be someone else. Or something else. Some... dark secret from your past.

DOGGETT: That's enough.

KOBOLD: An unsolved tragedy for which you feel responsible. In some morbid way you haven't even admitted to yourself, perhaps you feel that... chasing ghosts will answer the questions which damn you.

(DOGGETT looks troubled by this insight.)

DOGGETT: I don't have time for this. Tell me if he says anything.

OFFICER CUSTER: Agent Doggett?

(The ghostly voices suddenly start in the cell. KOBOLD's head starts moving quickly. He looks possessed. DOGGETT needs some extra help.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes! Get Agent Reyes!

(The voices continue. The guard leaves the cell to find REYES.)



SCENE 17

(DR. SAMPSON arrives at her house. She takes some mail from the mailbox and opens her front door. She walks through the hallway, passing a large window. As she passes the window, we see the white pickup track slowly moving across the lawn beside her house.)



SCENE 18

(Back at the mental hospital. REYES enters KOBOLD's cell to find DOGGETT restraining him on a gurney as a nurse injects something in his arm to sedate him. KOBOLD is muttering still. REYES gets closer to try to understand what he is saying.)

KOBOLD: Me-di-cus, me-diii-cuss.

REYES: He's saying something. Medicus... a physician.



SCENE 19

(We cut back to outside DR. SAMPSON's residence. We see the white pickup driving off from the kerbside. Just it leaves the roadside we see 5 or 6 police cars rapidly approaching the house, sirens wailing. They all pull up at the kerb, and perhaps a dozen officers get out. REYES and DOGGETT are also present. They burst through the front door of DR. SAMPSON's house.

DOGGETT: (Shouting) Dr. Sampson?

(REYES enters a room of the hallway with her gun aimed in front of her. She looks around, and her gaze stops on something to the side of her. She stops and moves towards it slowly, her gun lowered. She calls to DOGGETT.)

REYES: John.

(DOGGETT hears her voice and moves towards it, holding his gun in front of him. He enters the room where REYES is standing. We see DR. SAMPSON sitting at a desk in front of a window, the blinds drawn. She is motionless.)

DOGGETT: Dr. Sampson?

(No response. DOGGETT moves closer to her. He stops, and, turning the chair around, reveals DR. SAMPSON, her face stabbed with a dozen hypodermic syringes, firmly embedded in her skin and pointing in all directions. She's dead. REYES looks perturbed.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 20

(Day. Outside DR. SAMPSON's house. Her body is led away on a gurney, uncovered. The needles have been removed, and we can see the puncture marks in her skin. REYES walks past DOGGETT, and they exchange a glance. SCULLY then appears.)

SCULLY: The syringes contained roperidol, that's the same anti-psychotic medication that she was giving to Dr. Richmond.

DOGGETT: He's not the one calling the shots.

(We see JOSEF KOBOLD seated in the back of a car parked at the kerbside.)

SCULLY: You still think that it was Kobold?

DOGGETT: This is not about demons, it's not about demonic possession, it's about men.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, have you considered that something else might be going on here?

DOGGETT: I heard you say, Agent Scully, I heard you tell a classroom full of FBI cadets - most evil in the world comes from men.

SCULLY: But I also said that once science fails, we have to consider extreme possibilities.

(DOGGETT and DR RICHMOND glance at each other. DOGGETT looks wound up. We see SCULLY reassuring him.)

SCULLY: I know what you're feeling. I know your frustration. But you can't let it cloud your objectivity.

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes is thinking just what this guy Kobold wants her to think, and now you are too.

(DOGGETT walks off, leaving SCULLY looking frustrated. She looks over to the car. The demonic voices become audible. We see KOBOLD staring at SCULLY )



SCENE 21

(The mental hospital. KOBOLD's room. OFFICER CUSTER enters and walks over to a tray sitting on a chair.)

OFFICER CUSTER: Professor, you done with this meal?

(KOBOLD does answer. He is motionless, staring out of the window. DOGGETT enters the room carrying a report.)

DOGGETT: I brought something, Professor. Something to read. It's a monograph you wrote six years ago. Know the one I'm talking about, Professor? It's about the influence of Satan in Renaissance thinking.

(KOBOLD slowly gets up from the floor, stretching upwards as he stands.)

KOBOLD: So, you found your proof. Circumstantial though it may be.

DOGGETT: You planned this whole thing. I want to know why.

KOBOLD: I've been thinking a lot about you, Agent Doggett.

(KOBOLD walks slowly around the room.)

DOGGETT: You're not answering my question, Professor.

KOBOLD: About why someone so ill-suited would draw this duty. Clearly, you have feelings for her.

DOGGETT: You ordered Dr. Richmond to kill these people, didn't you?

KOBOLD: But you can't compete with the long-lost Agent Mulder. With his easy good looks, his Oxford education.

(DOGGETT is getting agitated by these remarks. His face gets more and more angry.)

DOGGETT: This is about you, Professor.

KOBOLD: Mulder has what you can't have. What you stumble for. The flat-footed cop, thinking he could put handcuffs on a demon.

(DOGGETT's pent up anger at KOBOLD is beginning to surface.)

DOGGETT: Answer the question!

KOBOLD: You want her, but she feels sorry for you. They both do.

(DOGGETT grabs KOBOLD around the shoulders, gripping his t-shirt. Suddenly, a thick liquid orange substance comes rushing out of KOBOLD's mouth, covering DOGGETT's jacket and shirt. DOGGETT jumps back. The liquid continues to emerge from his mouth as he stands there. He drops to his hands and knees, the liquid pooling on the floor in front of him. KOBOLD then slips sideways and lands in the pool of goo on the floor. DOGGETT bangs frantically on the door.)

DOGGETT: Guard! We need a medic! Guard! We need a medic! Guard!



SCENE 22

(SCULLY is examining KOBOLD in the presence of CUSTER. She has just finished her examination. REYES is standing outside the room, and notices this. She walks off along a corridor, meeting DOGGETT.)

REYES: She's coming.

(SCULLY appears a few seconds later.)

SCULLY: As far as I can tell physically he's fine.

DOGGETT: Of course he is.

SCULLY: What brought this on?

DOGGETT: The guy's an expert on Satanic history, I, I confronted him on it.

REYES: Which proves what?

DOGGETT: Come on, Monica, y-you wanted to know who could stage a textbook example. This guy wrote the damn book!

REYES: I can't explain those voices we heard in his room... or this.

(REYES holds up a small sample bottle of the mysterious orange liquid.)

DOGGETT: It's a trick.

REYES: What if it's ectoplasm?

DOGGETT: Ectoplasm?

REYES: You've heard of it, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Agent Mulder used to refer to it as psychic plasma - a residual by-product of telepathic communication. In theory it would have inorganic properties that couldn't be explained otherwise.

DOGGETT: So what are we talking now? The Ghostbusters?

REYES: If I'm right an analysis of this sample could prove whether he's telling the truth or faking it.

DOGGETT: Well, you can throw that crap away because I can tell you right now that this guy's liar. He's playing a game.

SCULLY: Well, then let's just see how well he plays that game.

DOGGETT: Why? So you can get suckered in even more? Listen to you two!

SCULLY: Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Listen, I'm telling ya. This guy threw this up for our benefit. He knew exactly what you'd say, he knew exactly what I'd say. He even knew that the two of you would be so blinded by this hocus pocus that you wouldn't see what's in front of your faces.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes is just trying to get to the truth, okay? What are you doing?

REYES: Maybe this is a hoax. Maybe you're right. But now you're saying we should turn away from evidence? It's not like you, John. I don't understand why.

DOGGETT: I already told you why.

(DOGGETT turns and leaves. REYES looks surprised and lost for words. DOGGETT continues down the corridor. He stops outside KOBOLD's cell, and peers in through the security glass window. He sees KOBOLD, motionless as ever, kneeling in front of the window.)



SCENE 23

(Night. The mental hospital. The main atrium with the chessboard floor is dimly lit by lights hanging from the ceiling. Outside it is thundering, and flashes of lightning briefly light up the floor. OFFICER CUSTER is sat a desk to one side of the hallway reading a comic book. The demonic voices start. He puts down the magazine and gets up. We hear a loud crash and suddenly the lights go out. He moves towards KOBOLD's cell door, and looks through the windows. He sees KOBOLD standing up, arms at his side, in the near darkness. He is illuminated every few seconds by the lightning flashes from outside. KOBOLD's face suddenly turns demonic, and CUSTER is left staring at him.)



SCENE 24

(Night. A car is driving along a road in the dark. We hear a cell phone ring. We see that it is SCULLY's car. She stops and answers the phone.)

SCULLY: Scully.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, I tried to reach you at Quantico.

SCULLY: I'm on my way back to DC. What is it?

DOGGETT: Kobold. He told the guard he knows where we can find Dr. Richmond.

SCULLY: Where?

DOGGETT: Well, let's just say it sounds like a joke. Another game. It's a place called Happy Landing.

(SCULLY thinks about this.)

DOGGETT: Scully?

SCULLY: On state road 710, near Annandale.

DOGGETT: What are you talking about?

SCULLY: There-there's old marina there. I passed it on my way home, in fact I'm almost there right now.

DOGGETT: (To REYES) State road 710 near Annandale. (To SCULLY) All right, we're going to meet you there.



SCENE 25

(Night. We see a sign decorated "Happy Landing". A car pulls up at the marina. SCULLY gets out cautiously. She looks around. The wooden boards under her feet creak as she walks along them. She draws her gun. She hears a noise and turns around quickly. Nothing. We see a shadowy figure approaching her from behind. She turns to see him as he lunges at her. SCULLY screams in horror.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 26

(Later. A stream of police cars pull up at the marina, their lights flashing and sirens wailing into the night. The second car to arrive is DOGGETT and REYES, which quickly get out and go to SCULLY's car.)

REYES: Where is she?

DOGGETT: I don't know. But I know who does.

(DOGGETT races over towards KOBOLD, who is seated in the back of one of the cars.)

DOGGETT: Where is she, Professor?

KOBOLD: Game's over, Mr. Doggett.

DOGGETT: Tell me where she is right now, you son of a bitch, I swear to God I'll kill you where you sit!

REYES: (Shocked) John ...

KOBOLD: You lost.

DOGGETT: (Shouting in KOBOLD's face) Where is she!!??

(KOBOLD looks at DOGGETT and laughs. Suddenly, we hear a gunshot ring out. DOGGETT and REYES look over to where the gunshot sounded. They race away from the car. OFFICER CUSTER then approaches the car, looking down at KOBOLD. DOGGETT and REYES are running through the marina, and enter a building. They stop and look around. They see some guard standing in a group over to one side. DOGGETT walks over, looking down to the ground. We see a body lying on the ground, still wearing a demonic mask. A pool of blood surrounds his head. DOGGETT calls out.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, over here.

DOGGETT: I don't understand.

SCULLY: He held me at gunpoint until you arrived and then he shot himself.

REYES: It doesn't make sense.

DOGGETT: (Nodding) Yes, it does. Game's over.

(DOGGETT races back outside. He sees the car door open, and the manacles lying on the ground. He sees a man running away. Believing him to be KOBOLD, DOGGETT raises his gun and holds aim.)

DOGGETT: Josef Kobold! Stop there! I'm armed! I will shoot!

(The figure carries on running, and DOGGETT fires twice. The figure falls off the side of the quayside and into the water. We do not see who it is. DOGGETT races to the quayside. REYES and SCULLY follow. The body does not resurface.)



SCENE 27

(Back at the Training Centre in Quantico. SCULLY is writing on the blackboard in front of the class of FBI cadets.)

SCULLY: Uncertainty. Not matter how thorough the investigation, some doubts inevitably remain. Just as juries seek to convict beyond reasonable doubt, the forensic investigator will seek conclusions supported by a preponderance of evidence. Rarely will you encounter a case where all of the variables, all of the open questions, are fully answered.

(The bell rings. The class all stand and get ready to leave the auditorium.

SCULLY: (To herself, light-heartedly) I'll see you Monday.

(DOGGETT and REYES walk down the steps to the front of the auditorium to meet SCULLY.)

REYES: Have you filed your report on the case yet?

SCULLY: (Sounding exhausted) I was going to do it on my way home.

REYES: We'd rather you didn't.

DOGGETT: We haven't accounted to Kobold's actions. Not all of them.

SCULLY: But Agent Reyes told me that Kobold accessed information about all of us over the Internet. About Mulder too.

DOGGETT: Well, that explains how he knew how we'd respond to the first killings. Why he staged them to look like Satanic ritual, to make sure that we would.

SCULLY: He wanted us on the case, we know that.

DOGGETT: He bent everyone to think and do whatever he wanted.

SCULLY: But we know all this already. It was a game, every move was played out perfectly. Except the last one.

REYES: Not unless that was part of the game, too.

SCULLY: What, to get shot in the back?

REYES: No. Kobold's body still hasn't been found.

SCULLY: Kobold's dead. Agent Doggett shot him. We all saw that.

(DOGGETT picks up a piece of chalk and writes DAEMONICUS on the blackboard.)

DOGGETT: Did we? Think back to Agent Reyes' question - why didn't Kobold escape with the others when he had the chance? Why? Because he wanted to escape without anyone knowing he'd escaped, so that by the time it was discovered, he'd be too far away for anyone to find him.

SCULLY: Satan.

(We see the original padded cell of KOBOLD. The door opens. DOGGETT enters the cell and looks around for clues.)

DOGGETT: Daemonicus. The beginning and the end of our case. The snake eating its own tail. We lost. Kobold told me so. He wanted us to see how brilliantly he played the game.

(DOGGETT reaches behind some loose padding and pulls out a clipping from a phonebook. The names of Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy are circled. We see their address as 41 Palm Road.)

DOGGETT: How thoroughly we lost. The first victims, Darren and Evelyn Mountjoy.

(SCULLY is holding the clipping in her hands.)

SCULLY: Chosen from the phone book. For what reason?

DOGGETT: No reason. Other than their names.

(DOGGETT underlines the letters DAE on the blackboard.)

SCULLY: And the third victim?

DOGGETT: The doctor. Monique Sampson. (DOGGETT underlines the letters MONI on the blackboard.) And the last. The man whose body is at the bottom of that river.

(We see a body being lifted from the water using a crane and a stretcher.)

SCULLY: (Moving closer) It's not Kobold.

DOGGETT: The guard we assigned to him. The guard he knew he'd have when we transferred him.)

SCULLY: Custer.

DOGGETT: Checkmate.

(The three agents stand in silence, comprehending DOGGETT's proposed MO. DOGGETT leaves the auditorium via the stairs.)

SCULLY: Something still bothering you, Agent Reyes? You don't believe this explanation?

(REYES looks troubled.)

REYES: It all makes sense to me as far as it goes. But there's something else, something he's afraid to explain.

SCULLY: You mean that you felt the presence of evil?

REYES: No, I mean that he felt it, too.

(SCULLY thinks about this.

CUT TO:

(The screen dissolves to clouds moving at speed across the sky. The demonic voices are heard once again.)

[THE END]



                                4-D



SCENE 1

(A man, ERWIN LUKESH, pauses momentarily in front of a mirrored glass door, before entering his apartment building. Once in the foyer, he picks up a newspaper, the DC Weekly, and glances at the front page. We notice REYES, kneeling behind him attending to the rear derailleur of her racing bike. She notices him and looks up.)

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT and FOLLMER are watching the foyer on a monitor screen. We see they are monitoring LUKESH. We see a curved mirror mounted on a wall, the type used to see other people approaching from around a corner. LUKESH looks up at it.)

DOGGETT: He's looking right at us. Fifty bucks says it's Lukesh and he knows we're here. Does it look like him to you?

(LUKESH looks over towards REYES, who has her back to him.)

FOLLMER: Let him get to the mailbox.

DOGGETT: It's Lukesh. I don't need him opening his mailbox to prove it.

FOLLMER: Patience, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: We have an agent alone with a sicko who cutting out women's tongues, a guy known for his vanishing act.

FOLLMER: We've got the block surrounded. He isn't vanishing anywhere. And your partner volunteered. Now, open the 4-D.

(FOLLMER picks up his walkie-talkie and contacts REYES, who is still attending to her bike.)

FOLLMER: Agent Reyes, stand by.

(LUKESH, standing in front off a bank of storage lockers, suddenly walks off.)

DOGGETT: What the hell is this?

(REYES puts down her tools and takes out her handgun, following LUKESH.)

DOGGETT: Monica, don't.

FOLLMER: Agent Reyes - keep your distance. Don't let him see you following.

(We see REYES on the monitor briefly, her gun ready, until she slowly moves out of the frame in pursuit of LUKESH.)

(REYES is now following LUKESH around the gloomy corridors of the apartment building. A door closes ahead of her and she investigates. She opens the door and enters.)

DOGGETT: Monica, where are you?

REYES: In a stairwell. I lost sight of him. I think he might be (LUKESH suddenly appears and smacks REYES' gun from her hands. She screams.)

REYES: AGHHH!

(DOGGETT and FOLLMER burst out of the back doors of a white van parked on the side of the street. They are both wearing blue FBI jackets. They run into the apartment block. They race through the lobby towards the stairwell. They enter cautiously and find REYES lying slumped against the stairs, her mouth bloodied.)

FOLLMER: Agent down, back stairwell, get EMS here now!

(REYES is still, her eyes open. FOLLMER is holding her. He shouts to DOGGETT, who is now outside the building.)

FOLLMER: Doggett! He's got her gun!

(DOGGETT is at the side of the building, and spots LUKESH walking away in the distance, slowly.)

DOGGETT: Erwin Lukesh! Federal Agent! Turn around, you son of a bitch.

(LUKESH stops, and turns around slowly to face DOGGETT. His hands are covered in blood. We hear police sirens at the roadside and DOGGETT turns his head briefly to motion them to where LUKESH is. Two cars park at the entrance to the dead-end, blocking it off.)

DOGGETT: Back here!

(His head turned only momentarily, as soon as he turns back around to face LUKESH he finds him gone. The dead end street is entirely empty, LUKESH having nowhere to have hidden. DOGGETT, with his gun aimed in front of him, slowly moves down the street. Suddenly, we see LUKESH appear behind DOGGETT as the camera tracks forward. LUKESH, armed with REYES' gun, is aimed straight at DOGGETT's back. DOGGETT continues to check the street, unaware of LUKESH behind him. Suddenly he stops, and quickly turns around, intent on shooting LUKESH, whom he has now sensed standing behind him. LUKESH manages to get off the first shot.)

SCENE 2

(REYES' new apartment. She is unwrapping an antique looking metal framed mirror from some bubble-wrap material. She looks as though she has only just moved in. DOGGETT appears in the open doorway, knocking on the door to alert her. REYES turns around and sees him. To moves towards the door to welcome him in. He's carrying a parcel in his hand.)

REYES: Hey!

DOGGETT: So, this is how the uptown crowd lives, huh?

REYES: This is it!

DOGGETT: So have you got anything really heavy that I can move for you, a dresser, a fridge.

REYES: No, but thank you, John, you just missed movers.

DOGGETT: You don't say?!

DOGGETT: I brought you a housewarming gift.

(DOGGETT gives her the parcel. She unwraps it straight away. A white bag. She smells inside it.)

REYES: Hot dogs?

DOGGETT: Polish sausage! It's the best in the city, there is a . You'll be able to walk to it.

REYES: Wow.

DOGGETT: Try one.

(She takes a hotdog from the bag and smells it again. DOGGETT is already eating his.)

REYES: Mmmm. I'm back in Gdansk.

(DOGGETT has managed to get some ketchup around his mouth. REYES extends her arm and wipes it from his mouth with her finger. They share "a moment". DOGGETT is frozen. REYES says nothings, and moves away again.)

REYES: Let me get some plates.

DOGGETT: Plates? For crying out loud... who eats Polish sausage with plates?

(REYES' cell phone rings as she is sorting out some plates on the kitchen counter. She answers.)

REYES: (on phone) Hello?

SKINNER: (on phone) Agent Reyes, it's AD Skinner.

REYES: (on phone) Yes, sir?

CUT TO:

(SKINNER is standing in the street from the opening scene, talking to REYES on his cell phone.

SKINNER: There's no easy way to say this, I'm sorry to do it on the phone.

REYES: What is it?

SKINNER: It's Doggett. He's been found in an alley off Dillon Park. He's been shot.

(We see three men lift a gurney from the ground, somebody lying motionless on it.

REYES: (Disbelieving) I'm sorry, what did you say?

SKINNER: They're taking him in the Washington Memorial. Agent?

REYES: Sir, what you're saying is ...

(REYES notices her apartment is empty. DOGGETT is nowhere to be seen. REYES turns her head in disbelief, looking for her partner. SKINNER checks to see if she is still there.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Agent Reyes? Agent Reyes?

CUT TO:

(A lift opens. REYES gets out. We see we are at the hospital. AD BRAD FOLLMER walks up the corridor to meet REYES, who is enquiring with a desk clerk.)

REYES: (To desk clerk) Excuse me?

(FOLLMER walks up to REYES.)

FOLLMER: Monica?

(REYES and FOLLMER slowly walk off down the corridor.)

REYES: Brad? Skinner called you, too?

FOLLMER: He's staying at the crime scene. I'm sorry. I've been put in charge of this investigation. I promise you, it's my top priority. I will find a person who did this. I just need to find out why your partner was in that alley this morning.

REYES: He wasn't. (Smiling, sure of herself.) He was with me, at my apartment. He was with me when Skinner called me.

FOLLMER: (Confused) I'm not sure I'm following.

(REYES starts to look puzzled. She walks off and bumps into SCULLY.)

SCULLY: Monica, I'm so sorry. Agent Doggett is just coming out of surgery and they're moving him to the ICU.

FOLLMER: How's it look?

SCULLY: If he pulls through this, it's likely that he'll be paralysed for life.

REYES: I haven't understood one single word I've heard since I got here. Whoever you're talking about, it's not John Doggett.



SCENE 3

(The door of a hospital room opens. We see a medical monitor working away as SCULLY, REYES and FOLLMER enter. REYES looks over the bed, her silence revealing her shock. We see DOGGETT lying on the bed, his neck in a cervical collar to keep it perfectly still. He is unconscious. REYES places her hand over his. She looks very sad. She opens her mouth to say something but can't. FOLLMER and SCULLY, standing behind her, also share her sadness.)



SCENE 4
FBI BALLISTICS LAB
WASHINGTON, D.C.

FOLLMER: You have found the bullet?

SKINNER: 9mm slug. Found it in the alley lodged in the wall. Most likely from the Sig Sauer P226 or 228.

FOLLMER: Possibly FBI issue.

SKINNER: I don't know what you're thinking but this didn't come from Doggett's weapon. Ballistics don't match and his gun was never fired.

FOLLMER: Assistant Director. (FOLLMER beckons SKINNER over toward him.) I'd appreciate case updates in a timely fashion. For instance, this bullet... how long have you have it? An hour? Two?

SKINNER: Thereabouts.

FOLLMER: It just we need to keep the lines of communication open, that's all I'm asking. I want this slug run through our database of FBI-issued pistols.

SKINNER: Like I told you the round didn't come from Doggett's weapon. (FOLLMER looks at him) You're not saying another agent could have done this.

FOLLMER: Just run it, please.



SCENE 5

(Outside DOGGETT's hospital room. We see REYES' face reflected in the glass. SCULLY walks up and stands next to her. They are both in through the windows at DOGGETT.)

REYES: I just... I don't understand how any of this is possible. He was with me, Dana, in my apartment. How can this be?

SCULLY: I saw something once. It's only been the last couple of years that I've... fully come to terms with it. In '94 my father passed away... and that night... at the very moment that it happened he came to me. I like to believe that he came to say goodbye.

REYES: (Sincerely) A visitation. I think that's wonderful. A blessing. But that's not what happened to me.

(SCULLY's cell phone rings, interrupting them.)

SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.

(SKINNER is driving, talking through a hands-free phone.)

SKINNER: (on phone) It's me, is Reyes with you?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, she's here, we're both at the hospital.

SKINNER: (on phone) I need you to bring her to Sixth District Police Station. I'm on my way there myself.

SCULLY: (on phone) What's this about?

SKINNER: (on phone) I'll tell you when you get there.

(SCULLY looks over at REYES.)



SCENE 6
METRO POLICE, SIXTH DISTRICT
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(SCULLY and REYES are walking through the station. They meet up with SKINNER.)

REYES: What's going on?

SKINNER: Agent Reyes, wouldn't you mind stepping inside, please?

(REYES looks at SCULLY before entering the room they are standing in front of. FOLLMER is waiting for her inside.)

FOLLMER: Hi, Monica. Have a seat.

(REYES walks around a table and sits in a chair. The room is illuminated by a harsh light hanging over the table.)

FOLLMER: I wanted you and I to have a chance to talk alone to clear a few things up. A few details of your story.

REYES: My story?

FOLLMER: Well, your so certain that you were with Agent Doggett when he was shot?

(SCULLY is watching and listening in from an adjoining room with SKINNER.)

SCULLY: What is this?

SKINNER: Just wait.

FOLLMER: Is that a true statement?

REYES: Yes. Uh-ah, I mean, no, I wasn't with Agent Doggett when he was shot, but I was with him at the time AD Skinner called to tell me he'd been shot.

FOLLMER: Look, Monica, you know how I feel. You know I'm on your side, but give me something here. Give me some... meaning... reason for what you're trying to cover up.

SCULLY: I'm going to put a stop to this.

REYES: What are you saying to me, Brad? Why are you saying these things?

FOLLMER: The results of the ballistics test. A bullet that hit Doggett came from your gun. (REYES looks shocked. Behind the one-way mirror, SCULLT also looks up in surprise.) And furthermore we have an eyewitness... one who has placed you at the scene.

REYES: Is that why I'm here? In this room? So you can make an ID?

FOLLMER: Agent Reyes ...

(REYES gets up from her chair and paces towards the one-way glass.)

FOLLMER: I'm going to have to ask you for your FBI identification.

REYES: Who's there? Who's back there?

(We see SKINNER and SCULLY behind the glass. We see another police officer, thanking an eyewitness for his help in the identification of REYES.)

POLICE OFFICER: We appreciate your cooperation, sir.

(The camera pans over the eyewitness. We see that it is ERWIN LUKESH.)

LUKESH: Anything I can do to help.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 7

(DOGGETT's hospital room. REYES is holding her hands over his again. She looks exhausted and pale. DOGGETT is still unconscious in his neck collar. SCULLY and SKINNER enter the room. We see a suited man outside in the doorway.)

REYES: Smart touch. Posting a guard making sure I don't finish the job.

REYES: Do you really believe I did this?

SKINNER: No, but it doesn't matter what I believe. You may still be arrested.

REYES: So what are they waiting for?

SCULLY: Follmer's case has a couple potential holes.

SCULLY: For starters, there's the fact that when I called you, you were at home. Fourteen miles from the crime scene.

SCULLY: Plus there's the condition of your gun.

REYES: It hadn't been fired.

SCULLY: However, the bullet does match your gun. Perfectly.

REYES: Uh, it doesn't make any sense. None of it. What about the eyewitness? What can you tell me about him?

SKINNER: You know we can't discuss that.

SKINNER: Look...

(DOGGETT's fingers begin to twitch. His eyes open briefly.)

REYES: My God, John.

SKINNER: Is he conscious?

SCULLY: I don't know. It could just be a muscle spasm. It's not uncommon with this type of spinal injury.

(DOGGETT's fingers continue to twitch, but with regularity that SKINNER immediately notices.)

SKINNER: That's not a spasm. That's Morse code.

REYES: What'd he say?

SCULLY: (reading) Lukesh.

REYES: What? What does that mean?

(REYES notices this has changed SCULLY's demeanour. She wants answers.)



SCENE 8

(The apartment building lobby. Locker 4-D is being unlocked. We see LUKESH take out a handful of letters and junkmail.)

CUT TO:

(LUKESH enters an apartment. He puts the mail down on a table in the hallway just inside the door. A woman's voice calls out. She has a particularly whining voice.)

MOTHER: Who's there? Is somebody there? Erwin, is that you?

LUKESH: Who else would it be, Mama?

MOTHER: I thought maybe robbers ... My God, I thought something terrible had happened to you. You were gone so long.

LUKESH: I was gone 2 hours and 6 minutes (checking his watch) and back at noon, just like I told you.

MOTHER: I was so scared. Could you bring me a glass of that clemado with two squirts of Texas Tea and two icecubes. God I was all alone. And I heard the knob rattle. Somebody was rattling the knob. (LUKESH opens a drawer, revealing a handgun. He picks it up, holds it, spins it around his trigger finger, and then places it back in the drawer.) It was the robbers. I just know it was. I don't know how I got through it. I was so scared.

(LUKESH picks up the drink and takes it through to the lounge. The TV is on. We see LUKESH's MOTHER, laying in a bed facing the TV. "Days of our lives" is on.)

MOTHER: That show is on. Could you make me my hot sandwich so that I could eat my sandwich while I watch my show?

(LUKESH goes to the kitchen and opens the refrigerator.)

MOTHER: What kind of sandwich is it?

LUKESH: Potted meat.

MOTHER: I don't think I like that. Have I had it before?

LUKESH: Many times.

(LUKESH holds up a clear plastic bag containing a severed human tongue. It looks quite fresh.)

LUKESH: (Transfixed by the tongue) You love it.



SCENE 9

(REYES tosses a roll into the bin. She looks as though she doesn't want to be there.)

REYES: We should be at the hospital.

(We see SKINNER is with her. They are in her new apartment.)

SKINNER: Scully will call if he regains consciousness.

REYES: Yeah, I should be there...

SKINNER: Agent, you're still under investigation. Not to mention I will be too if anyone finds out that I show you this.

(He holds a brown file out to REYES, looking away as he does so. REYES sits down and reads through the file.)

REYES: Erwin Timothy Lukesh?

SKINNER: Have you even seen him before?

REYES: (Reading from the file) 1995. Patient at the State Psychiatric Hospital at Gaitersburg. Diagnosed with a delusional disorder anger sub-type that presented itself shortly after the suicide death of his father.

SKINNER: After four months, he was deemed fit for release. He lives with his invalid mother in an apartment adjacent to the crime scene.

REYES: What's the story he's telling?

SKINNER: That he heard a bang, went downstairs to investigate, and that he saw you exit the alley.

REYES: This is the one person we know was in the vicinity at the time of shooting. Why would Doggett say his name?

SKINNER: You think Lukesh shot Doggett?

REYES: What if... Doggett was investigating Lukesh. What if... Lukesh is somehow behind all this ...

(SKINNER's cell phone rings.)

SKINNER: (on phone) Skinner.

(AD FOLLMER is standing in a hospital corridor.)

FOLLMER: (on phone) It's Follmer. You remember the discussion we had yesterday when I asked you to keep me up to date?

SKINNER: (on phone) I do ...

FOLLMER: (on phone) I'm at Washington Memorial. I'm assuming you're with our prime suspect? Bring her. She's going to talk to Agent Doggett.



SCENE 10

(The hospital. The lift doors open and REYES and SKINNER step out. AD FOLLMER is waiting for them, and SCULLY appears from another corridor.)

FOLLMER: Ah, the gang's all here.

REYES: How is he?

(They head off towards DOGGETT's room.)

SCULLY: Fully conscious. We set up a communication device designed for spinal injuries ............

FOLLMER: Just so we're clear, we ask only the questions I want asked. You're not to try and shade his testimony in any way.

SKINNER: If you're so concerned, why let Reyes talk to him in the first place?

FOLLMER: Because he says he won't talk to anyone but you.

(They arrive at the room. REYES enters. FOLLMER stops outside with SKINNER and SCULLY.)

FOLLMER: He didn't mention you two.

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT's bedside. There is a monitor at the end of the bed. REYES enters and walks over towards DOGGETT. She gently strokes his face with the back of her hand

REYES: John. Hey there.

(We see one of DOGGETT's fingers is attached to a morse button, which is connected to a laptop. It interprets his finger presses and display the letters on the screen. His fingers twitch and the screen is updated.)

DOGGETT: (On monitor screen) ALIVE>.

REYES: That's right. You're alive. As if there were ever any doubt.

DOGGETT: (On monitor screen) NO YOU HOW OK>.

REYES: Why I'm alive? Is that what you're asking? I'm fine, John. Why wouldn't I be?

FOLLMER: Have him say who shot him.

DOGGETT: (taps) YOU... (REYES looks at DOGGETT, shocked. There's a long pause before DOGGETT continues) YOUR THROAT CUT.

REYES: My throat wasn't cut, John, what do you mean?

DOGGETT: (taps) LUKESH KILLED YOU. TRIED KILL ME.

(REYES and FOLLMER look at DOGGETT. His eyes open slightly.)



SCENE 11

(Night. LUKESH is lying on his mother's bed. He checks to see that she is asleep. LUKESH carefully gets off the bed to try and leave without waking her. As he leaves the room, her eyes open.)

CUT TO:

(Night. LUKESH is in the alleyway where DOGGETT was shot. He is holding a cut-throat razor in his hand. He walks down the alley towards the dead-end. Suddenly, he completely disappears into thin air. The alley is empty.)



SCENE 12

(Day. DOGGETT's room. A DOCTOR is probing DOGGETT's chest for sensation with a long needle.)

DOCTOR: We're going to see if you feel anything. Any sensation at all. (The DOCTOR carefully presses the needle against his skin around his chest.) Okay, that's enough for today. We'll see if you can feel any better tomorrow.

(DOGGETT taps away on his morse button.)

DOGGETT: (On screen) 1ST TIME EVER HOPED FOR A LITTLE PRICK>

(REYES can't help but smile.)

REYES: You kiss your mother with that mouth?

(DOGGETT's eyes are open and he looks up at REYES.)

DOGGETT: (On screen) HOWS CASE?

REYES: It's coming along. (He eyes her) It's nowhere, basically. There's so much that's impossible to reconcile. You say I was on the stakeout with you, I say you were at my apartment bringing me...

(REYES pauses, an idea forming in her mind.)

REYES: John, do you know a little stand on M Street? Supposed to be really good hot dogs?

DOGGETT: (On screen) POLISH SAUSAGE. BEST IN CITY>

REYES: John, what if we were both right? What if you were at my apartment, and I was on a stakeout with you at the exact same time. W-what would it take for that to be true?

DOGGETT: (On screen) WE BOTH HAD TWINS WHICH WE DONT>

REYES: Except maybe we do. Maybe all of us do. You've heard of the idea of a parallel universe? One that's identical, or nearly identical, to our own. One in which we all have a double. It's theoretical physics but... what if it's real?

DOGGETT: (On screen) TOO MUCH STAR TREK>

REYES: You said yourself Erwin Lukesh was known for his impossible escapes. You said that in the alley you looked away only for an instant and he was gone. (DOGGETT's mind goes back to the alley just before he was shot.) And then, somehow, he was behind you. And he shot you. With my gun. My gun, that never left my possession that entire afternoon. What if Lukesh can pass freely from one parallel world to the other? Like... like he's opening a door. And what if somehow you followed him through that door. (We see DOGGETT in the alleyway, disappearing into thin air.) Without even knowing it. Maybe when you followed Lukesh into this world, my - my Doggett got forced out.

DOGGETT: (On screen) WOW>

REYES: My Doggett would have called that crazy, too... but give me another theory that fits.



SCENE 13

(Police Station interview room. SKINNER and FOLLMER are talking to LUKESH.)

LUKESH: I'm kind of confused as to why I'm back. I already told you everything I know.

FOLLMER: We just had a few... inconsistencies that we need to clear up.

LUKESH: Sure. Dot the I's, cross the T's

SKINNER: Yeah, here's an odd one, for starters. We have an eyewitness that says you shot Agent John Doggett.

LUKESH: (Surprised) That's surprising I can't imagine who would have said that.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett. Yeah, he's regained consciousness. He's very chatty. Among other things, he says that you're a murderer, that you enjoy killing women with a straight razor. And cutting out their tongues.

LUKESH: Yeah. Wow. (Laughs) What a corker.

FOLLMER: Mr. Lukesh, would you consent to a GSR test?

LUKESH: GSR? What is that?

FOLLMER: It can reveal whether or not someone recently fired a gun. You wouldn't mind indulging us, would you?

LUKESH: I don't know. I think I ought to talk to my lawyer about that. Look, my heart goes out to your Agent Doggett. But he's confused. It's clear to me that your female agent, Miss Reyes, is responsible for this terrible tragedy.

FOLLMER: Is there someone who can corroborate your story?

LUKESH: (Smiling) No.

SKINNER: How about your mother? I mean, you live with your mother right?

LUKESH: She was sleeping, she wouldn't have heard anything.

SKINNER: Well, still, maybe she can tell us something. Would she be willing to come down here and talk to us?

LUKESH: My mother is in poor health. She gets confused easily.

SKINNER: Oh, we can go to her

LUKESH: I won't have you harassing her just because you're afraid to admit that one of your people did this! (Threatening SKINNER and FOLLMER) If you're going to arrest me, do it. Otherwise, I'm going home.

SKINNER: (As LUKESH leaves) Say hi to mama.

(LUKESH leaves. We see REYES walking through the police station. She bumps into LUKESH. He stops and walks back up to her.)

LUKESH: Agent Reyes, right? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

REYES: How do you do it? You know what I'm talking about, don't you? There's this world, and there's the world where you live out your sick fantasies. When did it start? After your breakdown in 1995? All that anger, it's buttoned up so tight, it had nowhere else to go. It had to get released. Not here. But in a world just like this one.

LUKESH: (He leans forwards so that his face is only inches from her. He inhales, smelling her.) God, I enjoyed it. You bled just like a pig. (He walks away.)

(REYES looks shocked. SKINNER exits the interview room behind her.)

SKINNER: Reyes?

(LUKESH turns around once more before leaving to look back towards REYES. FOLLMER joins SKINNER in the hallway.)

FOLLMER: You all right?



SCENE 14

(LUKESH's apartment. He takes a drink from the refrigerator. He holds it to his forehead.)

LUKESH: Mama, I'm home. (No reply) Mama, you want your clemato?

(He walks over to the drawer where he's hiding REYES' gun. He opens the drawer to find it gone.)

LUKESH: Mama. Have you been out of bed? Mama?

(LUKESH looks worried. He walks to the bedroom, to find REYES gun out on a table.)

MOTHER: You don't tell me things, Erwin.

LUKESH: I tell you things.

MOTHER: You sneak out of house in night. You leave me alone all by myself. And then you think that I don't know but I know. I know every time. What is it that you do, Erwin, that you don't tell me?

LUKESH: I don't... I don't do you that. I don't know what you mean.

MOTHER: Why is this gun in my house? I opened the drawer. I don't even know how I even picked it up without it going off and killing me. I was so scared.

(She sobs. She wipes her tears away with a tissue.)

LUKESH: Mama ...

MOTHER: If you won't tell me, you will tell the FBI, that's it. Agents at the FBI have left three messages. (The message lights on the answerphone is blinking.) They want to talk to me? Can you imagine, Erwin, why would the FBI want to talk to me?

MOTHER: What are you doing? Aren't you even going to listen?

LUKESH: You're going to talk to them?

MOTHER: Well, of course I am, it's the FBI!

LUKESH: Mama.

(LUKESH starts sobbing.)

MOTHER: Don't turn on the waterworks, Mister, it's not going to wash. I'm the one who's been lied to.

(We takes out the cut-throat razor he had earlier. He wipes his eyes with his hand.)

MOTHER: Erwin. What are you doing?

(He moves towards her. She looks very scared.)

MOTHER: Erwin. What are you doing? Erwin. No...

(LUKESH stops over her bed and stabs her three times with the razor.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 15

(DOGGETT's hospital room. REYES is wet shaving him, carefully. She puts it down, finished.)

DOGGETT: (On screen) MISSED A SPOT>

REYES: (Smiling) Did not. Anyway, that's what you get for hiring cheap help.

DOGGETT: (On screen) BEEN THINKING>

REYES: Thinking about what?

DOGGETT: (On screen) SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT THINK YOURE RIGHT. 2 DOGGETTS CANT BE IN 1 WORLD. U CAN FIX>

REYES: How?

DOGGETT: (On screen) PULL THE PLUG.

(He looks up at REYES.)

REYES: Bad joke.

DOGGETT: (On screen) I GO YOUR DOGGETT COMES BACK. CMON YOUR THEORY SOUND>

REYES: My theory is sound? You don't believe a word of it, John, not in a million years would you believe. It has nothing to do with my theory.

DOGGETT: (On screen) DO U BELIEVE?>

(She nods.)

DOGGETT: (On screen) PROVE IT>

REYES: I would do anything for you. Anything but that.

(DOGGETT lies there, looking up at her. Her cell phone rings.)

REYES: (on phone) Reyes.

SKINNER: (on phone) It's Skinner, are you okay?

REYES: (on phone) Yes, sir, I'm fine.

SKINNER: (on phone) I can't say the same for Marion Lukesh.

REYES: (on phone) What happened?

SKINNER: (on phone) She's dead. It's the exact M.O. Doggett described. It looks like a straight razor was used.

REYES: (to DOGGETT) Lukesh killed his mother. (on phone) Do you have any idea where he is?

SKINNER: (on phone) No. But if everything I've heard is true, he's not going to be easy to find.

REYES: (on phone) I think he'll find us.



SCENE 16
67 BENNETT AVE.
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Night. Outside in the street. A dog is barking. Inside REYES is walking around her apartment slowly, checking to make sure things are as she left them. She draws her gun as she checks a room. Suddenly we hear SCULLY's voice over a radio.)

SCULLY: You all right, Agent Reyes?

REYES: Just a little jumpy, I guess.

SCULLY: It's understandable

FOLLMER: Try and take it easy, Monica. We got you covered, coming and going.

REYES: Anything happening out front?

SKINNER: No, you moved to a quiet neighbourhood. It's dead out there.

REYES: I think I'll check around once more.

(REYES is checking around her dimly lit apartment. She sees an empty bottle and a small box on the floor, which she stops to pick up. FOLLMER and SCULLY are watching her on a surveillance monitor. She passes a doorway and suddenly, she is grabbed around the neck from behind by LUKESH, who holds a razor to her throat. He pulls her back towards him so he is whispering into her ear. He notices her earpiece of pulls out her radio transmitter.)

LUKESH: You want to scream right now, don't you?

REYES: Lukesh. (He holds the razor at her throat.)

LUKESH: Parked in a van outside was the FBI. Try and scream out 'em. They can't hear you.

CUT TO:

(SCULLY is checking the monitors. There is no sign of REYES in the apartment.)

SCULLY: Where's she gone?

FOLLMER: Monica, do you copy?

SKINNER: Reyes, Agent Reyes, do you read me?

SCULLY: He's in there. He's got to be.

FOLLMER: That's not possible.

SCULLY: And what if it is? Want to stick around to find out?

CUT BACK TO:

(LUKESH starts to break down. He is still holding REYES against him.)

LUKESH: You ruined everything, you bitch. You made me! You made me do it.

REYES: Lukesh.

LUKESH: Shut up! Shut up! But you know what? This time, I get to bleed you slow.

(LUKESH looks down at REYES' neck. Suddenly an FBI MARKSMEN burst through the door, and within a second has shot LUKESH in the centre of the forehead. LUKESH falls to the ground, leaving REYES standing. FOLLMER, SCULLY and SKINNER race in to the apartment. FOLLMER goes to comfort her.)

FOLLMER: You all right? Monica, you all right? It's okay. It's okay. It's over.

(REYES looks shaken up. She knows what she has to do to end it.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 17

(DOGGETT's hospital room. DOGGETT is sleeping as REYES enters. She closes the door quietly behind her and locks it. She walks over to his bed. DOGGETT looks up at her. She takes his hand in hers, and strokes it. She turns off the monitor behind him, and switches off the respirator. The machine becomes silent. Tears well up in her eyes. She lays DOGGETT's hand back down on the bed. REYES closes her eyes.)



SCENE 18

(REYES opens her eyes. She is back in her apartment.)

DOGGETT: Monica, forget about the plates, will you?

(She opens here eyes. She looks up at DOGGETT in shock. DOGGETT looks confused.)

DOGGETT: What's wrong?

(REYES smiles. She walks up to DOGGETT and puts her arms around him. She hugs him tight, her chin resting on his shoulder. She looks happy.)

DOGGETT: Monica, what's wrong?

REYES: I'm good. Good.

(REYES smiles, her tears of happiness streaming down her face.)

[Fade to black]

[THE END]

(Before the credits roll, a special memorial was shown on the screen.)

In Loving Memory Of

RICKY LOYD ARREGUIN

January 24, 1985 - September 13, 2001

                                       LORD OF THE FLIES



SCENE 1

(An unknown H.S. Baseball Field.)

(Hand-held video cameras where the video feed is shaky at best. Wild Whooping off to the side. A young high school teenager comes into view. He's the one whooping.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Yeah, dudes! Welcome to your Dumb Ass Show! I am Sky Commander Winky and this is the beautiful Captain Dare!

(A second high school teenager comes into view. Both kids are very in the camera's face. They seem to be close friends.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Yeah, baby! Woo-hoo!

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: The biggest Dumb Ass I know.

(SKY COMMANDER WINKY hands CAPTAIN DARE the football helmet.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Thank you, Sky Commander.

(CAPTAIN DARE puts the football helmet on.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Yes, Captain Dare will show you what a dumb ass he really is. But be forewarned, only a stupid dumb ass would neglect to take every safety precaution in the stunts you're about to witness. C'mon!

(CAPTAIN DARE hits the helmet into place and lets out a grunt. The two boys run several steps nearby. The camera is still on SKY COMMANDER WINKY as he picks up a baseball and stops in front what looks like a baseball pitching machine. CAPTAIN DARE runs out of view of the camera.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Now, the physics alone took almost five minutes of calculations. (The machine pitches. With barely a glance at the ball, SKY COMMANDER WINKY is happy with the trajectory.) Oh, oh... yes! (He gives the camera a thumb's up.)

(CAPTAIN DARE is standing at home plate. His arms and feet spread wide, a sure target for the speeding baseball. A small crowd of onlookers stand behind the fence behind him. CAPTAIN DARE prepares himself.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Yeah, dude, fire when ready.

(The machine fires and the baseball hits him square in the groin. CAPTAIN DARE falls to the ground in pain.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Aah, mother( bleep )! What the ( bleep )!

(SKY COMMANDER WINKY joins his buddy on the ground. He's pleased and stoked at the success of the project. CAPTAIN DARE is still on the ground doubled over and groaning in pain.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Now that's a dumb ass! Oh, right in the ( bleep ) target!



SCENE 2

(An unknown empty road.)

(CAPTAIN DARE is sitting in something big, something plastic and something blue. His football helmet fit snugly on his head.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Hey, Natalie, come here. How about a kiss for good luck?

(NATALIE stands off to the side. She is not happy, her arms crossed in front of her.)

NATALIE GORDON: Bill, why are you doing this?

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: His name's Captain Dare and he'll be famous one day for going where no dudes have gone before.

(CAPTAIN DARE is sitting in a port-a-potty. The door is still open.)

CAPTAIN DARE: Hey, if you won't give me a kiss how about throwing me a magazine?

(The crowd laughs. SKY COMMANDER WINKY closes the door to the port-a-pottie. Someone in the crowd playfully retches. A blue car accelerates. As it moves down the road, a rope tied to the port-a-pottie pulls it along behind it. The crowd cheers and runs after it. The port-a-pottie stays upright for about 2 seconds before it tilts over onto its side, down the side of the road and over onto itself. SKY COMMANDER WINKY exits the car, cheering.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Yeah! Yeah! Oh, yeah!

(SKY COMMANDER WINKY runs straight in front of the hand-held video camera. He points down to the tilted port-a-pottie.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Hey, hey ... that ... that is it! Whoo! There it is!

(CAPTAIN DARE emerges from the port-a-pottie.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: There it is, yes! That is a dumb ass! That is a dumb ass!

(He runs straight toward SKY COMMANDER WINKY and the camera, his arms raised in victory. CAPTAIN DARE is soaked. CAPTAIN DARE and SKY COMMANDER WINKY run toward each other as if to embrace, but SKY COMMANDER WINKY gets out of CAPTAIN DARE's way. CAPTAIN DARE runs straight into the unsuspecting crowd. The crowd disburses and CAPTAIN DARE runs straight for NATALIE. NATALIE runs away. Everyone in the crowd, except for one, cheers and whoops their encouragement to CAPTAIN DARE.)

SCENE #3: "CART OF DOOM"

(SKY COMMANDER WINKY pushes a shopping cart uphill and speaks to the hand-held video camera.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: ... and now, the awesome Captain Dare will make dumb ass history in the scientifically-modified shopping cart of doom --- rolling down this hill hitting the launch ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour sailing just over the scrumptious Natalie Gordon who will be holding this flaming torch in her mouth.

(NATALIE is talking with CAPTAIN DARE on the side when she hears SKY COMMANDER WINKY's words. She pulls away from CAPTAIN DARE to interrupt SKY COMMANDER WINKY.)

NATALIE GORDON: Whoa, I didn't say I was going to do anything.

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: What? I is the money shot, Natalie. We need you. Captain, will you tell her?

CAPTAIN DARE (BILL): Yeah, come on, Natalie ... what could go wrong?

NATALIE GORDON: What could go wrong?! You mean besides landing on me and crushing my head, Bill? (NATALIE pushes the video camera away from her face.) Would you...?

(The camera focuses on SKY COMMANDER WINKY.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY (whispering): It'll be killer. The Captain will jump her, her torch will set the cart on fire-- whoosh-- and our daring hero rolling on to salvation into the pool of life. Triumphant.

(The camera moves to focus on the little plastic kiddie blow-up swimming pool set up a few feet past the ramp.)

CAPTAIN DARE (BILL): Natalie, come on, just do it for me, please? Please? Please?

THE CROWD: Yeah, come on, Natalie.

CAPTAIN DARE (BILL): Come on.

(Everyone on the Crowd, except for one, goads Natalie into doing the stunt.)

(The hand-held video camera cuts to show us NATALIE lying down on the asphalt and a kid lighting a sparkler held in her mouth. From beyond the ramp, CAPTAIN DARE sits in the shopping cart of doom with SKY COMMANDER WINKY by his side.

SKY COMMANDER WINKY (from the distance): You're going to freaking fly man! This is going to be spectacular! (SKY COMMANDER WINKY hands CAPTAIN DARE his football helmet and CAPTAIN DARE puts it on.) Okay, you can do this! You are the man! Go and act Dumb Ass. (He gives CAPTAIN DARE an encouraging slap on the back.)

CAPTAIN DARE (from the distance): I'm the man! I'm the man!

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Captain Dumb Ass !

(SKY COMMANDER WINKY pushes the cart forward. CAPTAIN DARE in the cart begins its descent down the hill. CAPTAIN DARE and SKY COMMANDER WINKY are both yelling. The crowd cheers. CAPTAIN DARE clutches his helmet and yells. The cart veers off course. CAPTAIN DARE is still clutching his helmet and screaming. The cart crashes on the side of the road, tilts over and CAPTAIN DARE spills out of the cart. He rolls a few feet down the hill. He is not moving. The crowd cheers.)

(NATALIE gets up and rushes over to the unmoving CAPTAIN DARE. NATALIE rolls him over. SKY COMMANDER WINKY saunters to the front of the hand-held video camera.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Now that's a dumb ass.

(He turns to his friend who is still unmoving on the ground.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY: Come on, Bill, get up! Hey, Bill!

(NATALIE is crying. SKY COMMANDER WINKY removes CAPTAIN DARE'S helmet. His head is deflated like a basketball. It's caved in. NATALIE's screaming now. The crowd is horrified and silent.)

SCENE 3
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S UNIT
OCEAN COUNTRY, NEW JERSEY

(Elevator bell dings and the doors open. DOGGETT and REYES emerge. DR. FOUNTAIN meets them in the hallway and walks with them to the autopsy room.)

DR. FOUNTAIN: Thanks for coming so quickly.

REYES: Are you the medical examiner?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Yes, yes, I'm Dr. Fountain. And you're the experts from the FBI?

DOGGETT: The experts?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well, I was told you were the experts.

REYES: We work on the X-Files. Our expertise is the unexplained.

DOGGETT: We were told you had an unexplained death here.

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well, you're the experts you tell me.

(They enter the room where the body is kept.)

DOGGETT: So why don't you explain exactly what happened here, doctor?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well, I can't. That's the point.

REYES: You can't tell us anything?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well, all things considered, I'd prefer not to go on record.

DOGGETT: Why is that?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well, it's the kid's parents. They're suing everyone.

REYES: For what?

DR. FOUNTAIN: Everything. They're suing the county for making the street too steep, the supermarket he stole the shopping cart from, the company that made the helmet he was wearing.

(DOGGETT and REYES look at each other. DOGGETT moves over to the covered body and removes the sheet. He and REYES look over the boy's deflated head.)

DOGGETT: Off the record, Doc ... what the hell has that got to do with a supermarket shopping cart?

DR. FOUNTAIN: You familiar with The Dumb Ass Show?

REYES: The Dumb Ass Show?

DR. FOUNTAIN: It's a cable TV show where the kids act like, well, dumb asses. They videotape themselves doing stupid stunts.

DOGGETT: You mean this was an accident?

DR. FOUNTAIN: I'd prefer not to get sucked into a legal nightmare here. You investigate the unexplained. How about you explain it to me?

(DOGGETT and REYES look at each other. REYES looks over at the body and notices movement behind the boy's closed eye lids.)

REYES: Dr. Fountain, do you see this?

DOGGETT: What the hell is that?

DR. FOUNTAIN: You're asking me?

(REYES picks up a pair of forceps from the tray next to her and prys the eyelid open. Flies emerge and engulf them.)



SCENE 4

(Medical Examiner'S Unit.)

(Elevator bell dings and the doors open. SCULLY walks out and is immediately flanked by both DOGGETT and REYES.)

DOGGETT: Thanks for coming so quickly.

SCULLY: The message said urgent. What is it you want me to look at here?

DOGGETT: We were hoping you could tell us.

(DR. FOUNTAIN joins the group.)

DR. FOUNTAIN: Is, uh, she the expert?



SCENE 5

(Autopsy Room.)

(SCULLY is looking at CAPTAIN DARE'S head. She puts the instrument she's holding aside and takes off her protective eyewear.)

DR. FOUNTAIN: Well? What do you think?

SCULLY: Well, I have to say that, uh... I've never seen anything quite like this before.

(DR. FOUNTAIN shakes his head, disappointed, and walks out of the room. They watch him leave.)

DOGGETT: Well, something killed this kid.

SCULLY: Well, judging from the amount of insect faeces in the ear and nasal cavities it appears that they fed at such a furious rate that it caused the boy's skull to collapse from the inside. His helmet protected his head during the there is no impact trauma here whatsoever. None.

REYES: You're saying flies killed him.

(SCULLY shrugs. She moves aside and removes her gloves and heads to her laptop.)

DOGGETT: All the kids at the scene ... and the flies choose to attack this boy? Why?

REYES: Maybe they were attracted for reasons we're not seeing.

DOGGETT: What if somebody put something in his helmet? Insect pheromone. You know, "Spanish Fly"--that stuff you see advertised in the back of magazines that guys use to attract girls. (REYES looks at DOGGETT.) I glance at them for amusement.

SCULLY: I may have to brush up on my "Spanish Fly" but I don't think the science works that way. Anyway, before we start looking for M.O., I want to find out what kind of fly would act that aggressively.

(From the doorway, a voice interrupts.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: The musca vetustissima walker. The Australian Bush Fly. It craves protein so much it will actually crawl into your open nose, mouth, ears even your eyes to feed on nutritious blood and moisture. Though the New Zealand screw-worm fly often kills its victims in mere moments by burrowing into an open wound or cut.

(SCULLY silently stares at him. He reaches over and grabs her hand and shakes it.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Rocky Bronzino. (He turns to DOGGETT.) Hi. Rocky Bronzino. (He turns to REYES.) Hello there. Rocky Bronzino, field entomological expert at Rutgers University, at your service.

SCULLY: Dr. Bronzino ...

ROCKY BRONZINO: Rocky.

SCULLY: These flies you mentioned neither of them are indigenous to North America. Are you suggesting that we've got a virulent foreign vector here?

(ROCKY BRONZINO holds up the bottle of flies.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: No. The specimens you collected are your garden-variety calliphorid. Harmless as, well... flies.

DOGGETT: What are you suggesting then?

ROCKY BRONZINO: Nothing. Dr. Fountain brought me in for my scientific expertise. And I must say ... (He turns to look directly at SCULLY.) I'm glad he did.

REYES: Dr. Bronzino, you should know we may be looking at a murder.

ROCKY BRONZINO: A murder? Are there any suspects?

(REYES walks over to him and picks up the bottle of flies. She hands it to him. He takes the bottle and looks at it with scepticism.)



SCENE 6
GARFIELD HIGH SCHOOL
MANAHAWKIN, NEW JERSEY

(NATALIE sits alone at a table picking at her lunch. Off to the side, a boy sits along at another table watching her. Someone passes near him and unintentionally hits him with his backpack. It's DAVID WINKLE aka SKY COMMANDER WINKY and his hand-held video cameraman in tow.)

DAVID WINKLE (to the camera): Natalie Gordon -- the lady in Captain Dare's short life and the last person to see him alive.

(DAVID WINKLE approaches NATALIE and stops by her table. She looks up at him angrily.)

NATALIE GORDON: Leave me alone, Winky.

DAVID WINKLE: It's for The Dumb Ass Memorial Video. For our fallen hero. Just a few words for Captain Dare, come on.

NATALIE GORDON (angry with grief): You want a few words, Winky? You're a jerk! And so is your brother for making Bill do all those stupid stunts.

DAVID WINKLE: Hey, Captain Dare died doing what he loved! (Behind him, the boy watching Natalie on the other table, stands up as if to intervene. Natalie notices him.) Pushing the envelope. Maybe if you weren't such a ...

(DAVID WINKLE sees the boy standing and stares at him. The boy backs down and sits back down. DAVID WINKLE and his cameraman brother approach the boy.)

DAVID WINKLE: Hey, you! Freaky-deaky. You want your own memorial, huh? You want to be in Dumb Ass?

(DAVID WINKLE pinks up a piece of someone's dessert.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Just leave her alone.

DAVID WINKLE: I'm talking to you now, freak.

(DAVID WINKLE smashes the dessert plate onto DYLAN LOKENSGARD'S head. He pushes DYLAN backwards and onto the floor. Others in the lunchroom laugh at the display.)

PRINCIPAL LOKENSGARD: David Winkle. In my office, right now!

DAVID WINKLE (to DYLAN): Typical. Lokensgard's going to have his mommy stick up for him. Baby.

(DAVID WINKLE makes his way to Principal Lokensgard. DYLAN watches as his mother signals that she wants to speak with him, too. DYLAN picks up his backpack, ignores his mother and walks away. He passes by NATALIE who wants to say something to him, but doesn't. She watches him leave.)



SCENE 7

(Principal Lokensgard's Office.)

(The hand-held video camera of the port-a-pottie train plays on the television set. The crowd is cheering. The car accelerates with the port-a-pottie in tow.)

(DOGGETT and REYES are watching the video. DOGGETT is amused by what he sees on the screen. REYES turns to watch DOGGETT. DOGGETT is holding the television remove and fast forwards to the port-a-pottie overturned on the side. SKY COMMANDER WINKIE is in the camera pointing at the overturned port-a-pottie and yelling "That is it! That is it! Whoo! There it is ! There it is! ... ")

DOGGETT: I think I just solved this case. This kid had crap for brains and the flies couldn't resist.

REYES: Oh, and you were such a choirboy growing up?

DOGGETT: I mean, we did some stupid stuff but we didn't know it was stupid at the time. This isn't just stupid, this is glorification of stupid. These kids take enormous pride in being sub-mental.

REYES (amused): That's why they call it Dumb Ass.

(On the video, the kids in the crowd are cheering. REYES notices that not all the kids are cheering. There is one who is not. The door to the office opens, Principal Lokensgard appears with DAVID WINKLE and introduces him to the agents.)

PRINCIPAL LOKENSGARD: Mr. David Winkle.

DOGGETT: Sky Pilot Winky. Just the man we want to see. Come on in.

[On the video in the background) Winky: ...Hitting the launch ramp at an estimated 24.6 miles an hour sailing over the scrumptious Natalie Gordon ... ]

(DAVID WINKLE enters the room and takes a seat. The agents remain standing. DAVID WINKLE looks back on Principal LOKENSGARD. She looks at him and leaves, closing the door behind her. DAVID WINKLE scratches his back.)

DOGGETT (indicating the video behind them): That's very entertaining, Sky Pilot.

DAVID WINKLE: Sky Commander, if you don't mind.

DOGGETT: And you can call me Sheriff John when I haul your dumb ass off to jail, Winky.

(DAVID WINKLE sits up in his chair. He scratches his back.)

DAVID WINKLE: What are you talking about?

REYES: We obtained a copy of a recent e-mail you sent offering to sell the video of your friend's death to the fox network.

DAVID WINKLE: What? No, no, no, I wrote all the networks. Fox was the only one who had any interest in it.

(DAVID WINKLE scratches his back.)

REYES: I don't think you understand.

DAVID WINKLE: Wait ... you think I killed him? You think I killed Captain Dare to make money? My best friend?

DOGGETT: Well, looking at this video you were the last person to have contact with him. You handed him his helmet at the top of the hill. I think you put something in it.

(DAVID WINKLE stands up, still scratching his back.

DOGGETT: Sit down, Sky Commander ...

DAVID WINKLE: I can't! I'm being attacked! Oh, god, it's happening to me!

(DAVID stands up and pulls his shirt off. DOGGETT and REYES notice the words "DUMB ASS" on his lower back.)

SKY COMMANDER WINKY (from the video): Now that's a dumb ass!



SCENE 8

(Lokensgard's Residence.)

(DYLAN LOKENSGARD comes home. His mother is waiting for him.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Where you been? Dinner's been on the table almost an hour, young man.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I'm not hungry.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Well, then, you sit down here until you get hungry, Dylan. I have something to talk to you about. Dylan!

(DYLAN goes into his bedroom, he shuts the door and takes off his jacket. He sits on his bed and turns the CD/radio on. PINK FLOYD music fills the room. DYLAN lies down on his bed. He picks up a class picture of NATALIE and looks at it.)

[PINK FLOYD MUSIC: It's no trying to place your hand where I can't see because I understand that you're different from me ]

(DYLAN'S MOTHER is knocking on his bedroom door.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Dylan?

(DYLAN ignores his mother and increases the volume of the music he's listening to so that he can't hear her.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Dylan?

[PINK FLOYD MUSIC: Yes, I can tell that you can't be ... ]

(More knocking on his bedroom door. DYLAN ignores his mother and shuts his eyes so that he might hide from his mother and from the world.)

[PINK FLOYD MUSIC: ...What you pretend ]

(DYLAN closes his eyes. The room around him grows darker. Bugs / insects congregate outside his window covering it so that no light can come in. The bugs cover the walls in his room. The wall around him is covered with ants. DYLAN continues to have his eyes tightly shut.)

[PINK FLOYD MUSIC: ... and you're rocking backwards and you're rocking towards .. ]



SCENE 9

(Medical Examiner'S Office.)

(SCULLY is examining the fly under a high-powered microscope. Behind her, the door opens. REYES and DOGGETT walk in.)

SCULLY: I'm glad you're here. I think we just got our first real break.

REYES: What did you find?

SCULLY: Well, it's what the entomologist Rocky Bronzino found. The flies that ate at the brain and skull of the victim are all female. Every last one of them.

DOGGETT: Exactly how is that a break?

SCULLY: Well, what are the chances of that?

REYES: You mean that the absence of males suggests there's a reason for the attack. Behaviourally.

SCULLY: Well, something biological is going on. Whether it's hormonal or chemical something has caused these bugs to attack.

DOGGETT: Or a need to express themselves.

SCULLY: To what?

DOGGETT: This is a kid that calls himself "Sky Commander Winky." Agent Reyes and I were interviewing him as a suspect when this happened.

(DOGGETT hands SCULLY a photograph of DAVID WINKLE's back. The words "DUMB ASS" clearly on his lower back.)

DOGGETT: The paramedics arrived and treated him for an aggressive attack of body lice.

SCULLY: Hmm. Lice are not altogether uncommon in a school environment.

DOGGETT: Except that these are better spellers than most of the kids.

SCULLY: So what are you saying? That this is just another dumb ass stunt?

REYES: Well, that was my first thought. But the victim here was just too freaked out by this incident to make me believe he'd staged this. Which leads me to think that while you may be right about this being a matter of biology, someone is directing the biology.

SCULLY: How does one direct bugs?

REYES: I don't know how but we've been running down a long list of witnesses.

(REYES hands SCULLY a series of photographs of the crowd on the video.)

REYES: A loner who was present at every dumb ass stunt and who had a run-in with this kid Winky at school just prior to the lice attacking. His name is Dylan Lokensgard. We're going to want to talk to him.



SCENE 10

(Lokensgard Residence.)

(DYLAN is looking at himself in the mirror. He has his hand around his jaw as if feeling for something. He clock hanging on his wall reads 7:25. DYLAN is thoughtful as he looks at himself in the mirror. The doorbell rings below. He's startled and leaves his room to get a look at who might be there. From the top of the stairs, DYLAN can see his mother speaking with someone who's standing just outside the door.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: It's just not a good time right now. He's unable to talk.

(MRS. LOKENSGARD closes the door and looks up just in time to see DYLAN leave the top of the staircase and retreat to his bedroom. From his bedroom window, DYLAN sees NATALIE leave the front walkway. His mother knocks on his bedroom door.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Dylan? Dylan, I want to have a talk with you. [Closed-caption adds the line: I saw you up here.]

(DYLAN grabs his jacket and heads for the window. He pushes the curtain aside.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Honey, can you come out here?

(DYLAN climbs out of the window and makes his way down the trellis.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Dylan? Dylan? Dylan!

(DYLAN jumps down to the ground outside as NATALIE drives away from his house. He turns nervously around thinking that his mother may have spotted him leaving. No one's there. He makes his way toward the street. His mother intercepts him before he leaves the front yard.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: where are you going?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: To school.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: I know where you're going.

(DYLAN looks down at his feet.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Well, what did Natalie want?

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: You stay away from her. Dylan, she's no good for you. She's only going to get you into trouble.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Natalie and I are friends. We've been friends since we were kids.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: But you're not kids anymore, Dylan. Which is why we need to talk, honey.

(DYLAN lets out a frustrated sigh.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: You're going through changes. Your body is going through changes.

(He pushes past her and gets his bike.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You don't understand anything. I don't want to talk to you. I wish dad was still here. You don't know anything about me.

(DYLAN rides off to school.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Honey, I want what's best for you. Dylan! Come back Dylan!



SCENE 11

(Middle of unknown street.)

(DR. ROCKY BRONZINO is looking out on the deserted street.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: So many flowers ... so little time.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

ROCKY BRONZINO: Pheromones, Dr. Scully. Heavy in the air. Nature's natural attractants. Driving the insect world to go forth and pollinate.

SCULLY: I'm aware of how pheromones work. But according to this device there isn't a single pheromone to be found out here.

ROCKY BRONZINO: Well, that can't be right. The bio-sensor we uses an actual fly antennae over which the pheromones pass. But I modified the EAG to measure in picograms which makes it sensitive to traces a mile in any direction. But I'm still not sure why you think that pheromones might cause an otherwise harmless fly to attack a human so violently, Doctor ...

ROCKY BRONZINO: Rocky.

SCULLY: Rocky.

ROCKY BRONZINO: Bugs are small-minded creatures, and therefore very predictable. They don't have moods, E. They react to circumstance and stimuli as they have been doing for millennia.

SCULLY: So what do you suppose they're reacting to out here?

ROCKY BRONZINO: It may be the bugs are being somehow driven crazy with desire. You know, they say we humans respond to pheromones, too.

SCULLY: Yeah, I tend to agree with that, yeah.

ROCKY BRONZINO: "Women's dormitory syndrome." It's believed that pheromones are the reason that women who live together share the same menstrual cycle.

SCULLY: Fascinating.

ROCKY BRONZINO: You know, when a male and female calliphorid fly mate they stay joined for up to one and a half hours. One and a half, doctor.

SCULLY: You know, Rocky ... I'm a mother.

ROCKY BRONZINO: Mothers are women, too.

(SCULLY takes a deep breath to respond, but is interrupted by the beeping of the pheromone bio-sensor.)

ROCKY BRONZINO (excited): Big hit!

SCULLY: What is it?

ROCKY BRONZINO: A high concentration of c-13 calliphorone ... (ROCKY BRONZINO looks up.) Incoming.

(SCULLY looks up. The beeping increases as DYLAN LOKENSGARD passes behind them on his bicycle. SCULLY and ROCKY BRONZINO are still looking up at the sky.)



SCENE 12

(School parking lot.)

(NATALIE parks her car and gets out.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Natalie!

(DYLAN rides his bike straight past NATALIE and into the bushes in front of her parked car.

NATALIE GORDON: Dylan?

(DYLAN emerges from the bushes. He heads for the school. NATALIE walks with him.)

NATALIE GORDON: Are you all right?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I'm fine.

NATALIE GORDON: What about your bike?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Um, I'll get it later.

NATALIE GORDON: I came by your house to see you.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Oh, really?

NATALIE GORDON: Yeah, your mom made it sound like there was something wrong with you.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Me? I'm fine. What-what did you want?

(NATALIE sighs.)

NATALIE GORDON: I wanted to apologize about what happened yesterday in the cafeteria. Winky can be such a jerk. I was just worried about you.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: W-w-what'd I say?

NATALIE GORDON: Nothing. No one understands. My mom and dad think it's just going to go away. What I'm feeling ...

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You-you mean about Bill?

(NATALIE nods.)

NATALIE GORDON: I wish I could just turn back time. I wish we could just ... make everything go away and start all over again.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I know. Like-like when we were kids.

NATALIE GORDON: Yeah. Remember the night we played hide-and-seek on your street?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Manhunt.

NATALIE GORDON: We hid in the tree together.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Our names are still carved in it.

( Awkward laugh. The bell rings.)

NATALIE GORDON: I'm-I'm going to get marked late.

(NATALIE walks lone back to class.)

REYES: Dylan Lokensgard? Can you come with us, Dylan?



SCENE 13

(Principal Lokensgard's Office.)

(The video is playing. DYLAN's watching the video. REYES offers DYLAN a tissue and he takes one, wiping the sweat off of his face.)

Winky (on video): Now the awesome Captain Dare will make dumb ass history in a scientifically-modified shopping cart of doom. Rolling down this hill...

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: why are you showing me this?

REYES: What do you think of it?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You mean, the dumb ass show?

DOGGETT: That, and the kids who make it.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I know them, you know...

REYES: you ever have contact with bill? The kid who played captain dare?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: No.

DOGGETT: You have anything against him?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: No.

REYES: Do you think it's strange that he was attacked and killed by insects?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Who wouldn't?

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: What's going on in here?

REYES: We're talking to Dylan.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Oh, no, you're not. Dylan...

DOGGETT: Ma'am...

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: No one interrogates my son in my office without my permission.

REYES: Just calm down, Mrs. Lokensgard.

(Flies buzz on the ceiling. They're amassing on the ceiling with every passing moment.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: He's not a part of that crowd. What are you accusing him of?

DOGGETT: We're not accusing him. Just trying to see what he knows.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: He doesn't know anything.

REYES: He was at the crime scene.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Yeah, well, so were a lot of kids. Dylan ...

(PRINCIPAL LOKENSGARD looks at DYLAN and stops mid-sentence. DOGGETT and REYES turn around to see DYLAN covered in flies.)



SCENE 14

(School parking lot.)

(DOGGETT walks out of the school. On his way out he passes men in decontamination or exterminating suits.)

DOGGETT: You're too late, gentlemen. Bugs are gone. Bugs are all gone. (No one's listening to him.) Whatever.

(Outside REYES is watching the EMTs check out DYLAN LOKENSGARD.)

DOGGETT: How's he doing?

REYES: He's unhurt, apparently. Not so much as a single bite on him.

(MRS. LOKENSGARD takes DYLAN from the EMT and urges him toward her car.)

DOGGETT: Mrs. Lokensgard? I don't think we've finished talking to Dylan.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Oh, yes, you have! We're going home.

(Before DYLAN gets into the car, DAVID WINKLE and his brother are standing off to the side glaring at him with accusation. DYLAN sees this and gets into the car. DOGGETT and REYES watch the car drive away.)

DOGGETT: I've said it before and I'll say it again: The whole reason this case is attracting flies is because somebody's full of crap.

REYES: I think what we just saw was a show. Dylan Lokensgard caused those bugs to attack him to make himself look like a victim instead of the perpetrator.

DOGGETT: Okay, but how? This guy's a horse whisperer, only for bugs?

REYES: I don't know how he's doing it but I may know a way to find out.

(REYES leaves DOGGETT.)



SCENE 15

(Elevator hallway.)

(Elevator bell dings. SCULLY emerges carrying a tissue in a metal container. She is flanked by both DOGGETT and REYES.)

SCULLY: Where did you get this?

DOGGETT: Dylan Lokensgard provided it to us when we interviewed him.

SCULLY: I have to warn you, there's typically not a lot to be found in a teenage boy's sweaty kleenex.

REYES: We were looking for pheromones. Aren't there pheromones produced in adolescent sweat?

SCULLY: Yes, it's what causes B.O., But all too obviously it's not all that attractive--to anything.



SCENE 16

(Medical Examiner'S Office.)

(ROCKY BRONZINO is in the office working on his laptop. His bio-sensor is emitting low steady beeps. When the agents walk in with the sample, the bio- sensor's beeps become progressively faster, the close the sample gets. ROCKY BRONZINO is excited by the development.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: I've got a reading here that's going right off the scale. Holy Toledo! We've got pheromones coming out the ying-yang here. C-13 calliphorene and how.

(The beeping continues becoming more rapid as the sample gets closer to the sensor. The beeping becomes a steady tone. Then it stops.)

DOGGETT: What happened?

ROCKY BRONZINO: I think my electroantennogram just... tilted.

REYES: What's c-13 calliphorone?

SCULLY: Insect pheromone.

ROCKY BRONZINO: Where did you find this mother lode?

REYES: A boy named Dylan Lokensgard. That specimen came from him.

ROCKY BRONZINO: A boy ... is secreting bug pheromones? That's impossible. Preposterous.

DOGGETT: You're the expert Dr. Bronzino. How else do you explain it, then?

SCULLY: Rocky?

ROCKY BRONZINO: A boy is a boy, a bug is a bug. You can't have it both ways.

(ROCKY BRONZINO doesn't have a theory. SCULLY takes a deep breath. They need to discuss this.)

SCULLY: Okay, so this boy's going through puberty, right? I mean, maybe his body chemistry is somehow just going crazy and it's his raging teenage hormones that are attracting all these insects.

REYES: What if it's more than chemistry and hormones? More than biology?

REYES: Dylan's not just attracting these bugs he's using them to act out.

SCULLY: Yes, but against what?

REYES: We saw him talking to a girl.

DOGGETT: The one in the dumb ass video. Captain dare's girlfriend.



SCENE 17

(Dylan's bedroom.)

(DYLAN is lying in bed. He's looking at a class picture of NATALIE GORDON. A PINK FLOYD rock ballad is playing in the background. Outside, we hear a Volkswagen engine chugging. DYLAN hears it too. He stashes the picture under his pillow and looks out his bedroom window to see NATALIE's her red Volkswagen parked outside his street. He opens his window, sticks his head outside and calls to her.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Natalie ... ?

NATALIE GORDON: Dylan?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: What are you doing?

NATALIE GORDON: I need to talk to you, Dylan.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You have to be quiet--It's my mom, she's going to hear you.

NATALIE GORDON: I'm coming up.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: What? No.

(DYLAN runs to the bedroom door hoping to stop her before she gets up, but NATALIE is already at his window. He opens the window for her. She smiles at him. He helps her into his room.)

NATALIE GORDON: Hey... you're going to break your neck.

[Closed-Caption reads: NATALIE GORDON: I needed to see you. ]

(He signals for her to be quiet and closes his bedroom door.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Shh.

(NATALIE looks around DYLAN's room.)

NATALIE GORDON: I haven't been here in so long.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Since 4th grade. After school. And it was a Wednesday in April. "A dream in a mist of gray." That's from a Syd Barrett song.

NATALIE GORDON: How do you know all these things?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: My dad told me. Syd Barrett, he was in the band Pink Floyd. He was, like this brilliant guy that nobody understood.

NATALIE GORDON: Kind of like you?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Me?

NATALIE GORDON: I never said I was sorry when your dad disappeared, Dylan. I never said a lot of things. But I want to say them now. I know you've always cared about me. We've grown apart, but ... I haven't forgotten you. And... after we talked this morning at school I realized ... how special you really are to me.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I can't believe this.

NATALIE GORDON: After what happened to Bill ... I realized how important it is to have someone who does understand you and ... I wanted to do this.

(NATALIE lightly kisses DYLAN.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: That ... that was amazing.

(They deepen the kiss and NATALIE whimpers and moves away from DYLAN. Her mouth is bleeding.)

NATALIE GORDON: What... what... was that?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: What was what?

NATALIE GORDON: Your ... your ... your mouth, your tongue ... there's something wrong with you.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: No, don't-don't say that.

NATALIE GORDON: I got to go.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Natalie, please. Please, don't. Just stay.

(NATALIE runs out of DYLAN's bedroom through the door. DYLAN runs after her. NATALIE drives away in her car, crying.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Natalie, listen to me! Natalie, please ...

(DYLAN watches NATALIE drive away from him. Behind him, another car pulls up and stops. DAVID WINKLE, his brother and friends emerge.)

DAVID WINKLE: Hey, bug boy! How about we go for a little buzz around the block.



SCENE 18

(David Winkle's car.)

DAVID WINKLE: So, Lokensgard... how'd you do it, huh? How'd you kill him?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I thought bugs killed Captain Dare.

DAVID WINKLE: Yeah, bugs who do what you say.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You want to know how I did it? I'll show you. But maybe you should get your camera ready.

DAVID WINKLE: What are you talking about?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I just have to open my mouth. Look!

(DYLAN opens his mouth and a pair of insect-like mandibles show. They emit a webbing on the unsuspecting boys that causes the car to veer and swerve off the road. The car hits the side of the hill and flips over as it comes to a complete stop.)



SCENE 19

(Lokensgard's Residence.)

(SCULLY and ROCKY BRONZINO walk up the LOKENSGARD's front walk way. The door is partially open. SCULLY knocks.)

SCULLY: Mrs. Lokensgard? Dylan?

(ROCKY BRONZINO turns on his machine and a series of steady beeps sound.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: I'm getting a reading here. Trace levels inside the house.

SCULLY: Well, I guess that's probable cause.

(SCULLY starts up the stairs to search the premises. She's stopped by the eager ROCKY BRONZINO.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: Dr. Scully? This is so exciting. I've never had a partner before.

SCULLY: I have.

ROCKY BRONZINO: I'd like to think of it as a hymenopteran relationship. Two scientists using their special knowledge reaching higher than either of them could ever reach alone. And if I may say so, Doctor, you complete me.

SCULLY: I got upstairs, you take down.

ROCKY BRONZINO: All right.



SCENE 20

(Glenhaven Road.)

(DOGGETT and REYES come across the overturned DAVID WINKLE's car. They approach the car and the kids can be heard.)

BOY: hey!

DAVID WINKLE: Who's that?

BOY: Someone's coming.

BOY: Ow!

BOY: Get us out!

(More moaning, groaning and coughing coming from the car. As DOGGETT and REYES peer into the car, the boys are upside down and covered in webbing.)

BOY: oh, god. Ow! God!

DOGGETT: David Winkle, is that you?

DAVID WINKLE: Yeah.

DOGGETT: Now that's a dumb ass.

DAVID WINKLE: It wasn't a stunt, it was, uh... it was Dylan Lokensgard. He attacked us.

REYES: He attacked you?

DAVID WINKLE: Yeah, the dude's a freakin' bug. He chewed right out the back window. Ow!

(DOGGETT shines his light on the back window to see it missing.)

REYES (to DOGGETT): You stay. I'll go see that Dylan didn't head to that girl's house.



SCENE 21

(Lokensgard Residence.)

(SCULLY is in DYLAN's bedroom. She sees NATALIE's class picture on the bed and the various Syd Barrett posters on the walls.

( Phone ringing )

SCULLY: Scully.

DOGGETT: Where are you?

SCULLY: I'm with ROCKY at the Lokensgard's house. But there's nobody here.

DOGGETT: Yeah, well, I'm afraid the kid's on a tear. He's caused a car accident out here on Glenhaven road.

SCULLY: How'd he do that?

DOGGETT: You'd better see for yourself.

(SCULLY makes her way downstairs while ROCKY is just starting his way up.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: C-13 calliphorone. I'm getting a stiff new reading from up here.

SCULLY: Yeah, Dylan's bedroom's up there. Unfortunately, he's not in it.

ROCKY BRONZINO: Where are you going?

SCULLY: The kid's on a rampage.

(ROCKY notices the reading on his machine.)

ROCKY BRONZINO: Whoa!

SCULLY: You got my number, partner.



SCENE 22

(Natalie Gordon'S Residence.)

(REYES approaches NATALIES bedroom. NATALIE is lying in bed.)

REYES: Natalie?

NATALIE GORDON: Whoever you are, leave me alone.

REYES: Natalie, I'm Monica Reyes, with the FBI. I'm here because I need your help. It's about Dylan Lokensgard.

NATALIE GORDON: Don't say that name around me!

REYES: It's important. You may be the key to this, to stopping him.

NATALIE GORDON: Dylan Lokensgard is a freak! I thought he was the normal one.

REYES: Dylan was normal, just like any other kid. Whatever it is he's going through it has to do with what he's beco...

NATALIE GORDON: He kissed me!

REYES: And it's probably what he's living for. And now it's probably why he lost all control and attacked David Winkle and his brother.

NATALIE GORDON: He attacked Winky?

REYES: They're going to be okay. We just want to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else, Natalie. All right?

(NATALIE nods her head.)

REYES: Come with me.

(NATALIE stands to go with REYES and gasps at something behind her. Behind REYES, DYLAN LOKENSGARD is standing in her doorway.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Why did you run from me?

NATALIE GORDON: What is wrong with you?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: I'm different, Natalie ... isn't that what you wanted? Somebody different from Bill and Winky?

NATALIE GORDON: You killed Bill.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: To keep you from being killed. And now you're coming with me.

(DYLAN holds out his hand to NATALIE. REYES reaches for her weapon.)

REYES: Just stay where you are, Dylan.



SCENE 23

(Lokensgard Residence.)

(ROCKY BRONZINO continues his ascent deeper into the LOKENSGARD residence all the while keeping an eye on his bio-sensor. He makes his way up the attic stairs and into the attic. He proceeds deeper into the attic. He hears a noise behind him. He turns around and comes face to face with MRS. LOKENSGARD. There is insect-like mandibles coming out of her mouth. Webbing shoots out from the mandibles catching ROCKY BRONZINO by surprise.)



SCENE 24
(Lokensgard Residence.)

(MRS. LOKENSGARD closes the door, she turns around and hears DYLANS voice coming from the ground floor. NATALIE stands behind DYLAN.)

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: Don't try to stop me. That little talk that you wanted to have with me? It'll have to wait.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: Where do you think you're going?

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: It's where we're going, me and Natalie. I'll be taking the car.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: You'll be doing nothing of the sort.

DYLAN LOKENSGARD: You don't want to cross me, mom. I am not some kid everybody can kick around anymore.

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: You think I don't know what you are? It's what I've been trying to tell you, Dylan to save you from what you are about to do. These are the things I couldn't tell you. The things I couldn't tell your father.

(NATALIE listens in shock as she realizes that whatever DYLAN is, his mother is one too.)

MRS. ANNE T. LOKENSGARD: You are not like the other kids. You never will be.



SCENE 25

(Natalie Gordon'S House/Bedroom.)

(DOGGETT makes his way through the house looking for REYES. He reaches NATALIE GORDON'S bedroom and sees a large webbed sack covering the entire wall. REYES is inside that webbed sac.)

DOGGETT: Monica! Monica! Holy mother ... Monica, hold on! Can you hear me? Monica, can you breathe? Monica, talk to me.

(DOGGETT tears into the webbed sac thinking that REYES may not be able to breathe through the webbing. Layer upon layer, he rips away the webbing.)

REYES: He's got the girl.

DOGGETT: Where'd they go?

REYES: To Dylan's house.

DOGGETT: That's where Scully is. She lost phone contact with the entomologist, Bronzino.



SCENE 26

Lokensgard Residence.)

(SCULLY approaches the opened doorway with her weapon drawn. She hears something and raises her weapon and her flashlight as she rounds the corner into the living room. NATALIE GORDON is sitting in a corner chair and crying.)

SCULLY: Where are they?

(NATALIE GORDON is beyond being able to speak.

SCULLY: Natalie!

(NATALIE GORDON continues to cry. She manages to point upstairs. SCULLY raises her weapon and the flashlight and proceeds up the stairs. SCULLY makes her way up the attic. To her horror she finds large human-sized webbed sacs in the attic. There are many of them hanging from various positions in the ceiling. One of the sacs whimpers. SCULLY swings around.)

BRONZINO ( muffled ): Help me.

(SCULLY steps up to get a closer look at the sac.

BRONZINO: Help me.

(SCULLY peels away the webbing to find ROCKY BRONZINO within.



SCENE 27

(Final series of clips.)

(Officers scramble up the stairs followed by DOGGETT and REYES who in turn stop as they watch SCULLY astride ROCKY BRONZINO administering CPR to the man on the floor who is obviously not in need of it.

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): Four more bodies were found in the Lokensgard attic including that of Michael Lokensgard, Dylan's father, long reported missing.

(DOGGETT peels away the webbing from one of the sacs revealing a decomposed body of a figure who wore a "Syd Barrett" t-shirt. This is presumably Michael Lokensgard, Dylan's father.)

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): It now appears that he, like the others, fell victim to Dylan's mother who, in Dr. Rocky Bronzino's expert opinion, was neither human nor insect but something in between. A biological anomaly, whose differences from the rest of humanity could be hidden only for so long.

(On an roadway, MRS. LOKENSGARD and her son, DYLAN LOKENSGARD, drives away to places unknown. DYLAN is not happy. He raises his hand to touch the car window.)

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): However strong Dylan Lokensgard's yearning to fit in, to win acceptance, to love and to be loved he could not defeat the unseen forces which direct behaviour.

(NATALIE GORDON is awake in her bed at home. Lights from outside glow through her bedroom window. NATALIE looks outside to see a swarm of fireflies light the sky with the message, "I Love You". NATALIE smiles.)

SCULLY (VOICE OVER): In the struggle between our desire to determine who and what we will be and the identity which biology defines for us there can only be one outcome. But even in victory, there are forces biology can not defeat -- the stirring of the soul the mysteries of desire the simple truth that the heart wants ... what the heart wants.

(NATALIE raises her hand to touch the window.)

[THE END]

                            TRUST NO 1



SCENE 1

(Fade In.)

(During SCULLY's opening voiceover we see a montage of images and scenes from previous seasons and classic MSR (Mulder Scully Romance) episodes. The whole opening teaser is in slow-motion. The classical music playing during this montage of clips is Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky's "The Seasons: Barcarolle", arranged and performed by Richard Grayson. The teaser gives the impression that MULDER and SCULY have been under surveillance for a long time.)

(Black and white image of SCULLY looking at herself in a mirror.)
(From "WITHIN" 8X01)

(It dissolves into a colourful image of two cars passing each other on a city street at night.)

(Black-and-white image of SCULLY looking down in front of a mirror takes place up-front on screen.)
(From "WITHIN" 8X01)

(It dissolves into another colourful city street shot, with moving cars and the Capitol Building in the background, well-lit and clearly visible at night. The scene freezes and turns black and white.)

(We cut seamlessly onto SCULLY exiting the hospital, lost in her thoughts, holding a bouquet of flowers in her right hand. Black-and-white footage.)
(From "all things" 7X17)

(Black and white shot of SCULLY seated in a car behind a steering-wheel in a parking garage. Very sad. Its format is that of a surveillance footage.)
(From "THE END" 5X20)

(Another black and white shot of SCULLY looking at herself in a mirror.)
(From "WITHIN" 8X01)

(Black and white image of SCULLY holding an umbrella. As the scene begins playing the screen turns colourful and SCULLY comes up to join MULDER at a crime scene. Then the scene freezes and turns into a black and white surveillance photograph.)
(From "LEONARD BETTS" 4X14)

(Fade to white)

(The white light melts into a black and white image of MULDER running towards a phone booth, SCULLY close behind him. It is a surveillance photograph, then other black and white surveillance photographs appear, all fast-forwarded until we see a close-up of MULDER holding a phone receiver to his ear. It is also a black and white surveillance photograph.)
(From "PUSHER" 3X17)

[Fade to black]

(Colourful image of MULDER and SCULLY appears, both sitting in The X Files office. MULDER sitting in his chair behind his table, SCULLY sitting in a chair in front of the table. Very awkward atmosphere, yet *very* memorable moment. The scene freezes and turns black and white.)
(From Final images of "NEVER AGAIN" 4X13)

(Black and white scene of SCULLY following MULDER through the street. Police officers can be seen in the background.)
(From "PAPER HEARTS" 4X08)

(Black and white scene of MULDER and SCULLY kneeling over a dead body lying on a floor at the Metro Diner.)
(From "KILL SWITCH" 5X11)

(MULDER and SCULLY sitting on a couch at MULDER's apartment. The camera angle is from the airvent.)
(From "MILAGRO" 6X18)

(Black and white surveillance image of MULDER staring ahead of himself, contemplating the next move. The shot freezes, then begins playing as SCULLY leans closer to MULDER to speak to him privately. Very lovely image.)
(From "THE FIELD WHERE I DIED" 4X05)

(Hallway hug at the hospital. MULDER and SCULLY holding each other. MULDER has his chin on the top of SCULLY's head. He then stokes her hair.)
(From "MEMENTO MORI" 4X15)

(MULDER smiles at SCULLY, then leans down to her and they kiss.)
(From "MILLENNIUM" 7X05)

(MULDER embraced SCULLY after her failed attempt at IVF pregnancy. We see her face over his shoulder. Her eyes are filled with tears.)
(From ("PER MANUM" 8X08)

(MULDER sitting on bed in his motel room, SCULLY examining him.)
(From "DEMONS" 4X23)

(Standing at SCULLY's apartment close to each other.)
(From "PER MANUM" 8X08)

(Night. SCULLY approaching MULDER in a desert before their touching "Good-bye" conversation.)
(From "DREAMLAND II" 6X05)

SCULLY: (Voiceover) One day, you'll ask me to speak of a truth - of the miracle of your birth. To explain what is unexplained. And if I falter or fail on this day, know there is an answer, my child, a sacred imperishable truth, but one you may never hope to find alone. Chance meeting your perfect other, your perfect opposite - your protector and endangeror. Chance embarking with this other on the greatest of journeys - - a search for truths fugitive and imponderable. If one day this chance may befall you, my son, do not fail or falter to seize it. The truths are out there. And if one day you should behold a miracle, as I have in you, you will learn the truth is not found in science, or on some unseen plane, but by looking into your own heart. And in that moment you will be blessed - and stricken. For the truest truths are what hold us together, or keep us painfully, desperately apart.

(We see a new image of SCULLY's devastated face. She is leaning over a lifeless male body laying on a train platform. The green surveillance footage changes into a real- life colourful image.)

TAGLINE: THEY'RE WATCHING



SCENE 2

(Night. SCULLY is still on the platform, waiting for someone. She is being covertly watched through a surveillance camera. She paces down the platform and checks her watch.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 3
FEDERAL GROUNDS INTERNET CAFE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Day. SCULLY is pushing WILLIAM in his stroller along a street. She enters the cyber cafe and walks over to the counter, where she orders a drink. The WAITRESS recognises her.)

WAITRESS: (from behind a counter) Hey. Tall coffee with milk?

SCULLY: Yes, thanks.

SCULLY: And can I get a warm-up, please?

(SCULLY hands the WAITRESS a bottle of baby milk to warm.)

(Minutes later, SCULLY is sitting in front of a computer and has logged into her mail account. A voice informs her "You have 5 new messages." The screen says "Welcome Dana Scully". The messages listed on the screen are:

(The camera moves in towards the email from "trust_no1@mail.com. SCULLY looks happy to see it. She opens it. We see the message on the screen.)

E-Mail From: Trust_No1@mail.com
To: Queequeg0925@hotmail.com
Date: 07 Jan 2002

SCULLY: (Voiceover) I've resisted contacting you for reasons I know you continue to appreciate. But, to be honest, some unexpected dimensions of my new life are eating away at any resolve I have left. I'm lonely, Dana, uncertain of my ability to live like this. I want to come home. To you, and to William.

(SCULLY looks sad after reading to message to herself. She looks down at WILLIAM, who is sucking on his bottle. We hear another baby cry. SCULLY looks up)

(A woman, PATTI, enters the cafe, pushing another stroller. She stops at the counter to attend to her baby.)

PATTI: Shhh-shhh.

(SCULLY starts writing her reply on the computer.)

SCULLY: (Voiceover) I am physically shaking right now seeing your words. Wishing it were you speaking them to me. I want so badly to see you too, but you are still not safe here.

(SCULLY looks up. The baby's mother is nowhere to be seen. The baby continues to cry. SCULLY gets up and walks over to the stroller. The WAITRESS has also walked over to the baby.)

SCULLY: The child's mother, she was just here. Where did she go?

WAITRESS: I think that's her out there.

(Through the window, we can see PATTI talking to a MAN ON THE STREET. They seem to be having a heated discussion. She suddenly turns away from him and comes back into the cafe.)

PATTI: Excuse me.

(She kneels down, tending to her baby.)

PATTI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

(She stands back up. SCULLY smiles at her. The PATTI quickly turns the stroller around and leaves the cafe.)



SCENE 4
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Day. SCULLY is looking at a print out of the E-Mail from earlier on a piece of paper. She hears doors opening and sees DOGGETT and REYES enter. She quickly hides the piece of paper in a drawer.)

DOGGETT: Can we talk to you a second?

REYES: It's about Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: What about Mulder?

DOGGETT: We got a guy contacting us through intelligence channels. He keeps saying he wants to talk to Fox Mulder only he won't say why.

SCULLY: Well, who is he?

REYES: We don't know. He always covers his tracks. But this morning we finally got him to tip his hand. He says he has highly classified military files.

SCULLY: Files on what?

DOGGETT: These bio-engineered soldiers we've all come in contact with. So-called super-soldiers. The same ones threatening Mulder's life, forcing him to live underground.

SCULLY: What does he want with Mulder?

DOGGETT: He wants to give him the names of these super-soldiers, and Mulder's the only person he'll give them to.

(Pause)

SCULLY: Well, even if this was a good idea I don't know how to contact him.

(SCULLY leaves, going into her teaching lab where her FBI class is waiting for her.)

SCULLY: (To her class) I'm sorry about that. I believe that last class we were covering petechia and evidence of death by -

DOGGETT: (standing behind SCULLY, interrupting) Agent Scully.

(SCULLY and DOGGETT leave the lab. They stop outside the door.)

DOGGETT: What the hell are you doing?

SCULLY: I'm trying to teach a class.

DOGGETT: You understand what we're being offered here? If we know who these super-soldiers are we can go after them. This is somebody giving us a way that can make it safe for Mulder to come home.

SCULLY: That's the operative word here - somebody. Somebody that we don't know.

DOGGETT: And you don't want to check it out.

SCULLY: (Insistent) What I don't want is Agent Mulder's life to be endangered any more than it already is.

DOGGETT: How long are you going to do this?

SCULLY: Do what, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: Refuse to trust me ... or anybody. How else you going to get him home?

(SCULLY looks away before going back into the lab.)



SCENE 5

(Night. A silver car, license plate 51 - CORI, turns round a corner and stops at the kerb. SCULLY gets out and goes to the rear door to get WILLIAM out of his car seat. She overhears someone in the street. She doesn't recognise her.)

PATTI: Leave us alone.

MAN ON THE STREET: I am not going to do this.

PATTI: Get away. Get away from us. Leave us alone.

MAN ON THE STREET: She's coming with me.

PATTI: What are you doing?

SCULLY: (To the WOMAN) Do you need help, ma'am?

(PATTI has her back turned to her.)

PATTI: No. Don't ...

SCULLY: Hey.

PATTI: Don't take her with you.

MAN ON THE STREET: No. I'm not letting you have her.

SCULLY: Do you need me to call the police?

PATTI: Don't go. Don't go! Please.

SCULLY: Ma'am? Are you all right?

(The WOMAN turns and SCULLY sees that it is the woman from the Internet cafe, PATTI.)



SCENE 6

(Night. SCULLY's apartment. Her front door opens and SCULLY enters, holding WILLIAM in her arms. PATTI follows her in. SCULLY turns some lights on.)

SCULLY: Come on in. The phone's over there.

PATTI: I don't know if it's such a good idea. Making out a police report.

SCULLY: Well, you've (pausing) obviously got a problem. I saw you this morning at the cafe. Is he your husband?

(PATTI looks upset, and avoids eye contact with SCULLY.)

PATTI: Yeah.

SCULLY: It's okay. I understand. I mean ... it's hard enough caring for a child.

PATTI: You don't have anyone, do you?

SCULLY: No. (SCULLY looks down.) But I wish I did.

PATTI: (With a smile) Maybe he'll come back.

(SCULLY looks up at PATTI, a beautiful smile on her face.)

SCULLY: Do you have anywhere to go?

PATTI: (Shaking her head) No.

SCULLY: I'm going to get you a blanket and something hot to drink, all right?

PATTI: Thank you.

SCULLY: (Extending her hand) My name's Dana.

PATTI: (Smiling back) I'm Patti.

(They shake hands.)



SCENE 7
BETHESDA, MARYLAND
9:32 PM

(Night. DOGGETT is sitting in his car, watching a 3-storey brick building across the street in front of him. REYES' car pulls up behind his. He sees her in his rearview mirror. She gets out of her car and joins DOGGETT in the front seat of his.)

REYES: What do you have?

DOGGETT: This source of ours decided to give my cell phone a call tonight. I ran a trace.

REYES: Did you get a number?

DOGGETT: No, but I got a node. A sector of six City blocks. The area's pretty vacant, except for this building here.

REYES: Say this source is for real, and this is Mulder's chance to come home. We spook the spook, and maybe that chance goes away. Or worse, it drives Mulder deeper.

(A dark car pulls up in front of the building. A man gets out and opens a door into the building. He enters, checking behind his before he closes the door. We see it is the MAN IN THE STREET from earlier.)

REYES: Where are you going?

DOGGETT: Take a little look into his car.

REYES: I'll say it again - what we risk is compromising Mulder's return.

DOGGETT: I don't plan on getting caught.

(DOGGETT gets out of the car.)



SCENE 8

(A surveillance room. There are maybe a dozen desks in the room, each with several monitors on them. Staff sit in front of the screens, working at terminals. The MAN IN THE STREET enters the room, taking off his jacket and sitting down at a desk. Another man is sitting at a desk next to his, his fade in shadow.)

MAN ON THE STREET: Good evening. How are you?

SHADOW MAN: Good. You?

SHADOW MAN: Your wife and kid?

MAN ON THE STREET: They're good. Good. Everybody's good.

(The SHADOW MAN turns back to his monitor. On the screen, we see a feed from a surveillance camera outside. We see DOGGETT and REYES run across the road to investigate the MAN IN THE STREET's car. The SHADOW MAN watches intently.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 9

(Surveillance footage. We again see SCULLY being surveilled on the train platform. The camera zooms in to show her face. We see REYES standing on the platform. A solitary man in shadow walks down the platform.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 10
5:41 AM

(Day. In the car, REYES is asleep, whilst DOGGETT reads the paper. He notices the MAN IN THE STREET leaving the building, moving towards his car.)

DOGGETT: Monica, wake up.

REYES: What?

(The man starts the car and drives away (license plate 29 - DOTH), past DOGGETT. Once he has passed, DOGGETT turns the car around in the street and follows.)



SCENE 11

(Early morning. SCULLY's apartment. PATTI is laying awake on the sofa. She gets up and sees SCULLY sleeping in her bedroom. She goes to the baby monitor and turns it off. She stands over WILLIAM and outstretches her arms to pick him up.

(In SCULLY's bedroom, her cell phone starts vibrating on the bedside table. She wakes up and answers it.)

SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.

DOGGETT: You awake?

SCULLY: Yeah. I just laid down. What time is it?

DOGGETT: 6:00 AM

(We see DOGGETT and REYES are walking up the street in front of SCULLY's apartment.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes and I just tailed a car onto your street. We watched a guy go into your building. A guy we're guessing you've got no business with.

DOGGETT: (on phone, voice) You there, Agent Scully?

(SCULLY appears from around a doorway with her gun, aimed in front of her. She sees PATTI holding WILLIAM.)

SCULLY: Put him down. Now!

PATTI: Oh, my God.

SCULLY: Put my baby down.

(PATTI puts WILLIAM back down in his crib. She looks visibly shocked by SCULLY's actions.)

(The door handle starts to turn slowly. Outside her apartment door, we see the MAN ON THE STREET picking the lock. DOGGETT exits the stairwell and sees him. He races towards him and pins him up against the wall. He wrestles him to the floor as REYES appears from the stairwell. REYES moves towards the door.)

REYES: (Pounding on door) Agent Scully?

(SCULLY still has her gun aimed at PATTI, as the door opens.)

REYES: Agent Scully, do you know this man?

(SCULLY looks down at the MAN ON THE STREET.)

DOGGETT: I wouldn't think so. Not with him trying to pick his way into your place.

(DOGGETT shows SCULLY the lockpick he was using to pick the lock.)



SCENE 12

(Inside SCULLY's apartment. DOGGETT, REYES and SCULLY are interrogating PATTI and the MAN ON THE STREET, who are sat next to each other on the couch.)

DOGGETT: Start with who you work for.

MAN ON THE STREET: I'm not at liberty to say.

DOGGETT: Is this your wife? Maybe she's at liberty. Maybe she doesn't want to accompany you to prison.

SCULLY: You staged this, didn't you? Arguing on the street. Everything.

PATTI: No.

SCULLY: It's a con job. What are you after? My baby?

PATTI: No, no. I want to protect William.

MAN ON THE STREET: That's enough. You want to get us killed?

PATTI: You said ... you said that they could help us. You told me that. That's what you said.

DOGGETT: What the hell is going on here?

MAN ON THE STREET: They're watching.

DOGGETT: They're watching?

(SCULLY walks over to the window and lowers the blinds.)

SCULLY: You got something to say, say it.

MAN ON THE STREET: I work for the National Security Agency. The name on my driver's license is false. If you were to call the police I would be detained only long enough for another NSA agent to authorize my release. I don't exist as a citizen, nor does anyone I work with.

DOGGETT: So what are you doing here?

MAN ON THE STREET: As you can see, my wife is upset. I was coming to get her to stop this very event.

REYES: What's she so upset about?

PATTI: We have a daughter ... Joy. There's something about her. Something different. Just like there's something different with her son William.

(SCULLY is silent, listening carefully and shocked at PATTI's revelations.)

DOGGETT: Different how? How do you know anything about her or her son?

MAN ON THE STREET: (To DOGGETT) I know virtually everything about you. (To REYES) And you.

(To SCULLY) And you. Several months ago, you saw your son affect the movement of the mobile over his crib. He spun it, as if with his mind. It happened to us the same way.

REYES: So you've been looking in this apartment with what, cameras?

MAN ON THE STREET: Various forms of technology.

REYES: Then it's you who's been contacting us.

MAN ON THE STREET: Not directly. My scope is limited. I only look at what they tell me to. But I have a supervisor who I've told everything I'm telling you about my daughter, and her son, and he started to look into it. He learned things about a super- soldier program. Things he won't tell us. Crimes, he says, against innocent people.

SCULLY: What does he want with Mulder?

MAN ON THE STREET: Mulder's the only one capable of making the connections, he says.

PATTI: Maybe we can help you. And maybe you can help us find out the truth. About what our babies really are.

(During the pause in conversion, SCULLY's home phone rings. She picks it up and answers.)

SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.

SHADOW MAN: (On phone) You've had quite an earful.

(The voice we hear through SCULLY's phone is distorted to disguise it.)

SCULLY: Who is this?

(We see the SHADOW MAN sitting at his desk.)

SHADOW MAN: As my associate indiscreetly told you, we don't have names.

SCULLY: You've been listening to us?

SHADOW MAN: It's all I could do after you closed the shades, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: You ever heard of the Constitution?

SHADOW MAN: Yes. It's what allows foreign terrorists to live here and enjoy the American dream, until time comes to destroy it. But my trespasses are the least of your concern, after what they've done to you and Mulder.

SCULLY: What have they done?

SHADOW MAN: Actually, it's what they're prepared to do next.

SHADOW MAN: I'd be happy to tell Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: (Tearful) Well, you're going to have to tell me 'cause I don't know how to reach Agent Mulder.

SHADOW MAN: You reached him yesterday. You sent him an e- mail. Would you like me to read it to you?

SCULLY: (Tears are now welling up in her eyes) Look why should I trust you? You're just a voice on the end of the phone. I'm not going to give you anything unless I can meet you. Unless I ... unless I can see your face. Are you still there?

SHADOW MAN: If you think you can flush me out you're making a big mistake. Bus bench, Internet cafe. Come alone. You have 20 minutes.

(The SHADOW MAN hangs up the phone. SCULLY puts on her jacket.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully? What are you doing?

SCULLY: I'm going to meet your contact. I think you should watch William, Monica.

DOGGETT: I don't like this. I don't like the feel of it and I don't like you agreeing to it without backup.

SCULLY: You said I had to trust someone, right? Well, that's what I'm doing.

(SCULLY gets ready to leave.)



SCENE 13

(Outside the Federal Grounds internet cafe. SCULLY stops and sits on the bench. Her cell phone rings as soon as she's sitting.)

SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.

SHADOW MAN: (On phone, distorted) Are you armed, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yes.

SHADOW MAN: Then you're prepared to use your weapon should anything go wrong?

(We see a surveillance camera is monitoring SCULLY outside the cafe.)

SCULLY: (on phone) I'm not sure I follow you.

SHADOW MAN: Then do exactly as I say. If you vary my instructions in the smallest way, we're over. If I see, or suspect that you're not working alone I will terminate our communication. If I believe a third party is trying to use this meeting to prevent our exchange you must be prepared to use your weapon in your own defence. Am I clear?

SCULLY: (on phone) Yes.

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) There's a green sedan across the street from you. The keys are in it. I want you to get in the car.

(SCULLY notices the car on the other side of the road. She gets up and goes over to it. The camera tracks her whilst she does this. She looks around before getting into the driver's seat.)

SCULLY: (on phone) All right, what next?

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) Start the engine, put the car in drive and await my next order.

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) Pull out quickly! Go now!

(In front of an approaching car, SCULLY accelerates from the side of the road into traffic. The car she cuts up slams on the brakes and sounds their horn in anger. SCULLY continues to accelerate down the road, driving with one hand and holding to phone to her ear with the other.)

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) Agent Scully?

SCULLY: (on phone) Is it absolutely necessary to get innocent people hurt?

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) You're free to stop the car and walk away at any time. Up to you. I'm doing this for your own protection and for Mulder's.

SCULLY: (on phone) So where am I going?

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) Turn right. Right now.

(SCULLY looks up ahead. There is a narrow alley to the right up ahead. She turns into it and stops the car. The camera is watching her. She walks away from the car.)

SHADOW MAN: (on phone, voice) Stop the car. Get out, Agent Scully. Turn the engine off, take the keys out. Walk to the top of the alley. There's another car there. Get in and drive directly to the interstate on-ramp heading west. You will continue driving west until I tell you otherwise.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 14

(Night. Road. SCULLY is driving alone in the dark. She is still holding the phone to her ear.)

SHADOW MAN: That's far enough. Get out of the car.

(She moves to turn off the engine.)

SHADOW MAN: Leave it running.

SCULLY: Where are you?

SHADOW MAN: Move around to the trunk. You'll see a change of clothes inside for you. Put them on.

SCULLY: Look, uh ... we're in the middle of nowhere.

(She opens the trunk. There are clothes inside.)

SHADOW MAN: There is no middle of nowhere anymore, Agent Scully.

(We see SCULLY being watched from about 20 metres, by someone standing behind bushes. We are in a deserted clearing, the car's headlights providing the only illumination. SCULLY is changing into the new clothes. She bends down to the ground to pick up her old clothes when suddenly we see somebody's foot appear in front of her. It is the SHADOW MAN.)

SHADOW MAN: Put the gun in the trunk. Your clothes, too.

(She does as he asks. The SHADOW MAN takes a remote control device out of his pocket and turns it on. The car starts moving away from them. We see the license plate is 48 - INXU. SCULLY watches in semi-shock. When the car is sufficiently far away, he presses another button on the device and the car explodes in a huge ball of flames. He turns to SCULLY.)

SHADOW MAN: Your watch. Give it to me.

SCULLY: This is ridiculous. This has gone far enough.

SHADOW MAN: Do you want to see Mulder again?

(She takes her Omega from her wrist. The SHADOW MAN examines it before giving it back to her.)

SCULLY: These clothes that I'm wearing ... they're my size. How the hell do you know my size?

SHADOW MAN: Your size? I know your blood type, your resting heart rate, your childhood fear of clowns. I know the name of your College boyfriend, your true hair colour, your ATM pin number, favourite charities, pet peeves. I know you spend too much time alone. And I know ... that on one lonely night you invited Mulder to your bed.

(SCULLY cannot believe all this. Her eyes starts to well up.))

SCULLY: (Speechless) Oh, my God.

SHADOW MAN: I was as surprised as you are.

(Tears have started to stream down her face.)

SCULLY: Who authorizes you? I mean, what gives you the right? Who are you?!

SHADOW MAN: I'm the future, Agent Scully. And I risked my life being here.

SCULLY: Well, then why do it? I mean, why meet me?

SHADOW MAN: Because you can reach Mulder. Mulder needs to know what I know or he may have no future. Perhaps no one will. Another car is parked on the main road, half a mile out. If I see that you haven't contacted Mulder in the next twenty- four hours, I disappear and you never see me again. Do you understand, lady?

(He holds out some car keys and she takes them. She walks off into the night. The SHADOW MAN watches her.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 15
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(SCULLY is in the teaching lab, standing over a cadaver with a group of students. DOGGETT is standing outside in the corridor. She notices him.)

SCULLY: (To her students) Excuse me.

(SCULLY comes over to the lab door, opening it and standing in the doorway.)

SCULLY: I'm teaching a class, Agent Doggett. Is it something pressing?

DOGGETT: Yeah. I'm worried now about what it is I've gotten you into.

(She joins him in the corridor.)

SCULLY: You're right to be worried.

DOGGETT: This guy that led you all over town last night ... he says he wants to talk to Mulder, right? Why does he need you? Why not go to Mulder directly? 'Cause this guy knows Mulder resurfaces only if the one person he trusts asks him to.

SCULLY: That guy didn't come to me, Agent Doggett, he came to you. That woman that I took in blew his cover. He had no other choice.

DOGGETT: Did you ever stop to think that this woman and her husband are in on this, too?

SCULLY: I don't believe that. That woman is truly scared for her child for the same reasons that I am.

DOGGETT: How do you know they're not being used by this Shadow Man to lure Mulder out? To kill him?

SCULLY: 'Cause that couple doesn't even necessarily trust the Shadow Man. I mean, for their own reasons.

DOGGETT: You think about it. This guy seems to know everything. He even reads your e-mail. How can you, or anybody hope to ensure for Mulder a safe passage home?

SCULLY: Mulder and I already considered that even before he left. His return has been pre-arranged. The place, the mode of transport, everything's been set.

DOGGETT: Well, you can call the whole thing off?

SCULLY: I can't. I've already sent for him. Mulder's on a train. He'll be here at midnight.

DOGGETT: Maybe you can reach him.

SCULLY: You can't do that to me.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry.

SCULLY: (Passionately) I want to see him so bad.

DOGGETT: I know. And I want to make sure that you get to, Dana. That's the whole reason I'm here.

SCULLY: Well, it's too late. And I have to go.



SCENE 16
10:48 PM

(SCULLY is on the train platform, walking down it alone. She checks the time on her watch. A surveillance camera watches her every move. It zooms in on her face. She looks very anxious.)



SCENE 17
FBI EVIDENCE LAB

(DOGGETT enters the lab, carrying an evidence bag. We see an female agent sitting at a bench, wearing glasses with magnifiers on each lens and a small light source attached to the bridge of the glasses. She is hard at work examining something.)

DOGGETT: Agent Boal? Edie Boal? Yeah, I'm John Doggett. We spoke a few minutes ago. You said if I came right down you might be able to help me out.

(She looks up from the bench. She moves the magnifiers so she can see him.)

AGENT BOAL: What'd I get myself into?

DOGGETT: I've got some clothing here. I'm looking for anything you can find that might give me an ID.

AGENT BOAL: Male or female?

DOGGETT: It's a male who handled them and he gave them to a female agent.

AGENT BOAL: When do you need them?

DOGGETT: I got a little over an hour.

AGENT BOAL: Your staring over my shoulder doesn't make me go faster.

(She turn and looks at him, her expression clearly making her point. DOGGETT leaves the sample with her and heads for the door.)



SCENE 18

(SCULLY is still pacing the platform. She checks the time on her Omega watch again, 11:26 PM. She turns back towards the station building, and REYES appears. SCULLY is still being surveilled. She turns away and we see the MAN ON THE STREET walking down the platform towards her. He stops in front of her, looking up the wall of the platform building. We notice a small camera attached to the wall. He takes out a black spraycan and sprays over the lens, obscuring its view.) CUT TO:

(DOGGETT is in the X Files office, watching the clock. It is now 11:38 PM. He takes his jacket and heads out the door.) CUT BACK TO:

(The Postal Telegraph clock at the station shows it is now 11:56 PM. REYES is on the platform. SCULLY is now looking very anxious. She checks up and down the platform. The MAN IN THE STREET is still there.)

STATION ANNOUNCER: (On Tannoy) May I have your attention please? Southbound 112 now arriving. Southbound 112 now arriving. Please stay clear of the platform until the train comes to a full stop.

(In the distance we seethe light of a train approaching the station. A bell starts to ring as the crossing closes.)

(The scene suddenly change to slow motion. SCULLY looks over at the MAN IN THE STREET. He reaches into a pocket and pulls out a handgun. He aims it in SCULLY's direction. REYES notices this and shouts to DANA. She runs over to her and pulls SCULLY to the ground. The MAN IN THE STREET shouts as he holds his aims. From the other end of the platform, and from behind a ground of waiting people, the SHADOW MAN appears. He has a handgun aimed back towards THE MAN IN THE STREET as he pushes his way past the group of people.)

(The SHADOW MAN walks towards him and fires, hitting the MAN IN THE STREET in the left side of the chest. He continues towards him. The MAN IN THE STREET collapses onto the platform. The SHADOW MAN moves closer. REYES reaches for her gun, protection SCULLY. Suddenly the SHADOW MAN is hit in the leg and chest. The camera pans to reveal DOGGETT standing a short distance away, his gun still aimed at the SHADOW MAN who falls backwards off the platform in front of the train. It looks as though he falls inbetween the rails.)

(The scene changes back to normal speed.)

STATION MANAGER: (On radio) Two men shot! Two men shot! Keep rolling!

(SCULLY runs up to him.)

SCULLY: Stop the train!

STATION MANAGER: (on radio) Keep rolling!

SCULLY: I'm a Federal Agent!

STATION MANAGER: (on radio) Keep rolling!

(SCULLY checks the carriages for any sign of MULDER, getting more agitated as the train passes.)

SCULLY: (Shouting) Mulder!

(The train passes the platform. SCULLY runs back over to REYES and DOGGETT, who are standing over the MAN IN THE STREET's body. He is just barely alive. SCULLY cradles his head in her hands, and he drifts away. SCULLY is very upset and kneels over him.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 19

Night. Later on the platform, a police car pulls up, its blue lights flashing. DOGGETT and a police officer are inspecting the tracks where the SHADOW MAN fell. SCULLY is sitting with REYES in silence on the platform bench. PATTI walks over to her.)

PATTI: (Tearfully) Agent Scully? It wasn't supposed to happen. This wasn't supposed to happen at all. All we wanted was answers. We never meant to harm you. My husband was not a part of this.

SCULLY: I know. I know that he was only trying to protect me.

PATTI: The man who he works for ... he's the one who's responsible for this.

SCULLY: I know. I'm sorry.

SCULLY: I'm so sorry.

(PATTI and SCULLY are now both crying. SCULLY comforts PATTI and they hug.)

(DOGGETT leaves the trackside and walks up a flight of steps to the platform. REYES walks over to him.)

REYES: What is it?

DOGGETT: What I was afraid of.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, what?

(SCULLY walks over to them.)

DOGGETT: We can't find him.

SCULLY: Who?

DOGGETT: The man I shot. He fell in front of a frikkin' moving train but he ain't down there on the tracks.

SCULLY: Well, where is he?

DOGGETT: Nowhere. It shouldn't make a bit of sense, but it does. I went to run the DNA on the clothes he gave you, only the man's DNA can't be tested. They say it's some kind of weird DNA complexed with iron or some damn thing.

REYES: That doesn't make sense.

DOGGETT: I think it does. 'Cause he's not a man. He's a super-soldier.

(SCULLY now realises what this means.)

SCULLY: Mulder. I've got to warn Mulder.

(SCULLY runs over to the STATION MANAGER, who is standing on the platform with some other passengers.)

SCULLY: Get on the radio! Get on the radio and alert them that there's a situation on that train.

STATION MANAGER: A situation?

SCULLY: The man who fell on the tracks, he's gotten on that train.

(Suddenly, a voice is heard over the STATION MANAGER's radio.)

MAN FROM THE TRAIN: This is the Southbound 112. We got a jumper. A man jumped off the train at the mile 19 connector, ran into the Manville rock quarry there.

(SCULLY turns away, sure of who they are referring to.)



SCENE 20
MANVILLE ROCK QUARRY
1:17 AM

(Night. A car is driving into the quarry. We see its license plate is 86 - WFMG. It comes to a stop and Agents SCULLY, DOGGETT and REYES get out. SCULLY runs around from the passenger seat as DOGGETT and REYES get out.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, you drive. Head down into the quarry and we'll meet you at the bottom.

SCULLY: Okay.

(SCULLY gets into the driver's seat whilst DOGGETT and REYES head off to explorer the quarry on foot. SCULLY starts the car and drives off.)

(DOGGETT and REYES are climbing down a rather steep rock face, littered with stones and boulders. DOGGETT stops and sees a man running across the bottom of the quarry, too far away to easily identify.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes!

(DOGGETT calls out. The figure stops momentarily.)

DOGGETT: Mulder! Mulder!

(The figure stands there.)

DOGGETT: Mulder, it's John Doggett!

(The figure starts to run again.)

SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder?

(A man appears through the mist. It's the SHADOW MAN.) CUT TO:

(SCULLY parks the car at the bottom of the quarry and gets out. She calls out.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(Silence. She calls out again.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

(A figure emerges from the mist ahead of her. His face in shadow to start with, as he approaches his identity is revealed. It is the SHADOW MAN, alive and well as DOGGETT predicted. Recognising him, SCULLY runs off in the opposite direction. She continues as far as she can go. She finds herself in an open area surrounded by the high, steep sides of the quarry. There is heavy plant machinery standing idle around her. SCULLY stops and draws her gun as the SHADOW MAN appears from behind one of the diggers. He starts walking towards her.)

SCULLY: Stop there! Stop right there! Why do you want to kill us?!

(The SHADOW MAN continues walking towards SCULLY.)

SHADOW MAN: Mulder must die. Mulder or your son.

(Taking no notice of SCULLY he continues towards her menacingly.)

SCULLY: What are you talking about? What does this have to do with my son? What's wrong with my son?! Answer me!

(The SHADOW MAN suddenly stops in front of her. His expression becomes pained. His body goes rigid. He looks at the rocks around him. There is a reddish colouring around the base of the quarry. The SHADOW MAN starts shaking and drops to his knees. SCULLY holds her gun on him, unsure of what is happening. He drops onto his chest. Patches of black start appearing on his forehead. He tries to get up, but cannot resist the invisible attraction to the rock. He struggles to his feet, his exposed skin now completely blackened by a chemical reaction. Suddenly without warning, his body is pulled towards the quarry wall at great speed, flying past Agent SCULLY. He hits the wall with enormous velocity, his body exploding into dust on impact. Nothing remains.)

(SCULLY, laying on the ground to avoid him, looks over at the rock wall. She scrambles to her feet and runs off back the way she came, back to her car.)



SCENE 21

(Night. SCULLY is sitting in the internet cafe, typing an email to MULDER. WILLIAM is awake in his stroller next to her.)

SCULLY: (Voiceover) I hold no hope you can respond to this. Or that it reaches you. I only hope that you are alive.

I cannot help believing that you jumped off that train because you knew what I now know - that these "super-soldiers," if that's what they are, can in fact be destroyed. That the key to their destruction lies in the iron compound at that quarry.

I am scared for you, Mulder. And for William. The forces against us are unrelenting. But so is my determination. To see you again. To regain the comfort and safety we shared for so brief a time.

Until then, I remain forever yours... Dana

(SCULLY looks down at WILLIAM, who looks very content. She strokes his face with her hand, and smiles warmly at him.)

(She clicks the "Send" button. Seconds later a message message appears on the screen "Your Mail Has Been Sent.")

SCENE 1
DAY ONE

(Fade in. DOGGETT is laying on the ground, seemingly unconscious. As he comes to, we see his is laying on his back, wearing a dirty white T-shirt and jeans. He looks down to his feet. A CRACKHEAD is removing his right sneaker. DOGGETT doesn't have the strength to resist him.)

DOGGETT: Hey, damn it! My shoe ...

(The CRACKHEAD runs off as the sneaker comes off, running away through the building they are sitting in. DOGGETT gets to his feet, his balance unsteady. The room spins. He's hears the CRACKHEAD leaving through a door and follows. He opens the door and is hit by bright sunlight, which disorientates him. He sees the CRACKHEAD disappearing round a corner ahead of them. He runs after him. As he gets the roadside, he stops. He looks around. His is completely unsure of where he is. He looks around. We see we are in a Mexican street, with small shops and stalls lining the roadside. He sees the CRACKHEAD up ahead, looking at the sneaker he has stolen. DOGGETT runs after him and catches him, throwing the CRACKHEAD up against a lamp-post in the street. The CRACKHEAD starts shouting at DOGGETT in Spanish.)

CRACKHEAD: (Arguing with DOGGETT in Spanish) Dejame en paz!

DOGGETT: Give me my shoe!

(The CRACKHEAD notices a police car in the street and calls out to the officers sitting inside.)

CRACKHEAD: (in Spanish) Policia! Policia! Me están robando. Auxilio! Me están asaltando!

(The POLICE OFFICERS get out of their police car and walk over to DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Misunderstanding, officers. I'm the victim here! The guy ripped me off. Here, look -

(DOGGETT hols up the shoe to the POLICE OFFICERS, trying to prove that the CRACKHEAD stole it from him.)

DOGGETT: Hey!

(One of the officers takes the sneaker and throws it to the ground behind him. He takes hold of DOGGETT. The other hits the CRACKHEAD in the stomach with his truncheon. The CRACKHEAD doubles up in pain.)

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish) Eres Americano? Tienes papeles?

(DOGGETT looks confused.)

POLICE OFFICER: Paper ... paper. Visa ... Passport?

(DOGGETT feels his pockets for some kind of identification, but can't find any. He shakes his head at the POLICE OFFICER.)

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish) Cuál es tu nombre? Nombre? What is your (pause) name?

(DOGGETT tries to give an answer, but after several seconds of thought, cannot remember. DOGGETT shakes his head again. He looks very confused.)

DOGGETT: I - I- er, I don't know.

SCENE 2
DAY TWO

(Fade in. We see we are in a prison cell. There are men standing and sitting on the floor, almost filling the holding cell. We notice DOGGETT standing in front of the bars, his one remaining sneaker on his left foot. He now has a dirty white sock on his right foot. He takes off his sneaker and uses it bang on the bars to attract attention.)

DOGGETT: Hey, guard! Come here! Andale! Hey, guard! Somebody come here!

(Failing to attract anybody, DOGGETT sits down and puts his sneaker back on. One of the other prisoners, DOMINGO, starts sniggering at DOGGETT as he laces up his sneaker.)

DOGGETT: Something funny?

DOMINGO: Nice touch. Putting it back on, your one shoe.

DOGGETT: Yeah, well, maybe I like to hop. You speak English, why didn't you say something before?

DOMINGO: You weren't funny before.

DOGGETT: Uh-huh. Where are we? What's the name of this place?

DOMINGO: What, the jail?

DOGGETT: The town? Tell me the name of the town. Tell me where I am.

DOMINGO: Sangradura.

DOGGETT: Mexico?

DOMINGO: Man, if you can't remember, you must have had one fine good time getting here. What's your name? (DOGGETT is still unsure.) Damn, you don't know that either, huh?

(Laughing, DOMINGO gets up and approaches DOGGETT.)

DOMINGO: (to DOGGETT) Call you "One Shoe." (He turns to the other prisoners) Señor un zapato, huh?

(Some of the other prisoner laugh at him.)

DOMINGO: One Shoe, what do you know?

DOGGETT: I know I'm getting the hell out of here.

DOMINGO: You got money to bribe the Police? That's what it takes.

DOGGETT: I just need to get to a phone and call the U.S. Embassy.

DOMINGO: Yeah, they can get you home, I guess. Where is home?

(DOMINGO moves closer to DOGGETT until he is only a few feet away from him.)

DOMINGO: (Quietly) You know what I think, One Shoe? Maybe getting home is not in your best interest.

DOGGETT: How's that?

DOMINGO: This isn't Tijuana or Cabo. We don't see Americans in this town unless they're on the run from something, somebody. This town ... people like you come here to disappear.

DOGGETT: People like me? You don't know me.

DOMINGO: Hey, *you* don't know you.

(DOMINGO walks away, leaving DOGGETT to consider this. DOGGETT turns away from the other prisoners and stares out of the cell, noticeably confused.)



SCENE 3

(Fade in. We are in a flashback scene. DOGGETT and his wife and laying in bed on a bright morning. DOGGETT's son, LUKE, jumps up and down on the bed, his feet straddling DOGGETT.)

LUKE: Daddy, daddy!

(DOGGETT suddenly wakes up from his dream, finding himself in the cell as dawn breaks.)



SCENE 4
DAY EIGHT

(The cell is now almost at bursting point. DOGGETT's attention is drawn to keys unlocking the cell door. Two men enter, the POLICE OFFICER and another man, NESTOR. The POLICE OFFICER calls out to the prisoners.)

POLICIA: Domingo Salmeron.

(DOMINGO gets up and walks over to the door.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish) Me estoy poniendo Viejo aquí encerrado.

NESTOR: (in Spanish) Trabajé lo más rápido que pude, esas cosas toman tiempo.

(The POLICE OFFICER gives DOMINGO his watch.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish) Caballeros, ha sido un placer.

(As he leaves the cell, DOMINGO looks back at DOGGETT. He single him out to NESTOR.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish) Cuánto por él? Es caro?

GUARD: (in Spanish) No mucho. Por qué? Estás enamorado?

(DOMINGO is now outside the cell, but walks towards DOGGETT, the cell's bars inbetween them.)

DOMINGO: Hey, One Shoe, nobody coming for you. You want to hop out of here with me? I've got a job for you.

(NESTOR tries to stop DOMINGO.)

NESTOR: Domingo?

DOMINGO: Nestor ...

(DOMINGO holds up his hand, motioning NESTOR to be quiet.)

DOGGETT: What kind of job?

DOMINGO: What the hell do you care?

(DOGGETT considers the offer.)



SCENE 5

(DOGGETT, DOMINGO AND NESTOR walk out of the COMISARIA DE POLICIA and into the street.)

DOMINGO (to DOGGETT): You work hard, maybe I'll even buy you another shoe. Right one, left one ... your choice.

(The two men stop by a car. DOGGETT keeps walking.)

DOMINGO: Hey! Right here!

DOGGETT: Thanks. Some other time.

(DOGGETT keeps walking away. DOMINGO and NESTOR follow after DOGGETT.)

DOMINGO: Hey! Hey!

(NESTOR grabs DOGGETT by the shoulder and pulls him around. DOGGETT quickly pulls away and stares back at him.)

DOGGETT: You watch your hands.

DOMINGO: You're bought and paid for. You understand? I own you like I own that car.

DOGGETT: I'll pay you back your money.

DOMINGO: You don't tell me what you'll do. I tell you what you'll do.

(DOGGETT walks off again, away from them. NESTOR suddenly pulls out a gun and holds it in the middle of DOGGETT's back. DOGGETT stops and turns slowly around to face NESTOR. DOGGETT then slowly raises his arms above his head, but then strikes NESTOR, taking him completely by surprise and forcibly taking his gun from him. DOGGETT quickly points the gun back at NESTOR, who takes steps backwards. He then aims at DOMINGO.)

DOMINGO: This makes one thing we know about you. You're not a man of your word.

(DOGGETT ponders this. He bends down to pick up his sneaker. He then takes the gun and opens the barrel, striking it with his shoe. Bullets fall to the ground. DOGGETT turns and walks away from them, tossing the now unloaded revolver into a nearby oil drum.)



SCENE 6

(Day. In the warehouse. DOGGETT sees the CRACKHEAD sitting down against a wall, smoking and speaking to himself.)

CRACKHEAD: (in Spanish) Cállate! Estoy tratando de concentrarme.

(The CRACKHEAD looks up and sees DOGGETT reaching down for him. DOGGETT pulls the CRACKHEAD to his feet. He is clearly not happy.)

DOGGETT: It fit good? Mi zapato. What else of mine you got? My wallet, my documents? Mi documentos?

CRACKHEAD: No. No documentos ...

DOGGETT: What else did you take from me? Show me what else you got. Show me! Show me! (In Spanish) Que es mío? Repito ...

(The CRACKHEAD pulls out a small charm from his pocket and holds it out to DOGGETT. It is a small silver skull, about the size of a fingernail. DOGGETT holds it between his forefinger and thumb.)

CRACKHEAD: Ya estuvo, no más. Desaparecido.

DOGGETT: Desaparecido? I'm desaparecido? (The CRACKHEAD nods.) What does that mean? No comprendo.

(THE CRACKHEAD draws his fingertips together and gestures to DOGGETT in the way a magician would gesture that something has disappeared.)



SCENE 7

(Night. DOMINGO is sitting at the bar next to NESTOR, drinking from a can of Tecata beer. He pours salt and lemon onto the rim of the can and takes a long drink. DOGGETT approaches them, and NESTOR points him out to DOMINGO. DOGGETT reaches the bar and stands next to DOMINGO.)

DOGGETT: What's the job?

DOMINGO: We're movers.

DOGGETT: What do you move?

DOMINGO: Mexicanos, Guatemaltecos, sometimes even Chinese. Drive them up north, across the border into McCallen.

DOGGETT: You're coyotes.

DOMINGO: Don't turn your nose up at me. For all you know, you've spent your life fondling little boys.

NESTOR: No digas que quieres trabajar con este hijo de perra.

DOMINGO: You start tomorrow. I'd invite you to have a drink with us but Nestor hates you. They'll rent you a room upstairs.

(DOMINGO gestures for DOGGETT to leave them.)

DOGGETT: I don't have any money.

(DOMINGO reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out some money. He puts some on the bar for DOGGETT.)

DOMINGO: First month's salary. Don't try and leave town.

(DOGGETT takes the money from the bar and starts to leave. He then turns around and holds out the silver skull charm.)

DOGGETT: This mean anything to you?

(NESTOR seems to recognize the charm but stays quiet. DOMINGO examines it.)

DOMINGO: Not a thing, other than the fact that you have silver in your pocket and you still ask me for money.

(DOGGETT takes his charm and walks away.)

NESTOR: (in Spanish: Que diablos estás haciendo? Esa es muy mala idea, Domingo. Tu no sabes lo que este hombre quiere) Why are you doing this? It's a bad idea, Domingo. You don't know what this one wants.

(DOMINGO shrugs him off.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: Sólo quiere acordarse, igual que todos los demás.) He just wants to remember. Same as all the rest.

(NESTOR looks back towards DOGGETT, clearly perturbed by the charm.)



SCENE 8

(Later. In his new bedroom, DOGGETT turns on the light and looks at himself in a small dirty mirror hanging from the wall. He checks himself over. As he looks at his head, he notices two bloodstained marks on either side of his forehead, just above his temples on his hairline. He takes of his dirty T-shirt and examines his neck and chest. He notices something on his left shoulder, a tattoo. He looks at it in the mirror. It reads "24th MAU, Lebanon '83. We Shall Not Forget".)

DOGGETT: I'm a Marine. Semper fi.



SCENE 9

(Outside in the street below DOGGETT's window, an older man, CABALLERO, is watching DOGGETT's silhouette through the window. He is wearing a silver bracelet on his arm, with small silver skulls hanging from it. There is a gap on the bracelet where we can tell one of the skulls is missing. The man lights a cigar and exhales.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 10
DAY TWELVE

(Day. KERSH's office at the FBI Building, Washington DC. SCULLY and SKINNER are sitting at KERSH's desk.)

KERSH: AD Skinner, Agent Scully. What's this I'm hearing about Mexico?

(SCULLY hands KERSH a photograph of DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: Well, this came in last night from US Customs. It's a blow-up from a security camera at the border crossing in Laredo, Texas. It was taken at 12:50 AM on the morning of the fourth.

KERSH: We're sure this is Doggett?

SKINNER: It's been scanned to Agent Reyes. She also believes it is him.

KERSH: I'd say this reshapes the investigation.

SKINNER: It's our first solid lead. Now with your permission, I'd like to contact our Legat's office and extend our task force south of the border.

KERSH: I'm not extending the task force. I'm disbanding it.

SCULLY: Excuse me?

KERSH: I see no other choice. For the past 12 days I've had 40 agents working overtime scouring the entire State of Texas, in what appears to be a waste of effort. I can't move them lock, stock and barrel into Mexico, not on the strength of this. Turn it over to the Mexican Federal Police. Doggett's in their jurisdiction, not ours.

(SKINNER looks very annoyed by KERSH's decision.)

SCULLY: Sir, he could be injured.

KERSH: Whether you believe it or not I want to find him as badly as you do. But the FBI's resources are already taxed by National Security concerns. There are political realities I have to account for.

SKINNER: Sir, Agent Reyes is still in San Antonio. She was raised in Mexico. She could offer the Federal Police some on-site help.

KERSH: She can help them all she wants. But from *this* side of the border.

(KERSH hands the photograph back to SCULLY.)



SCENE 11
FBI FIELD OFFICE
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

(In a glass-walled room, REYES is interviewing MR. MOLINA. His lawyer is sitting next to him.)

REYES: Mr. Molina, you're a hard man to get an audience with. I've been trying for the better part of two weeks. What's keeping you so busy?

MOLINA: Selling tractors. I own the biggest farm equipment dealership in South Texas. AGCO, John Deere, New Holland, CAT ...

REYES: Impressive. (in Spanish: Y acerca de las drogas? Están en su inventario también? Usted ya sabe... cocaina, AGCO, John Deere?) What about drugs? Are they on your inventory, too? You know... cocaine, AGCO, John Deere?

MOLINA'S LAWYER: I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.

MOLINA: She says I sell drugs.

(MOLINA's lawyer instantly objects.)

MOLINA'S LAWYER: Please don't speak Spanish anymore.

(REYES opens a file in front of her and takes out a photograph, putting it on the desk in front of MOLINA.)

REYES: You know Hollis Rice, don't you? Vice President of Pan American Mercantile?

(MOLINA picks up the picture and studies it.)

MOLINA: Sure. I do business with this man. I know he's missing.

REYES: My partner, John Doggett, was investigating his disappearance. I'm betting he came to you with questions.

MOLINA: When would this have happened?

REYES: Two weeks ago.

MOLINA: Sorry. I don't remember any person named Doggett.

MOLINA'S LAWYER: Agent, I don't quite know what you're implying. Mr. Molina's an upstanding businessman and a pillar of the c...

REYES: ... Pillar of the community? Does anyone actually use that phrase except Mob lawyers? I'll tell you what's clear to me. You're some kind of middleman in a smuggling operation. Hollis Rice laundered money for your cartel until something went wrong - maybe he got greedy, maybe he talked too much. Your cartel made him disappear.

MOLINA'S LAWYER: Agent...

REYES: My partner has disappeared, too. He's in Mexico, I know that much and I will find him, whatever it takes. Your only personal hope for the future is that I find him alive. Now where is he?

MOLINA'S LAWYER: Unless my client is under arrest, this meeting is over. No? Come on, Mariano.

(MOLINA'S LAWYER stands up and leaves. MOLINA stands. REYES stands and stops MOLINA before he leaves.)

REYES: (Whispering in Spanish: Piense bien en su futuro, Sr. Pilar de la Comunidad) Think hard about your future, Mr. Pillar of the Community.

(MOLINA leaves.)



SCENE 12

(Another flashback. Early morning. LUKE is jumping up and down on his dad's bed. DOGGETT is lying half-awake next to his wife. LUKE seems really excited.)

LUKE: Daddy.

DOGGETT: Hmmm?

LUKE: Get up, I want to show you something. Come on.

(LUKE jumps off the bed onto the floor. DOGGETT checks the time on an alarm clock. It's red display reads 5:28 AM.

LUKE: Let's go, Daddy! Come on! Please!

DOGGETT: Can it wait another hour?

LUKE: No.

DOGGETT: Why, what is it?

LUKE: A surprise. Come on!

DOGGETT: Shh, don't wake your mom.

(DOGGETT gets out of bed.)



SCENE 13

(As we fade in, we see DOGGETT in excruciating pain. A phone is ringing, the shrill noise causing him to wince. He notices that the phone is ringing. People are sitting around him, staring. The phone continues to ring. We see we are in the Police Station. There is a woman sitting at a counter. An officer is leaning against it, talking to her. The woman calls over to DOGGETT.)

OPERATOR: Señor? Señor? Cabina tres.

(The woman indicates the ringing phone. DOGGETT rises to get the phone.)

(We hear a phone ring.)

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: Marine Corps Public Affairs Office. Staff Sergeant MCCORMICK speaking.

DOGGETT: Yeah, uh ... this is Detective, uh...

(Still unsure of his own identity, DOGGETT checks the phone booth for names. His eyes come upon a sticker on the phone, advertising Ladatel "De Venta Aqui".)

..Ladatel calling from Mexico. I'm hoping you can give me some help.

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: Yes, Sir, if I can.

DOGGETT: We've got a Marine down here who's been hit by a taxicab. He's been messed up pretty good. He doesn't remember his own name. He doesn't have any ID. We need to contact his family. I-I assume there's somebody somewhere who's worrying about him.

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: Any chance you can give me a social security number or a date of birth?

DOGGETT: No, unfortunately, uh, the only thing I have to go by is there's a tattoo on his left shoulder that says "24th M.A.U. We shall not forget." You have any idea what that means?

(DOGGETT reads this from his own tattoo.)

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: Yes Sir, I do. The 24th Marine Amphibious Unit. It refers to the Lebanon barracks bombing in 1983. That narrows things down.

DOGGETT: Yeah, good, good. This guy's um, I don't know, he's six feet, 190 pounds, er, brown hair, blue eyes, about 40 years old. If you could just put a name to him. If you could just tell me anything at all about him. Anything.

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: We'll definitely look into it.

(DOGGETT's attention is drawn to the counter, where two POLICEMEN have entered the station and are talking to the woman.)

STAFF SERGEANT MCCORMICK: Detective, do you have a number where I can reach you? Detective?

(When the camera pans back to the phone DOGGETT was using, we see that he's hung up. DOGGETT is not there.)



SCENE 14

(Day. Outside a garage in the open countryside. A radio is on. A motor engine is revving. We find DOGGETT leaning over the open bonnet of an old bus, working on the engine. NESTOR is sitting in a chair, reading the paper and keeping a close eye on DOGGETT. DOMINGO walks into the garage.)

DOMINGO: Hey. (To DOGGETT) Sounding good.

DOGGETT: Sounding better than it was. It won't sound good until it gets new seals.

(DOMINGO walks over to NESTOR. He speaks in Spanish and kicks the box that NESTOR's feet are resting on.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish) Ah, tu ves? Más de lo que tu hayas hecho, sentado ahí.

(DOMINGO turns back to DOGGETT who continues to work on the engine. NESTOR looks angry.)

DOMINGO: Thank God I got somebody worth a damn. If you'd only drive for me.

DOGGETT: You got a few odd jobs, fine. I'm not breaking the law for you.

DOMINGO: A man of principle... as far as you know.

(DOMINGO takes out a folded piece of paper from his pocket. He unfolds it.)

DOMINGO: Found something out about you today.

(DOGGETT turns to DOMINGO, who gives him a sheet of paper. It's a "Wanted" poster "SE BUSCA".)

DOMINGO: You're not going to like it. Says your name is Henry Bruck. The Federales are looking for you in connection with a double murder. Doesn't give details but that description's you as far as I can see. Don't take it so hard. A man does what he does, I'm not judging you. Just keep away from the Federales, okay? (Placing his hand on DOGGETT's shoulder.) We'll keep you safe.

(DOMINGO leave the garage, tapping the bus as he leaves. NESTOR stares at DOGGETT with utter contempt.)



SCENE 15

(Night. NESTOR walks over towards the Mexican bar "Cantina Cabrera". Inside, NESTOR approaches the old man from earlier, CABALLERO, who is sitting alone at a table in the middle of the bar.)

NESTOR: (in Spanish: Puedo hablar con usted?) May I speak with you?

(The old man nods his head. NESTOR sits down at the table opposite him.)

NESTOR: (in Spanish: Usted ya conoce a Domingo, mi capataz? Es un amigo al Cartel, como lo soy yo. Domingo tomó sobre él a uno de los desaparecidos. Al americano. Pero éste americano, quien sea, es diferente. Pienso que le dijo algo que usted ya sabe.) You know Domingo, my boss? He's a friend to the Cartel, as am I. Domingo took on one of the disappeared ones. An American. But this American, whoever he is, he's different. (CABALLERO finally looks up at NESTOR.) I sense I'm telling you something you already know.

CABALLERO: (in Spanish: Él es un agente del FBI.) He's an FBI agent.

NESTOR: Why is he still alive? (In Spanish: Por qué todavía está vivo?)

CABALLERO: Same as everyone, I take my orders from the Cartel. My orders didn't mention killing the man. Of course, if he were to die tonight, it's no concern of mine. (In Spanish: Como todos aquí yo sólo tomo órdenes del Cartel. Mis órdenes no mencionan matar. Claro que si él muriera ésta noche, no me importaría.)

(NESTOR listens carefully to these words.)



SCENE 16
FBI FIELD OFFICE
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS

(SCULLY enters the office holding an overnight bag. She talks to a male agent who points across the room and hands her a piece of paper. She looks at it and heads over toward REYES.)

SCULLY: Monica.

REYES: Dana.

SCULLY: Surprise, surprise.

REYES: How did you escape Kersh's cost-cutting regimen? Did you see? He shut us down.

SCULLY: Well, actually he doesn't know that I'm here. Nor does he know that Skinner is headed to Mexico to consult with the Federal Police.

SCULLY: Perfect timing, I hope. Look what just got handed to me. (SCULLY shows the document to REYES.) This says that someone in Mexico is trying to track down a former Marine matching Doggett's description. It says that he was in an accident and possibly suffering from amnesia.

(REYES looks at the paper. She notices something.)

REYES: Wait... Detective Ladatel?

SCULLY: Yeah, that's who placed the call. Does that sound familiar to you?

REYES: Ladatel is a Mexican telephone calling card.

SCULLY: We'll trace the call.

(SCULLY leaves, as REYES considers this piece of information.)



SCENE 17

(Night. DOMINGO's garage. DOGGETT is working under the bus. He pauses to look at the silver charm. Approaching footsteps interrupt him.)

DOGGETT: Domingo, is that you? (The footsteps stop. NESTOR stops beside the bus.) Siempre trabajo.

NESTOR: I speak English, by the way.

DOGGETT: Yeah?

NESTOR: Yeah. See you in hell, FBI.

(NESTOR pulls out a gun from is jeans and aims it straight at DOGGETT. DOGGETT looks around and reaches for the air release on the pneumatic jack the bus is raised on. One of the bus' wheels crashes straight down on NESTOR's right foot, crushing it. NESTOR screams out in pain. He manages to pull his foot out from under the wheel. His foot and toes are heavily bloodstained and continue to drip blood. He picks himself up and looks for DOGGETT under the bus. DOGGETT is nowhere to be seen. NESTOR looks scared and holds his gun out in front of him. Suddenly, DOGGETT jumps down on him from above him. The gun fires. We see the flash through the dirty windows of the garage.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 18

(A white pickup drives down the dusty road and stops outside his garage. DOMINGO gets out and walks over to the garage door. He opens it and steps inside. DOMINGO hears nothing, and calls out.)

DOMINGO: Nestor?

(He sees NESTOR's body laying beside the bus. He rushes over.)

DOMINGO: Nestor!

(DOMINGO hears something moving behind him and turns.)

DOMINGO: You?

(DOGGETT is standing there, still holding the gun.)

DOGGETT: Did you send him after me?

DOMINGO: What? What's that mean? DOGGETT raises the gun and aims straight at DOMINGO.)

DOGGETT: Did you send him to kill me? Tell me who I am.

(DOMINGO turns away from DOGGETT.)

DOMINGO: I don't know who you are.

(DOGGETT screams back at DOMINGO, his desperation fully evident.)

DOGGETT: Tell me who I am!

(DOMINGO rises to face DOGGETT.)

DOMINGO: I don't know, you son of a bitch! But you killed my friend. You're a killer. That's who you are.

(DOGETT cocks the gun.)

DOMINGO: Desaparecido. You're one of the disappeared ones.

DOGGETT: What's that mean, disappeared? Disappeared by who?

DOMINGO: The cartel. They own the town, everything and everybody. People who make trouble for them wind up dead. Other people who make more trouble dead than alive get this.

(DOMINGO raises his hand and points to his temple.)

DOGGETT: They took away my memory? How? How do I get it back?

DOMINGO: You don't. That's the point.

(DOGGETT stares at DOMINGO.)



SCENE 19

(We quickly go through the flashback memories DOGGETT's already had. DOGGETT laying in bed with his wife. LUKE jumping on the bed, trying to get his attention. He glances at the clock. The boy gets him up eager to show him his surprise. DOGGETT gets out of bed to follow the little boy. The memories start to come back faster and faster.)

LUKE: Daddy? Daddy? Get up, I wanna show you something. Come on! Come on! Come on!

(Pain from these memories has caused DOGGETT to double over. He falls to his knees, the gun still in his hand. DOMINGO stands in front of him, watching. He leans down and takes the loaded gun from DOGGETT's hand. DOGGETT is still reeling in pain as DOMINGO hits him on the side of the head, knocking him to the ground.)



SCENE 20

(Night. A street. A group of POLICE OFFICERS are sitting at a shoe shine stand. A photograph of DOGGETT is placed on the table.

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish: Quién pregunta?) Who's asking?

(REYES slips some money on top of the picture.)

REYES: (in Spanish: Un grupo interesado.) Just a concerned party.

(The POLICE OFFICER looks down at the money.)

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish: Puedo ver una forma de identificación?) May I see some identification?

(REYES hands him a Mexican ID. We see the POLICE OFFICER is sitting, having his shoes shined. He takes the ID and checks it.)

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish: Eres mexicana?) You're Mexican?

REYES: (in Spanish: Nacida y criada.) Born and raised.

(She slips another bill on top of the first.)

REYES: (in Spanish: Por favor, ayúdeme hermano. Él me abandonó a mí y a mis hijos.) Please, help me brother. He ran out on me and my kids.

(The POLICIA stands up. His shoe shine is completed. He hands REYES her ID back and picks up the money.)

POLICE OFFICER: (in Spanish: Pensándolo bien , el turno anterior encontró a un americano. Es triste decir pero reportó que estaba bien golpeado) Come to think of it, our previous shift came upon an American. They reported he'd been beaten very badly, sorry to say.

(REYES looks concerned.)

REYES: (in Spanish: Dónde está ahorita?) Where is he now?



SCENE 21

(Night. The local morgue. The POLICE OFFICER pulls back a curtain as REYES enters. We see a body on a table, covered with a sheet. REYES enters the room, looking down at the body. Although the sheet is covering the person's head and body, we can see the victim's hairline, which looks very much like DOGGETT. REYES prepares for the worst as she slowly lifts the sheet. It is not DOGGETT.)

POLICE OFFICER: (In Spanish: Disculpe, no es el de la fotografía. Sólo un gringo vagabundo que llegó al pueblo) I apologize. It's not the one in your photo. Just some homeless gringo. I guess.

(REYES notices red, bloodstained markings at the side of the victim's hairline. They are just like the ones that DOGGETT noticed earlier.)

REYES: (in Spanish: Qué son esos?) What are those?

(The POLICE OFFICER shakes his head in silence.)



SCENE 22
DAY THIRTEEN

(Inside the bar, a waiter brings a cup of coffee over to CABALLERO, who is sitting alone at his table reading the newspaper. DOMINGO cautiously enters the bar and approaches him. They are the only people in the bar. DOMINGO doesn't sit down.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: Señor, mi amigo Nestor está muerto.) Sir, my friend Nestor is dead.

(CABALLERO motions for DOMINGO to sit.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: Vengo a usted porque me doy cuenta que Nestor no hubiera tratado de matar al americano sin su permiso.) I come to you because I realize Nestor would not have tried to kill the American without your permission.

CABALLERO: (in Spanish: Dónde está el americano ahorita?) Where is the American now?

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: Lo dejé tirado en mi garaje. Me apuntó una pistola pero se la quité.) I left him lying in my garage. He held a gun on me, but I took it from him.

CABALLERO: (in Spanish: ¿Le mataste?) You killed him?

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: No, se lo dejé.) I left him there for you.

CABALLERO: (in Spanish: Hablaste al americano mientras te estaba apuntando con la pistola, verdad? Qué le dijiste?) You talked with the American while he held a gun on you? (DOMINGO quickly nods.) What did you tell him?

(DOMINGO looks nervous, realising what is being implied.)

DOMINGO: (in Spanish: Nada.) Nothing.

(CABALLERO leans forwards, closer to DOMINGO.)

CABALLERO: (in Spanish: Se me hace dificil de creerte. Voy a tener que buscar la verdad con mis propios ojos) I find that hard to believe. I'm afraid I'll have to see with my own eyes.

(DOMINGO looks very scared now. CABALLERO's eyes begin to glow white and he raises his hands toward DOMINGO's temples. He presses the ends of his thumbs into DOMINGO's forehead, he hear his fingernails piercing the skin and blood starts to seep out of the wounds. CABALLERO's eyes glow as DOMINGO moans in pain.)



SCENE 23

(DOGGETT is still laying on the garage floor in pain. He gets up, seeing NESTOR dead on the floor. He hears a car approaching outside and goes to the window to investigate. DOGGETT searches for a weapon, and picks up a crowbar from the tool bench. He waits to one side of the door. The door then slowly opens, and REYES enters, keeping low with her gun drawn. DOGGETT takes a swing at her, but REYES drops and DOGGETT hits the door above her. She quickly turns and holds the gun on DOGGETT who raises his hands in surrender.)

REYES: John, I've been looking for you everywhere.

(Suddenly, DOGGETT disarms REYES and slams her up against the bus. REYES doesn't put up a fight. DOGGETT holds the gun on REYES. She doesn't move.)

DOGGETT: Who the hell are you?

REYES: I'm your partner Monica. Your name is John Doggett. You're an FBI Agent. Do you remember? John, trust me. We gotta leave. I'll explain it in the car but we're not safe here.

(DOGGETT hesitates momentarily, then lowers the gun and releases REYES. Outside, they hear more cars approaching the garage. DOGGETT and REYES go to the window to see three Police cars stop in front of the garage, blocking their only means of exit. The POLICE OFFICERS get out, armed with shotguns and revolvers, and take aim.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 24

(Outside. One of the POLICE OFFIERS is using a bullhorn to issue instructions to REYES and DOGGETT. REYES hovers near the window, translating what the officer is saying. DOGGETT is trying to secure the garage door with a heavy duty chain.)

POLICIA: (in Spanish) A todos los ocupantes del edificio. Salgan en estos momentos, inmediatamente! Salgan con las manos en alto!

REYES: They're telling us to come out.

DOGGETT: Sure, they want us to make it easy for them. Cartel owns the cops in this town. They're going to kill us.

REYES: They're going to try.

(In silent agreement, DOGGETT and REYES to fight on.)

DOGGETT: Take cover. It won't be long before they get tired of waiting.

(REYES and DOGGETT retreat further into the garage, and take refuge behind the bus. REYES crouches down, DOGGETT stands, armed with her gun.)

DOGGETT: So, we're partners, huh? How long we been working together?

REYES: Not long. But we've known each other for years.

(One of the POLICE OFFICERS outside shouts something on the bullhorn.)

POLICE OFFICER: (In Spanish) Tiene un minuto para salir, ahorita.

REYES (interpreting): They're giving us one minute.

(DOGGETT crouches next to REYES.)

DOGGETT: What's the name of my son? Think it's weird. It's the only thing I can remember is I have a son. I can see his face, but I can't remember his name.

REYES: Luke.

DOGGETT: Luke. How old is Luke? I can't even remember that.

(REYES suddenly looks very troubled. She turns to face DOGGETT, but is unable to say anything. DOGGETT remembers and understands what she's not saying verbally.)

DOGGETT: Oh God. Oh God, no.

(DOGGETT now remembers what happened to LUKE.)

DOGGETT: He's dead. He was murdered. Is that right? Is that right?

(REYES remains silent. She nods her head.)

DOGGETT: He was kidnapped. He was just a little boy. He was ... oh!

(DOGGETT breaks down, unable to continue. REYES is welling up now.)

REYES: The FBI got involved. I was assigned to the case. That's when you and I met.

DOGGETT: Oh God!

(Suddenly, the window breaks as a smoke grenade rolls is fired into the garage. REYES turns and quickly notices this. Thick white smoke begins to fill the garage. DOGGETT is still breaking down beside the bus. REYES leaps into action.)

REYES: Oh God, John, they're smoking us out. John, I need you here. I need you to focus here John.

(REYES grabs her gun from DOGGETT. She instinctively puts a rag over the smoke grenade and throws it back out the window, still smoking. As she throws it out of the window, the Police start firing at her. REYES shelters behind the garage wall as the police continue their assault. REYES quickly gets off a couple of shots then goes over to DOGGETT.)

REYES: John! JOHN! (She grabs hold of him, trying to shake him out of his depression.) If we're going to die here you're going to die on your feet! You hear me? (She shakes him.) Do you hear me?

(DOGGETT slowly raises his head and looks back at REYES. Outside the police continue their barrage as several dozen shots are fired toward the garage. DOGGETT moves his move.)

DOGGETT: Get in the bus.

(Outside, as the Police fire at the garage, the bus suddenly crashes out of the garage doors, smashing them to pieces. The bus is being driven in reverse, and as it picks up speed, DOGGETT steers it into the path of the police cars which are blocking their exit. The police officers struggle to get out of the way as it smashes through the blockade. Inside the bus, DOGGETT and REYES are clinging on to their seats. As the bus passes the blockade, the police start shooting at the bus, the front of which is now facing them. DOGGETT and REYES duck from the bullets being fired at the windscreen.)

DOGGETT: Hang on!

(The speeding bus continues in reverse, its left wheels riding up a small ridge. As the bus speeds backwards, it begins to lean over on its right side, until gravity takes over and causes the bus to fall on its right side. Inside, DOGGETT and REYES gets to their feet and wait, peering out of the bus's windows helplessly. The police officers begin to approach the overturned bus, their guns drawn.)

(Suddenly, from nowhere, a trio of Mexican Federal Jeep-type vehicles appear and stop in front of the approaching police officers. Armed Federal Police quickly overpower the police and wrestle them to the ground. AD Skinner gets out of one of the vehicles and looks around for DOGGETT and REYES. He notices the overturned bus, and approaches it with his Sig Sauer aimed in front of him. As he gets near to the bus, he can see DOGGETT and REYES through the dusty glass windscreen. He looks down at DOGGETT, who is now beginning to remember.)



SCENE 25

(Day. The Mexican bar. DOGGETT tosses the silver skull down onto a table. CABALLERO picks it up and examines it. DOGGETT is standing in front of him. Just inside the bar stand SKINNER, REYES and a Federal Officer.)

DOGGETT: You work for the cartel. You make their enemies disappear. Desaparecido. You understand me?

CABALLERO: I speak English, but I don't understand you.

DOGGETT: Like hell you don't.

(DOGGETT indicates the markings on his head.)

DOGGETT: You gave me these when you took my memory. I have no idea how you do it but everything I am, everything I have, my identity, you robbed that from me.

CABALLERO: I don't know who has been saying those things to you. How can you prove them?

DOGGETT: I was searching for a man, a banker from Texas. Hollis Rice was the banker. He was out of his mind, he didn't even know his name. You robbed him of that. And then you tried to do the same thing to me. You failed, you son of a bitch. I remember everything.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett. Leave him to us.

(DOGGETT takes a long look at CABALLERO, and turns to leave. As CABALLERO begins to speak, DOGGETT pauses and turns back.)

CABALLERO: Why would you want to remember? You can't tell me you're happier now, because you recall your life. I saw it all. So much pain. Why would you want to struggle, so long, and hard, to get that pain back?

DOGGETT: (Defiant/proud)Because it's mine.



SCENE 26

(Flashback scene. Day. LUKE leads his father outside. He picks up his red bicycle from the kerb and jumps on. He starts pedalling along the street and then turns back, looking back at his father.)

LUKE: Look, daddy! I can do it.

(DOGGETT looks on proudly, at his son's latest achievement.)



SCENE 27

(DOGGETT is leaning against one of the Federal Police vehicles in the street. He looks very tired and in need of a good, long shower. REYES walks over.)

REYES: John. I'm so sorry (pause) about Luke. About you having to relive that.

DOGGETT: I'll take the bad as long as I remember the good.

(REYES stands with him as he stares off into the distance, happy to be alive and to have his memories.)

[Fade to black]

[THE END]

                               HELLBOUND


SCENE 1
FIRST CALVARY CHURCH
NOVI, VIRGINIA

(Inside the church.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: I always said there's three kinds of people in the world: Them who make things happen, them who watch things happen and them who wonder what happened. I made things happen. The wrong things. I caused pain to anyone who came near me.

(TERRANCE PRUIT glances down at a large tattoo on his upper left bicep: "Hellbound".)

TERRANCE PRUIT: This tattoo used to be my badge of honor. I'm a different man since I've joined group. A better man. I never thought words like that would come out of my mouth. It's all because of the help and the love that I found in this room.

(In the back room of a small church, a group meeting is being held for rehabilitated ex-cons. A group of about a half dozen men is being led by a lone female doctor. She glances over at a man who isn't paying much attention to what's being said.)

DR. HOLLAND: You're new here. Is it Ed?

ED KELSO: Yeah, I'm new to this B.S.

DR. HOLLAND: Why do you think it's B.S.?

TERRANCE PRUIT: I mean, listen, man, I turned my life around. A lot of us here have.

ED KELSO: Our kind of lives go one way. You can't change any more than you can undo the crimes you've done.

TERRANCE PRUIT: Well, I feel sorry for you, man.

ED KELSO: Don't feel sorry. You going to hell just like I am, brother.

DR. HOLLAND: Why are you here, Ed?

ED KELSO: I drove Victor. He knows I'm right.

DR. HOLLAND: Victor's been doing good.

ED KELSO: Oh, yeah ... just look at him.

(VICTOR is sitting next to ED KELSO. He's a nervous man who keeps is eyes averted downward. He lights up a cigarette.)

DR. HOLLAND: Victor, you want to talk about it?

VICTOR DALE POTTS: I've just been having bad dreams. Really bad dreams.

DR. HOLLAND: What kind of dreams?

VICTOR DALE POTTS: Oh... seeing people skinned alive.

(ED KELSO is silent. DR. HOLLAND says nothing. TERRANCE PRUIT leans forward.)

TERRANCE: It's a hard road, Victor. It's a shock to the system: Changing the way we think taking charge of our lives. We're all afraid. And that fear preys on us night and day, brother. In our minds and in our dreams.

(VICTOR nods his head, never once looking at anyone. He goes back to smoking his cigarette.)



SCENE 2

(After group and still at the church.)

ED KELSO: You ever get enough of that crap? "A shock to the system" crap? "This fear preying on us night and day" crap? Those boys in there are afraid of one thing: Themselves... their true nature. You know what I'm saying, Victor?

VICTOR: Sort of.

ED KELSO: What do you mean, "sort of"? Don't tell me that bull does you any good. And don't tell me you feel any better about yourself coming here ... that it makes these nightmares go away.

VICTOR: No ... it don't.

(VICTOR looks at his friend ED KELSO and sees a skinned man.)

SCENE 3
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA
1:47 AM

(REYES is looking at a file of VICTOR DALE POTTS. The following information can be seen from the file:

[name] POTTS, VICTOR DALE,
[alias] none,
[address] #4 327 Lamer Rd., Novi, VA,
[number] R-7432 a,
[operator's license number] VA c54683 n,
[race] White,
[date of birth] March 8, 1960,
[place of birth] Parsons, VA,
[age] 41, single / male / height=75" )

(On the right side of the file are two pictures of VICTOR DALE POTTS. The right front view and the left side view pictures are labeled "Potts, V.D. R-7432 a".)

(The elevator door rings, the door opens and DOGGETT walks out. He's dressed casually in jeans, t-shirt and a leather jacket. He looks like he just got out of bed.)

DOGGETT: Hey.

REYES: Hi. Thanks for coming. Sorry about the hour.

DOGGETT: The way you sounded seemed like something that couldn't wait.

REYES: No. I need another set of eyes on it. I called Scully in, too.

DOGGETT: A little late to be looking for a sitter. What's so pressing? (She hands him a file.) "Victor Dale Potts." Ex-con, three-time loser, career criminal.

REYES: He was murdered five days ago. Scully's got the crime report.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry, what am I missing?

REYES: It's the way he was killed.

(REYES walks away. DOGGETT follows. They both enter the autopsy area where SCULLYS waiting.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

REYES: I'd like him to see the body.

(SCULLY lifts the sheet and whether it's the smell or the horror of the body itself, DOGGETT glances at it and turns away.)

DOGGETT: Damn. I've seen a bunch of these when I was a cop. It's a favourite of some of the pan-Asian gangs.

(The body has no skin.)

REYES: The difference is Victor Potts had a premonition of his death.

DOGGETT: And?

SCULLY: That was my question.

REYES: What I'm saying is, this man was skinned alive just hours after describing it in exact detail.

DOGGETT: Maybe he could describe it because maybe somebody threatened him.

REYES: He said it came in a dream, or a vision according to the woman who last spoke to him.

DOGGETT: Who's that?

REYES: Dr. Lisa Holland. She's a therapist who runs an anger management group for ex-cons.

DOGGETT: Lifelong criminal's bound to have some bad enemies. People capable of this very thing. I mean, unless there's something here that I'm just not seeing.

SCULLY: Well, from what I could see from my visual exam the skin was removed with considerable skill by someone using a hunting-type knife. Arteries and veins were left intact so as to prolong the period that the victim would suffer.

DOGGETT: Terrible way to die, for sure.

REYES: I know.

(At REYES' whispered words, both DOGGETT and SCULLY turn to look at her.)

SCULLY: Is there anything else ... Agent Reyes? Something special that brought this case to your attention as a possible X-File?

REYES: No. I just know I need to solve this and I'd appreciate your help.



SCENE 4
NOVI, VIRGINIA
9:35 AM

(A car stops in front of the First Calvary Church. The large sign in front of the church quotes Jesus: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." ~Luke 5:32-KJV. DOGGETT and REYES exit the car. They walk toward the lone law officer leaning against his car. Can't tell for sure, but those look like California license plates "BU-235B".)

VAN ALLEN (to DOGGETT): You Reyes?

DOGGETT: I'm Doggett. She's Reyes.

REYES: Detective Van Allen?

VAN ALLEN: That's right.

REYES: I appreciate your help on this.

VAN ALLEN: What help is that?

REYES: On this investigation.

VAN ALLEN: There isn't a lot to investigate. I mean, Victor Potts wasn't exactly one of the FBI's ten most wanted.

DOGGETT: I think she means your insight into the way he died, Detective.

VAN ALLEN: Don't have any. But I'm sure you'd rather talk to somebody who actually gives a damn, right?

(VAN ALLEN leaves the agents and heads toward the church entrance.)

DOGGETT: Hate to say it but, he probably sums up most people's feelings.

(The two agents follow.)



SCENE 5

(Inside the First Calvary Church.)

DR. HOLLAND: It's hard for the Victor Pottses of the world. Nobody cares much about them in life or in death.

REYES: Victor told the group a story about a dream he'd had.

DR. HOLLAND: These men are haunted by their pasts. That's why they're here.

REYES: But this dream came true.

DR. HOLLAND: Sometimes the past they want to escape won't let them. There was a man: Ed. He drove Victor to group that night. He was all over Victor's case.

DOGGETT: You think he could have killed him?

DR. HOLLAND: I try to help these men. Some have been violent, some still are. It's not my place to judge them.

DOGGETT: Dr. Holland there's justice to be served here. You can't forget that.

DR. HOLLAND: I'm sure Agent Reyes won't let me. Probably won't let anybody.

(REYES stands and offers her hand to DR. HOLLAND.)

REYES: Thank you for your help.

(REYES leaves the room. DOGGETT starts to follow, then pauses as something occurs to him.)

DOGGETT: She contacted you with this case?

DR. HOLLAND: I think the police would have given up on who murdered Victor Potts if it wasn't for her.



SCENE 6

(outside the church.)

(REYES walks out of the church and heads toward the parked car. She is interrupted by DET. VAN ALLEN who is leaning against the church wall in the shadows.

VAN ALLEN: You know something, Agent Reyes? You seem real familiar to me.

REYES: Excuse me?

VAN ALLEN: You ever visited Novi before?

REYES: No, I never have.

(VAN ALLEN smiles and nods his head at her. He seems smug and pleased as if he had just gotten away with something. REYES continues to walk toward the parked car. VAN ALLEN watches her.)



SCENE 7
MANERI MEAT PACKING
NOVI, VIRGINIA

(A large skinning knife cuts through the tough pink skin of a pig, slicing away the exterior leaving tender meat behind. ED KELSO is busy at work skinning the dead pig. He is a lone worker on a solitary worktable in the entire room. There are dozens of dead pigs hanging for him to work on. His work apron is bloodied. He concentrates on the job at hand.)

(TERRANCE PRUIT makes his way intently toward ED KELSO's work table. KELSO notices PRUIT approaching and gets defensive.)

ED KELSO: You eyeballing me? You got some kind of problem or something?

TERRANCE PRUIT: Problem? Your friend is dead.

ED KELSO: Yeah, I guess the good news is I get to move up the ladder here now.

TERRANCE PRUIT: You know how it happened.

(Holding the knife out, ED KELSO walks around the work table toward PRUIT. PRUIT takes a step back.)

ED KELSO: Now, why don't you just back off.

TERRANCE PRUIT: FBI wants to talk to me now because of the way he died. Going to want to talk to you, too.

ED KELSO: I got nothing to tell nobody.

TERRANCE PRUIT: You were messing with his head.

ED KELSO: I'd watch what you go saying.

TERRANCE PRUIT: Or what? You going to do me, too?

(A loud buzzer blares overhead. KELSO notes the signal to mark the end of his work day. He smiles at PRUIT, his knife still pointed at him.)

ED KELSO: I got a ride to catch.

(KELSO pockets the knife in the metal sheath he wears around his waist and walks away.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: Yeah, that's right; walk away. But just like you said you can't run from what you are.

(KELSO turns around.)

ED KELSO: Yeah, and I'll see you in hell.

(KELSO leaves. PRUIT follows, walking parallel to KELSO amidst the hanging pigs as he makes his way out. The look on PRUIT's face is one of startled fright as we notice that PRUIT sees a walking KELSO skinned. PRUIT follows KELSO out of the building. He bursts out into the stark daylight. A car starts. KELSO's in the car. He glares at PRUIT as he leaves. PRUIT stares at KELSO speechless.)



SCENE 8
FBI TRAINING ACADEMY

(Back at Quantico, an FBI Cadet places a stack of old file folders on SCULLY's desk. This is the same FBI Cadet who heckled SCULLY back in the beginning of class in *DAEMONICUS.)

FBI CADET: Here you go, Dr. Scully. Everything you ever wanted to know about skinning people but were afraid to ask. This is every case of removal of the human dermis I could find within the last dozen years.

SCULLY: Most of these are post-mortem skinnings.

FBI CADET: That's all I could find. And most of it's Asian gang-related like you mentioned.

SCULLY: Wait a minute. What's this?

(SCULLY opens a file folder from HAYWOOD COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. It's for a John Doe: [age] 40's; [sex] male; [colour] white; [height] 5'10"; [date of death] 03/08/60; [viewable:] no; [body condition:] skin stripped from body; etc. The accompanying discoloured picture of the body looks like its in the same condition as the body that SCULLY showed DOGGETT earlier.)

FBI CADET: I'm sorry I probably shouldn't have included that one because it's pretty much ancient history.

SCULLY: It's just ... there's a pattern. There's a pattern ... the way the skin's been stripped off. A match?

FBI CADET: No, but how could it be? Did you notice a date?

(The file reads Date of Death: 03_08_60.)

SCULLY: 1960.

(SCULLY ponders a possible X-Files connection ... )



SCENE 9
PARADISE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY
COLUMBIA, MARYLAND

(SCULLY carries the file folder and makes her way down a hallway. An old woman with a walker passes her by. SCULLY walks toward the open door to room #109. A television can be heard from inside the room. As usual, what's heard on the television is pertinent to the theme of the episode.)

[Television playing]: ... Inca and Mayan peoples. However, the priest thought the souls survived on earth as a little shrub, tree or other foliage, and ...

(SCULLY knocks softly on the door.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. Dr. Mueller?

(Music on TV plays )

SCULLY: Dr. Bertram Mueller?

(The man turns around.

DR. MUELLER: Yes?

SCULLY: My name is Dana Scully. I'm with the FBI. I want to ask you some questions about a John Doe you did an autopsy on in 1960.

DR. MUELLER: You honestly expect me to recall some case from way back when? I'm 84 years old.

SCULLY: Sir, this particular victim was skinned alive.

[CLOSED CAPTION SAYS: Will you button your blouse?]

(DR. MUELLER is quiet as he stares at SCULLY. It's obvious that he remembers the case.)

CUT TO:

(DR. MUELLER looks at both set of autopsy photos and through the casefile SCULLY brought with her.)

DR. MUELLER: In all my days, I never saw anything as inhuman as this.

SCULLY: Sir, I haven't located police records from the investigation. Was there ever a suspect who was charged or arrested in this case as far as you know?

DR. MUELLER: No suspects, no investigation for that matter.

SCULLY: I don't understand.

DR. MUELLER: The victim was a John Doe -- a nobody. Carl Hobart, the county sheriff, figured he was a drifter. Hobart said he didn't want to stir up the community.

SCULLY: And no one called him on that?

DR. MUELLER: I tried ... the sheriff had other things on his mind, I suppose.

SCULLY: Why do you say that?

DR. MUELLER: Well, it wasn't long after that he put a bullet through his head. What are you thinking, doctor? This is some copycat murder 40-odd years later?

SCULLY: If so, it's the most perfectly executed that I've ever seen. And why copy an obscure murder that nobody's ever even heard of?

DR. MUELLER: A string of murders.

SCULLY: I'm sorry?

DR. MUELLER: I thought you knew. John Doe was only the first.



SCENE 10
MANERI MEAT PACKING PLANT

(It's dark, the plant is closed and TERRANCE PRUIT is alone watering down and cleaning the floor. He washes the day's blood down the open drain. It is no different than what he's done every other night. Only this night, the lights go out. He is not amused.)

TERRANCE PRUIT (into the darkness): Hey, I'm working in here.

(He listens for the sounds of anyone else in the building. He hears nothing. He makes his way to the nearest light switch and flips it several times. The lights don't work. He turns around as he hears the menacing crescendo of Mark Snow's awesome music fill the night air. Oh, okay. He hears footsteps in the distance signaling that he is not alone in the building after all. He sees the shadow of a figure in the room. Not to be intimidated, PRUIT pulls out his own skinning knife. He thinks that ED KELSO's returned for him.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: Is that you, Ed? Come see what I got for you.

(PRUIT hears footsteps in the distance and makes his way to the next room. He sees the hanging pig in front of the plastic room divider swaying to and fro. Someone's been here. Not to be frightened off easily, he pursues the intruder with the knife in his hand. He looks around and doesn't see anyone, but he knows that someone's there.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: Tell you what. You best clear the hell out, whoever you are!

(He sees a figure run across the room through the hanging pigs and takes off in pursuit of the intruder.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: Hey!

(He reaches the spot where he saw the figure and finds nothing. Thinking that he might get a better glimpse of the person's feet, he slowly lowers himself to the floor. As he looks around, he sees nothing. Behind him the shadowy figure dressed in a worker's apron and wielding his own skinning knife makes his way around PRUIT's blind side. He knocks PRUIT out.)

(Someone has tied TERRANCE PRUIT to the hog hanging wrack. He is bound by his feet, hanging upside down and unclothed. The assailant is pulling the man up. TERRANCE PRUIT is hanging there -- his body no different than the other hanging pigs in the meat packing plant. Slowly, he regains consciousness. He sees his killer holding the skinning knife. He realizes what's about to happen.)

TERRANCE PRUIT: Oh, god! Oh, god, no! Let me go! Let me go!

(He screams in pain. Blood streams down TERRANCE PRUIT'S face. The man's continuous screams of pain echoes in the empty plant. Blood splatters down the drain in the floor.)



SCENE 12

(Back at the church.)

(It is dark. A light fog shrouds the stone walls of the First Calvary Church. REYES drives up to the church and exits the car. She enters the church looking for Dr. Holland. It's strange because there's light coming through the stained glass windows of the church as if it were daylight outside.)

REYES: Dr. Holland? Lisa?

(She walks further into the church. The church door behind her suddenly slams shut; its finality echoes throughout the empty church. REYES turns around.)

REYES: Dr. Holland?

(REYES makes her way back toward the closed door. She reaches the closed church door and opens it. A skinned figure stands outside.)

(REYES wakes up. She's been dreaming. DOGGETT opens her bedroom door.)

DOGGETT: Monica?

(DOGGETT is standing by REYES' room door. He's in a white t-shirt and concerned.)

DOGGETT: What the hell are you dreaming about.

(REYES is still disoriented.)

REYES: Nothing. It was a nightmare. How did you know to come in here?

DOGGETT: I was on the phone. I could hear you through the wall calling out.

(REYES glances at the clock. It reads 2:09 AM.)

REYES: Who were you on the phone to?

DOGGETT: Dr. Lisa Holland. That anger-management group she runs, it's getting smaller.

(REYES gets out of bed.)



SCENE 13
MANERI MEAT PACKING PLANT

(Inside the Meat Packing Plant amidst the hanging pigs, VAN ALLEN stands near the skinned body of TERRANCE PRUIT. PRUIT is still hanging upside down. He glances over and sees one of his men talking to REYES and DOGGETT who are trying to get into the crime scene area.)

VAN ALLEN: It's okay. Let 'em through.

(He waves to DOGGETT and REYES.)

REYES: What happened to the lights?

VAN ALLEN: Somebody cut 'em. Might want to watch your step. We got some blood on the floor. Not as much as you'd expect.

(VAN ALLEN shines the light on the floor to indicate the blood he was talking about. He moves his flashlight from the floor to the roof and down the body to show the agents the body. When the light shines on the perfectly skinned body of TERRANCE PRUIT, REYES realizes that she's looking at the body she saw in her dream.)

REYES: Oh, my god!

(She turns to run outside for some air. DOGGETT tries to stops her; he is concerned for her.)

DOGGETT: Hey, you okay? Monica?

(REYES rushes past DOGGETT and outside where she catches her breath and ponders what's going on. Just what is her connection to all of this? She is clearly upset. Outside, police lights flash. Officers come and go all around her. A car pulls up and SCULLY exits the vehicle.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes, I got a call from Agent Doggett. He said there's another victim. (SCULLY notices that REYES is distressed.) Monica, you okay?

REYES: I'm just catching my breath.

SCULLY: Well, if you're up for it, I've got something to show you. Case files from crimes back in 1960.

REYES: What are they?

SCULLY: More skinned bodies ... cut with the same precision as the body I examined.



SCENE 14

(Inside the meat-packing plant.)

(DOGGETT is kneeling on the floor looking closely at the body still hanging from the ceiling. He's staring at PRUIT's skinned face trying to discern what's going on. He looks closer and closer and he finally notices something.)

DOGGETT: Can I see the light a second?

(DOGGETT moves in closer to the skinned man's face. Holding the flashlight in one hand, he lifts a gloved finger and pokes the man's cheek. The man moves. DOGGETT is horrified as he registers that PRUIT is not dead. Not yet.)

DOGGETT: Holy God, he's still alive! Somebody get in here and get him down! We need a medic in here! (to PRUIT) Can you hear me? Do you understand? Who did this to you? Do you know who did this to you?

(PRUIT tries to speak. All we hear is the vowel sound "eeehhahh" ... interpret that as you want.)



SCENE 15
ED KELSO'S RESIDENCE

(ED KELSO is desperately packing. He's putting his meagre possessions in a carry suitcase. He's packing away his knives, more knives, even more knives and a shirt. He's got more knives than underwear. His girlfriend ROXANNE is in bed. She's wearing a skimpy tank top.)

ROXANNE: Are we going somewhere, baby?

ED KELSO: You're not. Get out.

ROXANNE: Eddie?

ED KELSO: What'd I just say?!

ROXANNE: But I'm not even dressed.

ED KELSO: What else is new? Get out!

(ED KELSO tosses some clothes to ROXANNE. She angrily gets out of bed and gets dressed. She hurries past him and out the door.)

ROXANNE: Why are you such a jerk?

(ED looks downright scared. ROXANNE leaves the room. ED takes a second to listen to her leave, then continues to pack. As she clears the door, she is grabbed from behind by DOGGETT who is standing right outside with VAN ALLEN and police backup. He signals her to be silent. She gets the message and makes her way silently out of the danger to come. DOGGETT signals the police officers to wait. He pulls his gun and bursts through the door. The living room is empty. He slowly makes his way through the living room and checks the open dining room. That's empty, too. From the bedroom, ED KELSO walks out. He spots DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: FBI! Stop right there!

(KELSO runs. DOGGETT chases him out of the house and through the back yard. KELSO barely gets across the yard when DOGGETT tackles him.)

DOGGETT: What part of "stop right there" did you not understand?

(With KELSO on the ground, DOGGETT handcuffs his hands behind him.)



SCENE 16
NOVI POLICE STATION

(ED KELSO sits in the interrogation room. DR. LISA HOLLAND is with him while REYES and DOGGETT watch outside. DR. HOLLAND exits the room and stands in front of DOGGETT. She looks tired, sad and worn.)

DOGGETT: So, what? He's just waiting for his lawyer? That's what he's doing?

DR. HOLLAND: He's in a bad place. I've been there myself once or twice sitting right where he is now, not thinking you have a chance.

DOGGETT: Yeah? You ever murdered two men?

DR. HOLLAND: He's four years out of prison holding down a job, showing up to work sober. Why do it? Kill a friend and a co-worker?

(REYES looks through the glass over at KELSO who seems more scared than anything.)

DOGGETT: You're the one that said he was a hothead, right? Why run if you're not guilty? Bag packed to hit the road ... packed with knives?

REYES (thoughtful): I don't think we're going to find the murder weapon on him.

DOGGETT: What makes you say that?

REYES: Because I think this man here is running from something else. I want to talk to him.

(REYES enters the interrogation room. KELSO watches her enter. REYES sits down.)

REYES: Hi. My name is Monica. I know what you're thinking, that I must be the good cop.

ED KELSO: No such thing.

REYES: You didn't do it, did you? (Tears run down KELSO's face.) Your friend, Victor, he said he had bad dreams seeing things. I think you're seeing them now.

ED KELSO: How would you know?

REYES: Maybe I see them, too.

(KELSO looks up at REYES. She meets his gaze, her own eyes filled with unshed tears. For a moment, she's connecting with KELSO. DOGGETT opens the door to interrupt the questioning.)

DOGGETT: Can I talk to you for a second?

(REYES walks about of the room.)

DOGGETT: You want to explain to me what you're doing in there Agent Reyes?

REYES: I'm trying to make a connection.

DOGGETT: Hell of a way to do it. I can see this guy's defence already. "Your honor, I was having bad dreams ... seeing things. Ask Agent Reyes, she's seeing 'em, too." Something you're not telling me?

(REYES looks as if she wants to share something with DOGGETT when they are both interrupted by VAN ALLEN who confidently, almost insolently, makes his way to the interrogation room.)

VAN ALLEN: You two about finished?

DOGGETT: With what?

VAN ALLEN: The suspect. He's not our man.

DOGGETT: What are you talking about?

VAN ALLEN: Girlfriend vouched for him. Said they were getting hammered down at the bent oak from 6:00 till closing. Bartender confirms it.

(VAN ALLEN enters the room where KELSO is and tells KELSO the good news. DOGGETT watches KELSO. REYES looks at DR. HOLLAND. They wait as KELSO exits the room.)

DOGGETT: I know where you live, partner.

DR. HOLLAND: You're always welcome at group.

(KELSO lifts his eyes hesitantly at DR. HOLLAND and we see that he sees her skinless. He quickly averts his eyes and walks out. A cell phone rings.)

REYES: Agent Reyes.

SCULLY: I need you to come to Quantico right away, Monica.

[CLOSED CAPTION READS: SCULLY: What's your connection to this case, Monica?]

REYES: Why?

SCULLY: I have something to show you.



SCENE 17

(Back at Quantico.)

(SCULLY is dressed in her scrubs in the autopsy bay looking down at something. When REYES enters the room, she looks up, but doesn't move from her position behind the skeletal remains.)

REYES: Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Agent Reyes.

REYES: What are these?

SCULLY: I showed you files of men killed in 1960 skinned alive like the current victims. Well, I had two of those bodies exhumed looking for crossover forensic details.

REYES: Are there any?

SCULLY: Yes, there are cuts in the bone ... on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles that matched the cutting pattern that I found on Victor Potts ... using the exact same knife which left a signature pattern of grooves.

REYES: Same knife, same killer that's what you're saying, right?

SCULLY: Well, it's even weirder than that. (Both women leave the autopsy bay area and enter SCULLY's office. On her desk are various open old file folders.) I ran bios and backgrounds from the victims from 1960.

REYES: They're both ex-convicts like the current victims?

SCULLY: Mm-hmm. But look at the date that they died.

REYES: March eighth, 1960. June 21st, 1960.

(The date of death for the two 1960's cases were March 8, 1960 [Lipson-age 41] and June 21, 1960 [Dooley-age 39]. Scully then uses Lipson and Dooley to compare with Victor Potts and Pruit's birthdays.)

(File folder information are as follows: Potts is 41 years old. Same file information mentioned earlier plus the following: [weight] 185, [build] med, [hair] brown.)

(Terrance Pruit's file: [alias] none; [address] 188 Weaver Ct. Novi, VA, [number] R-7436 a; [operator's license number] VA c54663 n; [race] white; [dob] June 21, 1960; [pob] Craigsville, VA; [age] 41; [weight] 175; [build] med.)

SCULLY: Birth dates of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit. Potts and Pruit were born on the same dates that the previous victims died. You knew that we'd find something like this didn't you, Agent Reyes? How?

(REYES looks at SCULLY. She doesn't know.)



SCENE 18

(Outside Ed Kelso's Residence.)

(DOGGETT stops outside ED KELSO's house. He glances over at the darkened house. Something doesn't feel right. The police surveillance he ordered for KELSO is nowhere to be seen. His cell phone rings interrupting his thoughts.)

DOGGETT: John Doggett.

REYES: Where are you?

DOGGETT: Sitting outside the suspect's house wondering where the surveillance is I ordered.

REYES: I need a birthdate on him.

DOGGETT: Who?

REYES: The suspect, Ed Kelso. It's important. He may be in danger.

DOGGETT: He may be gone. I'll call you.

(DOGGETT hangs up and exits the car. He quickly and quietly makes his way to the house. He suspects that KELSO may have ran while no one was looking. DOGGETT's on the cell phone.)

DOGGETT: Yeah, this is John Doggett. I need to speak with Detective Van Allen. I'll hang on. Just get him.

(DOGGETT knocks on KELSO's front door. There's no answer.)

DOGGETT: No, I'm still holding.

(DOGGETT peers in through the residence side window and sees something that horrifies him. He breaks the door down and enters the premises. He hasnt drawn his weapon. DOGGETT finds ED KELSO on the table in the middle of the room, skinned. There's a blue cloth stuffed inside his mouth. The blood is still fresh as it glistens and drips off KELSO's newly skinned fingers.)



SCENE 19

(Ed Kelso's Residence.)

(REYES drives toward the house. She's carrying the files given to her by SCULLY. DOGGETT is angry and disgusted with VAN ALLEN who doesn't seem to care two bits about the case at all.)

DOGGETT: I said this house was supposed to be under a 24-hour watch.

VAN ALLEN: Patrolman says he wasn't gone more than five minutes.

DOGGETT (angry): You see that man in there? You think it takes five minutes to do that to somebody, detective?

VAN ALLEN (doesnt care): I don't know how long it takes, Agent Doggett. Only know you said watch him so he don't run.

(VAN ALLEN walks away. DOGGETT moves to continue to argument, but REYES stops him.)

REYES: Agent Doggett ...

(DOGGETT sighs and turns his attention to REYES.)

REYES: I have something to tell you.

(The both turn back toward the house.)



SCENE 20

(Inside Ed Kelso's House.)

(REYES is standing near the door. DOGGETT is on the other side of the room studying the files that REYES gave him; the covered body of ED KELSO still on the table lies between them. The cloth covering the body is soaked with blood. I guess this time they made sure the body was dead.)

DOGGETT: This thing with the birthdays is weird, no doubt about it. Looks to me like we're dealing with a real sick puppy here.

REYES: I don't think so.

DOGGETT: Choosing your victims because of their damn birth dates it's the very definition of a serial killer. I think we should get the boys from behavioural science out on this.

REYES: No. (DOGGETT stops at the finality in her voice.) That's not what's happening here.

DOGGETT: It's the only thing that makes sense.

REYES: To you.

(DOGGETT sighs. He prepares himself to listen to REYES' explanation.)

DOGGETT: Okay, what do you think it is?

REYES: He knew he was going to die. He had a premonition of his death. Just like the first victim did.

DOGGETT: So how do you figure that?

REYES: I'm involved in this some way. I have some kind of memory of it. It's all happened before and now it's happening again.

DOGGETT: You mean that it's a copycat and you have some kind of recall.

REYES: These men were born to die this way. The same way they died before.

DOGGETT: The same way they died before?

REYES: Not the men ... but their souls. Their souls are murdered over and over again from one lifetime to the next. By someone who won't let them rest.

DOGGETT: So how's this happening ... their souls coming back? [It's] Reincarnation?

REYES: It doesn't strike you that these men were all born on the dates of the previous victims' deaths?

DOGGETT: Yeah, it strikes me. It strikes me that the killer is clever.

(REYES wants to prove to DOGGETT that she's right. She needs to. She stares at KELSO's cloth-covered body.)

REYES: A rag is stuffed in his mouth. A dirty rag. Black with soot.

(DOGGETT stares at REYES as her words register. How does she know this information? The body has been covered all this time. He saw the cloth. She didn't. REYES lifts the cloth to reveal that her words are true.)

REYES: Coal dust ... from a coal mine.

DOGGETT: How the hell did you know that?

REYES: I don't know.



SCENE 21
FITZGERALD MINING COMPANY

(Outside the old mines, DOGGETT and REYES park their car. The old wooden sign in front reads: K. FITZGERALD MINING COMPANY  1868. Both agents exit the car, their huge flashlights already shining thick beams into the cold night air. They make their way toward the mine shed. DOGGETT must have been convinced by REYES' mind-reading performance because he is strangely/silently cooperative.)

DOGGETT: So what are we looking for?

REYES: I don't know exactly. But if the old files are correct there's going to be a fourth victim.

(They peel the plyboards blocking the old mine shed and peer inside. There's old metal furniture, cobwebs, dust and lots of junk.)

DOGGETT: It looks like housekeeping hasn't been here in awhile.

REYES: You or me?

(They look at each other coming quickly to a silent agreement. DOGGETT continues to peel the plyboards away while REYES continues on further outside.)

REYES: I'll check out the mine.

(REYES approaches the entrance to the old mine. With little effort, she pulls the lock away from the door. The mine is old, dusty and covered with cobwebs. Going deeper into the mine, REYES approaches a wall covered with various old newspaper clippings and photographs. She takes a moment to study the display.)

ARTICLE 1: "Skinned Body Still Unidentified" (I'm presuming that this was the John Doe in 1960).

ARTICLE 2: "Sheriff Carl Hobart Victim of Suicide" photograph shows the Sheriff with a bullet wound in his head.

(In the accompanying search, DOGGETT finds an old skeleton in a sitting position leaning against the wall of the hut. He doesn't look thrilled at the find. The bodies keep piling up. He moves in for a closer examination of the skeleton.)

(REYES continues to read:)

ARTICLE 3: "Fourth Skinned Body Found - Authorities Without Suspect"

ARTICLE 4: (dated Monday, September 27, 1909) "Lawman Disappears After Failing to Catch Killer" -- "The body of local drifter, *** ***, was found yesterday ... ". The accompanying photograph shows a well-dressed man with a derby hat, tie, pin-striped suit and a sheriff's badge on his lapel.

(DOGGETT, meanwhile, notices the sheriff's badge on the scrap of cloth on his skeleton. The skull has a bullet hole on the upper left forehead. An old six-shooter is next to the skeleton's right hand. DOGGETT picks it up and studies it closely. This body is probably the 1909 Lawman mentioned in ARTICLE #4.)

(REYES continues to read:)

ARTICLE 5: "Prospector Slain in Mining Claim Dispute" "The body of local prospector, *** ***, was found ... "

ARTICLE 6: (dated Tuesday, November 3, 1868) "Murderers Acquitted: Prosecutor Says Justice Not Served"

.. and finally, a photograph: four men standing at the mouth of a mine around a skinned body.

(REYES studies the photograph closely. She is interrupted by a rustling sound from behind her. REYES moves deeper into the mine and finds a hanging wall of plastic separating the outer mine from the inner mine. She moves past the plastic and finds, hanging one by one against it's own plastic backing, the skin shells of the men who were murdered. Rows of them, one after the other. REYES walks in further to the final bloodied three hanging in the back: VICTOR DALE POTTS, ED KELSO and finally, TERRANCE PRUIT with his faint but distinctive tattoo: "Hellbound". Paydirt.)

(REYES is startled by a faint rustling noise behind her. Through the plastic she sees the outline of a man.)

MAN (with a raspy voice): You shouldn't have come here.

(REYES pulls out her gun at the shadowy figure beyond the plastic sheeting.)

REYES: I'm a federal agent. I'm armed.

(REYES makes slowly advances toward the shadowy figure. She makes her way through the plastic sheeting and advances toward the mouth of the mine. No one is there. She passes THE MAN without noticing him hiding in the shadows. He comes up behind her and holds a skinning knife to her neck.)

MAN (with the raspy voice): Let go of the gun now.

(REYES complies and drops her gun.)

MAN (with the raspy voice): You can't stop it. You never do. (The man moves closer to her. His face clear in the light cast by the flashlight. It's VAN ALLEN.) You always fail. It's your lot.



SCENE 22

(Back at the Fitzgerald Mining Company.)

(DOGGETT opens the door to the mine. He enters looking for REYES.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes. Monica!

(REYES is on the floor on her hands and knees. She's coughing, gasping for air. DOGGETT rushes to her side.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes. Are you hurt? Talk to me.

REYES: He was here.

DOGGETT: Who?

REYES: Van Allen. He's who's killing these men.

DOGGETT: Van Allen?

REYES: He was skinned himself. Back in 1868 by four men in a mining dispute. His killers were never punished. Now he's born to keep avenging that injustice. Again and again.

DOGGETT: Van Allen's the cop here.

REYES: That's why these cases never get solved. Every time, four murders. Every time, four bodies. Then he takes his own life so he can just start it up all over again. There's still a fourth victim, and I think I know who it is.

(REYES stands up and heads out the mine.)

[Transcriber's note: Just to be clear on this, the four victims are: (1) VICTOR DALE POTTS, (2) TERRANCE PRUIT, (3) ED KELSO, and (4) DR. LISA HOLLAND (non victim).]



SCENE 23

(First Calvary Church.)

(A phone rings. The Group is breaking up. DR. HOLLAND answers her ringing cell phone.)

DR. HOLLAND: Lisa Holland.

REYES: Dr. Holland, it's Monica Reyes. You've seen the visions, haven't you? Just like the others in your group. Visions of people skinned alive. It's true, isn't it?

DR. HOLLAND: How did you know?

REYES: Where are you now?

DR. HOLLAND: I'm just finishing a session.

(The last person closes the door behind him.)

REYES: Is there anybody with you?

DR. HOLLAND: No, they've all left. Why? What's this about?

REYES: Get out of there. You're in danger. It's Detective Van Allen. He's coming after you.

(DR. HOLLAND hears footsteps approaching the closed door. Through the opaque glass, she sees a male arm reaching for the doorknob.)

REYES: Dr. Holland? Dr. Holland.

(VAN ALLEN enters the church back room. He's looking for DR. HOLLAND. A skinning knife in his hand.)

VAN ALLEN: Time's come! You're the last.

(VAN ALLEN cautiously makes his way through the back room and heads toward the back door. DR. HOLLAND waits till he passes her and ducks into the back room to check it out before she makes her break out of the session room and into the church. VAN ALLEN hears her and quickly pursues her.)

VAN ALLEN (running after her): No use running. It always ends the same.

(DR. HOLLAND runs clear through the church and out the door which slams shut behind her. VAN ALLEN reaches the door. He pulls it open and finds himself staring down the barrel of REYES' FBI-issued gun. DR. HOLLAND in safe in DOGGETT's arms. VAN ALLEN hesitates for a moment before he moves toward REYES with his skinning knife. REYES fires. VAN ALLEN falls to the floor barely alive.)

REYES: Get the paramedics out here.

VAN ALLEN (choking): You ... always fail.

(REYES grabs VAN ALLEN'S shirt. She's agitated by his words.)

REYES: You're not dying on me. Not until you tell me what you mean!

(DOGGETT grabs REYES and pulls her off of VAN ALLEN. REYES is upset. They're both staring at the man who has all the answers.)



SCENE 24

Inside a hospital ICU.)

(The ICU heart monitor attached to VAN ALLEN steadily beeps. REYES stands nearby watching VAN ALLEN through the glass window. DOGGETT approaches REYES from behind. He stops when he reaches her. MONICA hasn't taken her eyes off of VAN ALLEN to acknowledge DOGGETT's presence. He's concerned for her.)

DOGGETT: Doc says it's going to be touch-and-go tonight ... that we should go home. Go on, Monica. Go on home. There's nothing you're going to learn here now.

(REYES looks at DOGGETT.)

REYES: You still won't believe it, will you? My connection to this man.

DOGGETT: However you did it ... however you knew what you know what matters here is you saved a woman's life.

(He places a comforting hand on her shoulder and leaves. SCULLY approaches.)

SCULLY: He's trying. We all are. It's just a long way to go from this... (holding the photograph) ... to this ... (indicating VAN ALLEN on life support beyond the glass window.)

REYES: Do you believe in second chances, Dana? A chance to correct the mistakes we make in our lives?

SCULLY: You mean in a future life?

REYES: That's what these people were trying to do. All the victims ... trying to atone for their sins from what happened in that photo. Only this man wouldn't let them.

[photo caption reads: "Four men stand over a skinned body at Fitzgerald mining camp. c. 1868. ... " and " ... killed in a claim dispute by the men standing over his corpse. No persons ... " ]

SCULLY: And Lisa Holland? What about her?

REYES: She was one of them. One of the men you see standing there.

SCULLY: And you?

REYES: Whoever I was, I failed. In 1868. In 1909. In 1960, I failed. I was always there, but I couldn't stop the killings. And he knew that. Just like he knows I'm here right now. He feels me -- the way I felt him when I saw that picture of the first victim. And somehow he knows my deepest fear that I'll fail.

SCULLY: Well, maybe in this life you succeed.

REYES: Maybe.

(REYES doesn't look convinced.)

(VAN ALLEN begins to go code. He flatlines. REYES watches in horror as the workers attempt to resuscitate him and fail. VAN ALLEN dies.)

(Somewhere, a baby boy cries in a hospital nursery.)

[THE END]

SCENE 1

NARRATOR: Previously on THE X-FILES:

[from BIOGENESIS (6X22): DR. MERKMALLEN sitting at his desk holding two pieces of metal artifacts. He puts the two pieces together like edges of a puzzle, the singular piece of artifact flies out of his hands and across the room where it beelines toward and imbeds itself into The Holy Bible.]

[from BIOGENESIS (6X22): SCULLY kneeling in the sand on the beach brushing away sand from the metal hull of a buried spacecraft. Overhead shot of the spacecraft and SCULLY on the beach.]

[from BIOGENESIS (6X22): SCULLY in the tent on the floor piecing the rubbings like a giant jigsaw puzzle.]

SCULLY: It appears to be a craft covered in symbols, which I now understand are part of a complex communication.

AMINA NGEBE: It is the Word of God.

[from EXISTENCE (8X21): WILLIAM wrapped in blankets (SCULLY'S holding him) and MULDER moving the blanket away from his face to get a better look at him.]

SCULLY (V.O.): They want my baby. Why?

[from NIHT1 (9X01): DOGGETT talking to SCULLY.]

DOGGETT: Your pregnancy was a result of a government cloning experiment to try and create a super soldier.

[from TRUSTNO1 (9X08): The NSA Man speaking.]

[from NIHT1 (9X01): SCULLY watches the mobile over WILLIAM'S bassinet move, WILLIAM crying, SCULLY not happy.]

THE NSA MAN (V.O.): You saw your son affect the mobile over his crib. He spun it as if with his mind.

[from TRUSTNO1 (9X08): SCULLY typing the e-mail to MULDER. She turns to look at WILLIAM. Camera on WILLIAM.]

SCULLY (V.O.): I'm scared for you, Mulder, and for William ...

[Fade to black]



SCENE 2
U.S. - CANADIAN BORDER
BURKE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA

(Night time. In the darkness, two officers of the U.S. Border Patrol sit in their car. The continuous garbled radio transmission breaks the silence of the night.)

RADIO DISPATCHER: This is sector station to unit one. Unit one, please report.

DRIVER AGENT: Unit one reporting. No traffic or unusual activity, sector station.

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Tell her my ass is freezing off and I need someone out here to get the blood circulating.

DRIVER AGENT: Sector station, Agent Daley here has a very special request.

(AGENT DALEY turns to glare at his partner. His partner grins and shows him the mike.)

DRIVER AGENT: The mike's off, man.

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Don't scare me like that, man.

DRIVER AGENT: Aww, come on. Keeps you awake, don't it?

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Yeah. (He's not really listening anymore.)

(AGENT DALEY looks through his night binoculars to the distance where he sees movement.)

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Something moving.

DRIVER AGENT: Where?

(PASSENGER AGENT hands the binoculars over to the DRIVER AGNET.)

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Coming right through the trees. Straight ahead. See it?

DRIVER AGENT: Got it!

(The two officers take off in their SUV after the lone rider on the motorcycle in pursuit. The cyclist sees the officers and takes off.)

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Unit one to sector station we are in pursuit ... in pursuit of an illegal border crossing.

(THE AGENTS quickly catch up with the MOTORBIKE RIDER and continue to tail him. With frequent backward glances, THE MOTORBIKE RIDER manages to stay ahead of THE AGENTS. Suddenly, the MOTORBIKE turns off of the road and into the open field. The SUV manages to keep up with the MOTORBIKE.)

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): Rabbit's running for the hole.

(THE MOTORBIKE RIDER doesnt let up and keeps going through the field and into the trees. The two go some distance until finally THE SUV stops.)

PASSENGER AGENT (AGENT DALEY): End of the road, buddy.

(The MOTORBIKE RIDER glances back and notices that the SUV stopped. He continues on over the hill and into the ravine where he hits the ground.)

(The motorbike explodes. The two agents exit the SUV and visually sees the damage below. The TWO AGENTS run back to their vehicle to get help. Amidst the rubble, The motorbike rider is sprawled on the ground unmoving. Next to him, this backpack is open its contents spilling out: Sheathes of paper with rubbings of symbols.)

SCENE 3

(Kershs Office.)

(Just outside KERSHS office, SCULLY enters and approaches his assistants desk.)

SCULLY: Agent Scully. He's expecting me.

KERSH'S ASSISTANT: Go right in, Agent Scully. They're all waiting for you.

SCULLY: "They"?

KERSH'S ASSISTANT (nodding): Mm-hmm.

CUT TO:

(Inside KERSHS office, KERSH is there with a lot of upper FBI senior officials including FOLLMER and SKINNER. Also there is the infamous TOOTHPICK MAN who will take a very personal interest in the situation in Providence (9X11). SCULLY takes note of the audience gathered for the meeting. Everyone is standing. FOLLMER is sitting.)

SCULLY: Sorry to keep you waiting.

KERSH: Have a seat, please, Agent Scully ...

SCULLY: May I ask what this is about?

KERSH: You can take a seat, please.

(SCULLY turns to close the door and to take a seat as instructed. KERSH remains standing ... as does everyone except FOLLMER who remains sitting casually in the seat next to SCULLY also in front of KERSHS desk.)

FOLLMER: Deputy Director Kersh has called you here today to ask you a few questions, Agent Scully. All right, just a few ... routine questions.

(SCULLY regards FOLLMER suspiciously, as her eyes glance to A.D. SKINNER. His expression is unsettling because it offers nothing. Absolutely nothing about what his part is in this gathering.)

(Her look settles back on KERSH, standing across from her with an imperious air. His hands reaching to his desk, where he picks up: A plastic evidence bag containing one of the folded squares of paper we saw spilled from the motorcyclists bag. Its edges are burned and charred, but the rubbings of the numerous symbols are still visible. KERSH holds the bag up before him.

DEPUTY DIRECTOR KERSH: Do you know what this is?

(SCULLY looks at the bag. She does recognize it, but reveals nothing on her face. Everyone is watching her, waiting for a reaction from her. She gives them nothing.)

SCULLY: Should I?

(FOLLMER stands. He takes the bag from KERSH and hands it to SCULLY.)

FOLLMER: It's a simple question, Agent Scully. Do you know what this is?

(She stares at FOLLMER a moment, feeling the flush of disrespect. Then she fingers the paper through the plastic, its burnt edges. The symbols on the paper all too familiar to her. She looks at it. She studies it. All for the benefit of the audience in the room. TOOTHPICK MAN and his associate behind him take particular interest in any reaction of recognition from SCULLY.)

SCULLY: I'm not sure.

KERSH: But you've seen it before.

SCULLY: Am I under suspicion here?

[[From the OS scriptbyte (but not on screen): KERSH looks to SKINNER now. Something passing between them.]]

(FOLLMER hasnt sat back down in his seat. He is now standing along with everyone else in the room. Hes looking down at SCULLY.)

FOLLMER: Assistant Director Skinner led us to believe that you'd be able to identify this piece of evidence.

(SCULLY looks to SKINNER. Again, he is blank-faced.)

SCULLY: And why is that?

FOLLMER: Well, you once worked on the X-Files.

SCULLY: Well, if this is an X-File then why don't you ask somebody whos working on the X-Files?

FOLLMER: Because we're asking you.

SCULLY (to KERSH): Where did you get these?

(KERSH hasnt moved. Hes still standing. His manner, however, is less offensive. He along with everyone else in the room is watching SCULLY. He answers her automatically and (from what we do know) ... truthfully.)

KERSH: They were found during an illegal border crossing in North Dakota. Canada to the U.S.

(SCULLY nods at KERSHS response.)

SCULLY (still to KERSH): An illegal border crossing by whom?

FOLLMER (interrupting): As I said, we're asking the questions here today, Agent Scully.

[[From the OS scriptbyte: FOLLMERS staring hard at her, but its a comment thats meant to play the room. To impress the assembled senior staff. ]]

(SCULLY doesnt look at FOLLMER, in fact, it appears that shes ignoring him as is KERSH. Her gaze is still fixed solely on the DEPUTY DIRECTOR standing in front of her. At FOLLMERS words, SCULLY doesnt say anything. Right now, she knows that she has what they want from her. She has the information they need. She simply remains silent.)

KERSH: What A.D. Follmer is saying is your cooperation is important to this investigation, Agent Scully.

(SCULLY realizes that they do not know what they are holding in their hands. Her trip to this meeting has given her the opportunity to learn more information than any they had gotten from her. She now knows that the FBI has a set of the exact same rubbings from an alien spaceship, that they dont know what it means, but are trying to learn its secrets.)

SCULLY: I'd like to cooperate. I-I'd be happy to cooperate. I just wish that you would tell me who or what you are investigating.

(Off this tense stalemate, we PRELAP the DING of an elevator.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4

(The basement office.)

(Elevator bell dings its arrival at the basement floor. SCULLY exits and makes her way determinedly to her old office. She doesnt look happy. She appears in the doorway and finds DOGGETT and REYES conferring over something. They look relaxed as if they are in-between cases. SCULLYS sudden presence startles them.)

SCULLY: Were you called about this? Has A.D. Follmer been down here?

REYES: Brad Follmer?

SCULLY: Yeah. Going through the X-Files.

DOGGETT: I doubt Agent Follmer even knows where we are down here Agent Scully.

(SCULLY heads toward the filing cabinet. She opens it and begins rummaging through the files in the back. She is looking for something specific.)

REYES: Why? What are you looking for?

(SCULLY pulls out a file. Inside the file, she pulls out a stack of papers with the rubbings she made from the space craft back in THE SIXTH EXTINCTION (7X01) & T6E:AMOR FATI (7X02). She hands them to DOGGETT.)

SCULLY: These.

(DOGGETT examines the rubbings.)

REYES: What are they?

SCULLY: Rubbings. Taken from the surface structure of a craft.

DOGGETT: A craft?

SCULLY: A spacecraft. Agent Doggett, if you can wrap your brain around that.

(DOGGETT sighs. He remains silent. She continues.)

SCULLY: They were found by fishermen off the western coast of Africa. Two years ago, I traveled there to study it and I took these.

DOGGETT: What does this have to do with Follmer?

SCULLY: This morning I was called into the Deputy Director's office and I was shown an exact copy of that rubbing. I was asked by senior staff to identify it for them.

REYES: And where did they get them?

SCULLY: A guy running the North Dakota border from Canada. Or so they say.

REYES: What did you tell them about these?

SCULLY: Nothing.

REYES: And what aren't you telling us?

SCULLY: That they're powerful.

DOGGETT: We're talking about pieces of paper with marks on it.

SCULLY: They're not just marks, Agent Doggett. It's writing. Words. Powerful words. And if the FBI has them and they're keeping their investigation of them a secret, then they have a sense of their power as well.

(REYES looks worried. She glances down at the rubbings in her hands, then glances over at DOGGETT.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 5
U.S.  CANADIAN BORDER
BURKE COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA

(Daytime. DOGGETT pulls up in his rental. He exits, pulls out his badge and shows it to the agents standing around. He looks for the ASAC. The place is swarming with FBI agents in their FBI issue jackets.)

DOGGETT (to no one specific): Special Agent John Doggett out of Washington. I'm looking for the agent in charge out here.

(DOGGETT continues to walk around with his badge out.)

DOGGETT: Anybody point me to the ASAC?

(One of the agents points to a man speaking with two other men off to the side. DOGETT heads for the figure. On the way, he notices the motorbike tire tracks on the ground at his feet indicating speed and distance the bike was traveling at the time it went over the drop.)

(He walks to the edge of the drop to look down at the distance the motorbike fell. Down below he notices more FBI agents in their FBI issue jackets. He looks at them then heads to speak with the ASAC, AD BRAD FOLLMER.)

FOLLMER: Agent Doggett ...

DOGGETT: Assistant Director.

(Let the games begin.)

FOLLMER: I don't recall asking for your help or assistance on this case.

DOGGETT: Well, the way it looks I'm the only agent outside of D.C. You didn't ask.

(DOGGETT and FOLLMERS eyes meet.)

DOGGETT: What's the big attraction?

(FOLLMER considers letting him in on the information. Theres no harm there.)

FOLLMER: Last night, a man made an illegal border crossing from Canada. A chase ensued; ended here.

DOGGETT: You know anything about him? About what he might have been doing?

(FOLLMER has a huge smirk on his face.)

FOLLMER: We're endeavouring to learn as much as we can, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: Was he carrying anything interesting?

FOLLMER: Like what, for example?

(DOGGETT takes a couple of steps closer to FOLLMER so that theyre not yelling to each other anymore.)

DOGGETT: I don't know. Like, uh ... maybe something you'd find in an X-File.

(FOLLMERS amused. He smiles and shakes his head. He thinks that DOGGETT has got it so wrong.)

FOLLMER: If that's what you came looking for, you came a long way for nothing.

(DOGGETT looks around indicating all the agents standing. He speaks softly now. FOLLMERS not looking at him.)

DOGGETT: Then what's with the cavalry?

(FOLLMER turns to look at DOGGETT. He doesnt understand where this is going.)

FOLLMER: Excuse me?

DOGGETT: Lot of good shoes out here looking for what's got to be a dead man.

(FOLLMER doesnt say anything.)

DOGGETT: Guy was killed, right?

(FOLLMER has a look on his face that indicates that he thinks that this is a silly question.)

FOLLMER: Man survives a fall like this, on fire? Not very likely ...

DOGGETT (louder): You got a body?

(FOLLMER thinks that DOGGETT is making fun of his inability to find the body of the dead motorbike rider.)

FOLLMER: We will, Agent Doggett. Like you say, I got the cavalry out here.

(DOGGETT realizes that FOLLMER doesnt have a clue. He smiles.)

FOLLMER: Find that funny?

DOGGETT: Dead man up and disappearing? Happens every day, right?

(FOLLMER is silent.)

DOGGETT: At least it does on the X-Files.

(DOGGETT moves to pass FOLLMER. Hes stopped by a hand on his chest. The kid gloves are coming off. FOLLMER realizes that he's been played and he doesn't like it.)

FOLLMER: Trust me, Mr. Doggett. This has nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with you or the X-Files.

(DOGGETT recognizes a threat when he hears one. Hes not smiling anymore.)

FOLLMER: Stick your nose in this case I promise you, you'll live to regret it.

(FOLLMER turns away from DOGGETT. Hes dismissing DOGGETT. DOGGETT stays and watches FOLLMER for a while. He then leaves. As DOGGETT moves away, FOLLMER finally turns to watch him.)

CUT TO:

(Somewhere on the leafy-covered ground below ... the leaves begin to move and a hand emerges. It is covered with burns. Under a covering of leaves, twigs and branches, the MOTORBIKE RIDER or COMER is on the ground. He coughs and struggles to get up. From what we can see, Hes covered with multiple degree burns on his face and hands. He manages to flip himself over. He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a piece of metal with writing from the space craft. His hand holding the piece of metal heals all his burns right before our eyes.)

SCENE 6

(Monicas Residence.)

(REYES opens her door. SCULLY walks in.)

SCULLY: Hi.

REYES: Thanks for coming. I needed to talk to you about this in person.

(REYES looks concerned. SCULLYS puzzled.)

SCULLY: Well, what is it?

CUT TO:

(Theyre both kneeling on the floor of REYES living room. File papers are spread out in front of them. Cant tell whether theyre the rubbings put together like how SCULLY had them laid out in The Sixth Extinction, or whether theyre just the file papers. REYES has been studying the papers.)

(SCULLY allows REYES to take the lead in this discussion to discern what she knows ... what she understands/ comprehends.)

REYES: What I'm reading in your field report on these rubbings, Dana-- there's something I didn't understand. You say these were taken off a spacecraft. You determined they were words -- writings. You didn't tell us you knew what they said.

(The women are speaking softly.)

SCULLY: What little I read was through the help of an interpreter.

REYES: But you interpreted them as text from the Bible, from the Koran (Quran) ... scripture from religions around the world. And science, too. The periodic table of elements.

SCULLY: Yes.

REYES: And you wrote in your report they were millions of years old.

SCULLY: Based on radiometric readings from fossils that were encrusted on the surface of the ship.

REYES: Agent Scully, I know you've become more open-minded about these things ... but do you know what it is you're saying here?

(SCULLY nods.)

REYES: If it were true these symbols wouldn't just be words ... they'd be the very Word of God on the surface of an alien spacecraft.

SCULLY: It'd mean that everything mankind believes in ... is in question.

REYES: And you believe this?

SCULLY: I didn't. I mean, I-I refused to believe it. But now I think ... I think there may be answers there.

REYES: Answers to what?

(Tears fill SCULLYS eyes.)

SCULLY: Answers about my son. I know how that sounds. I have no one else to say it to. That I was meant to find these ... somehow. These were meant for me.

REYES: But why would the FBI keep that from you? From us? And what exactly do they want with them?

SCULLY: Those are questions I can't answer.

CUT TO:



SCENE 7
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Skinner's office. Night. SKINNERS on his way out. He exits his office and finds DOGGETT sitting on the couch in his assistants office.)

DOGGETT: You forget our extension? Or you just can't be bothered?

(DOGGETT stands.)

SKINNER: Excuse me?

DOGGETT: Returning calls. Agent Reyes', mine. What the hell's that about?

SKINNER: Well, I've been tied up, Agent Doggett. I just haven't had a chance.

DOGGETT: That's not what your phone log says. Your log says you've returned everyone's calls but ours.

SKINNER: Agent Doggett, let me remind you who answers to whom here.

DOGGETT: Oh, I think you owe me an answer, sir -- and if you don't owe it to me, you owe it to Agent Scully -- on this X-File case the FBI's got. The one they're working so hard to keep us from investigating.

SKINNER: You ready for my answer, Agent Doggett? It's not an X-File case.

DOGGETT: That's why you have 40 agents combing the Canadian border for a dead man that ain't dead.

SKINNER: You don't know what you're talking about.

DOGGETT: I was out there.

SKINNER: Without any authorization!

DOGGETT: I don't understand -- none of us do -- why you're keeping their secrets ... why you're keeping quiet.

SKINNER: Because I know things you don't, John. And it's for your own good.

(SKINNER walks down the hall leaving DOGGETT behind. DOGGETT considers SKINNERS words and wonders what it is that SKINNER could possibly know. DOGGETT turns to look at the closed door to SKINNERS office.)

SCENE 8
ALBERTA PROVINCE
CANADA

(Night. A huge tent in the middle of the field. A light coming from inside. Over a dozen men & women with wheelbarrows working an excavation. They have shovels and are busy trying to dig something huge up.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 9

(Skinner's Office. DOGGETT opens SKINNERS door. He makes his way purposefully to SKINNERS desk. He turns on the light and goes through the desk drawers. He opens drawer after drawer. In the back of the final drawer, he finds the plastic covered rubbings. He pulls those out and puts them on the desk intending to take them with him. He then turns back to the drawer to leaf through the files.]

CUT TO:



SCENE 10

(Excavation site. Buckets are being filled with dirt. Continuous work going on. Purposeful work. Men with small hand shovels sifting sand.)

(At the very bottom, one man with a paint brush is clearing sand from writings on a large piece of metal. Its the spacecraft. This is JOSEPHO. The excavation is for the spacecraft. He stands up and looks at the hull of the craft. They have definitely found a spacecraft and are digging it up.]

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(Monica's residence. Night. Someone is knocking of the door. REYES grabs her red bathrobe to cover her nightgown and answers the persistent knocking on the door.)

REYES: Yeah. Who's there?

DOGGETT: It's me. Open up, Monica.

(She turns on the light, opens the door and DOGGETT walks in carrying a brown file folder.)

DOGGETT: I got it.

REYES: Got what?

DOGGETT: What they've been keeping a secret. What they won't tell Scully. What they wouldn't tell us.

(He gives REYES the folder and she looks through it.)

REYES: What am I looking at?

DOGGETT: A file on a guy crossing the Canadian border last night.

(Reyes looks at the file. The left side of the file folder has a big colour photo of Robert Comer. The right side has the following information on the form.

(Federal Bureau of Investigation: Preliminary Application for Special Agent Position (Please Type or Print in Black Ink)

(Under Personal History:

REYES: Special Agent Robert Comer?

DOGGETT: He's FBI.

REYES: I-I know this guy. I worked a case with him once in New Orleans. Company man -- straight as a ruler.

DOGGETT: Well, according to his file last six months he's been deep undercover.

REYES: Undercover doing what?

DOGGETT: We got a pile of reading to do. What's not blacked out.

(DOGGETT opens his jacket and pulls out the evidence bag containing the rubbings. The same rubbings KERSH showed SCULLY earlier. He gives them to REYES who picks them up and looks at them.)

DOGGETT: Oh, and, uh ... picked these up in the bargain.

REYES: Agent Skinner gave you these?

DOGGETT: I sort of got it on loan.

REYES: Wed better call Agent Scully.

DOGGETT: I already did.

SCENE 12
JESSUP, MARYLAND
10:20 PM

(Night. A U-Mov It Truck parks. The driver gets out. In the trucks side- view mirror, we see COMER approach the truck from the back. Hes looking healthy and unburnt. He opens the truck door, he pulls the wires intending to hot-wire the truck. The driver re-appears behind him through the open truck door.)

DRIVER: Hey, need a hand there, bro?

(The DRIVER interrupts COMER.)

DRIVER: How about I just help you out, huh? Ohh!

(The DRIVER reaches over to pull COMER out. COMER kicks the DRIVER in the chest and climbs out of the truck. They fight. The driver is knocked out. COMER takes the keys from the DRIVER. He searches the glove compartment for a map. Hes looking for Georgetown.)

[CLOSED-CAPTION: COMER: Georgetown. Georgetown. Georgetown.]

(COMER drives off in the stolen truck.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 13

(Scully's apartment. It looks like its daytime outside SCULLYS apartment window. I could be wrong especially since MRS. SCULLY says that its the middle of the night. SCULLY is on the phone.)

SCULLY (on phone): I'm on my way.

(SCULLY hangs up. MRS. SCULLY is there holding WILLIAM who is not sleeping. For a kid his age, he really should be in bed sleeping especially if it is in the middle of the night. WILLIAM seems to be having the time of this life. MRS. SCULLY isnt happy with SCULLY at the moment.)

SCULLY: That was Agent Doggett again. They're waiting. Mom, I've got to go.

MRS. SCULLY: It's the middle of the night, Dana. I just don't understand what can't wait till tomorrow.

(SCULLYS putting her jacket on.)

SCULLY: Mom, it's important. I wouldn't go if it weren't.

MRS. SCULLY: Yes, I know, Dana. You say it's about getting answers.

SCULLY: Answers about William, mom.

MRS. SCULLY: I know you're worried about him ... that there are things about him that you just can't explain -- but even if you were to get those answers what would it change?

SCULLY: Mom, he's my child.

MRS. SCULLY: And you have to love him and raise him in spite of everything. Dana, God has given you a miracle. A child that wasn't supposed to be. Maybe its not to question ... just to be taken as a matter of faith.

SCULLY: Mom, I can't take this on faith. I need to know. I need to know if it's really God I have to thank.

(SCULLY leaves.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 14

(Monica's residence. From an overhead view, REYES is on her knees with the papers spread around her. Shes studying both the old set of rubbings and the new, burnt rubbings. She's comparing the two sets, her gloved hands lifting the various pieces of paper. DOGGETT is standing on the side watching her.)

(There is no knock on the door. SCULLY enters. She walks into the room and sees the new rubbings. The same papers that was shown to her in KERSHS office.)

SCULLY: Where did you get those?

DOGGETT: I got 'em ... and the FBI's file on the man who was carrying them. He's one of ours -- working deep undercover. Infiltrating a religious group, some kind of whacked-out UFO cult. A case they never told us about.

SCULLY: Where's this cult supposed to be?

DOGGETT: North Dakota. And at some point, they up and disappear into Canada. Agent goes right along with them. FBI loses all contact with him.

SCULLY: What did they think this guy was doing running across the U.S. Border carrying these rubbings on him?

DOGGETT: The FBI thinks he went over to the dark side. Became whacked-out himself. And that's the secret they've been trying to keep from everybody.

SCULLY: That's it? That's the big secret?

DOGGETT: That and ... they can't seem to find him the best I can figure.

(SCULLY considers this for a moment then dismisses it. That cant be it.)

SCULLY: I was questioned this morning by the senior staff of the FBI. Not about an FBI agent but about these rubbings. There's got to be something more. There has to be.

(REYES looks up.)

REYES: There may be, Agent Scully. But I'm not sure even the FBI is aware of it. How could they be without access to your files?

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

REYES: The set of rubbings the man smuggled over the border doesn't match the rubbings you took.

SCULLY: Wait a second. How can that be?

REYES: It could only be that this whacked UFO cult found a second spacecraft.

(This is not good news for the agents.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 15

(Scully's apartment. Daytime. From the window of an apartment, probably SCULLY'S apartment, someone is watching MRS. SCULLY take WILLIAM out for a walk. Shes making her way home. WILLIAM is in the stroller. That someone watches as MRS. SCULLY crosses the street in front of SCULLYS apartment.)

CUT TO:

(MRS. SCULLY unlocks the door and pulls the stroller into the apartment. She backs up into COMER. She gasps.)

CUT TO:

(Just outside, SCULLY comes home. She exits her car, turns on the car alarm. Shes in no rush; unaware of the danger her family is in.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY exits the stairwell onto her floor, pulls the apartment keys out of her pocket and finally notices that the door to her apartment is ajar.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the apartment, SCULLY pushes the door open a little further.)

SCULLY: Mom?

(MAGGIE SCULLY comes flying out of WILLIAMS room. She hits the floor with a loud thud. SCULLY rushes over to her mother who has some lacerations on her lip and forehead.)

MRS. SCULLY: He wants to kill the baby!

(SCULLY looks up, pulls her gun and approaches WILLIAMS room. From the slightly opened doorway, we see WILLIAM in his crib, flailing his arms, apparently still alive and not crying.)

(SCULLY enters the room cautiously. COMER pushes the door into SCULLY knocking the gun out of her hands. He then picks up her gun, but before he can actually do anything, SCULLY attacks. She gets in a couple of blows before he simply overpowers her and pushes her up against WILLIAMS crib. WILLIAM starts to cry.)

(SCULLY turns around and attacks COMER again. This time, he pushes her up against the wall just as police do to subdue felons. He has her arm twisted behind her back.)

(WILLIAM is still crying.)

SCULLY: No! No! Don't! Please! Don't!

(COMER manages to get both SCULLYS arms behind her back. He then uses that leverage to kick open the door and to toss SCULLY out into the hallway. He shuts and locks the door behind her.)

(From the hallway, SCULLY gets up and starts to knock down the door with her shoulder. WILLIAM'S cries can be heard.)

SCULLY (frantically): I'll kill you! I'll kill you if you touch my baby!

MRS. SCULLY (from behind): Dana!

(MRS. SCULLY is standing in the doorway. She is holding a second gun out for SCULLY.)

CUT TO:

(Inside WILLIAMS room, COMER picks up a fluffy white pillow. His intentions are clear. He plans on smothering WILLIAM. He approaches the crib. SCULLY bursts through the door. He turns, surprised. The pillow is still clutched in his hands. SCULLY fires three shots into his abdomen. WILLIAMS cries still pierce the air.)

(SCULLY doesnt take her eyes off of COMER till he falls to the floor in pain. WILLIAM is crying in his crib.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16

(Scully's apartment. DOGGETT and REYES burst through the stairway door onto SCULLYS floor. Theyre running. SCULLYS front door is ajar. DOGGETT reaches through first and REYES enters after him. They both see MRS. SCULLY sitting down and holding an ice pack to the bruise on her forehead. DOGGETT and REYES are kneeling before her.)

REYES: Oh, my god!

DOGGETT (concerned): Mrs. Scully, are you okay ?

(MRS. SCULLY nods.)

(SCULLY appears out of WILLIAMS room holding WILLIAM. Hes not crying and dressed warmly. DOGGETT and REYES turns to look at her. SCULLYS face is bruised, she nervously rubs WILLIAMS back. She looks downright frightened. DOGGETT senses this, his concern evident. He stands and moves toward her. REYES remains kneeling in front of MRS. SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: What the hell happened here?

SCULLY: I need your help, okay?

(SCULLY avoids answering DOGGETTS question. With a glance she tells him that shell answer his questions later. She looks over at REYES instead. He remains silent.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes, I need you to take my mom and the baby. Can you do that, Monica?

(REYES answers unhesitatingly.)

REYES: Of course.

(REYES stands and SCULLY hands WILLIAM over to her. They both pass DOGGETT and move toward the door.

[CLOSED-CAPTION SCULLY: Thank you.]

(REYES, MRS. SCULLY and WILLIAM leave. Only DOGGETT remains. DOGGETT turns back toward SCULLY to find out whats going on, when from the other room, he hears a man moaning.)

DOGGETT: Who is that? Is somebody here?

(SCULLY doesnt say a word. She opens the door to WILLIAMS room. DOGGETT enters and he sees COMER on the floor bleeding. SCULLY has packed his wound with some cloth and tied it around his waist. Both cloths are soaked through with blood. His shirt is open and the jacket he wore when he came in is beside him on the floor.)

DOGGETT: You gonna tell me what this is who the hell this is, Dana?

SCULLY: That man -- that FBI agent -- came here to kill my baby.

DOGGETT: You gotta help this man.

SCULLY: No, not until he tells me why.

DOGGETT: He's not gonna tell anybody anything unless you get him to a hospital. This man is losing blood fast.

SCULLY (angry): I am not going to turn him over to the FBI! I am not gonna let them cover their tracks on this one!

(SCULLY kneels beside COMER and grabs his shirt. She is angry and she wants answer from him. She pulls him up and shakes him, yelling her questions in his ear.)

SCULLY: Why?

(COMER groans softly )

SCULLY: Why do you want to hurt my son?!

(DOGGETT cant stand it anymore. He moves to the nearby phone and picks it up. SCULLY turns around as she hears DOGGETT reach for the phone and turns her anger at DOGGETT halting him in the process.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, put down the phone! He has to answer me!

(DOGGETT looks at SCULLY. His message clear: She has until help comes to get her answers out of COMER. He begins dialing.)

AGENT COMER: He ha-has to ...

SCULLY: What? Say it!

(COMER gulps, his lips bloodied.)

AGENT COMER: Your son ...

SCULLY: Say it!!

AGENT COMER: ... has to die.

SCULLY: Why?! Who told you that?!

(COMER can say no more. SCULLY angrily begins to shake him. COMER begins to lose consciousness.)

SCULLY: He's my son! He's my son!!

(COMERS eyes close. Behind SCULLY, we hear DOGGETT speaking rapidly on the phone.)

DOGGETT: I've got a medical emergency, a man in critical condition at ...

CUT TO:

(The EMTS with COMER on a gurney leaves WILLIAMS room. They have an oxygen mask on him. In the hallway, they pass DOGGETT and SCULLY who is strangely silent, struggling to hold on to her emotions in her tenuous grasp. DOGGETT approaches SCULLY and stops some distance from her.)

DOGGETT: This man have any kind of a weapon?

(SCULLY answers, then nods slightly as she remembers.)

SCULLY (whispers): A pillow.

DOGGETT: Whatever brought him here I hope to God we figure it out.

(DOGGETT leaves SCULLY standing in the hallway. Tears run down SCULLYS face at the nameless threat that wants her son dead. She glances over into the room and notices COMERS jacket. Theres blood everywhere. She picks it up and searches his pockets where she finds the piece of metal with foreign markings on it. SCULLY recognizes it.)

SCENE 17
CALGARY
ALBERTA PROVINCE
CANADA

(Night. The streets are dark. Its early morning. The early morning edition of the SUN has the following headline: Missing FBI Agent Shot In Washington with a large photo of COMER (same as the photo in his file).

(The OVERCOAT WOMAN from the cult picks up the paper, she looks at the headline, gasps, pays for it and leaves.)

CUT TO:

(The White truck belonging to the cult travels on a deserted path where there is no road toward the large white tent. The excavation inside the white tent continues. The OVERCOAT WOMAN heads for the site. Shes holding the paper.)



SCENE 18

(JOSEPHO looks up at the OVERCOAT WOMAN approaching.)

JOSEPHO: What is it?

(She doesnt say a word and tosses the paper to him. He catches it and reads the headlines. He sighs.)

JOSEPHO: This changes everything.

OVERCOAT WOMAN: He can expose all this. He's got proof he can show them. What do you want to do?

(He looks back down at the paper and sighs.)

JOSEPHO: There's only one thing to do.

(He looks at her. She gets the message and leaves.)

SCENE 19
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Its daytime at the FBI building. Inside KERSHS office, FOLLMER opens the office door.)

FOLLMER: Agent Scully, Agent Doggett.

(Both SCULLY and DOGGETT enter. SCULLYS been here before. DOGGETT trails in after her. SKINNER is standing by the window. KERSH is sitting behind his desk. TOOTHPICK MAN (yes, with a toothpick in his mouth) is also there.)

FOLLMER: You can both have a seat.

(They walk in to the office and stop in front of KERSHS desk.)

SCULLY: This is just going to be another interrogation I prefer to stand.

(DOGGETT sighs. He remains silent.)

KERSH: Agent Scully, a man was shot in your apartment. An FBI agent.

SCULLY: Trying to kill my son.

KERSH: That is not in question here. There'll be an investigation.

SCULLY (angry): Another secret investigation or one where I'm given advance warning that my family's life is in danger?

(DOGGETTS surprised at SCULLYS outburst. He looks over accusingly at SKINNER, possibly recalling his late night conversation with him. SKINNER remains silent and returns the look.)

FOLLMER: It would help us to help you if you could tell us anything this man might have communicated to you.

(DOGGETTS still looking at SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: I wouldn't tell him anything, not until they explain why all the hush-hush over this case, why the doublespeak -- the mincing words from Mr. Follmer -- 'cause I want answers myself.

(DOGGETT turns to look at AD FOLLMER, possibly recalling his crime scene conversation with him. Then turns to look at KERSH.)

KERSH: The man you shot had been undercover which you've already found out through whatever unethical means. His assignment was to infiltrate a religious cult. A cult led by a former military officer. A very dangerous man by all accounts and who also believed in very dangerous ideas ... about aliens.

SCULLY: And why wasn't I told? Why not Agent Doggett? Why not Agent Reyes? Why wasn't this an X-File?

SKINNER (quietly): I asked them to put somebody else on the case because I was afraid after all that you'd been through it just might break you.

(DOGGETT turns to look at SKINNER wondering what they know and still arent saying.)

SCULLY: What are you talking about?

(KERSH looks at SKINNER. A look passes between them. A silent agreement to share this information with them.)

KERSH: Agent Comer -- our undercover man -- was sent to infiltrate the cult ... based on a series of ... threats.

SCULLY: What threats? Threats to who? To me, to my child...

FOLLMER: Threats ... on Agent Mulder's life.

(DOGGETT pieces all the information together and remains silent.)

SCULLY: That's what this is about? Then why pull me in here and show me those rubbings? I don't understand.

(SCULLYS looking at FOLLMER. FOLLMER swallows. No one else is speaking.)

FOLLMER: Before losing all contact with our undercover agent he sent us a communication. A communication we've been trying to confirm that, uh...

(FOLLMER swallows. SCULLY is watching him, waiting for him to finish.)

FOLLMER (gently): ... that Mulder was already dead.

(SCULLY looks at FOLLMER trying to discern whether he is telling what he perceives to be the truth. She doesnt like what she sees. FOLLMER holds her gaze. SCULLY looks over at KERSH whose entire demeanour is one of sorrow. He, too, cant hold her gaze. SKINNER cant even look at SCULLY. DOGGETT has nothing but sympathy in what he thinks is the truth.)

(SCULLY has had enough. She turns to leave the office. It is unknown whether she, too, believes this. DOGGETT watches her as she leaves the room. The door closing behind her.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 20

(Scully's apartment. A white door is being unlocked and opened to reveal REYES smiling with WILLIAM. SCULLY is inside her apartment and REYES is holding WILLIAM. She gives him to her.)

REYES (smiling): Here's your mommy.

SCULLY (to WILLIAM): Hi, honey.

(SCULLY holds WILLIAM close. She kisses him. She hasnt moved. Shes very sad.)

REYES: Dana, what's wrong?

(WILLIAM makes a small noise as if hes going to cry. SCULLY turns away from REYES and moves further into her apartment. REYES follows. She removes her coat and closes the door.)

CUT TO:

(Williams nursery. SCULLY is walking back into WILLIAMS nursery. Shes moving fast and is stoically silent. REYES follows behind her. Something is terribly wrong.)

REYES: What's happened?

(SCULLYS barely holding it together. She holds WILLIAM close and kisses him over and over again hoping to find some comfort in comforting him. REYES stands in front of SCULLY.)

SCULLY (whispering to WILLIAM): It's okay.

REYES (gently): Just tell me what it is.

SCULLY (whispering): It's Mulder ...

(A rattling noise coming from the next room catches the attention of both women. SCULLY looks worried. The rattling noise is getting louder and more violent. SCULLY puts WILLIAM in his crib while she and REYES check it out.)

CUT TO:

(In the next room the top dresser drawer is rattling and shaking. Something inside the drawer is trying to get out. The noise gets louder and louder.)

REYES: What is it?

SCULLY: An artifact. I got it from the man who was trying to kill William.

REYES: Okay, but what the hell is it?

SCULLY: It's a piece of the spacecraft.

(REYES looks suddenly at SCULLY.)

(The drawer rattles louder and louder. The metal piece wants out. Both women move cautiously toward the dresser. SCULLY opens the drawer. The metal piece bursts out and heads straight for WILLIAM. It crashes through the crib and stops directly above WILLIAM. It hovers there. Spinning leisurely in a clockwise direction. SCULLY and REYES rush to WILLIAMS room and witness the events. SCULLY glances over at REYES who is with her ... watching it all happen.)

(SCULLY looks terrified at what shes seeing.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 21

(Outside Scullys apartment building.)

(Its night. DOGGETT pulls up in front of SCULLYS apartment building. REYES meets him at the door.)

DOGGETT: Where's Agent Scully?

REYES: She's still upstairs. I want to talk to you before you see her to explain what's happened.

DOGGETT: You said it had something to do with the kid. A piece of metal these rubbings were taken from.

REYES: A piece of that ship in Canada.

DOGGETT: Oh, come on, Monica. You're making an outrageous leap. You're just guessing there's any such thing.

REYES: It flew through the air at the baby. I saw it.

(A worried look crosses DOGGETTS face.)

DOGGETT: Just tell me the boy's okay.

REYES: I don't think you understand. The boy has some connection with this thing--this piece of metal.

DOGGETT: You saying this kid's an alien or something?

REYES: You can believe or not, but the man who tried to kill Scully's baby believed it ... so must this cult he got involved with who are obviously more than willing to kill for their belief.

(DOGGETT may not understand the intricacies of how this involves WILLIAM, but he does know a dangerous situation when he sees one. He remains silent. SCULLY appears at the doorway carrying WILLIAM. She hands WILLIAM to REYES.)

DOGGETT: Where are we going?

SCULLY: I'll tell you on the way.

(REYES puts WILLIAM in the car seat. SCULLY gets inside the car. DOGGETT closes the car door behind her. He looks up and notices a station wagon parked nearby with a driver inside. Both look suspicious to him. He doesnt like the look of it.

(DOGGETT hands the keys to REYES. Hes going to check it out.)

DOGGETT (to REYES): You drive.

REYES: What is it?

(DOGGETT leans over SCULLYS open window.)

DOGGETT: I'm right behind you guys.

SCULLY: What is it?

DOGGETT: Probably nothing.

(REYES drives off. Inside the parked station wagon, the OVERCOAT WOMAN watches them drive off. DOGGETT is left behind, standing below the lamppost. He makes his way purposefully toward the station wagon. The OVERCOAT WOMAN starts the engine and heads straight for DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Federal Agent! Stop the car!

(DOGGETT pulls out his gun and fires several shots at her, breaking her windshield. She doesnt stop and runs him down. DOGGETT tumbles over the hood of the car and falls to the pavement, unconscious. The station wagon takes off in pursuit of WILLIAM.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 22

(An unknown alley. REYES turns the car into an alleyway where THE LONE GUNMENS van waits.)

REYES: Who are we meeting?

SCULLY: The only ones left we can trust.

(BYERS, LANGLY & FROHIKE exit the van. FROHIKE gets WILLIAM out of the seat. WILLIAM is crying.)

FROHIKE: Hey, little man.

[CLOSED CAPTION FROHIKE: It's okay.]

(He hands WILLIAM to LANGLY. FROHIKE turns back to get the baby bag. He closes the car door.)

LANGLY: Your baby's in good hands.

(BYERS takes the car seat. The LONE GUNMEN turn to face SCULLY. She reaches over and plays with WILLIAM. WILLIAM isnt crying.)

SCULLY: I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place. I need to know that you're ... that you're taking every precaution.

BYERS: We understand. (to LANGLY) Langly.

(LANGLY runs back to the van to get something.)

SCULLY: Now, there's a good chance that my phone lines have been tapped and if they're tapped, they can trace you.

FROHIKE: We thought about that.

(LANGLY rushes back with a plastic bag that he hands to REYES.)

LANGLY: Six cell phones their signals scrambled. Use each one once and then throw it away.

(SCULLY still has her hand on WILLIAMS. Shes reluctant to let him go. She gives the GUNMEN a look filled with gratitude.)

(SCULLY looks down at WILLIAM and tenderly kisses his brow.)

SCULLY (softly to WILLIAM): Hey ... it's going to be okay.

(SCULLY lingers over WILLIAM. Suddenly she turns and heads back to the car. FROHIKE stops her with some final words.)

FROHIKE: Whatever you do, don't worry.

(SCULLY & REYES drive off. THE LONE GUNMEN remain behind holding WILLIAM.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 23

(Outside Scully's apartment. Driving back to the apartment, REYES turns back on to SCULLYS street. Police car lights flash indicating some kind of incident took place there. SCULLY looks worried.)

SCULLY: What's going on here?

REYES: I don't know.

(REYES stops the car. SKINNER is speaking with a group of police officers. He sees them and approaches the car. REYES exits the car and rushes over to SKINNER.)

REYES: What happened?

(SKINNER doesnt look happy. He doesnt say anything.)

REYES: Is it John?

(Somehow, REYES knows. SKINNER turns to the scene behind him. EMTS are putting a man on a gurney inside an awaiting ambulance. REYES runs over check on DOGGETT. SKINNER turns back to SCULLY who is standing there. She suddenly realizes what must have happened and that WILLIAM and The LONE GUNMEN are in danger. She quickly gets behind the wheel.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully! Scully!

SCULLY: My baby! They're after my baby! I have to get back!

(SCULLY slams the car door and drives off leaving SKINNER standing there in the street.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 24

(Back in the alley with the Gunmen. BYERS is in the back of the van tickling WILLIAMS cheek. Hes thoroughly enjoying making WILLIAM smile. The van makes its way down the alleyway. In front of them, blocking the entrance to the alleyway, the OVERCOAT WOMANS station wagon blocks the alleyway entrance.)

FROHIKE: What the hell is this?

BYERS (alarmed): What the hell is what?

(The OVERCOAT WOMAN is holding a gun. She fires several times. The first bullet breaks her passenger-side window. Several bullets later finds the front left tire of the LONE GUNMENS van. The moving van crashes into a nearby pole. The OVERCOAT WOMAN walks purposefully toward the back of the van. WILLIAM is crying. LANGLY and FROHIKE are stunned by the impact of the crash. She opens the back door and points the gun at BYERS who is protectively holding WILLIAM.)

(WILLIAM is crying )

SCENE 1
MAKHAFAR AL BUSAYYAH, IRAQ
OPERATION DESERT STORM

JOSEPHO (V.O.): The bible says God appeared to Moses in a burning bush. He came to Jesus on a mountain-top. For Buddha, God came while he sat under a tree. God came to me in a vision in the desert February 26, 1991.

(Day. The camera pans across the wide desert. In the distance, gunfire rings in the air. In the middle of nowhere, the last remains of what was a building stands - several walls here and there with no roof for cover.)

(Behind the building walls, about a dozen American soldiers fight against an unknown enemy firing upon them. The men are cornered behind unstable walls. One man (INJURED SOLDIER) is shot and bleeding. LT. COL. JOSEPHO goes to help him.)

JOSEPHO (V.O.): My recon squad had engaged Saddam's army in a small Bedouin encampment. We'd been ambushed, taken all by surprise and there were casualties.

(JOSEPHO looks around him and notes that they are not winning this squirmish. He turns his attention to the INJURED SOLDIER in front of him when a voice from another soldier off to the side catches his attention.)

SOLDIER #1: My legs -- I can't feel my legs.

LT. COL. JOSEPHO (to the INJURED SOLDIER): You're going to be okay, don't worry.

SOLDIER #1: My legs ...

JOSEPHO (to SOLDIER #2): Damn it! Get on the radio! We need some help here!

(The INJURED SOLDIER in front of him yells out in pain.)

SOLDIER #2: Zulu six two, we are under attack. Repeat: We are under attack. We are taking heavy machine-gun fire ...

JOSEPHO (V.O.): We were holding our perimeter, and we might've held up but on this day, I had a terrible sense of foreboding and I saw the future of those brave men and they were about to die.

[CLOSED-CAPTION SAYS: ... and I saw the failure of those brave men ... ]

(From up above, a grenade/bomb blasts through the last remaining wall, killing about a dozen soldiers who sat behind it. As the smoke clears, JOSEPHO is injured and lying in the rubble.)

JOSEPHO (V.O.): Death came to take my men ... but not me. I was left as a witness to a vision.

(JOSEPHO is on his back amidst the rubble. He's covered with a thick layer of sand and dust from the blast. Blood drips from his eyes.)

JOSEPHO (V.O.): Angels from heaven.

(From across the desert out of nowhere, four soldiers perfectly healthy briskly jog to where they are. JOSEPHO lifts his head. He sees bullets hit the men. He sees the men rush forward, take the hits, and disappear behind enemy lines. The gunfire ceases. He sees a bomb blast as it kills the enemy. JOSEPHO is still on the ground on his back in the rubble. Blood is running from his eyes.)

(As the smoke clears, the four soldiers emerge unhurt and victorious.)

JOSPEHO: "Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north and a brightness was about it. And out of the midst came the likeness of four living creatures and they had the likeness of a man."

[Transcriber note: Ezekiel 1:4-5.]

(JOSEPHO remains behind as he sees the last of the four soldiers jog back into the desert where they first emerged from.)

JOSEPHO (V.O.): I knew why my life had been spared. That I was to deliver the message of these angels. These sons of god.

FADE TO THE PRESENT:

(JOSEPHO has a look of wonder and amazement on his face. It is the same look he had when he watched the soldiers disappear back into the desert.)

JOSEPHO (V.O.): To deliver the message of the god who came before all other gods.

(JOSEPHO is standing on the top of the fully uncovered newly excavated spaceship.)

SCENE 2

NARRATOR: Previously on the X-Files:

[from PROVENANCE (9X10): COMER on the motorcycle flying through the air, crashing into the hillside and the bike exploding.]

[COMER'S burnt body struggling up the hill. His hand being healed as he clutches the piece of metal spacecraft.]

[Off DOGGETT facing SCULLY. REYES is kneeling on the floor studying the ship's rubbings. DOGGETT'S speaking.]

DOGGETT: A man crossed over the U.S./Canadian border last night. He's one of ours -- he was infiltrating a religious group. Some kind of whacked-out UFO cult.

[KERSH in interview; JOSEPHO close-up; and excavation overhead.]

KERSH: ... Led by a former military officer -- a very dangerous man.

[COMER holding pillow ready to smother WILLIAM. SCULLY'S voice screaming behind the closed door. SCULLY bursts through the door and fires three times at COMER.]

SCULLY: I'll kill you if you touch my baby!

[The piece of metal flying from the drawer, through the crib to hover over WILLIAM. SCULLY and REYES rush over to see the metal slowly turning over WILLIAM'S head.]

REYES: The boy has some connection with this thing -- this piece of metal. So must this cult who are more than willing to kill for their belief.

[DOGGETT fires shots at the woman in the car. The woman doesn't stop and runs DOGGETT over.]

[SCULLY & REYES with TLG.]

SCULLY: I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place.

[The OVERCOAT WOMAN pointing the gun at BYERS. WILLIAM is crying.]

CUT TO:



SCENE 3

(An FBI building task force briefing to find William. A large Mulder-worthy slide show is being conducted by FOLLMER at the briefing. A large king-sized overhead of William is on the wall. Two pictures. FOLLMER is speaking.)

FOLLMER: ... At 7:00 this evening, in a Washington D.C. Alley a vehicle carrying the son of Agent Dana Scully was forced to a violent stop by a female shooter who proceeded to kidnap the child at gunpoint.

(Slide of THE LONE GUNMEN'S smashed van.)

CUT TO:

(In another office, The LONE GUNMEN are sitting at a workstation going through computer mugshots trying to ID the OVERCOAT WOMAN who took WILLIAM. TOOTHPICK MAN is running the photo ID session. Three pictures into it, they see the woman. Though they recognize her, The LONE GUNMEN do not admit that its her.)

FOLLMER: The van was being driven by three men asked by Agent Scully to protect the child. The three men are currently working to ID the assailant.

CUT TO:

(FOLLMER is standing in front of the slide show talking to the room of FBI agents. As leader of the Task Force assigned to find WILLIAM, he's briefing them.)

FOLLMER: John Doggett was seriously injured by the same female shooter as he tried to halt her vehicle. Agent Doggett remains in a coma under close watch at St. Mary's Hospital.

(SKINNER is standing off to the side watching the proceedings. SCULLY is standing in the back of the room. Her arms are crossed. She looks very angry at what she's witnessing.)

FOLLMER: This kidnapping follows on the heels of a failed attack on Scully's child by another FBI agent, Robert Comer. He remains in critical condition also at St. Mary's.

(The picture of COMER graces the wall behind FOLLMER.)

FOLLMER: Now, this man's motives and the motives of the female kidnapper are still unknown.

(At this point, SCULLY turns and walks out of the room.)

FOLLMER: Let me emphasize that the FBI has no reason to believe that it cannot affect the safe return of Agent Scully's child.

CUT TO:

(Outside the hallway. SKINNER follows her.)

SKINNER: Agent Scully!

(SCULLY is already a good distance down the hall. Turning now. SKINNER continues to walk toward her. His voice gentler. )

SKINNER: What are you doing? I thought I told you you didn't need to be here.

SCULLY: I just had to see this for myself.

(SKINNER is coming toward her now. SCULLY remaining where she is. SKINNER can see that she is upset. Misreading the cause of it.)

SKINNER: Go home.

SCULLY: To what?

(SCULLY seems not only in consolable, but somehow angry.)

SKINNER: I'm just saying, you don't need to put yourself through this, Dana. We've got every stop pulled; every available agent working to find your son.

SCULLY: ... And A.D. Brad Follmer leading the charge.

SKINNER: Deputy Director Kersh asked him to take the lead. He knows how to run a task force. I think you see that in there.

SCULLY: I see a man who withholds information for Kersh. A man who not once but twice failed to prevent an attack on my son. You see a task force in there. I see a whitewash.

(SCULLY'S anger flashes, directed at SKINNER as much as FOLLMER.)

SKINNER: I know you're upset but you can't possibly accuse Follmer or Kersh of having any part in this.

SCULLY: What is it going to take for you? How many people have to be taken out for you to open your eyes to it? My son ... Agent Doggett ... Mulder.

(SCULLY'S voice breaks now, and she fights emotion. This is just what SKINNER wanted to shield her from. He softens his tone now.)

SKINNER: Kersh protected you by not telling you reports of Mulder's death. As did Follmer. As did I.

SCULLY: You call it protection. I call it a systematic effort inside the FBI to eliminate us.

SKINNER: You accuse anyone of anything in the FBI you have to accuse me along with them.

(SCULLY stares at him, then turns and walks off. SKINNER'S more worried about SCULLY than anything, as she gets to the elevator.)

SKINNER: Scully, where are you going?

SCULLY: To find my son.

(SCULLY continues down the hall. She doesn't look back at SKINNER. There is no hesitation in her.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4

(Doggett's hospital room. A heart monitor beeps in the background. DOGGETT is unconscious in the hospital bed, his face covered with lacerations from the car hit. REYES is standing next to his bed and holding his hand. She's looking down at DOGGETT.)

(SKINNER opens the closed door and enters the room.)

SINNER (whispers): Hi.

REYES: Hi.

(REYES turns back to look at DOGGETT.)

REYES: His hands are so cold.

SKINNER: Have you talked to the doctors yet?

REYES: They say the good news is that there's no swelling of the brain but they were very frank that he could just never wake up.

(REYES is feeling very emotional.)

REYES: I wonder if he can hear us.

SKINNER: There'd be soldiers in Vietnam ... bodies turned inside out ... I'd hold their hands just like you're doing. Tell them it was going to be okay.

REYES: Do you think it helped? Talking to them?

SKINNER: Well ... I always thought it was like ... like praying. Even if they can't hear maybe ... God can.

(REYES considers his words and the comfort he is giving her. The telephone rings.)

REYES (to the phone): Hello.

SCULLY (from home): How's he doing?

REYES: No change.

SCULLY: I need to see you right away, Monica. Are you alone right now?

REYES: Skinner's here with me.

SCULLY: I'd prefer if Skinner didn't know.

CUT TO:



SCENE 5

(Scully's apartment.)

(SCULLY opens the door.)

SCULLY: We found her.

REYES: Who?

SCULLY: The woman who took William.

(SCULLY shows REYES a photo printout of the OVERCOAT WOMAN. REYES takes the photo from SCULLY and walks into the apartment. SCULLY closes the door behind her.)

SCULLY: She's a wanted felon and a part of the UFO cult that the FBI was investigating. I need anything that you can find on her, Monica but I need you to get it quietly.

(LANGLY'S voice can be heard on the side. SCULLY turns. THE LONE GUNMEN are at SCULLY'S kitchen table. They have a computer set up there and they're around it. LANGLY'S at the keyboard, BYERS sitting to his right and FROHIKE standing to his left.)

REYES: If they ID'd the woman then why isn't the FBI investigating it?

SCULLY: I asked them not to tell the FBI.

(REYES is concerned.)

REYES: What are you doing, Dana?

SCULLY: I'm trying to get my son back.

(SCULLY understands REYES' concern, but assisting the FBI isn't going to get her son back.)

FROHIKE: We're locked on.

LANGLY: Like there was ever a doubt.

BYERS: Which beings us that much closer to finding William. Langly's inside the system.

(BYERS is hooking up a cell phone.)

LANGLY: I'm hacked inside the phone company. Going to use their mainframe to scan the map for a locator signal.

SCULLY: Before William was kidnapped, Byers was able to tuck a cell phone under the padding of the baby's car seat.

FROHIKE: Call the phone, and Langly can use the signal to find its location. Find the phone, find the baby.

REYES: You mean, assuming the kidnapper hasn't found the phone.

(FROHIKE, still sporting a forehead wound, stares at REYES. He looks over at BYERS who is trying the cell phone. A "NO SIGNAL" message and high-pitched beeps emit from BYERS' NOKIA phone.)

BYERS: We'll keep trying.

(SCULLY leaves the men to find her son's location. She moves into the living room and checks to see that her gun is loaded. REYES follows. She watches SCULLY and can't stay silent any longer.)

REYES: This is madness, and you know it. They failed you once with your child. They're going to fail you again.

SCULLY: Then I'll find him myself.

REYES: You can't do this alone.

(She turns to face REYES.)

SCULLY: Look, what alternative do I have ... when the FBI is all but telling me they think that my son is already dead?

BYERS (interrupting): We've got a signal ... in Warfordsburg, Pennsylvania off the interstate.

SCULLY: You coming with me? Or am I going alone?

(SCULLY walks away leaving REYES standing in the living room.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 6
WARFORDSBURG, PA

(The phone that BYERS tucked into WILLIAM'S carseat is buzzing. It's green cell light on and blinking. WILLAIM is awake, silent and looking as cute as ever. The OVERCOAT WOMAN stops outside a VERIZON telephone booth. Her windshield has bullet holes in it.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 7

(Excavation site. Two men sit on top of the spacecraft trying to get the top to open. One man is using the crowbar like a bottle top opener and the other man his holding a large light. Standing above is JOSEPHO. He's kneeling and watching the men work. Another cult member, a woman, and others are taking photographs.)

(JOSEPHO'S cell phone rings. He stands, moves away from the men opening the craft and answers the phone.)

JOSEPHO (to the phone): Have you got him?

OVERCOAT WOMAN (over the phone): Yes. He's safe. We're here.

JOSEPHO (over the phone): We need to go carefully now. I want you to stay where you are. I'm sending someone to get you, all right?

OVERCOAT WOMAN (in phone booth, PA): Yes.

(Back at the excavation site, a low rumbling emits from the spacecraft behind JOSEPHO. He turns to see what's going on. The top of the spacecraft begins to move in a clockwise direction as it rises above the two men within.)

CULT MAN #1: It's moving! It's moving!

(JOSEPHO turns toward the ship as does all the others there. The ship continues to turn and rise. Lights from holes on the inside where the men stand shoot beams into the sky above. The two men look perplexed as the ship around them continues to move. JOSEPHO kneels to watch what happens. He looks confused.)

(The dome stops and a metallic sheathe suddenly appears from nowhere and covers the dome, trapping the two men inside.)

(JOSEPHO and the other gasp. The two men are trapped inside. JOSEPHO climbs onto the dome of the ship. He pounds on the metal sheathe covering the top in futility. Screaming when he realizes that he has two of his men are trapped within.)

JOSEPHO (pounding on the metal cover): Can you hear me?! (to himself) We need some tools. (to the others) Go get some tools! Come on, move it!

CUT TO:



SCENE 8
WARFORDSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA

(Night. A car pulls up. REYES & SCULLY burst out of the car. They approach the lone station wagon that was driven by the OVERCOAT WOMAN. SCULLY takes the driver's side and REYES, the passenger side. With her gun drawn, SCULLY opens the car door.)

SCULLY: Federal Agent!

(They're too late. The car is empty. The baby seat is still in the car and empty. SCULLY slams the door in frustration. She has a look of tired desperation on her face. She looks around. The abandoned car is parked in front of three well lit phone booths in a large parking lot.)

10:47 AM

(REYES walks in. She stops by the nurse's station looking for DOGGETT. There's a wall full of what looks like Christmas cards on the wall behind her. NURSE is there.)

REYES: John Doggett ... where is he? He's not in his bed.

(The NURSE looks at the papers in front of her.)

NURSE: They've taken him down to radiology to run a cat scan. Would you like me to call down to his doctor?

REYES: No. No, I was just worried. I'm sorry.

(REYES turns away. She sees the overhead "CHAPEL" sign and heads in that direction.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 10

(Hospital Chapel. REYES enters the Chapel. Its a small room with a large floor to ceiling stained glass, a cross/crucifix, and a small makeshift table/altar. Before it, REYES kneels. She doesn't look all that comfortable. She looks up at the crucified Christ on the cross, she folds her hands, closes her eyes and prays.)

(Behind her, the door opens and a man walks in. REYES stands. It's FOLLMER.)

REYES: What?

FOLLMER: Nothing.

(FOLLMER smiles. REYES walks toward him.)

FOLLMER: I've known you a long time and this just seems, uh ... a little traditional for you.

REYES: Maybe when you're lost you knock at the door with the porch light on.

FOLLMER: Hey ... hey ...

(FOLLMER sees her distress and moves to hold her.)

FOLLMER: I want you to know, I'm doing all I can to find the woman who did this. Even though we got people inside the FBI working against us.

(REYES notices FOLLMER'S use of pronouns and that he's grouping himself with "us" and not with "them". She pulls away from him to look at his face. FOLLMER isn't happy with what he's learned. Once again, he's the AD.)

FOLLMER: It was foolish going after her by yourselves. We could have been there long before you, Monica. Could have even captured the suspect. Instead, she got away.

(REYES wonders what FOLLMER'S game is.)

REYES: This is complicated, Brad. If you came in here to bust me ...

FOLLMER: No. No. I came here to ask for your cooperation. Not sharing information creates an atmosphere of distrust and then I'm less apt to share my information with you.

REYES: What haven't you shared with me?

FOLLMER: This FBI agent who tried to kill Scully's baby has come around. He's got something he wants to tell us.

REYES: What?

FOLLMER: I need your cooperation.

CUT TO:



SCENE 11

(Inside COMER'S hospital room, he's still unconscious. The ventilator tube is still taped to his mouth. REYES and FOLLMER enter. She notices that he's still unconscious.)

REYES: You said he tried to tell you something. How is that possible?

(FOLLMER pulls out the pad from under COMER'S left hand.)

FOLLMER: He didn't tell me exactly. He wrote it down.

REYES: I don't know what this means.

FOLLMER: I don't know, either. But it means something. And I want to know what.

(REYES is holding a piece of paper with the word "JACKET" written on it. I think COMER must be right handed after all.)

SEGUE TO:



SCENE 12

(Scully's apartment. SCULLY'S holding the piece of paper with the word "JACKET" on it. She faces REYES.)

SCULLY: Just tell me where you got this.

REYES: You know what it means?

SCULLY: Robert Comer wrote this, didn't he? The FBI Agent who tried to kill my son, and how did you get it?

REYES: I got it under the condition that I share what I learn from you.

SCULLY: Take it.

REYES: What is it? What does it mean?

SCULLY: If I don't tell you you're good on your word, right? That means that you've learned absolutely nothing from me.

(REYES takes the paper. SCULLY walks away.)

REYES: Where are you going?

SCULLY: To the hospital.

REYES: Hey, it doesn't work that way.

(SCULLY turns around to face REYES.)

SCULLY: Look, this began when the Agent lying in that hospital crashed his motorcycle running the border from Canada. Somehow, he got to Washington without a scratch and he tried to kill my son. Now, tell me, how did he do that, Monica?

(REYES is a little slow on the uptake.)

SCULLY: With something I found in his jacket pocket in a jacket that he wore to my house that I put three shots in.

REYES: The artifact ... piece of the ship.

CUT TO:



SCENE 13

(St. Mary Medical Centre. Night. While the NURSE is busy talking with two FBI agents (probably the two who were assigned to watch COMER'S room), SCULLY and REYES walk past them. They enter COMER'S room.

(The heart monitor is beeping. The monitors show the following: top number is at 122; blood pressure at 160/94 ... and the bottom number is a little blurry-perhaps its 90 or so.)

(SCULLY looks down at COMER. He is unconscious. REYES stands by watching. SCULLY pulls out the piece of metal and holds it over COMER'S heart. As she moves nearer, the heart monitor's beeps begin to accelerate. COMER begins to quiver and shake. SCULLY glances up at the monitors: Pulse rises to 147; blood pressure moves at 192/101; and the final figure drops slowly down to 85.)

(REYES watches from the side. Her face grows alarmed as she sees the metal affecting the comatose COMER. COMER grabs SCULLY'S hand - the one with the piece of metal. He's awake and trying to grab hold of the metal piece from her.)

SCULLY: Let go.

REYES: My god.

(SCULLY is struggling with COMER who for a sick guy has a firm grip on her. This means that he's definitely getting stronger.)

SCULLY: Let go of my hand. (TO REYES:) Turn off the monitors, or they're going to alert somebody.

(REYES moves off to the side toward the monitor which reads a steady 120 and shuts it off.)

(SCULLY successfully frees herself from COMER. COMER is gagging with the ventilator tube down his throat. She has to remove the tube if she wants COMER to talk. SCULLY pockets the piece of metal and moves to remove the tube. REYES shuts off the monitors.)

(COMER coughs as he breathes on his own. SCULLY leans in closer toward him. She's going to get her answers from him.)

SCULLY: Now, tell me who sent you to kill my son or I will take that pillow from under your head and make them the last breaths that you take.

COMER: Your son has to die.

(SCULLY grabs COMER'S throat. REYES stops her

COMER: I'm not what you think. Please ... please ... the FBI sent me uncover on a man named Josepho to get inside his cult whose followers believe an alien race will rule the world.

(COMER gasps.)

COMER: One day god told Josepho to lead us a thousand miles north to find a ship buried in the ground. You have a piece of that ship in your hand. Josepho believes that that ship is a temple which houses the physical manifestation of god.

SCULLY: Are you saying that god asked you to kill my child?

COMER: No. Josepho said god spoke to him of a miracle child. A future saviour coveted by forces of good and evil. Josepho believes your son is this child.

SCULLY: Then why does he want to kill him?

COMER: He doesn't. He wants to protect him. Josepho believes your son will follow in his father's paths and try and stop the aliens' return. Unless his father was to be killed. That is the prophesy.

REYES: You came here to kill her son against this man and his cult? To stop them? Are you saying you believe this prophesy but acted alone?

SCULLY: What he's saying is that Mulder is dead. That that's true. That they killed him to fulfil this prophesy.

COMER: And that your son must die, too. Or everyone... all of mankind will perish from earth. Please... please... let me.

(COMER reaches out to grab the piece of metal from SCULLY. She struggles with him.)

COMER (begging): Please. Please...

(They struggle for the metal piece. REYES stands by watching. They are interrupted when the NURSE with the FBI AGENTS and TOOTHPICK MAN enter the room. COMER has successfully gotten hold of the metal piece. He holds it in his hands. SCULLY grabs the blanket and covers COMER'S hands and the metal piece.)

NURSE: What is going on here?

TOOTHPICK MAN: What are you doing in here?

NURSE: They turned off all the monitors. They removed his intubation.

TOOTHPICK MAN: What are you doing in here?

SCULLY: This patient does not need support. He's breathing on his own.

TOOTHPICK MAN: Step outside. Both of you.

(REYES leaves. SCULLY looks back down at COMER.)

TOOTHPICK MAN (to SCULLY): Let's go.

(SCULLY leaves without the piece of metal.)

TOOTHPICK MAN (to the two agents): Get me ADS Follmer and Skinner.

(TOOTHPICK MAN is with the NURSE inside COMER'S room. He closes the door behind him. His eyes on COMER. COMER is breathing. He turns to look at TOOTHPICK MAN.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 14

(Excavation site. JOSEPHO is sitting on top of the crux of the metal dome. He's using some kind of a tool to try to get the dome to open. He drops the tool in frustration.)

JOSEPHO: It's not working.

(Behind him, the OVERCOAT WOMAN who kidnapped William walks in. She's holding William wrapped in his blue baby blanket. JOSEPHO turns when he sees them. He gets off of the dome, his men forgotten.)

(He approaches them. As does everyone else.)

JOSEPHO: You weren't followed?

OVERCOAT WOMAN: No.

(She's confident. He pulls the blanket away from WILLIAM to see him just as MULDER had done in *EXISTENCE.)

JOSPEHO: He's safe now. He's safe with us.

(The OVERCOAT WOMAN looks satisfied. WILLIAM isn't crying.)

(Behind them, the ship's dome opens up on its own. This looks really cool. TXF'S effects department really kicks butt!)

(Everyone rushes over to the dome. Smoke and/or heat comes out from the newly opened dome. JOSEPHO glances inside. He's not smiling. We also have to note that the two men who were trapped inside haven't made an appearance yet. JOSEPHO turns to look at the OVERCOAT WOMAN who is holding William. She is not smiling either. Perhaps, JOSEPHO is really looking at William. OVERCOAT WOMAN looks down at William. William is smiling. She looks back over at JOSEPHO who turns to look at the remains of his two trapped men.)

(The men are on their backs in a ying-yang position. They are burnt to a crisp a la either the black oil radiation or the rebel's fire sticks. The ring around the dome continues to turn in a clock-wise direction. The cult members stand on the perimeter of the ring looking down at their dead comrades.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 15

(FOLLMER and SKINNER burst through St. Mary's front door. There are a lot of FBI agents in dark suits standing in the hallway. FOLLMER followed by SKINNER turn the corner. When they reach COMER'S room, TOOTHPICK MAN is inside along with four medical personnel. One is working on COMER. TOOTHPICK MAN moves outside to talk with FOLLMER. SKINNER walks into the hospital room.)

FOLLMER: Where are Scully and Reyes?

TOOTHPICK MAN: They were told to wait out here.

(SKINNER walks up to the bed. He looks down at COMER; he watches the medical personnel work on him or rather, not work on him.)

FOLLMER (to SKINNER): Assistant Director ... we need Scully and Reyes. Now.

(SKINNER walks out of the room to look for SCULLY and REYES.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 16

(SCULLY and REYES enter the empty hospital chapel. SCULLY is panicking and she is upset.)

SCULLY: What are we going to tell them?

REYES: Who?

SCULLY: The FBI about Agent Comer. About what just happened. About how he was healed.

(REYES is calm and a little confused over SCULLY'S behaviour.)

REYES: Just tell them the truth.

SCULLY: They're not on our side. They will use the truth against us.

REYES: Dana, you don't believe what you heard in there. You don't believe what that man was telling you.

SCULLY: How can you doubt him? I mean, after everything that you've just witnessed. After what you saw with my son.

SCULLY (crying): I mean, it's-it's exactly what I feared. That there's something terribly wrong. From the very moment that he was conceived.

REYES: Your child was a miracle, Dana. I don't doubt that the things I've witnessed are any less miraculous. But your son is not an abomination -- a thing that should cease to exist. You tell me on that ship is written scripture from the world's great religions. Tell me a religion that decrees the death of a child. Not just your child but any child. This is a man saying these things to us. How many religions warn of false prophets? Men sent to deceive us?

REYES: The only thing that I believe is that your son may still be alive and we can find him and save him. And with that object in that room we can save Agent Doggett, too.

(SCULLY'S listening to REYES and hanging on to her words. She's calmer now than she was when she entered the Chapel. Both women are interrupted when SKINNER opens the door.)

SKINNER: You two better get out here. Agent Comer's dead.

REYES: What?!

(REYES looks shocked. She was pinning her hopes on the piece of metal to heal DOGGETT. She rushes out of the Chapel past SKINNER. REYES is on her way to witnessing (first-hand) an FBI cover-up. SCULLY follows.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 17

(REYES passes the FBI agents in the hallway and stops in front of COMER'S bed. COMER is dead.)

REYES: This man was alive. (to the NURSE) You saw him. (to FOLLMER) He was alive.

(REYES pushes away the blanket. She's looking for something. The piece of metal spaceship is gone.)

REYES: Somebody was in here. Where did it go?

(The NURSE shakes her head. Everyone's looking at REYES.)

FOLLMER: Where did what go?

REYES: This man had something in his hand. A small piece of metal. It's what revived him. I-it's why he could be taken off life support.

(SKINNER is standing by the doorway. He takes a deep breath and says nothing.)

NURSE: A piece of metal? I don't know what she's talking about.

(REYES walks to the NURSE and starts questioning her. )

REYES: Who else came into this room?

NURSE: Why are you questioning me?

REYES: Did you leave the room?

FOLLMER (interrupting): Agent Reyes ...

REYES: This woman came in here, and this man was alive. He was more than alive.

(REYES indicates COMER.)

REYES: He'd been healed. He'd been brought back to life. This man was murdered, but it wasn't by us.

FOLLMER: Agent ... Reyes.

REYES (ignoring FOLLMER): Who else was in here?

(REYES looks around the room ... at FOLLMER ... at the NURSE ... at ... TOOTHPICK MAN ... )

REYES: You were in here.

TOOTHPICK MAN: I came in and found you.

REYES: Were you alone in here? Was he alone in here?

TOOTHPICK MAN: She went to get the doctors.

(SKINNER, standing by the doorway, turns his head and looks at TOOTHPICK MAN. He has an unreadable look on his face.)

REYES: Search this man.

TOOTHPICK MAN: For what?

FOLLMER: Monica!

REYES (to FOLLMER): Scully saw it. Ask Agent Scully.

(REYES leaves the hospital room to get SCULLY who is not in the hallway. SKINNER watches REYES.)

REYES: Agent Scully ... Where's Scully? Agent Scully!

(REYES walks down the hallway.)

(SKINNER turns to look at TOOTHPICK MAN. He returns SKINNER'S look. It is unknown whether they are sharing communication or not.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 18

(Doggett's hospital room. DOGGETT is unconscious. It was mentioned earlier during the Task Force briefing that DOGGETT was in a coma. Currently, he as a nasal cannula and no ventilator hooked up. His breathing is regular.)

(SCULLY is sitting next to DOGGETT'S bed. Her hands are clasped and she's praying. She's speaking to DOGGETT. Tears fall down her cheeks.)

SCULLY: I never meant for this. All that's been lost. I never meant to put you at risk -- to risk losing you, too. She's fighting for you. Monica's out there trying to find a way. And she's not going to let you go.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully.

(DOGGETT'S eyes are opened. )

SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Oh ...

DOGGETT: I heard someone talking.

SCULLY: Yeah, that was me. That was me talking to you.

DOGGETT: No, it wasn't you.

(DOGGETT has a message for her.)

DOGGETT: They're going to come to you, but you can't trust them. Do you understand that?

(The door opens. It's REYES. She's looking for ... )

REYES: Agent Scully.

(REYES sees that DOGGETT is awake.)

REYES: Oh, my god.

(REYES' need to find SCULLY is forgotten. Her focus is on DOGGETT. She moves toward DOGGETT's bed. She looks down at DOGGETT. He smiles up at her.)

(SCULLY'S cell phone rings.)

SCULLY (to phone): Scully.

JOSEPHO: Listen carefully, Agent Scully.

(JOSEPHO is at the excavation site. The cult followers are standing around the hull of the ship looking down (probably at the two bodies still there).

(SCULLY listens silently on the cell phone as JOSEPHO speaks.)

JOSEPHO: You want to see your son? You come alone and you follow my instructions to the letter.

(REYES turns to look back over at SCULLY.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 19
OUTSIDE CALGARY, CANADA
2:42 AM

(Inside a small off-the-road diner, SCULLY waits for contact to arrive. A car approaches, the engine cuts, a car door opens and closes. SCULLY is alone inside and quietly waiting. She sighs. She must have been waiting a long time. JOSEPHO walks in. He sits down across from SCULLY. He clasps his hands in front of him.)

JOSEPHO: Sorry to keep you waiting but I had to make sure you were alone. I only wish to protect the boy from those who'd harm him. He's a very special boy.

SCULLY: I came here to take him back.

JOSPEHO: "Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north and a brightness was about it. And out of the midst came the likeness of four living creatures. And they had the likeness of a man." That's the bible. Did you know it?

SCULLY: "Ephesians."

[Transcriber note: That passage is from Ezekiel 1:4-5. The actual quote is: "And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man." -Ezekiel 1:4-5 (KJV)]

JOSEPHO: The bible ... describing giants who walk the earth. Who'd believe it? Only the faithful and we who have seen them. These ... Super Soldiers. The true Sons of God.

SCULLY: I want to see my son.

JOSEPHO: You struggle to believe. It's so incredible but your son will lead this alien race. He was put here to lead.

(JOSEPHO pauses. He makes a decision.)

JOSPEHO: I'll bring you to him, to see your son. After you do something for me. After you bring something I need. Confirmation that Mulder's dead.

(This doesn't make sense to SCULLY.)

SCULLY: You killed Mulder.

JOSEPHO: No. I believed he was dead ... but now I have reason to doubt that. And if he's alive he's the one thing preventing your son's true destiny.

(SCULLY makes a decision. There is a subtle air of confidence in her.)

SCULLY: You told me I could see my son. You lied.

JOSEPHO: If you want to see the boy ... you'll bring me the head of Fox Mulder.

(JOSEPHO looks at SCULLY to show that he means it. JOSPEHO leaves. He walks outside and to his car.)

(SCULLY waits. She pulls out her cell phone)

SCULLY (over phone): Get ready, Monica.

REYES: Hold on.

(They watch as JOSEPHO'S truck leaves the small diner's parking lot. The van door opens. It's FROHIKE.)

FROHIKE: His car is wired.

REYES (over phone): Here we go.

(REYES gets out of the van. FROHIKE climbs into the van. BYERS is in the back. They watch.)

(REYES and SCULLY move. They get into their rental and take off in pursuit of JOSEPHO. This time, SCULLY'S driving. After having faced an FBI cover- up, REYES is wonderfully cooperative and supportive.)

CUT TO:

(JOSEPHO'S truck continues its journey back to the excavation site.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 20

(SCULLY'S driving. REYES is on the phone with the TLG.)

REYES (to SCULLY): They say he's about a mile ahead, turning off the highway.

SCULLY: What about these hills? Are we going to lose him in these hills?

CUT TO:



SCENE 21

(Inside the Gunmen VW. FROHIKE'S on the cell phone talking to REYES. LANGLY'S working the computer, BYERS is sitting next to him. The screen is in night-vision green. It seems to be hooked up to a satellite view. There's a small moving triangle with corresponding L/L coordinates indicating JOSEPHO'S truck as it travels over the terrain.)

FROHIKE: Yeah, yeah.

(The neon green glows off of LANGLY. Both men turn to look at FROHIKE.)

FROHIKE: How are we in terrain?

LANGLY: That transponder will track this guy driving under water to Brazil.

(At LANGLY'S words and in true Murphy's Law fashion as it only works with TLG, the computer screen beeps a warning and a message box pops up on screen: "SIGNAL LOST - last known position 51.00 N 115.08?W".)

BYERS (alarmed): Langly. What just happened?

(LANGLY hits some keys and hits the laptop keyboard in frustration.)

CUT TO:

REYES (in the car): We're coming to a turn. Is this it?

(Back in the TLG Van, FROHIKE'S caught in the middle and stalls ... )

FROHIKE: Uh... yeah.

(FROHIKE makes a decision.)

FROHIKE: Turn.

CUT TO:

(Back in the car, SCULLY makes the turn ... )

CUT TO:

REYES (in the car to SCULLY): I think they lost the signal.

SCULLY: Well, they have to get it back.

CUT TO:

(LANGLY'S frustrated and hits his laptop keyboard.)

LANGLY: Piece of crap!

FROHIKE (still on the phone): Hey, louder, why don't you?

BYERS (calm as ever): Tell them we're working on it.

(FROHIKE'S just as frustrated as the other men. He told them to turn. He holds the cell phone out to BYERS.)

FROHIKE: Here, you be the messenger.

(BYERS has a "not in a million years" look on his face.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 22

(Excavation site. The lights on the spacecraft is beaming strong. The spacecraft is humming. The two bodies inside the craft dome is covered in some kind of plastic. They have not removed the bodies. Perhaps, no one wants to climb down there. The outer ring of the craft dome moves in a clockwise direction.)

(WILLIAM'S cries can be heard above the spacecraft rumbling. The Cult Woman is still carrying WILLIAM. He is screaming. She does nothing to try to comfort him. She simply carries him. She looks uncomfortable ... like she doesn't really care.)

(Behind her, JOSEPHO enters the tent. He approaches the OVERCOAT WOMAN.)

JOSEPHO: What is it? What's happening?

OVERCOAT WOMAN: The baby started crying ... and it just came to life

(From above, we see the light from deep within the ship shine brighter. All the cult members surround the outer dome ring which still moves slowly in a clockwise direction.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 23

(Outside the excavation site. SCULLY stops the car. She and REYES exit. REYES is still on the phone with TLG. They've come to the end of the road.)

REYES: Hey, guys, we lost him. And we just ran out of road out here.

( ... and just as SCULLY had called out to MULDER in *WITHOUT, she cries out to her son in the darkness. )

SCULLY: William?

(In the distance, she sees the top of the excavation tent.)

SCULLY: William!

(She knows her son is there. SCULLY starts to run toward the tent.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the tent.)

(William continues crying.)

(The ship clangs. The light beams from the center of the ship still shine upward. JOSEPHO stands watching. CULT WOMAN holding WILLIAM stands next to him.)

(The center of the ship where the light beams are emitting from begin to depress. JOSEPHO is compelled to get a closer look. He braves the inner dome where the other two dead bodies are. He crawls in. The inner part continues to depress. JOSEPHO stands directly above it. The other cult followers surround the outer ring of the metal dome. WILLIAM'S cries pierce through the ship's rumblings.)

(The ship begins to shake. Everyone standing on the ship shakes with it. The inner part of the ship has hit center. The lights darken. ALL the lights go out.)

(Suddenly, a powerful beam of light bursts from the very center that JOSEPHO is leaning over. It hits him full force. It continues to shine straight through him. The outer lights of the ship light up as well.)

(OVERCOAT WOMAN is still holding on to WILLIAM. All the lights on the ship power up. We do not know what 'kind' of light this is. We do not know whether this light emits heat. We do know that it is very, very bright.)

(The ship begins to shake and rumble. The light beam that started from the center of the ship where JOSEPHO was grows and expands to fill the entire inner dome of the ship. The followers still stand on top of the ship. OVERCOAT WOMAN is still holding WILLIAM.)

(The light that hits JOSEPHO continues to get stronger, thicker, brighter.)

(WILLIAM'S piercing cries can be heard above the ship.)

CUT TO: [OUTISDE THE TENT]

(SCULLY is running up the hill. She can hear the noise from the ship.)

SCULLY: William!

(The light from inside the tent burns brighter and bursts through the flimsy tent covering. SCULLY and REYES reach the top of the hill just in time to witness the space ship emerging from the tent. They both pause. They both see the ship disappear in the distance. REYES watches the ship. SCULLY sees the burning tent collapse in horror.)

SCULLY: No ...

(SCULLY'S spurred into motion. They both run to the ruins that once was the excavation site. The burnt remains of the tent flap in the wind. Little fires of the remaining tent burn throughout the site. SCULLY and REYES separate to search for any sign of WILLIAM ... for any sign of life.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(In the center of the tent there is a gaping hole. Neither one spares the hole a look. They are walking amidst the burnt bodies of what was the cult followers. They are burnt to a crisp just like those bodies found at Ruskin Dam, El Rico, etc. This scene is all too familiar to SCULLY.)

(These are adult bodies. Burnt adult bodies.)

(The two meet. SCULLY looks at REYES and turns to head toward the hole in the center. REYES stops her.)

REYES: Dana ...

(SCULLY has a lost look on her face. She doesn't want to believe that her son is gone.)

(Off in the distance above the sounds of the winds, they hear a baby's healthy cry. For a moment, the two women pause trying to find the direction of its source.)

(SCULLY heads toward the center of the crater as the cries get louder. This time, REYES doesn't stop her.)

SCULLY: Oh, my ...

(SCULLY works her way through the smoke to the center of the crater where she finds ... )

SCULLY: William?

(SCULLY reaches him. He's still wrapped snugly in his blue baby blanket. Unburnt. Unhurt. He's kicking healthily and crying lustily. He's plainly unhappy at being on the cold dirt ground.)

(SCULLY picks him up. She's crying. He's crying. She kisses his brow and holds him close.)

FADE TO:



SCENE 24

(St. Mary Medical Centre. DOGGETT is sitting alone in the chapel. The room is silent. He faces the stained glass, the crucifix of the crucified Christ on the cross. REYES enters and takes a seat next to DOGGETT. He looks at her.)

REYES: I came to give you a ride home. They told me you were in here.

DOGGETT: Yeah.

(He turns back to look at the Cross.)

REYES: I came in here and prayed for you.

DOGGETT: Yeah, I know.

(REYES turns to look at DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: This voice in my head, it was ... it was talking to me telling me to get up ... telling me to warn Scully about this man. I mean ... was it you talking to me?

REYES: I only prayed for your life.

(DOGGETT considers her words.)

SCENE 25
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Kersh's Office. KERSH walks toward his office carrying a brown file folder. The file folder is unlabelled. Behind him, AD FOLLMER suddenly appears and hastily knocks on the door to get KERSH'S attention before he goes into his office. KERSH turns around.)

FOLLMER: Uh, Deputy Director?

KERSH: Mr. Follmer.

FOLLMER: Sir, it's, um ... it's about that report you have there. The investigation of Special Agent Robert Comer's death.

KERSH: Yes?

FOLLMER: As you know, A.D. Skinner refused to sign it believing that Agent Comer was murdered in his hospital bed.

KERSH: But you did sign it, isn't that right, Mr. Follmer? Finding nothing to support that allegation.

(FOLLMER walks into the outer office.)

FOLLMER: Well ... that's just it, sir. I did find something. The monitors in Agent Comer's room they recorded his condition moment by moment ... showing that his vital signs did improve just before his equipment was unplugged. They did, in fact ... return back to normal.

KERSH: And you have an explanation for that, yes?

FOLLMER: No, sir, I don't.

KERSH: And you want what?

FOLLMER: I just want to take my name off it.

KERSH: Maybe if you weren't so busy backpedalling, Mr. Follmer, you might get me an explanation. Excuse me.

(KERSH leaves the stunned FOLLMER and heads to his office.)

(KERSH shuts the door behind him.)

CUT TO: [INSIDE KERSH'S OFFICE]

(KERSH pauses by his doorway.)

KERSH: I'm sure you heard all of that.

(KERSH walks into the office. TOOTHPICK MAN is sitting there at ease.)

KERSH: Congratulations -- it would appear now that everything is dead but this case.

(KERSH hands the brown file folder to TOOTHPICK MAN who opens it to reveal the standard cream-coloured, red-worded X-File Folder. An X-File. Bureau File Number: X280911.)

(He looks at KERSH. He is confident.)

TOOTHPICK MAN: I'm sure I can take care of that, Deputy Director. Quite sure.

(KERSH doesn't look happy. The camera refocuses from KERSH to the back of TOOTHPICK MAN'S neck where we see the standard genetic mutation of a Super- Soldier ... the bumps on the back of his neck.)

SCENE 1
FALLS CHURCH, VIRGINIA

(It's dark. REYES pulls her bronco up to the side of DOGGETT'S house. It's a two-story house with a white picket fence. The porch light is on. Out in front along the sidewalk is a lit lamppost. The two agents had just come back from going out after work.)

REYES: Thanks for the beer.

DOGGETT: Thanks for the lift.

(REYES unbuckles her seat belt.)

REYES: So, big plans for the weekend?

DOGGETT: Oh, huge. Microwave pizza, satellite TV.

REYES: Wow. Thanks for making my life sound exciting. Maybe we both need pets. They say people with pets live longer.

DOGGETT (confesses): I was thinking about getting a cat.

REYES: There's dog people, and there's cat people. You are a dog person, John.

DOGGETT: How do you figure?

(REYES chuckles.)

REYES: You're faithful, you're dependable, you're without guile, you're very comfortable to be around. So why a cat?

DOGGETT: Low maintenance. They don't expect much from you, so you can't disappoint 'em.

REYES: I don't see you ever disappointing anyone, John.

(The two look at each other, sharing the moment. The moment soon passes.)

DOGGETT: See you Monday?

REYES: Yeah. See ya.

(DOGGETT smiles at her and leaves. REYES puts her seatbelt back on. She drives off. DOGGETT stops to watch her leave.)

REYES (smiling to herself): John, John, John.

(She reaches an intersection about a block away when another car speeding through a stop sign hits her on the driver's side.)

SCENE 2

(Trauma room. The EMT'S wheel REYES to the Emergency Room on a gurney. The ER physician and team are working on her. REYES' eyes are open.)

ER NURSE: One, two and three.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Miss... ?

ER NURSE: Reyes.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: How you feeling tonight? You with us?

(DR. PREIJERS shines his penlight into her eyes ... )

FADE TO WHITE:



SCENE 3

(Trauma room. We are close on REYES who lies with her eyes open. No penlight plays over her face now. The room is QUIET now, too - no on/off screen bustle of activity is heard. Reyes BLINKS, then blinks again. She focuses. She sits up. As she does, we ADJUST to reveal we are: )

(Inside the Doppel Hospital Trauma Room.)

(It's the same familiar trauma room, only this one is DESERTED - no doctors, no nurses, no one at all. It's not like everyone just split all of a sudden, either. The set dressing, or rather the dearth of it, makes it seem more like no one was ever here. )

(REYES looks around the room with some confusion. She touches the fresh trickle of blood on her head. She slides off the gurney, mildly surprised to find herself feeling fine. Feeling strong and well. REYES gets up. The ER room is empty. There's no one there. She's bleeding from a cut on her left temple.)

(REYES steps into the admitting area of the doppel hospital ER, also DESERTED. She wanders through, looking all around. This is getting weird.)

REYES: Hello? (a bit louder) Is anybody here?

(There is no answer. The place is eerily quiet, not a sound to be heard, not even the hum of room tone.)

(To differentiate it from the just plain HOSPITAL where REYES was first checked into, this place where REYES is will be called the DOPPEL HOSPITAL.. And here's a subtle but crucial note for our Art Department: there is no signage in the Doppel Hospital. No written words on the walls, on the Coke machines, on the equipment - none whatsoever. There's no DAY or NIGHT in the Doppel Hospital, either. None will be specified. We'll avoid seeing out any exterior windows. The light throughout this place is cold, steely blue-grey.)

(We are close on REYES again, her unease grows by the second. She looks into nearby rooms, checks behind the admitting desk. Nada, nobody, not a soul. She turns and walks quickly toward the exit. The automatic doors work fine. They open. She's stunned. There's nothing there but a blue sky or endless void outside ...

SCENE 4

(In the doppel hospital. REYES looks at herself in the small reflection of the paper towel dispenser. She dabs lightly at the bloodied cut at her left temple. In the distorted reflection, she sees a man behind her. He's dressed in pajamas. He approaches her cautiously.)

STEPHEN MUDOCH: Hello. (REYES is startled and turns around.) It's okay. I was a little freaked out, too ... at first.

REYES: Who are you?

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Stephen Murdoch. I-I don't even know if that matters anymore but my name is Stephen. Did you just look outside?

(REYES nods her head slightly.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH (gently): Yeah. Don't do that.

(MURDOCH turns and starts walking down the hallway. REYES follows.)

REYES: Where did everybody go?

STEPHEN MURDOCH: I think the question is, "where did we go?" Were you in an accident?

REYES: I think I was hit by a car on my way home.

STEPHEN MURDOCH: I came in with chest pains. Mr. Barreiro, someone new. I found Mr. Barreiro wandering around here same as you. He fell at a construction site where he used to work.

(MR. BARREIRO is a Hispanic man. The entire left half of his head is shaved and he bears a large 4-5 inch scar. REYES stares at him. Well ... not so much at him, but at the situation that they're in.)

REYES (to MURDOCH): You think we're dead.

(MURDOCH tilts his head slight as if to say, "don't you?" REYES looks at MR. BARREIRO. He looks as if he believes that they are dead.)

REYES: No. No, I don't believe that.

VAL BARREIRO: Have you ever been dead? So how do you know you're not?

(REYES turns and walks away from the two men.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 5

(In the real hospital. SCULLY enters the Emergency Room. She sees DOGGETT in the waiting room. He's upset. She sits next to him.)

DOGGETT: Hell of a thing to wake up to, huh?

(She puts a comforting arm around his shoulders.)

DOGGETT: We stopped after work. She had a beer.

SCULLY: Well, the man who hit her had fifteen. Don't do this to yourself, John.

CUT TO:



SCENE 6

(In REYES' real hospital room. The monitor hooked up to record REYES' brain activity shows no activity at all. All the lines are flat. All of them. REYES isn't on a ventilator. She does have a cannula on. SCULLY is looking through the ER chart. DOGGETT watches SCULLY from the side.)

SCULLY: It's true, John. She's gone.

DOGGETT: I don't accept that. Look at her breathing. Her heart's still beating. There's got to be hope.

SCULLY: There's no measurable electrical activity in her brain. Brain death is ... indeed death, John.

(DOGGETT looks down at REYES.)

SCULLY: I'm sorry.

(Behind DOGGETT, REYES appears outside in the blue-tinged hallway. She peers in. There's no recognition, nothing from her to indicate that she sees DOGGETT or SCULLY ... or herself.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 7

(In the doppel hospital, REYES sees an empty room through the glass. The bed is empty. There's no one in the room. She walks away to check the next room. It, too, is empty.)

(She stops at the nurse's station and pulls out a chart and looks through it. We get to see four different looking hospital forms. The pages are covered with hospital form gibberish. No, really. It's gibberish. If it weren't I'd probably transcribe the entire thing for you, too. The forms are all blank meaning that they're not completed. Not one of them is filled.)

(MURDOCH appears from the side.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: The thing is, it's not that bad, once you get used to the idea.

REYES: Have you seen this? It's nonsense, all of it. There's not a single sign on any of the walls here. Why is that?

(MURDOCH stands with his hands clasped. He doesn't say anything.)

REYES: You say we're dead. This seem like heaven to you? A big, deserted catholic hospital?

STEPHEN MURDOCH: I didn't say this was heaven. For all I know, it's ... it's hell.

(They're walking down the hallway.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: I don't know anything for sure. Maybe this place is a way station; to what comes next.

(REYES considers his words. She makes up her mind and begins to walk away from him with purpose.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Where are you going?

REYES: I'm finding a way out.

CUT TO:

(REYES stands near the closed ER door. She's looking outside. She looks thoughtful. She picks up a porcelain mud and drops it into the void. The mug falls. When it hits the end of the void, it disintegrates though what seems like an electrical force-field.)

(She walks back inside. The ER doors close behind her. She doesn't look back.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 8

(In REYES' real room. In front of REYES' bed, the ER physician who worked on REYES introduces himself.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Jack Preijers. I'm very sorry for your loss.

DOGGETT: Look, you two are the experts but there's got to be something more that can be done.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Well, I wish there were. And I don't mean to make this any harder but I do have information you both need to hear.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Your partner had a living will. She signed an organ donor card.

DOGGETT: Uh-uh. No way.

SCULLY: John ...

DOGGETT: Just slow down, all right?

DOGGETT: She's lying there in one piece. There's no fractures, no damage to her skull. Does that add up to you?

SCULLY: John, at the end of the day it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the diagnosis or her prognosis.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: In these situations time is always of the essence. There is a woman in Minnesota who can be saved by your friend's heart. In a real sense, she will live on.

CUT TO:



SCENE 9

(REYES is walking back down the hallway in the doppel hospital. Through a frosted wall, she makes out the shadow of a figure.)

REYES: Mr. Murdoch?

(The figure moves, but doesn't respond to her.)

REYES: Mr. Barreiro?

(The figure runs from her. REYES takes off after her. She rounds the corner and sees a woman running.)

REYES: You, stop!

(The woman stops. It's AUDREY PAULEY. She looks at REYES, then runs down another hallway. REYES runs after her. It's a dead-end hallway. The woman is nowhere to be seen.)

(REYES runs up to the wall and puts her hand on it. It is solid.)

(In the distance, she hears MURDOCH yelling for her.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Monica?!

(REYES leaves the wall to find MURDOCH.)

CUT TO:

(REYES runs through the hall as she hears a panicked MURDOCH calling for her.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Monica!

(REYES arrives. MURDOCH is standing some distance away from BARREIRO who is crackling with the same kind of electricity that the mug burned up in ... in the void. He's in obvious pain.)

STPEHEN MURDOCH: What's happening to him?

(MURDOCH and MONICA watch as BARREIRO screams in pain, crackles as the electrical force consumes him. He disappears from their sight.)

REYES: Oh, my god.

(Both MURDOCH and MONICA wonder if the same thing is going to happen to them.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 10

(Inside the real hospital in BARREIRO'S room. The steady tone of a heart monitor flatlined. BARREIRO is in the hospital bed. Surrounding his bed are his wife, son and daughter. Soft sobs can be heard.)

(DR. PREIJERS turns off the monitor and turns around to face the family.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: I am so very sorry for your loss.

(The family continue to grieve. Outside, AUDREY PAULEY watches. She takes her flower delivery cart and continues down the hallway.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(Hospital. SCULLY is inside MONICA'S hospital room studying the monitor with the record of her brain scan. DOGGETT walks in. He looks haggard and worn.)

DOGGETT: They're burning up the phone lines down there. Arranging with all these other hospitals how to divvy up Monica. They say they could do it as early as tomorrow.

(He looks hopefully at SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: Is there anything ... anything at all?

SCULLY: I did note some minor swelling in the left anterior which is consistent with subdural haematoma.

DOGGETT: Minor swelling?

SCULLY: I-I don't know if that means anything. It's not like there's an exact formula for how much damage equals death.

(DOGGETT walks over to the table with other papers. He picks them up and looks at them. He's looking for anything that will stop the proceedings. He thinks he may have found something. He just doesn't know what it means.)

DOGGETT: What about this?

(DOGGETT pulls out a piece of paper. It's the brain monitor readout. It has some indicator numbers on it: 135/7 and 170/7. There is also a big 8:11 PM circled on the top. That's when the monitor flatlines and shows that she has no brain activity.)

DOGGETT: This was monitoring her brain activity, right? Electrical impulses.

SCULLY: Yeah. She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded.

DOGGETT: Suddenly they just stop here. Right here. And if we can learn what this is maybe we can reverse it.

(DOGGETT takes the papers and walks out of the room to find someone who can answer his questions. SCULLY calls out to him, but he doesn't answer her.)

SCULLY: Agent Doggett.

(He ignores her and continues out of the room.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 12

(In the doppel hospital, MURDOCH and REYES are examining the hallway that AUDREY disappeared through.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Okay, so-so this woman you saw--she went through the wall?

REYES: I don't know. She was here, and then she disappeared.

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Disappeared? What do you mean, like Mr. Barreiro did?

(MONICA is still trying doors and examining walls. ) REYES: Different than Barreiro.

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Okay, okay, let's concentrate on one unexplainable event at a time here. What the hell happened to Mr. Barreiro?

REYES: My opinion? I think he died.

(MR. MURDOCH looks at MONICA as if he's heard one too many theories already. She continues.)

REYES: You can't die if you're already dead. Which backs up my belief that you and I are alive. I have no idea where she went.

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Hold on. If he's dead ... and we're not ... then where the hell are we?

(MONICA doesn't know.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 13

(At the nurses' station in the real hospital.)

DOGGETT: Dr. Preijers.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: I'll be there in one minute.

DOGGETT: I'm wondering about this moment on my partner's EEG tape--8:11 P.M., When brain death apparently occurred.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: You're reviewing our records?

DOGGETT: Well, no offense, but yeah. I just need to know if there was some change in Monica's condition leading up to this.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Agent Doggett, if you're trying to build a malpractice case against me or this hospital ...

DOGGETT: I'm not. I just want the facts.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Whitney, could you pull the code notes from earlier tonight, please?

NURSE WHITNEY: Mm-hmm.

DOGGETT: Look, Monica had a seat belt and an airbag protecting her through the crash. The ambulance crew said she was conscious at the scene. I just think there's something we're all missing.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Well, I don't think this will help you any but this describes what my team and I did to save your friend. You can take it, copy it, study it at your leisure.

NURSE (from behind): Dr. Preijers?

[CLOSED CAPTION: DR. JACK PREIJERS: If you'll excuse me ... ]

CUT TO:



SCENE 14

(In REYES' real hospital room, MONICA'S in bed with an undaunting number of tubes coming out of her. Next to her bedside is AUDREY PAULEY. She's just sitting there looking at MONICA. DOGGETT approaches the door and sees her. He walks in. AUDREY is startled. She stands to leave.)

DOGGETT (whispering): Oh, it-it's all right. (He indicates that she can stay.) You work here?

(AUDREY is a timid woman. She's shy and soft-spoken. She is awkward and quiet.)

AUDREY PAULEY: Uh, I-I'm a patient aide. I deliver the flowers mostly. Are you her husband?

(DOGGETT shakes his head, no.)

AUDREY PAULEY: You love her, though.

(DOGGETT doesn't say anything. She opens the door to leave, pauses and makes a decision to help comfort him.)

AUDREY PAULEY: She's not gone. Not her soul.

DOGGETT: I wish I could talk to her. I wish I could tell her. Guess I wish a lot of things.

(AUDREY looks at DOGGETT. She doesn't know what to say. She leaves. He turns to look at MONICA. DOGGETT stands next to her bed.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 15

(The elevator moves down to the real Hospital Basement. AUDREY comes out of the elevator. She goes to a room where a dollhouse sized model of the hospital is replicated. It seems as if she'd built the model. AUDREY hangs up her peach coat and sits in front of the model.)

(The camera pans from AUDREY'S room, passes through the model window and into the blue/gray-tinged Hospital where MONICA and MURDOCH are. MONICA is going from room to room looking for a way out. MURDOCH is following behind her.)

(We are now in the doppel hospital.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Come on. You're not giving up, are you?

(MURDOCH sees something behind MONICA.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Monica.

(MONICA turns around. It's AUDREY. AUDREY is standing half in light and half in darkness. Half of her is coloured and the other half is slightly blue-grey tinged.)

REYES (softly): Please. Don't run. Who are you?

AUDREY PAULEY: I'm Audrey. I-I work at the hospital.

REYES: Audrey, I'm Monica. Stephen and I just want to get out of here. Will you show us the way out?

AUDREY PAULEY: I can't. I can't help you.

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Why not?

AUDREY PAULEY: I came to tell you your friend ... loves you very much.

REYES: My friend? Did you talk to John? Does he know where I am?

AUDREY PAULEY: They all think you're dead.

(MONICA turns to look at MURDOCH. AUDREY has delivered her message. She turns to leave.)

REYES: Wait! Give my friend a message. Tell him he's a dog person.

(AUDREY looks at REYES. She will deliver the message. She moves down the corridor behind the wall blocking MONICA'S and MURDOCH'S view of her.

(They turn the corner and she's gone. There are tears in MONICA'S eyes.

CUT TO:



SCENE 16

(DR. PREIJERS is sitting at a small table in a tiny office. He's doing some paperwork. The faucet drips steadily. There's a small knock on the door and the nurse from the Trauma Room walks in.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Hey, Whitney.

NURSE WHITNEY: Doctor, it's not my place to say, but you might want to review the code notes for tonight.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Why is that?

NURSE WHITNEY: Well, there was an injection you gave Miss Reyes that wasn't in the notes.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: I don't think so.

NURSE WHITNEY: In trauma bay, I saw you administer the IV push. I assumed it was epinephrine.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: I have no memory of that. Anybody else see this?

NURSE WHITNEY: Just me. But it happened. My only point being, if there is an investigation that's the kind of inconsistency malpractice lawyers love to get hold of.

DR. JACK PREIJERS: Whitney, thank you so much for looking out for me.

(She turns to walk out, DR. PREIJERS moves incredibly fast. He stands, grabs her from behind and muffles her screams. He pulls out a small syringe and injects her with something in the neck. She goes limp and falls to the floor.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 17

(DOGGETT is sitting alone in the hospital hallway. It's daylight and the hospital around him is bustling with activity. He is impervious to it all, trapped in his own mixed-up world of memories and might-have-beens.)

REYES (V.O.): There's cat people, and there's dog people. You are a dog person, John. You're faithful. You're dependable. You're without guile and you're very comfortable to be around.

(In his memory, he sees MONICA behind the driver's wheel in the car. She's smiling at him as she tells him exactly what kind of man he is.)

(There are unshed tears in his eyes as he remembers.)

REYES (V.O.): I don't see you ever disappointing anyone, John.

(In his mind, they are alone in the car, she's gazing at him. He's gazing at her. He slowly moves toward her. She moves toward him. His hand comes up to cup her cheek. Their lips touch ... )

(DOGGETT is pulled back to the cold, lonely hallway as a woman's screams fill the air. Medical personnel run toward the room.)

NURSE: Get me some help in here!

CUT TO:



SCENE 18

(In the real hospital, NURSE WHITNEY is lying on a table. SCULLY is there.)

SCULLY: What exactly are you thinking?

DOGGETT: She helped work on Monica. I started asking questions about what happened in the trauma bay and she very inconveniently drops dead.

SCULLY: You're thinking that somebody murdered her to cover something up.

DOGGETT: Well, if it were you, how would you go about it make it look like natural causes?

SCULLY: Well, I'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital. I'd use a small-bore needle to make it next to impossible to find an injection mark.

DOGGETT: Next to impossible ... That's why you're perfect for the job. Should probably test her blood, too, while you're at it, right?

SCULLY: Agent Doggett ... I'm happy to do this for you. Just don't kid yourself that this is going to somehow bring her back.

(He blinks. He leaves. SCULLY sighs.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 19

(DOGGETT is sitting next to MONICA'S bedside. He is tenderly brushing MONICA'S hair away from her eyes. He's interrupted by AUDREY.)

AUDREY PAULEY: Your name is John, right? She has a message for you. She says you're a dog person.

(AUDREY'S words hit DOGGETT. He is stunned. DOGGETT looks back at MONICA who is still unconscious. AUDREY walks away. DOGGETT rushes to catch her.)

DOGGETT: Wait. Where did you get that? Who said that to you?

AUDREY PAULEY: I told you. She's not gone.

CUT TO:



SCENE 20

(Back in the doppel hospital, MONICA'S looking through the garbled chart sheets. MURDOCH is standing by the ER door. He's looking outside.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Look, I went through every last page of that before you ever got here. It's just nonsense, just like you said. There's not a clue in it.

REYES: Maybe in itself it's a clue. This place looks pretty complete at first glance but really it's not. There's so much missing. Words, details. It's like a set. A movie set but like it was built by someone who couldn't quite grasp what it was they were recreating.

(MURDOCH starts to shake. Something's wrong. MURDOCH gasps for air.)

REYES: Stephen, you okay?

(MURDOCH falls to the floor. He reaches out to MONICA who grabs his hand. He continues to gasp for air.)

REYES: Stephen, talk to me.

STEPHEN MURDOCH (gasping): What's ... what's happening to m-me?

CUT TO:



SCENE 21

(In MURDOCH'S hospital room, the steady tone of the heart monitor drones in the room. DR. PREIJERS has turned off the life-support for MR. MURDOCH. He reaches over and turns off the monitor. MRS. MURDOCH is sitting next to his bed, holding his hand and weeping.)

MRS. MURDOCH: Does he feel any pain?

DR. JACK PREIJERS (shaking his head): Absolutely none.

(DR. PREIJERS disconnects the oxygen tubing to MR. MURDOCH.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: It's just a matter of time.

CUT TO:



SCENE 22

(AUDREY turns on the lights to her room in the hospital basement. She walks in. DOGGETT is behind her. She closes the door.)

DOGGETT: You live down here?

(AUDREY stands by the door.)

AUDREY PAULEY: The-the nuns let me stay. I-I wanted to be a nurse, only I can't do much but they let me help out.

(DOGGETT studies the hospital model, the centrepiece of AUDREY'S room.)

DOGGETT: This is this hospital. You made this? (AUDREY nods.) Why?

AUDREY PAULEY: I like to visit it. I sort of go ... inside my head.

DOGGETT: You go into the model?

AUDREY PAULEY: I like it there. It's quiet. I used to have it all to myself but then some people showed up. Hospital patients. Your friend.

DOGGETT: This is where you say you talked to her? Right inside here?

(He indicates the model. She shakes her head. She tries to explain and starts getting excited at being able to talk about something to someone who will listen to her and maybe even understand her.

AUDREY PAULEY: Well ... not so much like tiny people in a ... in a model, but .. inside my head? Up here, I guess.

(She stops. She looks at him. DOGGETT looks confused.)

AUDREY PAULEY: You don't believe me.

DOGGETT: Audrey ... you said that you saw some other people besides my friend. Other patients? Can you tell me who they are?

(AUDREY looks at DOGGETT.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 23

(In the doppel hospital, MURDOCH is gasping for air. MONICA is holding on to him. They both know that he's about to die.)

STEPHEN MURDOCH: There's so much ... I'd do ... differently.

REYES: What?

STEPHEN MURDOCH: Life.

(Gasping.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 24

(In the real hospital, the elevator bell dings, door opens and DOGGETT walks out. He rounds the corner and finds SCULLY on the phone at the nurse's station.)

SCULLY: I'll call you back.

(SCULLY hangs up.)

SCULLY: Monica's parents are on their way from Mexico City. They're coming to say good-bye.

DOGGETT: Well, they can say "hello" instead. Nobody's shutting off her life support system. Not with what I got.

(He holds out a couple of file folders. SCULLY takes them.)

SCULLY: What are these?

DOGGETT: Patient files. Both men were declared brain dead, same as her. All three have something else in common, too. Check out the attending physician.

(DOGGETT pulls SCULLY off to the side. SCULLY opens the file. It reads: BARRIERO, VAL / Pt. ID # 106549 / Med # 659855589784. On the same sheet, DR. JACK PREIJERS' signature graces the form.)

SCULLY: Dr. Jack Preijers.

DOGGETT: The guy is some kind of Dr. Death. He gets off on pulling the plug on his own patients. He did it last night to this guy Barreiro.

SCULLY: Well, at the request of the family.

DOGGETT: But what I'm saying is what if he poisoned Barreiro in the first place? Same as this guy Stephen Murdoch, same as Monica. Tox screen will prove it.

SCULLY: How did you come up with these two men's names?

DOGGETT: If I tell you that, you'll think I'm crazy. But Monica's alive same as this guy Murdoch. And we got to help them both get back.

(SCULLY looks as if she believes DOGGETT.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 25

(In the doppel hospital, MURDOCH'S gasping for breath. He's no longer speaking.)

REYES: Steven stay with me.

(The electrical crackling engulfs MURDOCH. He's smiling at MONICA and its questionable whether he is in any pain. Steven disappears in MONICA'S arms.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 26

(In the real hospital. DOGGETT and SCULLY rush over to STEVEN MURDOCH'S room and peer through the glass. A sheet is being pulled over the recently deceased Mr. MURDOCH by Dr. JACK PREIJERS.)

(DOGGETT and SCULLY look at each other. DR. PREIJERS notices the two standing outside. DOGGETT looks angry or worried. He's running out of time and out of options.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 27

(AUDREY is sitting on the floor of her room her back resting against her bed. She's curled into a ball. Someone is pounding on her door. She gets up.)

DOGGETT: Audrey, it's John Doggett!

(The pounding continues.)

DOGGETT: Audrey!

(She opens the door. DOGGETT walks in.)

DOGGETT: I still need your help.

AUDREY PAULEY: I told you their names. Mr. Barreiro and Mr. Murdoch.

DOGGETT: No, they're both dead now. Monica's the only one left. And inside an hour the hospital plans to cut off her life support. Now, I'm not going to let that happen--no matter what it takes. But I'm losing here. Nobody else believes she's alive. Nobody -- just you and me.

AUDREY PAULEY: I can't do anything. I only deliver the flowers is all I do. I can't help.

DOGGETT (desperate): You can talk to her, right? You can.

(DOGGETT looks at the hospital model where he indicates as where MONICA is. He holds both her hands. He pulls AUDREY toward the model. He pulls her down to the floor. They are both on their knees in front of the model.)

DOGGETT: Audrey, I need you to talk to her. I need you to tell her what's going on. I need you to tell her that they're going to pull the plug. I need her ... [to] ...

(DOGGETT swallows hard. His emotions are surfacing and the desperation is evident in his voice. He takes a moment to get hold of himself, then continues.)

DOGGETT: I need you to tell her to fight. I need you to tell her to show us some sign - anything -- that she's in there.

(DOGGETT continues to plead with AUDREY. His own words makes no sense to him. He swallows down his emotion unsuccessfully.)

DOGGETT: I need her to understand.

(He shakes his head.)

DOGGETT: I don't know what the hell else to do.

(DOGGETT simply runs out of words as the desperation of losing her finally hits him. Sitting in front of AUDREY, he hangs his head in defeat.)

(AUDREY is compassionate toward DOGGETT. She wants to comfort his pain, but she doesn't know how. DOGGETT takes a few steadying breaths. Without a word, without looking at AUDREY, he stands, opens the door and exits. The door closes behind him.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 28

(In the basement, outside the closed door, DOGGETT pauses to compose himself. He wipes his eyes and leaves.)

(In the open room next door, DR. PREIJERS witnesses DOGGETT leaving AUDREY'S room.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 29

(MONICA'S alone in the doppel hospital. She's sitting in the middle of ER on the cold tile. She's sitting there. Waiting. Or Thinking. Either way, she is alone and doing nothing but waiting for death to come for her. It's only a matter of time.)

(Behind her, we see AUDREY standing there. She's wearing a blue top and jeans. Her hands are clasped together and she's looking down. She's there to deliver DOGGETT'S message.)

AUDREY PAULEY: Monica?

(At the sound of AUDREY'S voice, MONICA jumps up to her feet.)

AUDREY PAULEY: John wanted me to tell you something.

REYES: You gave him my message?

(AUDREY looks at MONICA and nods.)

AUDREY PAULEY: He says you don't have very long. He says you have to give them some kind of sign.

(MONICA is at a loss of what to do. AUDREY is sympathetic.)

AUDREY PAULEY: I know, I ... I-I'm sorry.

(AUDREY starts to walk away.)

REYES (desperate): Are you really going to leave me here to die?

(AUDREY wants to help, but she doesn't know how.)

AUDREY PAULEY: Uh ... I can't ... do ... anything.

(AUDREY somehow feels responsible for these two whom she really wants to help. She starts crying with frustration at her inability to help.)

AUDREY PAULEY: There's ... there's something wrong ... you know, up here. And I can't help anyone. I deliver the flowers. It's all I do. And I have to even get help with that because I-I can't read what's on the little cards.

(AUDREY'S crying.)

(MONICA finally understands what's going on. She walks toward AUDREY.)

REYES: You can't read?

AUDREY PAULEY: I see it all jumbled up.

(MONICA puts it together. She opens the chart and shows AUDREY the chart.)

REYES: This is your hospital. It's you who created it. It's all you, Audrey.

(AUDREY looks down at the chart that MONICA has in front of her. Tears are running down AUDREY'S cheeks. She's no longer crying, but listening to MONICA.)

REYES: This place is all you. And that means you can make the rules work any damn way that you want them to.

(AUDREY'S looking around at the walls all around them. Whether she understands, it's not known. But she's definitely thinking about what MONICA is saying.)

REYES: You can help me escape.

(Tears fall down AUDREY'S face. She's thinking about what MONICA said.)

REYES: Audrey?

(We watch REYES'S face turn from hope to confusion. AUDERY has disappeared. MONICA'S alone again. The camera moves straight up and gives us a downward view of MONICA standing with her arms open and empty. AUDREY is nowhere to be seen.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 30

(AUDREY is back in her room in the basement. She is standing and looking down into the hospital model. A door opens behind her. She hears it and turns around. DR. PREIJERS is there.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: You know, I've always wondered what was down here. I'm being accused of things Audrey. Terrible things regarding three patients of mine. Really, it's ... it's beyond the pale.

(He sighs and pulls out a small syringe from his pocket. Somehow AUDREY knows.)

DR. JACK PREIJERS: You're not going to yell out, are you, Audrey?

SEGUE TO:



SCENE 31

(Back in the Doppel Hospital, MONICA is walking the hallways looking for AUDREY.)

REYES: Audrey?

(MONICA turns the corner. The wind blows eerily. There's a low rumbling sound. MONICA turns the corner and stares in shock as the walls of the hospital visually shimmer. She swallows. Something is happening. Something is wrong. Something has happened to AUDREY.

(She swallows down her fear and continues to look for AUDREY through an unstable hospital.

REYES: Audrey? Audrey!

(She finally finds AUDREY standing inside the outside ER doors.)

REYES: Audrey, what's happening?

(AUDREY is different. Though she is still wearing blue, she seems to be cast in the same blue-gray tinged lighting that signifies the Doppel Hospital.)

AUDREY PAULEY: You have to go.

(The doors open and AUDREY PAULEY walks outside. MONICA follows slowly. They look out into the void.)

AUDREY PAULEY: This way.

REYES: No. If I do that, I'll burn up. I'll die.

AUDREY PAULEY: No. Not now. But you have to hurry.

REYES: What about you?

AUDREY PAULEY: I know now. I know who told me to build it.

(MONICA realizes that something has happened to AUDREY and that in probability she is most likely dead on the other side.)

(MONICA looks down into the void. She takes a deep breath, musters all her faith and falls in to the void to the life waiting for her on the other side. Behind her, AUDREY shimmers and disappears. MONICA continues to fall.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 32

(The monitors by MONICA'S bedside still show no brain activity. DOGGETT is sitting next to her. He looks worn. SCULLY walks in.)

SCULLY: The transplant teams are in place.

(DOGGETT stands up to face SCULLY.)

DOGGETT: They're not cutting her up.

(He turns to walk out the door.)

SCULLY: John ... I'm still waiting for your argument. If you have something to convince me to convince the doctors that somehow she's alive.

REYES: John ...

(Both DOGGETT and SCULLY turn at the sound of MONICA'S voice. DOGGETT moves to MONICA'S bedside. He gently grasps her hand.)

REYES (whispers): Audrey ...

(His look goes to worry at her message.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 33

(In the basement, DR. PREIJERS pockets the empty syringe. His head and body are suddenly slammed up against he wall. DOGGETT is holding DR. PREIJERS motionless.)

DOGGETT: Where're you going, doctor?

(DOGGETT opens AUDREY PAULEY'S room. She's lying on the floor ... dead.

DOGGETT: Oh, god. Oh, no.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 34
3 DAYS LATER

(DOGGETT'S driving this time. I want to say that he's driving her home from the hospital, but she doesn't have a bag with her. The car stops outside MONICA'S place. He comes around to open her door for her. MONICA exits. They stand there for a moment simply looking at each other.)

DOGGETT: Good night.

REYES: Good night.

(She turns to go up the stairs. She turns around to look at him. DOGGETT stands there and watches her as she enters her building.)

[THE END]

                              UNDERNEATH


SCENE 1
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO

(Night. It's pouring with rain. A white van pulls up to a house. The company name on the van is "Triboro Cable". A man, BOB, turns off the ignition and take s a crucifix hanging from the rear view mirror. He kisses it.)

(A voice from the back of the van cuts through the rain.)

BEARDED MAN: Get going.

(BOB looks anxious.)

BOB: Please ...

BEARDED MAN: Do your damn job.

(BOB reaches over to the passenger seat and picks up his toolbox. He opens the van door and gets out.)



SCENE 2

(In the house, a woman, JANET, is on the phone in the kitchen.)

JANET: You can't think Milli Vanilli is cool. I would disown you. (JANET'S mum walks into the kitchen, having to move under the phone cord.) You are unbelievable. Okay, I may puke, but I have to ask. Which one do you intend to marry? Rob or Fab?

(The doorbell rings.)

MOTHER: Janet, get that.

JANET: (To the person on the phone.) Hang on. I'm like the servant around here.

JANET: Yeah?

(JANET opens the door and we see BOB standing in the porch.)

BOB: Triboro Cable.

JANET: What do you want?

BOB: Your cable's out.

JANET: Is it? I don't think so.

BOB: Okay, I'm sorry.

(BOB turns to leave.)

JANET: Wait a sec. Maybe my dad called you. You'd better... come in.

(BOB turns back and enters the house.)

JANET: The TV's in here. (calling upstairs to her father) Dad? Cable guy's here.

(BOB walks into the living room and starts looking at the TV. JANET'S DAD appears in the doorway.)

DAD: Can I help you?

BOB: There's a problem with your cable?

DAD: I was just watchin' the game upstairs. I think you got the wrong house, buddy.

DAD: Is... that your work order? Who called it in?

(Suddenly, blood splatters all over the papers BOB is holding. He looks back up and JANET'S DAD is not in view. BOB looks around the room and suddenly see him lying on the floor in a pool of blood, his throat cut. BOB slowly walks into the kitchen, and finds JANET and her MUM lying on the floor, also in large pools of blood. He looks shocked.)

(There's a knock at the door. The front door opens and an NYPD cop enters, gun drawn.)

DUKE: Police! Don't move! Oh God, almighty. Face the wall. Face the wall! Johnny, check the other rooms!

(Another cop enters the house and checks the kitchen. We see it's DOGGETT, in his former NYPD guise.)

DOGGETT: They're all dead!

DOGGETT: Got you. Got you, you bastard.

SCENE 3

(Day. FBI Building corridor. The lift opens and REYES walks toward the X-Files office, hearing DOGGETT screaming to someone on the phone.)

DOGGETT: D-O-G-G-E-T-T. Two "G's" and two "T's". I was the arresting officer. You're makin' a huge mistake. I don't care what it shows!! I appreciate that. But I don't care what it shows. It's wrong! I was there! We got the right guy!

REYES: An X-File?

(DOGGETT hands REYES a newspaper clipping, with the headline "DNA Clears Screwdriver Killer", the subheader is "Innocent Man Jailed Thirteen Years". There is also a face shot of BOB.)

DOGGETT: (into phone) I'm tellin' you, you let this guy go, more people are gonna die.

(DOGGETT hangs up the phone.)

REYES: Was that the D.A. on the case?

DOGGETT: Assistant D.A. Some jack-off who was probably in ninth grade when this happened.

REYES: What is it exactly you want 'em to do?

DOGGETT: Keep the bastard locked up where he belongs! Did you read that? My partner and I busted this guy, Fassl, when I was a beat cop thirteen years ago. He killed seven people. Now they want to let him go so he can kill again.

REYES: It says here the DNA evidence proves he's innocent.

DOGGETT: It's wrong. It's some lab mistake. Simple as that. My partner, Duke and I, we catch this nine-one-one. Neighbours hearing screaming coming from this house on Flatbush Avenue. We get there. Teenage girl, mother, father, all dead. There's blood... (beat) I can still remember the sound of the blood squishing under my shoes. This guy, Fassl's just standing there.

REYES: So you... didn't actually catch him in the act?

DOGGETT: Ten seconds earlier through the door and we would have.

(SCULLY enters the office holding a report.)

DOGGETT: (to SCULLY) Tell me you've got good news.

SCULLY: I have combed through every detail of this M.E.'s report. I have read and re-read it. And I am sorry, Agent Doggett, but the DNA fingerprinting does indeed exonerate this man.

DOGGETT: You're tellin' me there's no way? There's not even a million-to-one chance that these DNA tests are wrong?

SCULLY: Actually, a hundred million.

DOGGETT: I need the reports run again. I need you to do it yourself.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett, you don't... (sigh) It'd take at least 48 hours.

DOGGETT: That's too long.

(DOGGETT starts to put on his jacket.)

REYES: Where are you going?

DOGGETT: New York. I can't just sit here and wait for this guy to kill again.

REYES: John ...

DOGGETT: Look, I get it. Enough people tell you you're drunk, it's time to lie down. But I know what I know. I could really use your help.



SCENE 4
SING SING CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
OSSINING, NEW YORK

(The camera pans along a line of cells. It stops when it gets to BOB FASSL'S.)

GUARD: It's time to go.

(The cell door slowly slides open.)

(We see a close up of his Inmate Property Sheet - "ROBERT M FASSL", detailing what he had when he entered prison. We see he had a Rosary, an employee ID and a set of keys.)

GUARD: Congratulations, Bob. Best of luck to you..

(BOB looks in his box of possessions. He picks up the Rosary and kisses it.)



SCENE 5
KINGS COUNTY COURTHOUSE
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK

(Bright light greets BOB as he steps into the daylight.)

REPORTER #1: How does it feel to be a free man?

REPORTER #2: What are doing in New York? Are you gonna sue the police?

REPORTER #1: What do you think you'll do next?

JANA: I think it goes without saying that my client is happy once more to be a free man. I myself, am overjoyed. I think today is a day to celebrate. But tomorrow, we will be looking very closely at the reasons why Bob was falsely accused and incarcerated. Thirteen years of his life were stolen from him. We'll be looking. at the Brooklyn D.A.'s office, and the New York City Police Department.

(BOB stares across the street. His perception of movement speeds up. A bearded man wearing dark clothes appears on the other side of the street. BOB is breathing heavily.)

JANA: Bob? Let's get you out of here. (to reporters) Thank you.

(BOB looks again but the figure is gone.)

REPORTERS: (walla) How do you feel?

JANA: Thank you.

REPORTERS: (walla) Did you ever feel like givin' up, Bob? Bob?

JANA: Thank you.



SCENE 6

(Government building. DOGGETT and SCULLY are walking down a corridor with the Assistant D.A., KAILER.)

DOGGETT: Wait a minute. On top of springin' loose a murderer, you're tellin' me the city of New York is gonna pay him off?

KAILER: Hell yes. And count ourselves lucky. We didn't spring a murderer. We sprang an innocent man. Or maybe you didn't glean that from our previous conversation.

SCULLY: Mr. Kailer, on the off chance that that's not true, what would be the harm in letting us look through your documents pertaining to this case? I mean, who knows. Maybe we can save the city some settlement money.

KAILER: Or maybe it gets me in an even bigger jackpot when Jana Fain starts crying "police vendetta", yelling at the papers about the disgruntled former cop who's out to get her client?

DOGGETT: Somebody committed these murders, right? And now that you've sprung Mr. Bob Fassl, the victims' families are gonna start askin' who. How you gonna answer 'em?

(KAILER stands silent.)



SCENE 7

(DOGGETT and SCULLY are in a large conference room, a long table standing in the centre. Two dozen evidence boxes are stacked on it.)

SCULLY: There's a lot of material here. Where should we start?

DOGGETT: Right there. The original arrest report.

SCULLY: "Arresting Officer John Doggett." Must have been a career maker.

DOGGETT: Well, it didn't hurt when I put in for detective. The murders had been front page news for weeks. The sense of relief everybody felt when we caught Fassl, it was...

SCULLY: You know, John? (Pause.) Whatever we find here, sometimes... sometimes even good cops make mistakes.

(DOGGETT looks offended.)

DOGGETT: Yeah. And I've made more than I can count. But this wasn't one of 'em. Whatever you think, I'm not here tryin' to cover my ass.

SCULLY: That's not what I think. It's not. I just... I just worry that maybe this is about you feeling guilty.

DOGGETT: I feel guilty? Like what, subconsciously? Like I was told I sent an innocent man to prison, only I refuse to accept it? A cop I know, a man I respect deeply, he told me one time... "You don't clock out at the end of your shift unless you know you did everything you could." That's what this is about. Me not clockin' out.

(DOGGETT goes back to looking through the evidence. SCULLY considers his statement.)



SCENE 8
FAIN RESIDENCE
LITTLE NECK, NEW YORK

(JANA'S house is a large, expensive residence in period design. JANA and BOB enter.)

JANA: Bob, I just want you to make yourself at home while you're here. Just relax. Mrs. Dowdy, this is Bob Fassl. He'll be staying with us for a while.

MRS. DOWDY: Oh, I have your room all made up. I hope you'll be quite comfortable.

JANA: (beat) Uh, thank you very much, Mrs. Dowdy.

(BOB can't help looking around the hallway.)

BOB: You're rich.

JANA: Well, my parents were. I inherited this when they died. I've been very fortunate, so I try and use my family's resources to help where I can.

(BOB follows JANA upstairs.)

BOB: You do good things. You're a good person.

JANA: I guess it takes one to know one. I know some business people who are sympathetic to your situation, and when you're ready, we'll set up some job interviews.

(BOB enters his room and sits on the end of the bed. He takes out his Rosary and holds it in his hands.)

JANA: (beat) I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now. I'm so sorry for everything you've been through. And I'm so happy for you now.

(After a pause, JANA turns and looks the bedroom, closing the door. BOB starts praying. He clenches his hands together together around the Rosary, opening them to discover blood on his palms.)

(Daubed on the wall in blood, still dripping down the wall, are the words "KiLL Her".)



SCENE 9
KINGS COUNTY COURTHOUSE
5:35 PM

(We see an older car pull into a space. An older, balding man gets out.)

DOGGETT: Hey, buddy! You steal that car?

DUKE: (laughs) If it ain't the FBI!

DOGGETT: Duke Tomasick. Lookin' good.

DUKE: (laugh) Well, hell yeah. I was always the pretty one. (laughs)

DOGGETT: Not that I'd steal you away from even one minute of retirement, but I gotta get another viewpoint on this case from someone who was there that night. Duke, I'm rackin' my brain on this thing, and I'm comin' at it from every possible angle. Was there somethin' we missed?

DUKE: Well yeah, we arrested the wrong man. Ah, I'm sorry, John. I've been torn up about this since I read it in the paper. But unless there's somethin' that you know that I don't? Then it looks like, uh, we're just gonna have to face facts.

DOGGETT: Duke, you were there that night. Fassl was the only one in the house. He killed those people.

DUKE: John, wise up, will ya? Drop this thing.

DOGGETT: What did you always tell me about bein' a good cop? You said never to clock out.

DUKE: I got another lesson for ya. Keep after this thing, it's gonna bite you in your ass.



SCENE 10
10:12 PM

(BOB is resting against the end of his bed, praying. JANA opens the door and stands in the doorway. BOB notices her.)

JANA: I'm sorry. I just wanted to see how you were settling in, and... I should have knocked. I read in your file that you had once attended the seminary, that you studied to be a priest? I think it's wonderful that all you've been through hasn't diminished your faith.

BOB: I pray all the time. I pray even when it looks like I'm not praying.

JANA: I know someone's listening, Bob. Goodnight.

(JANA closes the door as she leaves. BOB turns around, and the BEARDED MAN is standing in the room with him.)

BOB: No. Don't. Please don't hurt her. Please!

(The BEARDED MAN smacks BOB around the head. BOB holds his mouth in pain. The BEARDED MAN then takes out a sharp weapon, much like that used to kill the ALIEN BOUNTY HUNTER. The BEARDED MAN purposely walks over to the door and leaves the room, as BOB drops to his knees and starts to pray.)



SCENE 11

(Morning. Conference room. DOGGETT has the papers and photos spread all over the table. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Were you here all night?

DOGGETT: There's gotta be somethin' here the prosecution overlooked, I overlooked. Somethin' I can hang this guy with, DNA or no.

SCULLY: Speaking of DNA.

DOGGETT: Ah, come on.

SCULLY: The re-tests of the typing confirm the original results, that the hair samples do, indeed, belong to someone other than Robert Fassl.

DOGGETT: So what do we do, we just go home? This is wrong. This is...

SCULLY: John, there is something else. Something that explains why 13 years ago, the science of the day identified the hair as Fassl's. I spoke to the forensic examiner who ran the tests, and he found a match in 12 of the 13 key genes.

DOGGETT: What does that mean?

SCULLY: It means that the mitochondrial DNA in the hair sample is genetically similar to Fassl's. In fact, it is remarkably similar. It is so similar that it must be from a blood relative.

DOGGETT: Wait a minute. Fassl's an only child. His parents died when he was 13. He's got nobody.

SCULLY: I know.

DOGGETT: You know. And you know that what you're sayin's impossible.

SCULLY: And yet, somehow it's true.

(DOGGETT begins to consider this new development.)



SCENE 12

(Morning. BOB is asleep on the floor in his room. A shadow passes over his face and he wakes up.)

JANA: Would you get dressed and come on downstairs, please?

(BOB looks surprised to see her.)

JANA: Bob? This morning I noticed something that I have to talk to you about. The dresser drawers in my bedroom had been opened and somebody had been through my things.

BOB: You weren't home last night?

JANA: I think you know that I wasn't. As it happens, I was called down to County Lockup on behalf of another client. If you're going to stay here, then you have to respect me, my privacy, my possessions. You're a free man now. And with freedom comes responsibility. (Heavy sigh) I am late for a deposition. Help yourself to breakfast. Mrs. Dowdy seems to be running late this morning.

(Hearing this, BOB looks fearful. He looks over to the kitchen cupboard.)

(Later. BOB has changes clothes and puts a large piece of clear polythene on the floor. He places MRS DOWDY'S body onto the polythene. He then starts to mop out one of the large cupboards, which is full of blood. He goes to a kitchen drawer full of knives and takes out a meat cleaver. He stares at the large blade reflecting in the sunlight. He walks over to the body on the floor. Out of sight, we hear him strike blows with the cleaver.)



SCENE 13
SING SING CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
OSSINING, NEW YORK

(REYES is walking through the prison, its grated door opening as she proceeds. A man approaches her.)

HUTCHINSON: Agent Reyes. I'm Brian Hutchinson, Superintendent.

REYES: I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice.

HUTCHINSON: Anything I can do to help.

REYES: Great. I'm reviewing evidence pertinent to the Fassl case.

HUTCHINSON: Whatever I can do to ensure he gets locked back up again. By all means, tell me what you need.

REYES: Thank you. That's an extremely helpful attitude. What's your reason for it?

HUTCHINSON: I just don't think the system should've let him go.

REYES: Why, exactly? The court says he's innocent.

HUTCHINSON: Maybe. But there's another murder they don't know about.

(REYES and HUTCHINSON are now in a room. HUTCHINSON continues.)

HUTCHINSON: Bob Fassl's cellmate ... was a biker named Spud Jennings, a real bad ass. Or at least he thought he was.

REYES: Jennings was murdered?

HUTCHINSON: Oh yeah. We found him in a hallway that Bob Fassl had been mopping. He was lying ten feet from Bob Fassl's mop bucket. Fassl nowhere to be found.

REYES: And Fassl killed him?

HUTCHINSON: The murderer was caught on a security camera once he turned the corner. This is a videograph. A pretty clear one. You can see the blood on his hand.

(HUTCHINSON hands a folder to REYES, who studies the picture. We see the man caught on camera is the BEAERDED MAN. The time on the photo is 21:17:04.)

REYES: One problem. This isn't Fassl.

HUTCHINSON: This isn't anybody. This man doesn't fit the description of any inmate currently incarcerated here. We haven't been able to find him since. Don't ask me to explain it. We couldn't charge Fassl with it, either. But I sure as hell know he had something to do with it.

(REYES looks intrigued.)



SCENE 14

(Later in the conference room. KAILER is standing in the doorway.)

KAILER: Agent Doggett? A word, please?

(DOGGETT and KAILER step into the corridor.)

KAILER: Don't you have something to tell me, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: What do you mean?

KAILER: The DNA retests. I understand you received the results this morning. Mr. Fassl has been exonerated. Again.

DOGGETT: The results aren't that simple. The DNA is similar to Fassl's to a degree we haven't quite made sense of yet.

KAILER: Look, I just spoke to the D.A. He's authorized a settlement offer, which I intend to deliver to Mr. Fassl's counsel, post haste. I'll send the bailiffs down to retrieve the case files. Have a nice flight back to D.C.

DOGGETT: We need more time to get to the truth!

KAILER: This isn't about the truth. This is about getting a conviction, Agent Doggett. And if we can't get a conviction, then the truth doesn't matter.

(DOGGETT stands in the corridor as KAILER walks off. REYES appears further up the corridor and walks to DOGGETT.)

REYES: John. I may have a break in this case. A suspect.

DOGGETT: A suspect? Not Fassl?

REYES: You really need to see this.

(In the conference room, DOGGETT is looking at the picture of the BEARDED MAN.)

DOGGETT: So who is he?

REYES: I'm wondering more along the line of what is he. I ran him through the Known Offender Database, Facial Recognition, came up with nothing. It's like he has no identity. Yet somehow, this person materialized inside a maximum security prison, killed an inmate, and then vanished into thin air.

DOGGETT: Materialized how, like Casper the Friendly Ghost? (SCULLY looks up from the table.) When Duke and I entered that house back in '89, we didn't find ZZ Top here. We found Bob Fassl. End of story.

REYES: Yeah, but what if the two were somehow connected?

DOGGETT: Monica, for God sakes, this is not an X-File. Don't try to turn it into one.

REYES: In prison, this being, this person, whatever you want to call him, he acted as if he were protecting Bob Fassl.

DOGGETT: Protecting? How, by getting him locked up in prison in the first place?

REYES: So either he's doing Fassl's bidding, or Fassl's doing his. However you slice it, I'm thinking this bearded man was the one who committed the other seven murders. I think we can prove it. DNA evidence in the Sing Sing murder was gathered and filed by the prison authorities. All we have to do is compare it to the DNA from the 1989 murders.

SCULLY: No. Unfortunately, that's not gonna work. The 1989 evidence has to be thrown out.

DOGGETT: What are you talkin' about?

(SCULLY looks dejected as she talks.)

SCULLY: The hair samples logged to your crime scene, Agent Doggett, were not there on the day the crimes were committed.

DOGGETT: Are you accusing me? Are you accusing me of planting evidence?

SCULLY: I am simply stating the facts, okay? The DNA evidence that was used to convict Bob Fassl... was planted.

(DOGGETT looks stunned.)



SCENE 15

(BOB opens the door to KAILER at JANA's house.)

KAILER: Fassl? I'm Damon Kailer.

KAYLOR: I need to speak with your attorney. Is she here?

BOB: You were at my hearing.

KAILER: I'm the Assistant District Attorney. Is... Jana home?

BOB: She's not here.

KAILER: Mr. Fassl, I came to make a settlement offer on your case. There's no reason to be upset. This is good news for you. Tell her to call me. We'll work it out.

BOB: I want to go back.

KAILER: I'm sorry?

BOB: Please send me back to prison.

KAILER: Oh listen, Mr. Fassl, I shouldn't even be discussing this with you without your attorney present.

BOB: But it's my fault.

KAILER: I-I... I can't be hearing this.

BOB: It's the truth.

KAILER: That's not my concern.

(BOB stares at KAILER, who is motionless. Suddenly, blood starts pouring from his mouth. He falls to the floor, revealing the BEARDED MAN standing behind him with the pointed weapon. BOB drops to his knees, checking KAILER who is now dead, lying in a large pool of blood.)



SCENE 16

(Conference room. DUKE is checking a NYPD Property Log.)

DUKE: I'm sorry, John.

DOGGETT: You framed Fassl.

(DUKE starts to try and explain his actions.)

DUKE: You saw how it was goin' down. we arrested him at the scene. But he... he left no prints, no hair, no fibre. Nothin' to actually tie him to the murders.

DOGGETT: How did you do it?

DUKE: I took, uh, part of a hair sample that was found at a... at a previous murder, and put it in with the evidence from our crime scene.

DUKE: Johnny, it was the one and only time I ever did anything like that. I was scared Fassl would walk, and... and I couldn't let that happen. Not when I knew that... that he was guilty. Oh, God almighty.

DOGGETT: You know this is gonna come out. No one's gonna hear it from me, but... but I can't put Agent Scully on the spot. I can't ask her to lie.

DUKE: I don't want you to.

DOGGETT: Duke, you son of a bitch! This is a (shouting) felony!! I don't know how I can forgive you for this! You break my heart.

(SCULLY enters the room.)

SCULLY: Excuse me. Agent Doggett? A.D.A. Kailer. I assume you haven't seen him?

DOGGETT: No. Why?

SCULLY: Apparently nobody has.



SCENE 17

(BOB is in a sewer, disposing of the body of KAILER. As her finishes up, he walks past a skull, lying on the floor.)



SCENE 18

(REYES, SCULLY, BOB and JANA are sitting in a comfortable room around a large table. DOGGETT is watching through a window. )

REYES: Mr. Fassl, when was the last time you saw Damon Kailer?

JANA: Two days ago at his release hearing. My client had nothing to do with Mr. Kailer's disappearance.

REYES: No direct involvement?

JANA: None.

REYES: I think we can accept that. We're also prepared to accept that Mr. Fassl had no direct involvement in the seven murders he was previously convicted of.

JANA: How magnanimous of you. It's too bad you're thirteen years too late. Is that it?

REYES: No. Actually, we believe this person committed the murders.

REYES: What do you think? Do you recognize this man?

JANA: We're here as a courtesy. Which is something the police and the prosecution never showed Bob once.

(SCULLY notices BOB holding his Rosary.)

SCULLY: Are you a Catholic, Bob? So am I. I remember times in my life when my Rosary was a great comfort to me. Comfort in times of tribulation. And watching you now, I get the feeling... that this is a tribulation for you.

(SCULLY passes the photo to BOB.)

SCULLY: This man. Is it that he won't leave you alone, Bob? Is it that you just want him to go away? Tell us about him. Tell us so we can help make him go away.

(BOB looks panicked and very scared.)

JANA: No more mind games. We're done.

(JANA and BOB get up and leave.)

DOGGETT: What the hell was that?

REYES: I don't know about you, but that was me changing my theory.

DOGGETT: What, no more ghosts?

REYES: Nope. Just Fassl. What if a man of profound faith, a devout Catholic, was incapable of contrition?

SCULLY: As in he couldn't admit his own sins?

REYES: Or even that he had a sinful side to him, as we all do. What if he were so frightened by it that he couldn't even admit it to himself. Might not someone like that manifest a second personality?

DOGGETT: But it wouldn't explain the DNA evidence.

REYES: It would if he physically became that other personality.

DOGGETT: So what, we've moved on from Casper the Friendly Ghost to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

REYES: There is a precedent in the Catholic Canon itself. Transubstantiation. The manipulation of matter and energy.

SCULLY: You mean water into wine?

REYES: Or the Communion wafer into the body of Christ.

DOGGETT: Well Monica, I've slept through my share of Sunday Schools, but I never heard the story about the guy becoming another guy.

REYES: It's the one explanation that makes sense. It explains what happened thirteen years ago, and it explains what's happening now.

SCULLY: So what you're saying is because this man won't face himself, won't face his own sins, that he is forced to become someone else? (Pause) A killer.

DOGGETT: So how does someone go about catching a killer who hides inside an innocent man?



SCENE 19

(Night. BOB is in the bathroom, splashing water on his face. He looks up in the bathroom mirror over the taps and reels back. Written on the wall behind him in blood are the words "KiLL Her". BOB turns around, and the BEARDED MAN is standing only feet away from him.)

BEARDED MAN: Do it!

(The BEARDED MAN strikes out at BOB again.)

BOB: I don't want to hurt her!

(The BEARDED MAN then pushes BOB face first into the basin, and he cracks his head on the corner, falling to the floor.)

JANA: (Outside the door) Bob, are you okay?

BEARDED MAN: (Standing over BOB) Kill her.

(JANA enters, finding BOB on the floor.)

JANA: Oh, my god. What happened?

BOB: I, uh... I-I fell.

JANA: I'll fix you up. You'll be okay.

(JANA goes to the bathroom cabinet. We see BOB'S reflection in the mirror. She opens the door and takes some cotton wool and disinfectant from the shelf. When she closes the door, BOB'S reflection is gone. The BEARDED MAN is standing in his place. JANA is shocked.)



SCENE 20

(Night. Outside JANA's house. DOGGETT'S CAR.)

REYES: I'll take the next couple of hours. You should get some shut-eye. John, give yourself a break. You haven't slept in 48 hours.

DOGGETT: I'll sleep once we make sure this guy, Fassl, never kills again. Fassl or this... Charlie Manson sidekick.

REYES: They're one and the same person.

DOGGETT: Monica, I don't want to hear...

REYES: But I just need to hear another theory that makes sense.

DOGGETT: That theory doesn't make any sense. How the hell to you does that make sense? (Pause) Meat and potatoes police work is what busted this guy thirteen years ago. And it's what's gonna bust him again. And that's enough. And the day that's not enough? Then I don't know what to tell ya. 'Cause I got nothin' else.

(The BEARDED MAN appears at the front door, and runs off into the grounds.)

DOGGETT: Check it out, the front door.

(DOGGETT and REYES race from the car to the front door.)

DOGGETT: Jana Fain! Check on her!

(DOGGETT runs after the BEARDED MAN.)

JANA: Oh my god, he was here! He was here, the man in your photo!

REYES: The Bearded Man. Where's Bob Fassl?

JANA: Oh, he-he was right there, and then he wasn't. I don't... I don't know where.

(DOGGETT calls out.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes!!

REYES: Call the police!

(REYES runs over to DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Agent Reyes!

(DOGGETT is kneeling down in front of a metal cover in the ground, marked "CABLE ACCESS".)

DOGGETT: Cable access. Fassl worked for Triboro Cable.

(DOGGETT and REYES open the cover and climb down a steel ladder into the sewer below.)

DOGGETT: The trail ends here.

REYES: Blood. He could've gone either way.

(The BEARDED MAN suddenly appears and knocks REYES to the ground. He runs of into the sewer. DOGGETT fires 4 shots after him before helping REYES to her feet.)

DOGGETT: You okay?

DOGGETT: Come on.

(They head off in search of the BEARDED MAN.)

REYES: I'll take this way.

(They split up. DOGGETT explores further into the sewer. He discovers a grille on the floor. REYES searches another part of the sewer. She walks across the ground, when suddenly it gives way and she falls several feet into the water below. She shines her torch back up towards the hole. She makes her way to the side of the sewer and climbs out. She notices a bloody body against the side of the sewer.)

(Meanwhile, DOGGETT is climbing down another ladder and explores deeper into the sewer.)

(REYES shouts out to DOGGETT.)

REYES John!

DOGGETTMonica!

(DOGGETT draws his gun. Suddenly, the BEARDED MAN appears and stabs DOGGETT in the shoulder. DOGGETT's gun falls from his hand into the water. REYES now has her gun drawn and is slowly moving towards DOGGETT'S location. She reaches DOGGETT, who is being held hostage by the BEARDED MAN, who has his weapon across DOGGETT'S throat.)

REYES: Let him go, you hear me? Let him go!

DOGGETT: Don't waste your breath. Just shoot the bastard!

REYES: Bob Fassl, I'm talking to you. I know you're in there, Bob. There's some small part of you in there that couldn't kill Jana Fain when you had the chance.

BEARDED MAN: I'll kill him!!

(He tenses his body. The weapon resting dangerously close on DOGGETT'S throat.)

REYES: I believe you, Bob. Because you're a murderer.

BEARDED MAN: Shut up!! I'm not him.

REYES: You're not just a murderer, you're a sinner!

BEARDED MAN: Shut up!! Shut up!! Shut up!!

(DOGGETT manager to get away from the BEARDED MAN, BOB'S alter ego, and REYES fires at him, hitting him in the chest. He stands motionless in pain, before falling into the water. DOGGETT'S climbs in and drags the body to the surface. He turns it over. It is BOB. DOGGETT looks at REYES in bewilderment.)



SCENE 21

(Outside in the garden, SCULLY is examining the decapitated remains of a body. There are several police officers in the sewer collecting evidence. JANA is also standing in the sewer as SCULLY enters.)

JANA: My housekeeper, Mrs. Dowdy, can I see her?

SCULLY: It's better that you don't.

JANA: And the District Attorney?

SCULLY: There are a lot of bodies in there.

(JANA starts to cry.)

SCULLY: There are many more victims than anyone ever knew.

JANA: I saw a Bearded Man. I know what I saw.

SCULLY: Ms. Fain, I think we'd better get you home.

(SCULLY takes JANA back to the house. DOGGETT and REYES are still standing in the sewer as BOB FASSL'S body is stretchered away. DOGGETT looks shattered.)

REYES: John ...

DOGGETT: I've been 48 hours without sleep. I found out my ex-partner's a liar, a felon. (Shaking his head) Don't ask me to explain how this could be.

REYES: So what happened tonight, that was just you seeing things?

DOGGETT: I can't accept this. If you can, God love ya, but, it's not the way my mind works.

REYES: You closed this case. This time around, that was enough.

DOGGETT: What happens next time?

(DOGGETT and REYES stare into the water.)

[THE END]


                                    IMPROBABLE


SCENE 1

(Day. Inside a busy casino. A casino dealer's hands expertly shuffle the cards as poker-faced players watch. The dealer looks over at WAYNE, probably in his mid thirties, one of the men playing. The dealer deals the cards and WAYNE checks his hand, he has the three of hearts and the two of clubs. He stares back at her a moment, then slams down his cards and walks off. He stands next to AMY, a pretty blonde woman playing a One Armed Bandit slot machine nearby. The camera moves to MR. BURT, an middle-aged man, who is sitting at the bar.)

MR. BURT: Bartender? Seven and seven, pack of Morleys.

(WAYNE leaves the floor and makes his way over the to the bar, ordering.)

WAYNE: Seven and seven, pack of Morleys.

(MR. BURT notices WAYNE at the bar.)

MR. BURT: We have a winner!

WAYNE: Do I know you?

MR. BURT: Do you know me? Come on, Wayne-O. I'm part of the regular game? You know your problem, my friend? It's not the cards. It's playing the hand you were dealt. Well, you guys get a bad deal, it's all in what you do with it. You know what I'm saying, pardner? You can think. Cards can't. they just lie there. You gotta make them work for you. (We see that MR. BURT is playing Patience on the counter. Before he turns over his next card, he tells WAYNE what it's going to be) Jack of Hearts. (WAYNE looks impressed.) Two million, five hundred and ninety-eight thousand, nine hundred and sixty possible five card hands. Twelve hundred and seventy-seven flushes, and then you got your suit. One million, ninety-eight thousand, two hundred and forty ways to make two pairs. And yet, the game can't beat the man. Man only beats himself. And so on and so forth.

(WAYNE looks over at AMY, still at the same slot machine, playing over and over again.)

MR. BURT: She comes here every Friday. Loses her paycheck. Cries all weekend. Such a nice girl. I keep hoping her luck is gonna change and she could catch a break.

MR. BURT: We gonna blow this joint? Call it a night?

(Wee see AMY leave the slot machine and head for the Ladies toilets.)

MR. BURT: I know, you're bluffing me, right? You're gonna show me Fifth Street. Walk right out of here, surprise me, for a change.

(WAYNE heads off after AMY. MR. BURT reveals the cards left in his hand. They're the same as WAYNE had earlier.)

MR. BURT: Three of hearts. Two of clubs.

(A large man has started playing on the machine AMY was playing on moments earlier. He hits the jackpot.)

HEAVY-SET MAN: I won! I won!

(Suddenly a woman runs out of the toilets, screaming.)

WOMAN: (screaming) Oh, my god! Help me, please!! Help me!! Somebody help me! There's a woman who's been murdered! Somebody help me! Oh, god!! She's been murdered! Help!

(MR. BURT'S face remains poker-faced, showing no reaction. He carries on playing cards at the bar as we hit the opening credits.)

SCENE 2
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Day. Upbeat French music [Karl Zero (Remix by Le Tone) Lyrics - Ca Va Ca Va (Remix)] continues to play during the scene. REYES is walking down the corridor, reading a newspaper. The main headline reads "CASINO MURDER OFFERS NO CLUES". We see a picture of AMY beside the article. REYES walks towards the lift, not looking up from the article and causing everyone else to move out of her way. She gets into the lift, standing at the back. The lift fills with other people, 3 either side of her and one in front of her, giving a 3-2-3 arrangement in the lift.)

(REYES is now sitting in the X-Files office. She taps once on two files, and counts on her fingers absent-mindedly. We see there are three files on front of her on the desk. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes?

REYES: Three plus four is seven. Seven and six are thirteen.

(SCULLY looks unsure.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?

REYES: (Pointing to the files) Ten, thirteen, fourteen, sixteen. I want to ask you to open your mind to something. I don't want you to think I'm crazy, all right?

SCULLY: Why would I think that you're crazy?

REYES: Do you believe the universe is knowable as a mathematical calculation of the whole, reducible to a single equation?

SCULLY: No.

REYES: Why not?

SCULLY: Because I don't think that its complexity allows for it to be reduced so simply.

REYES: But you accept that some people do?

SCULLY: I presume you mean the so-called Unified Theory, what physicists often refer to as the theory of everything. An equation so simple they say that it might be printed on a T-shirt. It's a holy grail in the world of science. Potentially the most important question that mankind has ever asked. But that such a complex calculation is even possible is a subject of enormous controversy. Is that what you mean?

REYES: Uh... potentially.

(REYES displays some crime scene photos on the projector. They are pictures of dead women.)

REYES: Carla Maria Carpenter, born two, one, seventy-seven. Killed outside a nightclub two years ago. Her murder remains unsolved. Judy Ann Fuller, born three, twenty-one, sixty-nine, killed at a mall two years ago, unsolved. Julie Frances Gresham, born one, twenty-two, eighty, killed in her parked car last month, unsolved.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes, if there's a connection that I'm supposed to be seeing, I'm not seeing it.

REYES: And our latest victim, Amy Sheridan Noffsberger, born four, four, seventy-seven, killed two weeks ago in a casino. Police have yet to find her killer.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes, am I to presume that you've solved these unsolved murders by using some kind of numerical calculation?

REYES: Letters of names assigned values, added to birth dates, reduced to the lowest common denominator. A-J-S equal one. B-K-T...

SCULLY: Numerology, Agent Reyes... You're trying to solve these cases by using what is essentially a child's game.

REYES: It's been in use since the Sixth Century B.C., when Pythagoras determined that the world was built on the power and influence of numbers.

SCULLY: And, uh, when exactly did you stumble upon it?

REYES: We did it as kids. I still do it. You meet people at a party, ask them their birth date. It's kind of an ice breaker. And as I was reading the story of this woman, I calculated she was a fourteen. What they call a karmic number. An extremely significant numerological number, prompting me to look at all these other unsolved cases. The victims of which also work out to have karmic numbers. Ten, thirteen, sixteen.

SCULLY: So in other words, you haven't actually solved these cases.

REYES: Maybe "cracked" is a better word.

SCULLY: Without any other evidence to directly connect them, circumstantial or forensic.

(SCULLY is looking intently at the photo on the projector.)

REYES: What?

SCULLY: Can you enlarge this? (REYES zooms in on the photo.) Can I see the rest of those photos?

REYES: What is it?

(SCULLY looks at the other photos.)

SCULLY: There's a pattern in the bruising. All four of the victims have it. Three small circles. It might be from a ring that the killer wears.

REYES: So you're saying these cases are connected? That numerology may actually be driving the killer, and that I'm definitely not crazy?

SCULLY: Or that maybe you're both crazy.

(REYES looks humoured.)



SCENE 3

(Italian neighbourhood. Inside, WAYNE gets dressed, then looks out the window. We notice a silver ring on his finger with a skull design. He buttons up his shirt, and moves to the window. Background music is Karl Zero Lyrics - Ponciana.)

(Across the street, MR. BURT is doing card tricks for two Italian men.)

ITALIAN MEN: (laugh)

OLD ITALIAN MAN: E' veramente speciale! [He's very special!]

(MR. BURT starts another trick, noticing WAYNE looking out the window at him. He gives a smiling nod, and WAYNE closes the shade. MR. BURT mouths the words of the French song as the citizens go about their movements in time with the music.)

MR. BURT: (sings/mouths the words in French)

(OLD ITALIAN MAN #2 points to the wrong card during the trick.)

OLD ITALIAN MAN #2: Mamma mia!

(MR BURT turns over the king card to the surpise of OLD ITALIAN MAN #1.)

OLD ITALIAN MAN #1: Ma come fa? [God! How he can do this?]

OLD ITALIAN MAN #2: Vabbuò io me ne vaco, tanto cu vuie è inutile... nun c'è sfizio [Well, I go away. There's no fun to play with you.]

MR. BURT: (Italian) Arrivederci.

(WAYNE has left his building and walks across the street and walks over to MR. BURT.)

MR. BURT: (to man) Wayne-O! (Italian) Come stai?

WAYNE: Quit following me, or you might find yourself dead real soon.

MR. BURT: Oh, come on, Wayne-O. That's not your style. Doesn't fit your pattern. Far be it for me to rat you out. Can't show 'em what they can't see. Now, two clowns, and a man with a crown. (MR. BURT starts a card trick with two Jokers and a King card.) You want to try your luck, sailor? King runs, but he can't hide. How can you lose? Kids stuff. (WAYNE points at a card.) There goes the neighbourhood. (MR. BURT turns it over revealing a Joker.) Pop Mr. Bunny right next-door. (He turns over the next card revealing the King.) You know, there's a secret to this game, Wayne-O. And I'm gonna tell you what the secret is. Choose better. (MR. BURT smiles at WAYNE.)

(WAYNE moves closer.)

WAYNE: You got somethin' to say to me, you say it.

MR. BURT: Son, I just did.

(He upsets the table and cards, then stomps off. MR. BURT watches as REYES bumps into him across the street. She heads into the Hotel Knickerbocker.)



SCENE 4
HOTEL KNICKERBOCKER

(REYES walks down a corridor until she comes to door marked "333 - VICKI BURDICK, NUMEROLOGIST - Your destiny awaits you.)

(REYES opens the door and enters. We see a blonde lady sitting at a desk. She doesn't look up when REYES enters.)

REYES: Hello?

BURDICK: Uh, there's a clipboard over there, uh, with three forms. Only fill out the top one, or all three if you want to unlock your most secret numbers to love, life and true personal happiness.

REYES: I'm not here for a personal chart. I'm with the FBI, investigating a series of deaths that seem to have a numerological connection.

BURDICK: I give valuable insights to the living. The dead pretty much already know their future.

REYES: Well, these are murders. I'm looking for your help in trying to solve them.

BURDICK: You may over estimate the kind of work I'm capable of here.

REYES: My hope is in doing the victim's complete numerology you'll be able to draw a picture of the killer.

BURDICK: I don't think you understand. I run a little business here. Uh, people come to me, they want to improve their lives, how to get rich, how to marry the man of their dreams. I mean, look around. If I could actually provide that kind of information? I don't have to draw you a picture.

REYES: You don't believe in it?

BURDICK: At best, it's an art.

REYES: I have established an undeniable numerological connection between the victims in all of these cases. (REYES hands BURDICK a the crime folder. She starts looking at the photos.) If I found the killer, I might prevent this happening again.

BURDICK: Let me see what I can come up with.

(REYES' phone starts to ring. She answers.)

REYES: (into phone) Monica Reyes.

(The screen splits in half to show DOGGETT and REYES talking on the phone.)

DOGGETT: Monica? You're not gonna believe this. We found two more cases. Two more victims to add to this thing. Both with the same marks on their faces. Now I knew you were good, but this? This is career launching. You'd better get back here.



SCENE 5

(Back in the FBI building, REYES enters and is immediately greeted by a large group of FBI agents, including SCULLY. They start applauding her enthusiastically.)

DOGGETT: Nice work.

FBI AGENT: Well done. Well done.

REYES: Thank you.

FBI AGENT: By brilliantly tying these murder cases together, VICAP is now working hard to develop a profile on the man we are officially calling the "Triple Zero Killer". Through the identification of a pattern he leaves on his victims, we have been able to connect six unsolved cases to one murderer, including these two new cases. Agent Scully will act as the point person on the case forensics. That's three recent killings, and three from 1999. The developing pattern now appears to be murders in threes, on a serpentine trail up across the eastern seaboard. Agent Doggett will lead the task force, and is ready to roll. Here's what we don't know. One: How he chooses his victims. Two: How the killer kills. And three: If he'll kill again soon, or disappear as he did two years ago. (The agent has counted the three items on his hand.)

DOGGETT: He may have been incarcerated during those years. We may be lookin' for someone with a record.

FBI AGENT: That's an excellent observation.

SCULLY: The killer is strong. He uses his fists as weapons. Brute force. He is angry and he acts on impulse.

FBI AGENT: Good. Important. Agent Reyes, we're all working off your lead. Give us the benefit of your special insight into this case.

REYES: Well, the killer probably has a soul number of either four or six. His birth path is, I'm guessing, a nine or maybe a six. The destiny and realization numbers are definitely karmic. I'll know for sure once I've got the charts from the numerologist, but the killer is almost certainly working off numerical vibrational disharmonies.

(REYES' cell phone rings.)

REYES: That's her now. (into phone) Monica Reyes.

BURDICK: (vo on phone) Agent Reyes?

BURDICK: (into phone) I've been running numbers here on the murder victims.

BURDICK: (into phone) And the strangest thing has come up.

REYES: (vo on phone) What? What is it?

(WE cut to BURDICK'S office. Someone enters as BURDICK has her back to the door.)

BURDICK: Oh, there's three forms on the clipboard. Fill out the top one or all three if you want to unlock your most secret...

(BURDICK turns around in her chair and stares over at doorway, motionless.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 6

(Later in BURDICK's office. The FBI AGENT looks at BURDICK's body in the body bag.)

FBI AGENT: I want her body sent to Quantico. I want facts, I want details. I want Agent Scully to go over this woman with a fine tooth comb.

DOGGETT: Yes, Sir.

FBI AGENT: And I want you, Agent Reyes, to tell me who else knows about this.

REYES: Knows about what?

FBI AGENT: About this case. About you coming to this office to see this woman.

REYES: I don't think I told anyone.

FBI AGENT: Then how did the killer find his way here? Chance? Coincidence?

REYES: I, I ...

(The FBI AGENT interrupts her as she tries to explain.)

FBI AGENT: We've got a guy working the whole eastern seaboard, murdering up and down the coast. Tell me how it is he winds up here in this city in this building on this floor in this room, on the same day you came here to see her, if he didn't know?

REYES: That's actually why I came to see this woman. To find out who the killer is, why he does what he does when he does it.

FBI AGENT: We have a reputation to uphold, Agent Reyes. The FBI doesn't go to numerologists, for the same reason we don't consult horoscopes or palm readers or crystal balls. A killer kills for a reason. He lives in the world of cause and effect, as we all do. He gets an impulse and acts on it. Always the case, even if he doesn't know it. And that's how we catch him.

REYES: If he acts on impulses he can't understand, isn't it possible we can't understand them either? Can we not accept that every killer is not driven by the same impulses, and that there are some impulses that not every killer kills for.

FBI AGENT: No.

REYES: Why not?

FBI AGENT: Because it's unacceptable.

DOGGETT: But if Agent Reyes didn't tell anyone she was comin' here, the only person who would possibly have any idea is somebody at the FBI.

FBI AGENT: An inside job? I don't buy it.

DOGGETT: But don't we at least have to accept that as a possibility?

FBI AGENT: No, we don't.

REYES: Why?

FBI AGENT: Because it's highly improbable.

DOGGETT: But not impossible.

FBI AGENT: Six of one, half dozen of the other.

DOGGETT: How would you like us to proceed, Sir?

FBI AGENT: The bottom line is I want results. I don't care how you go about it. What I want is this killer caught. All right, let's get the body out of here.

(The FBI AGENT heads for the door. Two other FBI technicians start to move the body bag.)

DOGGETT: Maybe you were followed.

REYES: How? If the killer didn't even know I was looking for him?

DOGGETT: I don't know. You explain it then.

REYES: This woman called me, just before she was murdered. She had something to tell me. Something she found in the victim's charts.

DOGGETT: Their charts?

REYES: Their numerology. A calculation of numbers that rule their lives, in thirteen different categories.

DOGGETT: But a calculation based on what?

REYES: On names and birth dates.

DOGGETT: And because my name is John J. Doggett, and I was born April Fourth, 1960, I got some kind of magic number?

REYES: Six. Which makes you an active, adaptive, curious person, who insists on their independence, loves a bargain, and above all else, wants to be successful.

DOGGETT: Well, that describes pretty much anyone.

REYES: (Smiling) People are people.

DOGGETT: Right. They're non-numbers.

REYES: Then what was she calling me for?

DOGGETT: (beat) I'm gonna leave you here to figure that out. I'm goin' back to the Bureau.



SCENE 7

(Upbeat Italian music - "La pansè" is playing. In Italian la pansè is a flower, but in this song there is an erotic double meaning because it alludes to a vagina. MR. BURT holds up a number six domino at the same time REYES leans out the window.)

MR. BURT: (whistles)

(WAYNE APPROACHES. MR. BURT has the dominoes stood up in a circle around the table.)

MR. BURT: (Italian) Buongiorno. Wayne-O.

WAYNE: Who do you think you are?

(WAYNE notices several police officers nearby and looks cautious.)

MR. BURT: Who do you think I am?

WAYNE: Don't say a word.

MR. BURT: Do I ever?

(DOGGETT walks by the table as MR. BURT sets loose the dominoes. DOGGETT watches, looking at both men, then walks away.)

WAYNE: You're just tryin' to get me caught.

MR. BURT: I'm just playin' a game of dominoes. Long as you're sitting here, though, how you feelin'?

WAYNE: Go to hell.

MR. BURT: Are the reservations in your name? You're a card. You really are a card. But I love you. Got time for a quick game?

WAYNE: I don't play your games.

MR. BURT: Not a truer word's been spoken.

(WAYNE gets up to leave the table. As he leaves, we see that MR. BURT is holding the "three" domino in his hand.)



SCENE 8

(In the lab at Quantico, SCULLY examines BURDICK's body with a large, round magnifier. She looks at the left cheek, revealing the same pattern of three marks on the cheekbone as before. She picks up her voice recorder and starts talking.)

SCULLY: The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick. Upon external examination, cause of death appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla, in which a small three-ring pattern lies. I will begin my internal examination at six-oh-six PM

(SCULLY looks up at the lab clock, it reads 06:06:00. SCULLY picks up a scalpel from the tray. She notices the marks again on the arm of the deceased. She looks at her voice recorder, the tape counter is reading 666.)

(SCULLY looks concerned as if the numbers appear to be conveying something.)

(In the background we hear "La pansè" continue to play.)



SCENE 9

(REYES is working alone in BURDICK'S hotel room. SCULLY approaches the door and enters.)

REYES: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: I've got something to show you.

REYES: What is it?

SCULLY: I figured out what the triple zero pattern on the victim is. They aren't zeroes at all. It's the number 6-6-6, only worn away. (SCULYL shows REYES an enhanced photo of AMY'S face.) It must be stamped on the killer's ring. 6-6- 6, the work of the devil.

REYES: Of course. How'd you figure that?

SCULLY: I didn't.

REYES: Then how'd you discover it?

SCULLY: Completely by accident.

REYES: I discovered something, too. The victim's charts. When the numbers were figured, the numerologist found they were a match to her own numbers.

SCULLY: Uh... And how did the killer find her?

REYES: It obviously wasn't an accident.

SCULLY: And how does that help us find the killer?

REYES: It doesn't.

(SCULLY looks slightly dejected.)



SCENE 10

(DOGGETT is in the office standing in front of a wall containing crime photos and information. A newspaper clipping has the headline "Her Number Was Up.". DOGGETT then traces the pattern of the killings on a map of the North Eastern US, which appears to look like the number six. Music used in scene is Karl Zero with Daisy d'Errata Lyrics - Inouis.)

FBI AGENT: Agent Doggett. I think we have a psychological profile on the murderer.

DOGGETT: What is it?

FBI AGENT:Based on the amalgam of forensic detail, facts such as time and place the murders were committed and the amount of force used, we believe the killer is a man in his mid-20's to late 40's, of average build and looks, who is driven by a rage stemming from a hatred of his mother from a very early age. He was a bed wetter, who was made to feel inferior, which he took out on the world by killing small animals.

DOGGETT: That's it?

FBI AGENT: Go to work.

DOGGETT: That's the average profile of almost every single serial killer the FBI's ever hunted down.

FBI AGENT: Is that really all that surprising? (DOGGETT looks back at the photos on the wall.) Is there a problem, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: It's the way Agent Reyes found the cases. I don't think she should so easily be dismissed.

FBI AGENT: You don't believe in this nonsense.

DOGGETT: Look at this. The path of the killer forms the number six.

(DOGGETT shows the FBI AGENT the map on the wall.)

FBI AGENT: Your point?

DOGGETT: I don't know. I just noticed it.

FBI AGENT: Have you noticed all babies look like Winston Churchill? Same difference, Agent Doggett.

DOGGETT: What if this is the killer's pattern? What if the number six has some kind of significance to the murders?

FBI AGENT: It may. To you and Agent Reyes. But not to victim number seven.

(The FBI AGENT points to another victim photo on the wall.)



SCENE 11

(Later in the hotel. REYES and SCULLY exit BURDICK's office.)

REYES: If I could analyse these numbers, I know we could figure this out.

SCULLY: Despite what we know about the victim's numerology, about the ring that we think that he wears, we really know next to nothing about where to start looking for this man.

REYES: The answer's gonna come to me.

(The lift doors open. SCULLY notices someone inside.)

SCULLY: You going down?

(We see it is WAYNE. He nods to SCULLY. REYES and SCULLY enter this lift. They stand in silence as it descends. As SCULLY exits, WAYNE holds his arm to stop the door closing.)

SCULLY: Thank you.

(SCULLY notices the silver skull ring on his finger. She draws her gun and turns around quickly.)

SCULLY: Get out of the elevator!! Move!!

(WAYNE raises his arms.)

WAYNE: Just-Just be cool. Be cool. All right? Everything's gonna be fine. Be cool.

(WAYNE backs into the open lift just as the doors close. The lift starts to descend.)

SCULLY: It's him.

REYES: It's going down.

SCULLY: Stairs.

(REYES and SCULLY head for the stairwell.)

(Music at end of Scene is Karl Zero Lyrics - Torero.)



SCENE 12

(Basement garage. We can hear the Italian song "Torero" in the background. They enter from the stairwell and see a car race off. The security gate closes, blocking their exit.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 13

(Moments later. SCULLY and REYES go back to the elevator as REYES tries to make a call on her cell phone.)

REYES: It's not getting reception.

SCULLY: Great.

(REYES' phone beeps at her.)

REYES: No service.

SCULLY: We have to get an APB out on that car. Did you happen to see a plate?

(SCULLY finds a keypad on the door, and tries random numbers in a bid to open it.)

SCULLY: We've got all the numbers on this case except for the ones we need.

REYES: Maybe there's another way out.

SCULLY: Well it's only midnight. There's gotta be somebody coming in or out soon.

REYES: How do we know who was driving that car? That it was even him? That the killer's not still here.

(They look around and draw their guns.)

(They move through the garage. SCULLY issues a warning to whoever may be in the garage.)

SCULLY: We're Federal Agents and we're armed! If you are here, and you make any sudden moves, we will be forced to consider you a threat.

(They notice someone sitting in an old car. They hold their weapons over the car.)

SCULLY: Stay where you are! Right there!

REYES: Hands where we can see them! Get out of the car, slowly.

(MR. BURT slowly gets out, his arms up.)

MR. BURT: Did I do something wrong?

SCULLY: Step out around the back of the car.

(MR. BURT slowly moves to the rear of the car. REYES and SCULLY hold aim at MR. BURT.)

SCULLY: I want you to show us some identification.

MR. BURT: I don't have a wallet.

REYES: Do you have some form of I.D.?

MR. BURT: I don't think so.

SCULLY: Sir, what are you doing here?

MR. BURT: Waiting for a friend.

SCULLY: At midnight, in a parking garage?

MR. BURT: We have this regular game we play.

REYES: What kind of game?

MR. BURT: Checkers. The checkers are... in the trunk... if either of you play.

SCULLY: Sir, does it look like we're here to play checkers?

MR. BURT: What are you here for?

(MR. BURT'S arms lower, but REYES quickly notices.)

REYES: Get your hands back up in the air! Step forward. Put your hands on the trunk.

(REYES moves over to him and frisks him for weapons. SCULLY covers her with her gun. MR. BURT seems to enjoy the procedure.)

REYES: He's clean.

SCULLY: All right. Let's pop the trunk.

(The trunk is opened, revealing a checkers boards and probably over a hundred CDs, scattered around the boot.)

SCULLY: What's all this?

MR. BURT: Music.

REYES: You must really like music.

MR. BURT: Oh, I love it. The classics, of course. Mozart, Bach, the earlier jazz, Louis Armstrong, Sinatra, Doo-Wap, Elvis, marching bands...

SCULLY: Sir, enough.

MR. BURT: Don't get me wrong. I love all music. But I prefer the stuff that lasts. (He looks at SCULLY) Do you like them? Keep them. Thanks to the wondrous world of digital technology, I can always make more.

SCULLY: What time is your friend coming?

(MR. BURT looks at his wrist. He is not wearing a watch.)

MR. BURT: Soon.

REYES: What do you want to do?

SCULLY: I don't know. I don't know.

MR. BURT: I have some nice dance music.

SCULLY: We happen to be here, Sir, because there is a serial killer on the loose.

MR. BURT: How many did he kill?

REYES: Seven women now.

MR. BURT: How you gonna catch him?

SCULLY: We're not, stuck down here.

MR. BURT: You sure there's nothing I can do?

SCULLY: Do you have the combination to the door?

MR. BURT: No ...

REYES: Do you have a cell phone that works?

MR. BURT: I wish I did. There's always checkers.

(Later on, SCULLY is playing checkers against MR. BURT. She has just lost to him.)

MR. BURT: Next victim?

SCULLY: (to Reyes) How did we get ourselves into this?

(REYES is now playing MR. BURT, who pulls off an elaborate move, taking out all her pieces. SCULLY suddenly starts firing at the locked door. She tries to open it, but it is still locked. SCULLY looks fed up.)

(SCULLY is now playing checkers against REYES and MR. BURT is dancing the cha-cha-cha around in the background to the music playing, which is Karl Zero with HenriI Salvador Lyrics - El Bodeguero. REYES looks down at the board, and something dawns on her. The turns the board around half a turn, so that now REYES has black pieces and SCULLY has red pieces.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes?

REYES: Your hair colour.

SCULLY: I don't believe it.

MR. BURT: What?

REYES: What if we are his next victims?

MR. BURT: You?

REYES: The seventh victim was a blonde.

MR. BURT: But neither of you are blondes.

REYES: He kills in threes. Blonde, redhead, brunette. The next victims will be a redhead and a brunette.

MR. BURT: Amazing... from a game of checkers.

(SCULLY gets up and draws her gun on MR. BURT at point blank range.)

SCULLY: Who are you?

(He raises his arms above his head quickly.)

MR. BURT: Obviously someone you were very lucky to have run into.

SCULLY: You're part of this.

MR. BURT: How do you figure that?

REYES: No. It's all in the numbers. It makes perfect sense. The numbers led us to the killer. The killer led us to the garage. And now all we've done is recognize the killer's real serial pattern.

MR. BURT: So you're saying I didn't have anything to do with it?

(Looking more comfortable, he drops his hands.)

SCULLY: Keep your hands up.

(He quickly puts his hands above his head again.)

MR. BURT: Why?

SCULLY: I don't know.

MR. BURT: What's this about numbers?

(He drops his arms again. SCULLY looks like she's about to explode with frustration.)

SCULLY: Will you just...

MR. BURT: I'm very good with numbers.

REYES: The killer is driven by an impulse we believe is numerological.

MR. BURT: Of course. He's a serial killer.

SCULLY: No, that's... that's not what she means. (sigh) She thinks that his acts are determined by a calculation of numbers.

MR. BURT: So the killer is not in control of his actions - the numbers are.

MR. BURT: Well, are the numbers helping you catch him, or are they helping him not get caught?

REYES: That's a good question.

MR. BURT: So... it's a kind of a game.

SCULLY: No. It's not.

REYES: No, maybe it is. Maybe that's what this is about. Who wins the game.

(MR. BURT looks excited.)

MR. BURT: I think she's on to something.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes. You can't reduce a complex factor as physical and psychological into a game.

REYES: You're a scientist, Agent Scully. Your world is ruled by numbers. Atoms, molecules, periodicity.

MR. BURT Wow ...

REYES: And wouldn't it follow that everything made from those things is ruled by numbers, too? Genes, chromosomes, us, the Universe.

MR. BURT: Go, girl.

SCULLY: Agent Reyes, that is utter nonsense, okay? It would mean that all we are are checkers on a checker board being moved around by some ... forces completely outside and unbeknownst to us.

REYES: What did Einstein say?

MR. BURT: Einstein. Now there's a winner.

REYES: God does not play dice with the universe.

SCULLY: Nor does he play checkers. (SCULLY looks happy with her retort) Look, Agent Reyes, you can't reduce all of life, all creation, every piece of ... of art, architecture, music, literature... into a game of win or lose.

REYES: Why not? Maybe the winners are those who play the game better. Those who see the patterns and the connections, like we're doing right now.

MR. BURT: Free will.

REYES: Maybe we're not the next victims. Maybe we're here, because we saw the numbers, and read the patterns, and we're here to catch the killer.

SCULLY: But the killer is outside, killing, and we are stuck in a parking garage.

REYES: What if he's not? (MR. BURT looks uneasy) What if we didn't look hard enough? (REYES draws her gun) What if the killer is still down here?

(SCULLY notices MR. BURT is looking at her.)

SCULLY: What are you lookin' at?

(Suddenly the lights go out.)

MR. BURT: The same thing you are.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 14

(Later in the garage. MR. BURT sits at his checkers board, stacking the checkers.)

MR. BURT: So what now?

SCULLY: You go left and I'll go right. (to Mr. BURT) You? You stay right where you are.

MR. BURT: Oh, there's no getting rid of me.

(REYES walks past a concrete pillar. Suddenly WAYNE grabs her around the mouth. The struggle for a couple of second before the hit the ground. REYES' guns falls to the ground. WAYNE crawls after it. He picks it up and sits on the floor, aiming at REYES. Suddenly, short ring out and WAYNE is hit, falling back to the ground.)

(DOGGETT emerges from the shadows, his weapon drawn. SCULLY moves over to WAYNE'S body, kneeling down.)

SCULLY: He's going fast.

(DOGGETT helps REYES to her feet.)

DOGGETT: Are you okay?

REYES: Yeah, I think so.

(SCULLY tries to communicate with WAYNE.)

SCULLY: Can you hear me?

REYES: Why'd you do it? Kill those women?

(WAYNE holds his head up for a couple of seconds, before slowly falling back to the ground.)

SCULLY: (to Doggett) How did you ever find us?

DOGGETT: I saw somethin' in his pattern. Made me realize there was gonna be nine victims. And that maybe you two were gonna be eight and nine.

(REYES and SCULLY notice that MR. BURT has disappeared. They run through the garage, looking for him.)

REYES: Where'd he go?

(They look around for MR. BURT, dumbfounded.)



SCENE 15

(Back in the FBI building. The FBI AGENT and nearly 20 other agents are staring at DOGGETT'S map on the wall, the figure "6" clearly highlighting the path of the killer. Music used in the scene is Karl Zero Lyrics - I Love You For Sentimental Reasons.)

(They all slowly turn their heads clockwise, until the number "6" on the wall turns into a "9", the map now appearing upside down. They all stare at the map, intrigued by its significance.)



SCENE 16

(SCULLY'S apartment. She is just putting WILLIAM down in his cot, stroking his cheek. WILLIAM looks content, and SCULLY smiles at him. She turns off the light and walks out of his bedroom, pulling the door half closed. She goes into her room. She's in her silk pajamas and climbs under her duvet. She turns off her bedside light, and settles down. She lies awake, it seems there is something on her mind. She gets up again and picks up the phone.)

(The phone rings in REYES' bedroom. Her alarm clock shows the time as 9:09. REYES' picks up. The screen splits in half.)

REYES: (into phone) Hello?

SCULLY: (into phone) All right. I need to know.

REYES: (into phone) What?

SCULLY: (into phone) What my numerology is. My number. Whatever you call it. What am I?

REYES: (into phone) You're a nine.

SCULLY: (into phone) Which means what?

REYES: (into phone) Nine is completion. You've evolved through the experiences of all the other numbers to a spiritual realization that this life is only part of a larger whole.

(SCULLY is silent, and looks happy at what she's hearing.)

REYES: Dana, are you there?

SCULLY: (into phone) There's something else that's buggin' me.

REYES: (into phone) What's that?

SCULLY: (into phone) Who was that man?

REYES: (into phone) God knows.



SCENE 17

(Night. Back in the Italian neighbourhood. WAYNE'S body is removed in a body bag from the Hotel Knickerbocker. The body bag is placed on a stretcher and wheeled away.)

(Two old Italian men, standing near the Hotel's entrance, walk away, singing "Io, mammeta e tu" [Me, your mother and you]. They sing the lines of the song alternately, as they walk.)

(They walk along the street, which seems to be in the middle of a large street party. People line the streets, a band plays, and a ferris wheel is in motion in the background.

(A young Italian couple approaches, complaining to the old men in Italian, waving their arms about to make their point.)

(The old men ignore them and carry on along the crowded street. A group of women dance behind the men as they walk, giving a very musical feel to the episode's conclusion. The camera begins to pan out, until we can see the whole street, brightly lit and full of movement. The camera continues to pan upwards, until we can see more streets and houses, then the whole neighbourhood and further still, until we can see a large part of the City. The image is now greyscale, as we start to be able to make out the face of MR. BURT, his facial features appearing from the mosaic of different shades of grey in the picture.)

[THE END]



In keeping with the Italian theme running through the whole episode, the credits read:

                             SCARY MONSTERS



SCENE 1
FAIRHOPE, PENNSYLVANIA

(Camera pans across the wall where a child's drawings hang. The first picture is of a boy in a red & yellow long-sleeved shirt and jeans walking on green grass. The second picture is of a man and a woman driving in one-seat open vehicles/wagons (with steering wheels) in opposite directions. The third picture is of a boy flying a kite and running toward the edge of the hill.)

(It's night. A little boy lies in bed. He is awake and staring at the ceiling. He doesn't seem tired at all. The tree branches outside his window scratch against the glass. The little boy seems afraid. He closes his eyes and the scratching noise stops.)

(After a brief moment, the scratching resumes. The little boy gasps and opens his eyes. He looks around the darkened room. He sits up in bed and glances at himself in the mirror. He peers under the bed. He doesn't see anything. He gets up and looks in the mirror again and sees something move under his bed.)

TOMMY (yelling): Dad! Dad!

(The bedroom door opens slightly and a dark, shadowy figure appears at the doorway.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy? What is it?

TOMMY: I'm afraid. I heard something.

(Tommy's father leans a little further into the bedroom.)

JEFFREY CONLON: It's just the wind.

TOMMY: No. I think it's under the bed. Can you check?

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy, there is nothing to be scared of, I promise.

TOMMY: No. There's something under the bed. You have to check.

(From the doorway, Tommy's father crouches down slowly to peer under the bed. He sees something about a foot long scurry across the floor under the bed. Tommy is above on top of the bed watching his father closely.)

(Tommy's father gets up, a little shocked at what he's seen. He takes a breath and lies to his son.)

JEFFREY CONLON: All clear.

TOMMY: You sure? I thought I saw something in the mirror.

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy, it is just your imagination. Now, let's try to get some sleep, okay?

(Tommy's father backs out of the bedroom door and closes it. Tommy settles back down on the bed and turns to look at his reflection in the mirror. He stares at the dark corner under his bed. The scratching he heard earlier resumes and grows louder. He imagines he sees something.)

(Tommy jumps out of bed and runs screaming to the closed door.)

TOMMY: Dad, help! It's in here!

(Tommy grabs the door handle and tugs at it. It won't budge.)

TOMMY: Help! Help me! Help!

(Tommy pulls on the door handle and the door refuses to open. On the other side of the door in the hallway, Tommy's father holds the door pulled securely shut tight. His son's screams are heard loudly in the hallway.)

TOMMY: Help! Dad! It's in here! Help! Help me!

(Tommy's father braces the door shut keeping Tommy inside his bedroom.)

TOMMY: Dad! Daddy! Dad!

SCENE 2
FBI ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Daytime. A class bell rings. Students and teachers fill the hallway. Scully rushes quickly to her office to grab a quick bite to eat before her next class. An FBI Cadet tries to get her attention.)

FBI CADET: Dr. Scully ...

SCULLY: After lunch. Sorry. All questions answered after lunch. Thank you.

CUT TO:

(SCULLY'S rushes into her office. She seems to have something on her mind. She does. It's lunch. Right behind her is AGENT LELYA HARRISON.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Scully ...

SCULLY: Leyla Harrison. What a surprise.

LEYLA HARRISON: Oh, good. I was afraid I should have made a call first. How have you been?

(SCULLY reaches into her desk and pulls out a plastic Glad (c) storage container.)

SCULLY: Oh, uh... busy. And yourself?

LEYLA HARRISON: I'm back in accounting now. Happily, mind you. No regrets. Although I did relish my big adventure on the X-Files unit last year.

(SCULLY opens the container and pulls out her sandwich wrapped in wax paper. She pauses and looks up at LEYLA.)

SCULLY: I have about five minutes uh, before my next class. Can we talk while I eat?

LEYLA HARRISON: Not a problem.

(SCULLY grabs half of her sandwich and prepares to take a bit when LEYLA opens a thin file she carried in with her. On one side of the file is the gruesome picture of a dead woman covered in blood. SCULLY has the strangest face on.)

LEYLA HARRISON: It's an X-File. I'm sure of it.

(SCULLY puts her sandwich down, composes herself and picks the file up.)

SCULLY: Where'd you get this?

LEYLA HARRISON: It all started when I tracked down a mileage discrepancy in the bureau's vehicle fleet. It turns out a really nice secretary from our Baltimore field office had used a Ford Taurus without authorization.

SCULLY: And what does that have to do with...?

LEYLA HARRISON: Well, she was desperate to visit her grandson which is why she borrowed the car. She's the one who told me about this case. This was her daughter.

SCULLY: And what makes you think this is an X-File?

LEYLA HARRISON: Well, this dead woman's son -- my friend's grandson -- this is Tommy Conlon.

(LEYLA pulls out a photo of TOMMY CONLON. Cute kid.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Tommy is eight years old. And Tommy told her a monster killed his mother. And his father knows all about it.

(SCULLY looks at her sceptically. She picks up her sandwich again preparing to eat it.)

LEYLA HARRISON: I know, I know. Why take the word of an eight-year-old? But ... look at the autopsy report.

(LEYLA once again opens the file and puts it in front of SCULLY before she has a chance to take a single bite.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Clearly this woman was murdered, and yet ...

SCULLY: ... and yet the coroner concludes that she stabbed herself to death.

(LEYLA nods her head.)

SCULLY: Agent Harrison I see no reason to disagree with the coroner.

LEYLA HARRISON: But ... I mean, how could someone stab themselves sixteen times?

SCULLY: Look, it is unusual but I have seen it before.

LEYLA HARRISON: Tommy's father took the boy to some mountain-top in Pennsylvania in the middle of nowhere. He took him away from his friends -- his family. They don't even have a phone. Tommy's own grandmother isn't allowed to see him anymore.

SCULLY: I'm sorry, Agent Harrison but unless you have other evidence ...

LEYLA HARRISON: Wait, wait. Tommy said that the same monster that killed his mother killed Spanky his pet cat.

SCULLY: Uh, unless you bring me Spanky, there's nothing I can do.

(The class bell rings, ending their conversation. SCULLY stands and re-wraps her uneaten lunch. She hands the sandwich to LEYLA then leaves for her next class.)

SCULLY: Apple and tuna salad?

CUT TO:



SCENE 3
GEORGETOWN
6:42 PM

(Scully's apartment. Night. The phone rights. SCULLY exits the next room (presumably WILLIAM'S room) and partially closes the door behind her.)

SCULLY (to phone): Hello.

REYES: Dana, it's Monica Reyes. Did I catch you at a bad time?

(REYES is on her cell phone in a car. DOGGETT is driving. They're going somewhere.)

SCULLY: I was just putting the baby down. What is it?

REYES: I wanted to get your opinion on an autopsy finding. It's pretty unusual. A woman who stabbed herself sixteen times.

SCULLY: Last name Conlon? I assume you've been talking to Leyla Harrison?

(REYES glances to the person in the backseat of their car. It's LEYLA HARRISON.)

REYES: Yeah. The three of us are headed to Pennsylvania, in fact. It sounds like you're familiar with the case.

(REYES listens to SCULLY on the other end of the phone.)

REYES: What do you mean, "there is no case"?

(REYES glances over at DOGGETT who is listening in on the conversation. LEYLA smiles sheepishly.)

REYES: Oh, right. Thanks.

(REYES hangs up.)

REYES: Why didn't you tell us you'd already gone to Agent Scully?

LEYLA HARRISON: (mumbles) I didn't know that's who you were going to call.

DOGGETT: That's not the point, Leyla. You misled us.

(DOGGETT'S not happy with what he's hearing. He turns the car around.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Doggett, we're almost there.

DOGGETT: "How'd you spend your Friday night, John?" Ran around like an idiot.

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Doggett ... both of you got in this car believing a little boy may be in danger. What's changed since then? Even if this isn't an X-File (which it is) -- what will it hurt to keep going?

(LEYLA lets out an exasperated sigh.)

LEYLA HARRISON: If Agent Mulder were here, he'd keep going.

(REYES looks over at DOGGETT. He glances back at her. They exchange looks at which DOGGETT nods his head slightly in agreement.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4
FAIRHOPE, PENNSYLVANIA

(Night. A large two story house sits in darkness. A man with a shovel is busy burying something in the yard. He works diligently covering the hole with dirt mixed with snow. He finishes his job. He is tired. He looks up at the approaching car. It's JEFFERY CONLON, TOMMY'S father.)

(The Agents' car drives up the road and parks in the driveway. The agents get out of the car and approach the man.)

REYES: Jeffrey Conlon?

JEFFREY CONLON: Yeah. Can I help you?

REYES: Hi. I'm Agent Monica Reyes. This is Agent John Doggett and Agent Harrison. We're with the FBI.

(DOGGETT holds out his ID.)

JEFFREY CONLON: FBI. Really? What are you...?

LEYLA HARRISON: We're here at the request of Dorothy-- your mother-in-law. She's worried about her grandson.

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy is fine. I told Dorothy over and over. There's really nothing more to say.

DOGGETT: Is that blood on your hand, Mr. Conlon?

JEFFREY CONLON: Yeah, I cut myself.

DOGGETT: On what?

JEFFREY CONLON: A piece of broken glass.

REYES: Sir, can we speak with your son?

JEFFREY CONLON: He's asleep.

DOGGETT: It's not even 7:00. It's kind of early for bedtime, isn't it?

JEFFREY CONLON: Not for Tommy. And I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your voice down.

DOGGETT: Look, I'm going to be straight with you. We drove a long way.

REYES: Agent Doggett is very stubborn. I don't think you'll get him to leave until we see your son.

TOMMY: Dad?

(Just outside the door, TOMMY is standing on the porch in his PJs. JEFFREY CONLON walks toward his son. The agents follow.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy, go back inside, please.

TOMMY: I heard something. I got afraid.

REYES: Hi, Tommy. I'm Monica. This is John, and this is Leyla.

LEYLA HARRISON: I'm friends with your Grandmom. She wanted us to come see how you were doing.

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy, it's too cold out here. Go back inside the house, please.

REYES: Do you remember what you said to your Grandmom? Something about your mother. Do you remember?

LEYLA HARRISON: Monsters. You said there were monsters, right?

(TOMMY tells the agents woodenly:)

TOMMY: No such thing as monsters.

JEFFREY CONLON: Tell Dorothy this is exactly why she's not allowed to visit anymore. Now, good night.

(LEYLA looks at DOGGETT. She's disappointed at the uneventful exchange. DOGGETT remains silent and thoughtful. JEFFREY CONLON turns his back on the agents and picks up his son. The two go into the house.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Come on.

(The door closes behind them.)

(The agents stand there in silence. LEYLA sighs. The three slowly make their way back to the car.)

LEYLA HARRISON: I apologize. I let my imagination run wild and I ruined both your evenings. Thank you in advance for not yelling at me.

(When they reach the car, the agents stop. DOGGETT turns around to face LEYLA.)

DOGGETT: Something's going on here.

(LEYLA looks surprised.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Wait ... there is?

(REYES concurs.)

REYES: That little boy only said what his father wanted him to say.

DOGGETT: Did you notice the dirt on that guy's hands and knees? He's been digging. This time of the year he sure as hell ain't gardening. I say we find a judge get a warrant ... search the place.

(LEYLA is stunned. She sighs. She's surprised that she was right after all.)

CUT TO: [INT. TOMMY'S UPSTAIRS BEDROOM]

(From above, the agents are observed moving toward the car. They are preparing to leave. JEFFREY CONLON stands near the window looking down at them.)

TOMMY: Dad?

(JEFFREY CONLON turns from the window to look at his son who is standing by the door.)

TOMMY: The monsters aren't going to let those people leave are they?

JEFFREY CONLON: (gently, reassuringly) They're leaving, Tommy. They're leaving right now.

(JEFFREY CONLON watches the agents get into the car.)

TOMMY: It's too late.

(JEFFREY CONLON turns to look at his son.)

CUT TO: [INT. CAR]

(DOGGETT turns the ignition. The engine sputters but doesn't start.)

DOGGETT: What the hell?

(REYES looks concerned. DOGGETT tries the ignition one more time and as the engine sputters, blood burst through the a/c vents splattering the agents. REYES screams. The agents look surprised.

CUT TO: [EXT. CAR]

(DOGGETT opens the car hood. There is blood all over the inside engine. REYES and LEYLA stand on the side looking down at the mess.)

REYES: Oh, God. A possum, maybe?

DOGGETT: That doesn't make any sense. How'd it get from here into the vents?

CUT TO:



SCENE 5

(Scully's apartment. The living room is dark. Some light from the vicinity of the kitchen and a nearby fishtank pierces the darkness. There is someone knocking on the door. Loudly. A lamp light is turned on. SCULLY rushes out of her bedroom tying the sash to her robe. She peers through the door's peep hole and sees a young dark-haired man standing there ... someone she's never seen before.

SCULLY: Who is it?

GABE ROTTER: It's Gabe Rotter. I have the thing you've been waiting for.

SCULLY: Who?

GABE ROTTER: Gabe ... Rotter. I'm a friend of Leyla Harrison.

(At the mere mention of LEYLA'S name, SCULLY unchains and opens the door. She can't believe it.)

SCULLY: Do you know what time it is?

GABE ROTTER: Hey, I just do as I'm told. Enjoy.

(GABE ROTTER holds out a small dirty box for SCULLY to take. SCULLY takes a step back at the stench coming from the box.)

SCULLY: Whoa. What the hell is that?

GABE ROTTER: A dead cat.

SCULLY: Come again?

GABE ROTTER: Yeah, his name's Spanky. Leyla said you're helping her out on a case and you needed it ASAP, so ... hey, you're welcome.

(SCULLY puts her head in her hands. Could the day get any worse?)

SCULLY: I am going to be exceptionally polite. Leave. Now. Leave now and take that with you.

(SCULLY takes a step back and begins to close the door. GABE ROTTER, not one to be left out of anything, quickly steps into SCULLY'S apartment, uninvited. Him and his box.)

GABE ROTTER: Do you have any idea what I went through to get this thing? I snuck onto the property where your perp there used to live and I dug up the whole thing looking for it.

(SCULLY stands near the door. It's still wide open.)

SCULLY: I don't care. Leave! Now! Please!

(SCULLY'S voice rises.)

GABE ROTTER: Uh-uh. Leyla said she'd go out with me only if I got you the cat, and damn it, I got it.

(GABE ROTTER opens the box exposing the dead cat to SCULLY who, once again, turns away from the stench. Her hand covering her mouth, SCULLY glances down at the cat. She sees something. SCULLY walks past GABE ROTTER and picks up her phone. She begins dialing.)

GABE ROTTER: Oh, god ... you calling the cops on me?

SCULLY: If only. God help me but Agent Harrison might be on to something after all.

(SCULLY turns attention back to the telephone.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 6

(Conlon's residence. REYES is holding her cell phone. Her phone is on "ROAM". She presses the button twice; the phone beeps twice. She holds it to her ear but doesn't hear anything.)

(DOGGETT and JEFFREY CONLON come inside the house.)

REYES: Any luck?

DOGGETT: Our engine's completely shot. His truck won't start even though I can't find one damn thing wrong with it. Looks like we're here for the night.

JEFFREY CONLON: I'd better get Tommy back to sleep.

(JEFFREY CONLON leaves the room.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Phones that won't work, cars that won't start. It reminds me of a case Mulder and Scully investigated. A teenager who was struck by lightning -- his body affected the electrical workings of everything around him.

REYES: I don't think that's what we're dealing with here, Leyla.

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Mulder wasted no time closing that case. I just try to think like him. What would Agents Mulder and Scully do if they were in this situation?

DOGGETT: Agents Mulder and Scully aren't in this situation. Agents Doggett and Reyes are. I don't know about Agent Reyes but Agent Doggett's going to sit his tired ass down.

LEYLA HARRISON: What kind of a course of action is that?

REYES: I think Agent Doggett is saying that right now, we're in the best possible place.

DOGGETT: Exactly. Bottom line we're all concerned for this boy's safety. As long as we're here, nothing's going to happen to him, right?

TOMMY (screaming from upstairs): Help! It's in here! Dad!

(DOGGETT gets up off of the couch in a flash and begins running.)

TOMMY: Help! Help me!

(DOGGETT runs up the stairs. REYES not far behind him.)

TOMMY: Dad!

(DOGGETT turns the corner into the hallway and sees JEFFREY CONLON holding the door to his son's bedroom closed.)

[CLOSED CAPTION: TOMMY: Help! It's in here!]

DOGGETT: Hey!

JEFFREY CONLON: No, don't do it!

(DOGGETT pushes JEFFREY CONLON away from TOMMY'S bedroom door. REYES opens the door and sees TOMMY huddled on his bed. On the floor are two huge earwig.)

REYES: John ...

(DOGGETT appears behind REYES. REYES reaches TOMMY and pulls the boy into her arms while DOGGETT pulls out his weapon. LEYLA arrives at the bedroom doorway. DOGGETT fires at one earwig. The creature breaks upon impact. The agents all watch in horror as the two pieces of the broken earwig grow into two newly formed creatures. They both scurry away under the bedroom wall.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 7

(Conlon residence. TOMMY is sitting at the downstairs table colouring. It is a picture of a woman wearing black standing next to another person wearing sky blue.)

(REYES is standing quietly on the side watching TOMMY. DOGGETT enters the living area. REYES approaches him.)

DOGGETT: How's he doing?

REYES: He's a hell of a lot calmer than I'd be.

DOGGETT: I checked the place top to bottom. Whatever the hell those things were, they're gone. I have no idea where they went.

(DOGGETT glances down at TOMMY who is still colouring. He approaches the table and sits down in the chair next to TOMMY.)

DOGGETT: That's really good, Tommy.

(TOMMY doesn't say anything.)

DOGGETT: Is that you?

(TOMMY nods his head. DOGGETT points to the woman in black in the picture TOMMY'S colouring.)

DOGGETT: Who's that?

TOMMY: That's her.

(REYES smiles. DOGGETT turns to look at her.)

REYES: Tommy, tell John what you told me about what we saw in your room tonight.

TOMMY: Those are the monsters that hurt my mommy. But my dad says I'm not supposed to talk about it.

(DOGGETT quietly gets up and leaves.))

CUT TO:



SCENE 8

(Tommy's bedroom. There's a picture that TOMMY drew that's hanging on the wall. It's a picture of a boy, his cat, his bike and his house. JEFFREY CONLON is looking at the picture. DOGGETT and LEYLA are also in the room.)

JEFFREY CONLON: This is my house. Why do I have to sit here?

DOGGETT: Tell me what we're dealing with.

JEFFREY CONLON: I don't ...

DOGGETT: Don't tell me you don't know because you're not going to like what happens next. These things were in the room with your son and you knew it. You held the door shut, you son of a bitch.

JEFFREY CONLON: Want to see something? Look at that.

(JEFFREY CONLON rolls up his shirt sleeves to reveal large welting scars on his forearms.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Look at that. That's what they did to me. They almost killed me one time before.

DOGGETT: They? What are they? Some kind of animal? What?

JEFFREY CONLON: All I know is that they won't leave us alone and I'm dealing with this the best way I can. Now it's too late.

DOGGETT: How's that?

JEFFREY CONLON: They mean to kill every one of you and there's nothing you can do to stop it.

(LEYLA stands there silent.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Oh, come on. You saw what happens. You think you've killed one and then it becomes two.

LEYLA HARRISON: I don't think Mr. Conlon is telling us the whole truth.

DOGGETT: No kidding.

LEYLA HARRISON: I mean, I think you can kill them because I don't know what else he would have been burying when we showed up tonight.

CUT TO:



SCENE 9

(Scully's kitchen. Spread out on paper towels are an array of kitchen appliances, from knives, to tongs, a champagne opener, meat tenderizer, salad tongs ... every kitchen utensil available. SCULLY reaches for the salad tongs and begins working on SPANKY, the CONLON'S dead cat.)

(GABE ROTTER stands by the doorway watching as SCULLY (in her "Something smells goo-ood!" green bar-b-que apron and yellow rubber cleaning gloves) begins to autopsy the dead cat on her kitchen table.)

GABE ROTTER: You got to be freaking kidding me. I can't believe you're cutting up a dead cat on your kitchen table.

SCULLY: Will you keep your voice down, please? You're going to wake my baby.

GABE ROTTER: This... this just isn't right. Can you clue me in here as to why the cat's so important?

SCULLY: Because it would seem that poor Spanky here may have chewed a hole in his own stomach ... which you'll admit is unusual behaviour.

GABE ROTTER: You mean ... he killed himself.

SCULLY: Just like his owner, Mrs. Conlon stabbed herself with a knife. The wounds are in the same place and if we figure out why ... well, then, you'll have something really good to share with your good friend Leyla Harrison, won't you?

GABE ROTTER: True that.

(The phone rings.)

SCULLY: Can you hold the ribs open while I grab that, please? Just... Now. Thank you.

(SCULLY and GABE ROTTER switch places. SCULLY answers the phone.)

SCULLY: Agent Scully.

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: Yeah, ma'am, this is Sheriff Jack Coogan. I got a message to call this number.

SCULLY: Hi, Sheriff. Thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate it. I'm an FBI agent and I've been trying to reach three of my colleagues that are up in your area.

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: Were they on some kind of case?

SCULLY: Well, they're looking into some concerns expressed by the grandmother of a child. The family name is Conlon and I have an address ...

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: No need. I was back up there a couple of weeks ago. Got into a kind of a shouting match with the father.

SCULLY: Over what?

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: The grandmother asked me to look in on the boy. Father told me to get the hell off his property. Boy seemed fine, so I did.

SCULLY: Well, as I say, sheriff, I need to contact my colleagues.

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: I'm happy to take a drive up there but can't promise much tonight. The roads are icing up as we speak. Won't be easy getting in.

SCULLY: Look, sheriff, they may be in danger. Could you please find a way?

CUT TO:



SCENE 10

(Conlon's back yard. DOGGETT is digging. JEFFREY CONLON and LEYLA are standing nearby. The shovel hits something hard. DOGGETT reaches into the shallow hole and cuts his finger on a piece of glass. He's bleeding.)

DOGGETT: Ow!

LEYLA HARRISON: Oh, my god.

DOGGETT: It's no monster, Agent Harrison. Dead or alive. You want to explain this, Mr. Conlon?

(DOGGETT pulls out a dirty shard of glass with a around sticker on it and holds it up for CONLON to see. It's the same kind of sticker that was on the mirror in TOMMY'S bedroom at the beginning of the episode.)

JEFFREY CONLON: It's just a mirror from my son's room.

DOGGETT: Why'd you bury it?

JEFFREY CONLON: 'Cause he was afraid of it.

DOGGETT: I want you to get Tommy bundled up in warm clothes. I want you to pack anything you think he might need.

JEFFREY CONLON: Why?

DOGGETT: 'Cause I don't believe one damn thing you've told me except that we're in danger and we're walking out of here, all five of us.

(While DOGGETT gives JEFFREY CONLON instructions, LEYLA kneels and looks into the shallow hole at the broken mirror pieces. She looks up after JEFFREY CONLON leaves.)

LEYLA HARRISON: I know what you're thinking. Black magic. Mirrors are powerful symbols in conjuring in the dark arts. That's what this is. Right?

(DOGGETT listens to LEYLA finish her theory. He doesn't believe it.)

DOGGETT (dryly): Uh-huh.

(DOGGETT walks away leaving LEYLA standing next to the shallow hole. LEYLA follows him inside.)

CUT TO:

(INT. -- Up in TOMMY'S bedroom, JEFFREY CONLON is busy packing a bag like DOGGETT instructed. DOGGETT is there helping grab things from the boy's closet. REYES and TOMMY are both there also.

DOGGETT: We passed a sheriff's station maybe six miles down the mountain. It'll be a hike, but we can make it.

TOMMY: Dad, the sheriff...

JEFFREY CONLON (interrupting): No. Tommy ... don't worry about the sheriff. He's going to help us.

(The agents all watch TOMMY'S reaction to the mention of the Sheriff. TOMMY seems upset that no one's listening to him. He walks around the bed and into REYES' arms. He clings to her.)

REYES: What's up, Tommy? What's the matter?

(Someone is knocking on the door downstairs. DOGGETT reaches for his gun.)

DOGGETT: Stay here.

(JEFFREY CONLON looks silently at his son. TOMMY doesn't say anything.)

CUT TO: [INT. DOWNSTAIRS]

(DOGGETT walks to the nearby window to see who is outside. It's the Sheriff. DOGGETT opens the front door.)

DOGGETT: Man, you're a sight for sore eyes. John Doggett.

(The Sheriff walks into the house. DOGGETT closes the door behind him.)

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: I'm the Sheriff.

DOGGETT: Who called you?

(LEYLA and REYES make their way down the stairs. JEFFREY CONLON and TOMMY are behind them.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Perfect timing.

REYES: We were just leaving, sheriff. We need a ride.

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: Sorry, you can't leave.

DOGGETT: What do you mean?

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: You can't go anywhere. It's too cold.

JEFFREY CONLON: It's not him.

(DOGGETT turns his back on the Sheriff to look at JEFFREY CONLON.)

DOGGETT: What?

(While his back is turned, the Sheriff reaches for his gun. REYES calls out a warning to DOGGETT.)

REYES: Gun!

(DOGGETT manages to knock the gun out of the Sheriff's hands. The two men fight. REYES moves in closer but doesn't interfere with the fighting. TOMMY watches with interest.)

REYES: Let him go!

(The two men continue fighting. DOGGETT reaches back and punches the Sheriff in his abdomen. His fist goes clear through. DOGGETT has a look of horror on his face. His fist is covered with blood.)

JEFFREY CONLON: oh...

(JEFFREY CONLON pulls his son into his arms to shield him from the sight. DOGGETT pulls his bloodied fist out of the Sheriff who falls back on the floor motionless. DOGGETT'S hand is drenched and dripping with blood.)

(REYES, who was standing just behind DOGGETT, slowly lowers her gun. Her eyes on DOGGETT'S bloodied fist.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(Scully's apartment. GABE ROTTER has somehow gotten his hands on MULDER'S ID badge. He holds it up, looking at it.)

GABE ROTTER: So, this is Johnny Fabulous, huh?

(SCULLY approaches from behind and snatches MULDER'S ID badge from GABE ROTTER. She is on the phone. GABE ROTTER continues to mumble to himself.)

GABE ROTTER: Oh... "Mulder's so smart. Mulder's so dreamy." That's all Leyla ever talks about. Mulder and Scully, Scully and Mulder, blah, blah, blah.

(SCULLY hangs up the phone and sighs.)

SCULLY: This Sheriff, Jack Coogan, I'm just getting his answering machine.

GABE ROTTER: Hey, you're really worried. I thought you didn't find anything. You told me there wasn't anything inside that cat.

SCULLY: No, there wasn't. But it certainly seems like there should have been.

GABE ROTTER: What does that mean?

SCULLY: Well, the pattern of bite marks. I mean, it seems to me that the cat was trying to get at something in its stomach to chew something out.

GABE ROTTER: Something. What?

SCULLY: I don't know. I mean, there wasn't any sign of it but it obviously caused a great deal of pain. And I'm thinking maybe it goes the same for the woman who tried to stab herself. I mean, what if that was a frantic attempt to... to cut something out.

GABE ROTTER: Wait a minute. Is Leyla in danger up there?

SCULLY: All I know is we're wasting our time talking about this.

(SCULLY picks up the phone one more time and begins dialing.)

GABE ROTTER: Who are you calling now?

SCULLY: My mom. I'm going to beg her to baby-sit.

CUT TO:



SCENE 12

(REYES is picking at the hole in the Sheriff with a wooden spoon. The spoon is bloodied and red. DOGGETT appears behind her wiping the blood off of his hands with a towel.)

DOGGETT: Got anything?

REYES: Yeah. A salad spoons no one's ever going to use again. And the sheriff here? Do not ask me to explain it but he's got absolutely no internal organs. He's like, he's like a big bag.

DOGGETT: You know what else? This isn't blood. Whatever it is, I bet it's the same crap that's all over the inside of our car.

(DOGGETT finishes wiping his hands and moves to gently lay the towel over the dead Sheriff's face.)

DOGGETT: I've been thinking. You know, I hate to sound like Agent Harrison but Mulder and Scully had a case like this that I remember where they were trapped underground with these mushroom spores that caused hallucinations. Never mind.

REYES: I don't know what to say, either. Maybe Mulder and Scully would see something that we don't.

DOGGETT: How? Nothing here makes any sense. Unless that's the very thing that we need to see.

(DOGGETT seems to have an idea. REYES looks a little confused by what DOGGETT just said. He leaves the room. REYES follows.)

CUT TO:

(TOMMY is busy drawing another picture. It's a picture of a blonde-haired boy in a light blue shirt standing in a rowboat fishing.)

DOGGETT: Agent Harrison, you want to take Tommy up to his room?

LEYLA HARRISON: Sure. Come on, Tommy.

(JEFFREY CONLON look up. TOMMY ignores LEYLA and continues drawing. REYES moves toward TOMMY.)

REYES: What's the matter? You like Leyla, don't you?

TOMMY: Can you stay with me instead?

(TOMMY gives REYES a hug.)

REYES: Sure. Come on.

(The two leave the room. DOGGETT watches them leave. He turns to address JEFFREY CONLON.)

DOGGETT: I'm just a cop, Mr. Conlon. Maybe I don't have the imagination to connect all the pieces of this insanity together. You said that wasn't exactly the Sheriff in there and I want to know what you meant. In fact, you tried to warn us that bag of goo wasn't the sheriff. You were trying to help us.

LEYLA HARRISON: Yeah, so why not help us now? Tell us what you know, Mr. Conlon for Tommy's sake.

DOGGETT: Your son Tommy ... you move him up here in the middle of nowhere and you lock him in the room with those things. Now, if you're just trying to get rid of him is that all this is?

(JEFFREY CONLON is offended by DOGGETT'S insinuation.)

JEFFREY CONLON: I love my son. I love my son, you bastard.

DOGGETT: Well, you locked him in the room with those things.

JEFFREY CONLON: Because I knew they wouldn't hurt him.

DOGGETT: Now why is that? They hurt you they certainly hurt your wife. Why didn't they hurt Tommy?

CUT TO:

(Tommy's bedroom. TOMMY opens a dresser drawer and pulls out a stack of drawings. He gives them to REYES.)

TOMMY: I made this.

REYES: You drew all these?

(REYES goes through the drawings one by one. We don't get to see the first one. The second one is a picture of a boy in a sky blue shirt riding his scooter down the sidewalk. The third picture is of the two earwigs. The next picture is a picture of a dark-haired woman wearing black with an earwig inside her belly. TOMMY points to the picture.)

TOMMY: This one's you.

REYES: Why would you draw this, Tommy? Why would you imagine such awful things?

(TOMMY is watching REYES with eyes filled with a strange glint of anticipation. He says the words, but we no longer believe him.)

TOMMY: Because I'm afraid.

CUT TO:



SCENE 13
SHERIFF'S STATION
SOMERSET COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA

(SCULLY and GABE ROTTER enter the Sheriff's Station.)

SCULLY: Sheriff Coogan? Sheriff?

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: Are you Agent Scully?

SCULLY: Yeah. I, uh, I still can't contact my partners. Were you able to get up there?

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: I just got back from trying. The roads at that elevation are way too dangerous right now.

SCULLY: Well, Sheriff, there are three FBI agents who may be in grave danger.

GABE ROTTER: That's my girlfriend up there, Hoss.

(The Sheriff turns and points to the FAIRHOPE map hanging on the wall.)

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: This is the only road up to that mountain. We've got ice leading all the way up to the peak.

SCULLY: Well, we have to get up there. I mean, there must be a way.

SHERIFF JACK COOGAN: I'm sorry. Helicopter, snowplough or pack mule -- unfortunately, I'm fresh out of all three.

(GABE ROTTER looks at the SHERIFF, his mouth open. SCULLY has pretty much the same look on her face also.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 14

(Conlon's residence.)

LEYLA HARRISON: What if Tommy were at the center of this somehow? The monsters ... the Sheriff.

(LEYLA turns her head to indicate the body of the Sheriff on the floor.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Doggett?

(The two agents slowly walk to the empty space on the rug where the Sheriff's body was and no longer is.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Where the hell is the body?

(Off to the side, REYES makes her way down the stairs. She's in pain and clutching her stomach.)

DOGGETT: Monica, what happened?!

(DOGGETT turns toward the stairs and makes it barely in time to catch REYES as she collapses onto the ground floor.)

REYES: The boy!

(She is in pain and can barely get the words out.)

REYES: The boy, it's all him.

(DOGGETT lifts up REYES' shirt to reveal something moving around insider her abdomen. LEYLA is absolutely horrified.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Oh, my god.

(REYES continues to scream in pain. JEFFREY CONLON slowly approaches the agents. DOGGETT turns angrily to him.)

DOGGETT: Is your son doing this?!

JEFFREY CONLON: I told you. I told you to leave.

(DOGGETT gets up and grabs JEFFREY CONLON. REYES is still screaming in pain.)

DOGGETT: If this is your son, make him stop!

JEFFREY CONLON: I can't. You don't think I've tried? I can't stop him from .. from imagining things. I can't stop him from being afraid. He's just a little boy! He doesn't mean to do these things.

REYES: The hell he doesn't!

(REYES knows that TOMMY is doing these things deliberately. DOGGETT is angry at the uncontrolled son who inflicts pain and ineffective father standing before him.)

DOGGETT: If you won't stop him, I will.

(DOGGETT leaves JEFFREY CONLON and runs up the stairs to confront the child.)

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT turns the second floor corner onto the hallway. TOMMY is walking down the hallway as if he were nearby watching REYES in pain. He is about half the hallway away from DOGGETT. He turns around slowly.))

DOGGETT: Tommy? Stay right there.

(TOMMY has a grin on his face and defies DOGGETT by turning his back to him and running down the hallway back into his bedroom. DOGGETT takes off after him. TOMMY shuts the door in DOGGETT'S face. DOGGETT opens the door and enters the room across from TOMMY'S bedroom and falls down into darkness where the floor once was. DOGGETT continues to fall.)

(DOGGETT hits the floor with a loud thud. He rolls over and sees the light from the hallway through the door quite a distance above him. In the darkness around him, there is a scratching noise. All around him, giant earwigs converge upon him. Covering him completely.)

(DOGGETT yells.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 15

(Outside Conlon's residence. It's still lightly snowing outside. Icicles hang from the tree branches, the car is still parked in the driveway and REYES' cries of pain fill the air.)

CUT TO:

(Inside. REYES is screaming. LEYLA is holding REYES arms down--restraining her- preventing her from hurting herself.)

REYES: Please! Please! You have to get it out! Get it out of me!

LEYLA HARRISON: Agent Reyes, hold on. Please, hold on.

(LEYLA struggles to hold REYES down. She turns her frustration to JEFFREY CONLON who is still where DOGGETT left him.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Mr. Conlon, help us.

(JEFFREY CONLON cowers nearby. LEYLA stops and lets go restraining REYES as something happens to her eyes. She covers her eyes with the palms of both her hands. When she pulls them away, they are covered with blood. LEYLA'S eyes are bleeding.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Oh, my god!

REYES: Please!

(JEFFREY CONLON makes a decision and leaves the two women to venture upstairs where TOMMY is.)

CUT TO:

(Tommy's bedroom. TOMMY is drawing a new picture. It's a close-up of a blonde-haired woman whose eyes are bleeding.)

CUT TO: [HALLWAY]

(JEFFREY CONLON walks purposefully down the hallway toward TOMMY'S bedroom. Just as he reaches to open the door, DOGGETT appears, unharmed, and stops him.)

DOGGETT: Listen to me and listen good. These things -- these things aren't happening.

JEFFREY CONLON: What?

DOGGETT: How the hell could the it's like I've been saying all along. It's not possible.

JEFFREY CONLON: No, this is all real. My wife is dead.

DOGGETT: She believed it was real and she stabbed herself. But because I couldn't believe it ... not really ... it couldn't hurt me.

(JEFFREY CONLON realizes that his son had deliberately caused his wife's suffering that led to her death. A brief flash of anger takes hold of JEFFREY CONLON and he lunges for the doorknob to his son's bedroom. DOGGETT stops him.)

DOGGETT: Now, come on. You're going to help me.

CUT TO:

(Inside TOMMY'S bedroom, TOMMY has completely coloured LEYLA HARRISON'S eyes red. TOMMY stops drawing and looks up. All is silent.)

TOMMY: Dad? Dad!

(There is no answer.)

TOMMY: Dad, get in here!

(The house is still silent. TOMMY goes over to the window and looks outside to the grounds below. DOGGETT his helping REYES; JEFFREY CONLON is helping LEYLA. The four of them are making their way to the car and away from TOMMY.)

(TOMMY watches from the second floor window. Everyone is getting into the car. TOMMY isn't going to let them leave.)

CUT TO:

(Front yard. Both REYES and LEYLA are in the car. DOGGETT turns back toward the house. JEFFREY CONLON runs after him.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Wait. Wait ... wait a minute. Where are you going?

(DOGGETT picks up a gasoline can. He turns around and instructs JEFFREY CONLON.)

DOGGETT: You wait here.

(DOGGETT goes back into the house.)

CUT TO:

(Back inside the house. TOMMY is standing on the staircase. DOGGETT opens the gasoline can and begins pouring the liquid all over the living room.)

(TOMMY watches from above. Curious. Unafraid.)

TOMMY: What are you doing?

(DOGGETT doesn't answer him. He continues to pour the liquid from the gasoline can all over the living room floor. TOMMY walks further down the stairs.)

TOMMY: What are you doing?

DOGGETT: You're a smart boy, Tommy. What's it look like I'm doing?

TOMMY: No way.

DOGGETT: If I don't stop you, my friends are going to die.

(DOGGETT tosses the empty gasoline can aside and faces TOMMY who also reached the ground floor.)

DOGGETT: You think I'm going to let that happen?

TOMMY: You won't do it. You're lying. You'd get burned, too. You're just trying to scare me.

(DOGGETT pulls out a single match from his pocket and with a flick of his thumb, the match flares to life. DOGGETT holds the flame up in front of him for TOMMY to see.)

DOGGETT: Scared yet?

(DOGGETT throws the match to the floor igniting the liquid from the gasoline can.)

(Flames roll across the rug as the liquid catches fire and spreads rapidly around the room. Amidst it all, DOGGETT doesn't move. His angry, disapproving gaze is fixed solely on TOMMY. He shows TOMMY no fear at all as the flames rise higher and higher around them both.)

(TOMMY watches as the fire spreads from the floor rugs to the chairs, the sofa and along the floorboard behind him. TOMMY'S eyes widen as the fire spreads. He looks back at DOGGETT who hasn't taken his gaze off of TOMMY. Neither has he moved. He has no intention of leaving and makes no move to do so either. TOMMY'S eyes finally widen in fear as he realizes that the fire around him is real.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the car. LEYLA moves the towel away from her eyes. The towel isn't bloodied and neither are her eyes bleeding.)

LEYLA HARRISON: Oh, thank god.

REYES: Agent Harrison?

LEYLA HARRISON: Monica, are you all right?

REYES: Where's John?

(Both REYES and LEYLA HARRISON look out the car window. They see a Jeep cross the bridge, over the driveway and park. SCULLY and GABE ROTTER get out of the car and start running toward the house.)

CUT TO:

(Back inside the Conlon residence. GABE ROTTER bursts through the door, trips and falls on the floor hurting himself in the process.)

GABE ROTTER: Ow! Ow.

(DOGGETT gently lifts TOMMY off of the floor. Everyone walks back in to the house.)

JEFFREY CONLON: Tommy.

(DOGGETT gives TOMMY to his father who is worried about him. LEYLA HARRISON helps GABE ROTTER up off the floor. REYES walks in to the living room.)

DOGGETT: He's breathing. Passed out.

SCULLY (to JEFF CONLON): I'm a medical doctor.

(DOGGETT sees REYES and walks toward her. His eyes darting downward toward her abdomen.)

DOGGETT: You're all right?

(REYES calmly looks around the living room. She sees the empty gas can lying on the floor. The floor and carpet is soaked. A worried look crosses DOGGETT'S face. REYES kneels to examine the liquid on the floor from the gasoline tank.

REYES: Water. You filled it with water.

DOGGETT: That's not what Tommy believed.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16

(Inside the X-Files office. The camera lingers on the "I WANT TO BELIEVE" poster. LEYLA HARRISON is standing in the middle of the X-Files office staring at the poster. GABE ROTTER comes to stand next to her.)

GABE ROTTER: "I want to believe."

(A smile crosses GABE ROTTER'S face.)

GABE ROTTER: So, this is where the magic happens?

(LEYLA HARRISON smiles.)

LEYLA HARRISON: It still happens.

(LEYLA turns to look at SCULLY. SCULLY looks up at LEYLA and smiles.)

LEYLA HARRISON: I'm happy it's in good hands.

REYES: Hey.

SCULLY: Speak of the devil.

DOGGETT: That so?

GABE ROTTER: Leyla keeps going on and on about how you saved the day.

LEYLA HARRISON: I really do have to commend you, Agent Doggett. You solved this case. If it weren't for you ... I don't even like to think what would have happened. I have to say, it's clear to me now that you were better- equipped for this challenge than even Agent Mulder would have been. Absolutely. I mean your lack of imagination saved our lives.

DOGGETT: Gee, thanks.

LEYLA HARRISON: That... didn't come out right. Did it?

SCULLY: So, any news on the boy?

REYES: We just got back from the psych center. Their doctors don't quite know what to make of him. I think it goes without saying. However, they have come up with a stopgap treatment.

CUT TO:

(Inside the Psychiatric Centre. JEFFREY CONLON walks down the corridor and stops at a closed door with a window.

SCULLY (Voiceover): What's that?

DOGGETT (Voiceover): A way to stifle his imagination.

(JEFFREY CONLON looks inside. TOMMY is sitting in a recliner chair watching 30 television sets.)

[Fade to black]

SCENE 2
20 MILES WEST OF HARBOR ISLAND
BAHAMAS

(A shark swims through the clear blue waters of the Caribbean. (A pun on the title of this episode.) The GUNMEN theme plays as we reach the surface and notice a small motor launch. Inside the launch, two notebook PCs are displaying navigation and maps, a radar pinging. A young blonde, BRITTANY carries two large cocktails to the back of the boat, where we see MORRIS FLETCHER, having swapped his Black suits for a bright Hawaiian shirt. )

BRITTANY: Morris? Morris, it's going "ping!"

MORRIS: (Lewdly) Oh, it most certainly is.

MORRIS: Ping.

BRITTANY: You're gonna make me spill. Morris, what is all that stuff, anyway?

MORRIS: Now baby, don't make me talk shop. It is so boring.

BRITTANY: But I want to know.

(MORRIS takes a bottle of sun lotion and BRITTANY turns around so that MORRIS can rub it on her back.)

MORRIS: All right. where do I begin? You know we're in the Bermuda Triangle, right?

BRITTANY: Mmmm-hmmm ...

MORRIS: That place where all those planes and ships mysteriously disappeared.

BRITTANY: Mmmm-hmmm ...

MORRIS: Who do you think named it the "Bermuda Triangle"?

BRITTANY: Wait. You?

MORRIS: Yeah, that was in my former life, before I joined the private sector. There are a lot of things I can't talk about, owing to matters of National Security. But I will say this... there are powerful forces out here. Primal, other worldly forces. Hidden beneath the waves. Just waiting to be... (MORRIS smoothly unhooks her bikini top) plucked by man.

BRITTANY: Somebody's coming.

(MORRIS puts his shades on as we se anther small motor launch approaching the boat. 3 men are on board.)

MORRIS: Hey, whatever you're sellin', we don't want any, okay? No ghanga.

(As the boat pulls alongside, two of the men climb into MORRIS' boat. One grabs BRITTANY and takes her over to the other boat, whilst another gets out a silenced gun and points it at MORRIS.)

MORRIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

MORRIS: Uh... Oh, you want the girl? I... I can dig it. I'm down with that.

(One of the men grabs a gas can from the other boat and starts pouring fuel all over MORRIS' boat. MORRIS looks worried.)

MORRIS: Uh... Oh, wait, wait, wait, guys! This is a rental! There's a 15 thousand dollar deposit on this

MAN: Your employer wanted me to tell you... (He plants the gun between MORRIS' eyes. He closes his eyes and squirms.) You're fired.

(Whilst MORRIS has his eyes firmly closed, the man climbs back on board the other boat. They have BRITTANY hostage and as the boat moves away, MORRIS realises he is still alive. Once the men are about 25 feet away, one of the lights a flare and throws it back towards MORRIS' fuel-filled boat. MORRIS watches it spin through the air, landing in his boat and immediately igniting the fuel in a mass of flames. MORRIS dives overboard, seconds before the boat explodes in a fireball. After a few seconds, we begin to notice small pieces of boat floating in the sea, still alight. Papers float on the surface, showing detailed drawings of what appear to be craft. As we fade out, we notice one of the plans bears a remarkable resemblance to the circular UFOs we have seen in the series. There is still no sign of MORRIS.)



SCENE 3
U.S. COAST GUARD BASE
MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA

(Day. MORRIS FLETCHER sits alone in a room, a fan providing some form of relief to the hot air. He looks shaken, quiet. The door opens, and he turns to see DOGGETT and REYES enter the room.)

DOGGETT: Morris Fletcher?

(MORRIS soon perks up a little.)

MORRIS: Finally. What took you so long? You must be Reyes. Enchanté.

REYES: Yeah. Mr. Fletcher, we've been told you requested us by name. We're very curious about that.

MORRIS: Well, you two head the FBI's X-Files unit, do you not? I thought you'd appreciate what I have to offer.

DOGGETT: Which is?

MORRIS: You have no idea who you're sittin' here with, do you?

(MORRIS tries to impress them.)

DOGGETT: A guy who's up fudge creek for violatin' the Federal Secrets Act. How's that for starters?

MORRIS: I-I've got Top Security Clearance. I'm supposed to check-in every month with my former employer. So I skipped a few phone calls. Big deal. Let me give you a hint. I used to work at Groom Lake, Nevada. (REYES and DOGGETT make no sign of interest in this piece of information.) Area 51? I was a man in black. "The" Men in Black. What you've never heard of us?

DOGGETT: (Dryly) I saw the movie.

MORRIS: Yeah, well... there were a lot of technical inaccuracies in that thing. Anyway, I'm ready to make a deal.

DOGGETT: What deal would that be?

MORRIS: The one that saves my furry pink ass. People are tryin' to kill me. Did you hear about my boat?

REYES: Yeah. Your female companion told us what she witnessed.

MORRIS: My fem... Oh, you mean they didn't kill... (MORRIS desperately searches for her name, but doesn't make it.)

REYES: Brittany? Brittney?

MORRIS: Brittany. Oh... Oh, thank God she's still alive. Look, I need protection. I need to get out of here. You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. I can give you guys the keys to the kingdom. UFO's, aliens, the whole 50 year cover-up. I was there for all of it.

(REYES pulls some papers out of her bag, including a large crumpled piece of paper.)

REYES: Tell me, Mr. Fletcher, these documents of yours? Are they indicative of the kind of secrets you can reveal to us?

(MORRIS leans over the table, trying to prove his authority.)

MORRIS: (To REYES) Honey... they're just the tip of the iceberg.

(REYES turns around the paper to reveal a diagram of a craft.)

REYES: This is the Jupiter Two from "Lost In Space."

(MORRIS' demeanour quickly changes to defensive.)

MORRIS: Okay, yeah. Yeah, those-those-those are B.S. (Trying to save his credentials.) But only those. Yeah, I was freelancing for this foreign billionaire. I told him the Air Force lost a flying saucer in the Bermuda Triangle, and that I could recover it for him. I just wanted to cruise the Bahamas. I never would have given him the real thing. That would be un-American.

DOGGETT: Come now.

(REYES and DOGGETT look at each other and get up to leave. The are heading out the door. MORRIS gets agitated.)

MORRIS: Look, he found out about it. Now he wants to kill me. I need protection. Super Soldiers.

(DOGGETT'S head turns on the way out as he hears the word. He turns around to MORRIS. REYES enters and they close the door behind them.)

DOGGETT: What do you know about Super Soldiers?

MORRIS: A bit. It may be there's one I can help you lay your hands on.

DOGGETT: This Super Solider... he have a name?

MORRIS: Not "he".... (Pause) "She".



SCENE 4
OFFICES OF "THE LONE GUNMAN"
TAKOMA PARK, MARYLAND

(A monitor shows REYES and DOGGETT standing outside the GUNMEN'S door. They press the buzzer.)

FROHIKE: (To BYERS) What the hell do they want?

(DOGGETT thumps on the door. FROHIKE begins to unlock the 4 locks, and eventually opens the door. REYES enters, followed by DOGGETT.)

DOGGETT: Gentlemen.

REYES: What happened here? Did you get robbed?

LANGLY: No ...

FROHIKE: Uh, we're upgrading everything.

LANGLY: Yeah. We gave away all our old crap to the Salvation Army. We're buying totally new stuff.

BYERS: Well, what can we do for you, agents?

DOGGETT: Well, we were hoping you could help us out. You know that for months now, we've been investigating this secret cadre. These, uh, so-called Super Soldiers.

BYERS: Genetically altered humans.

FROHIKE: You mean the ones that want to kill Mulder.

REYES: Exactly. We'd like your help tracking one down.

DOGGETT: This woman.

(REYES gives FROHIKE a picture. It is YVES.)

REYES: Do you recognize her?

(FROHIKE passes the picture to LANGLY.)

LANGLY: She's, uh... she's a fellow hacker. Damn fine one.

BYERS: She calls herself Yves Adele Harlow. Uh, it's not her real name.

FROHIKE: Well, we never learned her real name. She disappeared a year ago and nobody's seen her since.

DOGGETT: No, we have reason to believe that she's resurfaced, and that she's become one of these Super Soldiers.

(The GUNMEN laugh at DOGGETT's suggestion.)

FROHIKE:What in the hell are you talking about? She's no Super Soldier.

BYERS: Absolutely not.

LANGLY: Not a chance. Who told you that?

(A voice suddenly interrupts the GUNMEN, coming from the doorway.)

MORRIS: This is pointless. These three monkeys couldn't find stink in an outhouse. Why are we even here?

(FROHIKE looks at MORRIS, his anger building.)

FROHIKE: (angry) You... son of a...

FROHIKE: Let me at him! I'll kill him!

(FROHIKE picks up a putter and holds it up, threatening MORRIS. FROHIKE lunges towards MORRIS, but DOGGETT grabs the putter, halting his attempt. LANGLY is also angry.

LANGLY: I'll hold him down!

REYES: Whoa, fellas.

BYERS: You got a nerve coming here.

FROHIKE: You little son of a bitch!

MORRIS: Told you they wouldn't help.

DOGGETT: All right, everybody just shut up.

BYERS: This man is a professional liar. every word out of his mouth.

LANGLY: He's a scam artist. He used us to track Yves down a year ago.

FROHIKE: And then he abducted her.

MORRIS: Which is why I know what happened to her. (MORRIS clears his throat.) I facilitated a meeting, is all. The man I was working for, I didn't know in advance what he was planning to do to her. Not my finest hour. I'll admit it.

BYERS: every word out of his mouth.

MORRIS: Agents, I'm tellin' ya, you don't want these three involved. I mean, they don't even have their ridiculous tinker toy gizmos. This place is like "How The Grinch Stole Radio Shack."

DOGGETT: All right, you three know this woman, I want your help. We need to track down this Yves Adele Harlow.

(The GUNMEN pay attention to DOGGETT'S request.)



SCENE 5
HARTWELL COLLEGE
KEARNY, NEW JERSEY

(Night. The silhouette of a woman, whom can tell is YVES, appears behind the frosted glass of a corridor door. She opens the door and proceeds to a door, marked "PROFESSOR HOUGHTON". YVES makes sure no-one has followed her before entering. PROFESSOR HOUGHTON, a bearded man in his 40's, doesn't look up from his paperwork as he speaks.)

PROFESSOR HOUGHTON: Knock, please.

(YVES enters, closing the door behind her. PROFESSOR HOUGHTON looks up, somewhat taken aback.)

PROFESSOR HOUGHTON: Oh. My office hours are three to five, Mondays and Fridays.

YVES: You'll make time for me, Professor.

(YVES reaches into her jeans and pulls out a dart gun. She aims it at a startled PROFESSOR HOUGHTON, and fires.)

(Later.)

(A man wearing a dark suit enters the corridor and makes his way to PROFESSOR HOUGHTON'S office. It is PROFESSOR GILLNITZ, who appears to be a similar age to PROFESSOR HOUGHTON. He knocks on PROFESSOR HOUGHTON'S door, calling through the door.)

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Douglas, are you ready to go? Douglas?

(Hearing no response, he takes a key out of his pocket and unlocks the door. He enters and immediately notices the window at the back of the room open, the blinds twisted. He walks to the window, looking out of it. He sees YVES, running across the campus away from the window. PROFESSOR GILLNITZ turns away from the window, and checks the rest of the room. He notices off to one side, and investigates. He finds PROFESSOR HOUGHTON, dead on the floor. He is laying on his back, his shirt ripped open, and a large bloodsoaked wound in his chest.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 6

(Back at Gunmen HQ. LANGLY, wearing a Joey Ramone t-shirt, is sat at a computer. FROHIKE and BYERS lean beside him.)

LANGLY: Airline reservation database. What name do we look under?

BYERS: Try her old stand-by. Different anagrams of Lee Harvey Oswald.

(MORRIS appears from the back of the room, reading an old issue of The Lone Gunman.)

MORRIS: "Area 51 Exposé!" Ooo! Where's your new issue? This one's a year old.

FROHIKE: Back off, Skeezick.

MORRIS: You'll never find her that way.

LANGLY: He's right. No anagrams for Yves Adele Harlow.

(The search software running on LANGLY'S computer fails to give any results.)

MORRIS: So, who's Joey?

(MORRIS has noticed LANGLY'S t-shirt.)

LANGLY: What? Joey Ramone? Leader of the greatest punk rock band in human history. Now shut up!

(LANGLY notices MORRIS taking a little too much interest in him.)

LANGLY: What?

MORRIS: (Sigh) What are you, 34, 35? Why don't you cut your hair and grow up, huh?

LANGLY: I need to remind you, Fletcher, that Doggett and Reyes aren't here to save you.

MORRIS: Get yourself a real hero, anyway. Not some dead teeny bopper.

(LANGLY throws down his keyboard and gets up, walking over to where MORRIS is sitting.)

LANGLY: You want to know why Joey Ramone's my hero? 'Cause people like you never managed to grind him down. They never stole his spirit. He never gave in, never gave up, and never sold out. Right till his last breath. And he's not dead. Guys like that? They live forever.

BYERS: (From the background) Langly? Just ignore him.

(MORRIS sighs again.)

MORRIS: Look, if we have to work together, let's work together.

FROHIKE: We don't have to work together.

MORRIS: Watching you three try and find your butts with both hands is not my idea of a fun time. Now, wouldn't it be easier tracking Yves if you knew her real name?

BYERS: You know her real name?

MORRIS: Lois Runtz.

BYERS: (Laugh) Lois Runtz. Uh-huh.

MORRIS: I'm telling you the truth, boys.

FROHIKE: Well, if you were, it'd be a first.

(They suddenly hear a knock coming from the wall. They look around.)

BYERS: Nobody knows about that door. That's our secret door.

MORRIS: Does Lois know about it? Yves?

(FROHIKE picks up the putter he tried to attack MORRIS with earlier, whilst they open the secret door. It slowly opens, and JIMYY slowly appears from the darkness. He leans against the doorway, looking clearly exhausted.)

BYERS: Jimmy?

JIMMY: Guys...

(JIMMY collapses onto the floor in front of the doorway.)

(Later. LANGLY changes the cold cloth on JIMMY's forehead. He is lying on the couch, recovering.)

LANGLY: Jimmy? How you feelin', man?

MORRIS: Oh, right. The old errand boy. The guy used to intern for you losers, right? I wondered what happened to you.

(JIMMY looks over to MORRIS.)

JIMMY: Why is he here?

BYERS: FBI business. It's a long story.

FROHIKE: Where the hell ya been, big guy?

JIMMY: Zurich. I was in Malta. And Yemen. And just now, New Jersey. It's been a rough geology lesson. I ran out of money, so I hitch-hiked here. I snuck in the back, 'cause I didn't know if the place was being watched. (JIMMY sits up.) I just had to see you guys. It's about Lois. Lois Runtz - that's Yves' real name.

MORRIS: I told ya so. Hey, wait a minute. You tracked her all over the world? You? Mr. Brain Power here is lucky to be alive. Why did you send him? Were you tryin' to get him killed?

LANGLY: He sent himself to find Yves. We tried to talk him out of it.

JIMMY: Now I almost wish you had.

(JIMMY leans forward, looking pained.)

BYERS: Jimmy, what is it? Are you all right?

JIMMY: Last night... I traced her to a little college in New Jersey. It's the closest I've been... been in a year of searching. I saw her. I actually laid my eyes on her. I called to her. But she ran. Later on, I... I found out. Guys? I think she murdered somebody.



SCENE 7

(YVES is inside what looks like a boiler room. She opens the furnace door, and reaches into her backpack. She takes out a respirator and puts it on, covering her mouth and nose. She then takes out a clear plastic bag, containing a square object, roughly three inches across, and tosses it into the furnace. She waits for it to burn, before taking off her respirator)

YVES: One down.



SCENE 8
HARTWELL COLLEGE
KEARNY, NEW JERSEY

(REYES and DOGGETT enter through a doorway and walk down the corridor, passing a large fishtank containing beautiful shark swimming around. At the end of the corridor, we notice PROFESSOR GILLNITZ sitting on a bench against the wall.)

REYES: John Gillnitz? I'm Agent Reyes, and this is Agent Doggett. Is this the woman you saw last night?

(REYES hands him the picture of YVES.)

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Uh... it was dark, uh... it could have been her. Do you have her in custody?

DOGGETT: We're workin' on it. Sir, what can you tell us about your friend? Do you have any reason why he may have been targeted?

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Absolutely none. Douglas was a wonderful teacher, and an even better researcher.

REYES: What did he research?

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Elasmo Bronchi. Sharks, rays and skates.

REYES: He was a marine biologist?

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: An immunologist. Sharks have a remarkable immune system. Toxins that would kill nearly any other vertebrate pass right through them.

DOGGETT: So he did medical research?

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Douglas wanted to save the world.

(Beat. DOGGETT and REYES look at each other.)



SCENE 9

(Back in Gunmen HQ, the GUNMEN and MORRIS have been joined by nerd friend and hacker KIMMY.)

MORRIS: Cheer up, Gomer. You're bringin' the whole room down.

KIMMY: This is a computer, Langly. Com-pu-ter. Step away before you embarrass yourself.

LANGLY: Always a pleasure, Kimmy.

KIMMY: Yeah, yeah! So then, how do you wish to partake... of my hacking genius?

FROHIKE: Well, thanks to Jimmy, we know Yves' real name.

MORRIS: Hey, I told ya before he did.

LANGLY: Jimmy also told us what kind of car she's driving. Silver X5 with New York plates.

KIMMY: Really? Way to go, Special Ed.

BYERS: The New Jersey Turnpike has video cameras at every toll booth. Langly hacked the system and spotted her southbound at Newark.

KIMMY: Somewhat creative.

(LANGLY brings up a series of still short showing a tunnel and a car passing through it.)

LANGLY: We spotted her again going through the Fort McHenry Tunnel. She passed through not 20 minutes ago.

BYERS: We're betting she's headed for D.C. We're going to try to intercept her, with your help.."

FROHIKE: Think you might find a military satellite you could piggy back? Give us a bird's-eye view of the beltway?

KIMMY: Intriguing. Stand aside, ladies.

(KIMMY cracks his knuckles and starts typing.)

FROHIKE: We'll be on the cell.

MORRIS: I got shotgun.

LANGLY: Dream on. You're staying here.

(BYERS turns to JIMMY as he leaves.)

BYERS: We need somebody we can trust keeping an eye on Fletcher.

JIMMY: (Smiling at BYERS.) I'm on it.

(BYERS leaves, closing the door behind him. JIMMY turns to MORRIS, who tries to start up a conversation.)

MORRIS: So, how'd you like Malta?



SCENE 10
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE
NEWARK, NEW JERSEY

(The MEDICAL EXAMINER examiner enters the autopsy room, followed by DOGGETT and REYES. They walk over to a trolley, upon which lies a body covered by a sheet. The MEDICAL EXAMINER pulls it back to reveal PROFESSOR HOUGHTON. We can see the large wound in the centre of his chest.)

MEDICAL EXAMINER: The only thing I can't say for sure is what killed him. He was injected with some sort of tiny poisoned pellet. But the wound in his chest? Was post-mortem.

(DOGGETT looks at the wound. It is pinkish in colour.)

DOGGETT: What is that?

MEDICAL EXAMINER: That's what I said. My best guess is bioluminescence, but, uh, I'm still waitin' to hear back from our lab.

REYES: Bioluminescence? As in the stuff that makes lightning bugs glow?

MEDICAL EXAMINER: Lightning bugs, plankton, jellyfish. But, uh, generally not dead college professors.

DOGGETT: So what, this stuff was put on post-mortem?

MEDICAL EXAMINER: No. As near as I can tell, it bleed out of him. (Beat) it gets weirder still. When I opened him up, I found adhesions that indicate past surgery, so I'm figuring I'll find he had a bypass or a pacemaker. Instead, I find... this.

(He picks up a metal tray, upon which lies a white piece of tissue.)

REYES: Looks like cartilage.

MEDICAL EXAMINER: It is. It was living tissue grafted into him. I have absolutely no idea why.

(Wearing a surgical glove, DOGGETT picks up the piece of tissue in his hand and looks at it. He holds it so that it forms what looks like an open envelope, with a central cavity.)

DOGGETT: Look, it held something. Something that's now missing. Could that be the purpose of this wound? A little ad hoc surgery?

REYES: Maybe that was the very purpose of the murder. Whatever was inside him, she removed it.

DOGGETT: What the hell was inside him?

(CUT TO:)



SCENE 11

(REYES and DOGGETT are standing in the Gunmen HQ.)

MORRIS: I have no clue. Seriously, this is the first time hearing of it. Weird organs? I don't know what to tell you.

REYES: You've never heard of the man? Professor Douglas Houghton?

MORRIS: (Beat) You're looking at me oddly.

DOGGETT: Perhaps because you've been known to lie on occasion.

(JIMMY stands over MORRIS, intimidating him.)

MORRIS: Well I'm not lying now. I've said from the start, I didn't know what she was up to.

(KIMMY cries out from the background, hitting the keyboard in disgust.)

KIMMY: Dammit! Crashed again! I cannot make magic with sub-standard equipment.

DOGGETT: What's the problem?

KIMMY: The problem is... it's a freakin' piece of junk! I knew those guys were broke, but this is pathetic.

(REYES and DOGGETT share a look.)

REYES: The guys are broke?

KIMMY: Are you kidding? Look around this dump. They had to hock all their stuff just to pay the rent.

MORRIS: What about this?

KIMMY: Oh, their "paper"? Deader than disco. They haven't published in months.

(MORRIS picks up the latest issue, the headline is "DOUBLE AGENT CAPTURED - CAP'N TOBY VINDICATED"

MORRIS: (Chuckle) So saving the world doesn't pay the bills. There's a hot news flash for ya, huh? (chuckles) What chumps.

JIMMY: They were gettin' by all right, till you put 'em out of business.

MORRIS: Oh. And how exactly did I do that?

JIMMY: When you took Yves. They spent every last dime trying to find her. They're loyal to their friends. Hilarious, huh?

(REYES cell phone rings. She picks it up and answers.)

REYES: Reyes.

BYERS: (On phone) You'd better get here quick.

REYES: (into phone) Where are you?

BYERS: (into phone) The Hotel Farragut. Hurry.

(CUT TO:)

(Hotel Farragut. BYERS and FROHIKE are peering around a corridor using a small mirror on the end of a metal rod. We see YVES crouching behind a laundry trolley further down the corridor. FROHIKE takes another look in the mirror. A man, LEONARD SOUTHHALL, approaches the trolley from the other side, and enters a hotel room before passing the trolley. After he has entered, YVES gets up and approaches the door.)

FROHIKE: She's gonna kill that guy.

BYERS: Doggett and Reyes are on their way.

(BYERS, LANGLY and FROHIKE all peer around the corner as YVES enters the room.)

LANGLY: By then it'll be too late.

(YVES quietly enters the room, but the man she is following is nowhere to be seen. She hears him in the bathroom and quickly hides behind a door as her enters the bedroom. She is armed with the same dart gun she used against PROFESSOR HOUGHTON. At the same time, the GUNMEN burst in, startling the man.)

FROHIKE: Yves! Don't do it!

(LEONARD SOUTHHALL sees YVES hiding behind the door, and pushes the door into her, knocking her to the ground. He forces his way past the GUNMEN and out into the corridor. The GUNMEN recover. YVES is lying unconscious on the floor, her gun beside her.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 12

(Later in the hotel room. BYERS, LANGLY and FROHIKE are sitting near the window. JIMMY is sitting on the end of the bed, next to a now conscious YVES.)

JIMMY: Lois? Should I call you that?

YVES: I prefer Yves.

LANGLY: So... we take it you're not a Super Soldier?

YVES: Super what?

BYERS: Long story. Never mind.

FROHIKE: You weren't seriously gonna smoke that guy, were you?

YVES: I know you three mean well. But I can't begin to tell you how badly you've mucked things up.

(DOGGETT and REYES enter through a door.)

DOGGETT: So, this guy just up and bolted?

LANGLY: He hit her, and then he took off.

REYES: Nobody's seen him. The room is registered to one Leonard Southhall of Darrian, Connecticut.

YVES: It's an alias.

DOGGETT: It's a stolen ID. The real Leonard Southhall died in 1996. You want to tell me who that was?

YVES: His real name? I have no idea.

(DOGGETT picks up YVES' backpack and empties it onto the desk.)

DOGGETT: This is your bag, isn't it? That was quite a party you got planned for him. Respirator. Surgical gloves. Scalpel. (DOGGETT holds up YVES' dart gun.) Not to mention this little item here.

REYES: You were planning to cut him open, Ms. Runtz, just like you did the professor. Why?

JIMMY: It can't be true. Tell 'em it's not.

YVES: It is, Jimmy. Time is running short. Unless you let me finish what I started, innocent people will die.

DOGGETT: You want to elaborate on that?

YVES: First things first. Who was it that put you on to me?

(CUT TO:)



SCENE 13

(Gunmen HQ. MORRIS' head is pushed down onto the desk forcefully.)

MORRIS: Okay, guys. So she's not a Super Soldier. I made an honest mistake.

(YVES peels off the plaster on MORRIS' face. Under the gauze we can see a square miniature circuit board.)

YVES: As I suspected. It's a tracking device. I'm sure he meant to activate it, once he knew you had me.

(DOGGETT and REYES examine the device.)

DOGGETT: You've been wearin' that since Miami. You were runnin' a scam on us from the start.

REYES: Blowing up the boat, the girl as your witness. You planned all that.

(MORRIS smiles.)

DOGGETT: That and all the Super Soldier bull. All that was just to hook us.

BYERS: So that you two would, in turn, hook us.

FROHIKE: And we'd track down Yves for this slimeball all over again.

(MORRIS is now grinning like a fox.)

MORRIS: Well, what can I tell you? You three always get the job done for me.

DOGGETT: Who do you work for, Fletcher?

(MORRIS nods to YVES.)

YVES: An international arms dealer. A billionaire. And scum of the earth.

MORRIS: And... he's also...

YVES: My father. My father is a murderer, and a supporter of terrorism. I hate everything he stands for.

JIMMY: Yves? You're a murderer, too.

YVES: The man I killed was a terrorist, Jimmy. A zealot whose research was funded by my father for its potential as a weapons system.

REYES: Houghton was an immunologist, doing research on sharks.

YVES: Yes. And he used his knowledge of their immune system to devise a vessel of sorts. One that kept him safe from an engineered virus that he carried within him.

DOGGETT: This man had living tissue implanted in his chest.

REYES: Cartilage. Shark cartilage. It contained something which you removed.

DOGGETT: That was this virus you're talkin' about?

YVES: I destroyed it, but it was only one of two.

LANGLY: Oh, man. The bald dude at the hotel. The one that got away.

YVES: Think of him as a human time bomb. He can pass by any sniff dog, any metal detector, and no one would ever suspect.

BYERS: What triggers this time bomb?

YVES: Programmed cellular death. Genetically altered to a high degree of precision. The way the vessel is decaying inside of him is virtually clock-like. It will lose integrity and rupture at eight o'clock... tonight.

KIMMY: Five hours from now?

YVES: This virus, once it's airborne, its kill radius is five or six miles, depending on the winds. Potentially, it could kill thousands. Tens of thousands.

FROHIKE: Fletcher, I knew you were a dirt bag, but still... how could you be a party to this?

YVES: Fletcher's a con-man, not a killer. He didn't know about it.

(DOGGETT looks worried.)

DOGGETT: Providing all this is true, how do we track this man down?

(Later. Everyone is grouped around KIMMY, who is sitting at the computer. Some mapping software is running. KIMMY starts to zoom in on the map.)

LANGLY: Kimmy, zoom in more. Zoom in!

KIMMY: Back off, kibitzer! I'm doin' it! This thing is slower than Stumpy, my one-legged Granny. Where did you get this dinosaur turd?

JIMMY: Stop bellyachin' and work.

(FROHIKE takes a drag on a cigarette.)

MORRIS: Those things'll kill ya, ya know?

FROHIKE: That's why I quit 20 years ago. You want one?

MORRIS: (Sigh) So, you're too broke to publish, huh? Pencil neck told me. It's a shame. This little rag always was such a hoot. I'm gonna miss it. But, hey, the world spins on, right? Maybe saving it is a younger man's game. Or a woman's.

(FROHIKE thinks about MORRIS' words.)

FROHIKE: Maybe it is. You gotta admit, Byers. It hasn't exactly been our year. And to top it all off, we screwed the pooch pretty good today. Maybe we should pack it in.

BYERS: And do what instead? We never gave up. We never will. In the end, if that's the best they can say about us, ... it'll do.

LANGLY: I got him!

KIMMY: Hey, it's my hack, Langly. I got him.

LANGLY: We got him, all right? Our bad guy just rented a blue Corolla under his alias Leonard Southhall. We just picked him up on Kimmy's satellite.

LANGLY: Haulin' north like a bat out of hell.

KIMMY: New Jersey Turnpike, 30 miles south of Newark.

YVES: I think I know where he's headed.



SCENE 14
HARTWELL COLLEGE
KEARNY, NEW JERSEY

(The balding man enters the College and walks down the corridor. He turns a corner, only to find it blocked by plastic sheeting from floor to ceiling. Men in full HAZMAT suits are stapling the sheeting to the walls. He turns around, perturbed, only to find the corridor in the other direction also blocked by sheeting. He turns back to go the way he came. Two men in HAZMAT suits appear ahead of him and walk towards him.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 15

(Gunmen HQ. BYERS' cell phone rings.)

BYERS: Lone Gunman Newspaper Group. Byers speaking.

DOGGETT: Byers? John Doggett.

BYERS: Agent Doggett. Do you have him?

(DOGGETT is with the man in a hospital room. MRI and CT scans are displayed on light boxes. The man is being contained in a sealed area around his bed, clear plastic sheeting hanging from floor to ceiling. DOGGETT looks at him.)

DOGGETT: Oh yeah, we got him. Listen, how much do you trust this Yves Harlow, Lois Runtz, whatever name she's tellin' you?

BYERS: Completely. Why?

DOGGETT: Because the doctors here have run every kind of imaging on this guy, Southhall, and come up snake eyes. No virus, no cartilage vessel in his chest, nothin'.

(BYERS tells YVES the news.)

BYERS: They found nothing.

YVES: That doesn't make sense.

(BYERS checks again with DOGGETT at the hospital.)

BYERS: They're absolutely certain?

DOGGETT: One hundred percent. Agent Reyes and I are lookin' like a couple of fools on this one.

BYERS: There must be something we missed.

DOGGETT: All I can tell you is, we got the wrong guy.

(YVES tries to make sense of DOGGETT'S information.)

YVES: There must be a second man. I know there is. It's Basic Terrorism 101.

LANGLY: Except we don't know his name, and we don't know his target.

JIMMY: And we've got one hour to find him.

(They look at the clock on the wall. It is 6:58 PM.)



SCENE 16
INTERNATIONAL BIOETHICS FORUM
EVENING SESSION 7:00 PM

(The entrance hall is filled with academics, getting ready for the forum. A table contains an array of ID cards for the attendees. We see a man take a card from the table and walk away. It is PROFESSOR GILLNITZ. He walks towards a GUARD who is using a hand-held scanner to check for weapons. He scans PROFESSOR GILLNITZ. Nothing happens as he passes the baton over his body.)

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Good Evening.

SECURITY GUARD: You're good.

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ walks off into the forum.)



SCENE 17

(Gunmen HQ. The clock on the wall is now reading 7:04 PM.)

YVES: All my information pointed to that man, Leonard Southhall. He goes by an alias, he traveled to Washington on this very day.

BYERS: Clearly, he's involved somehow.

JIMMY: He must be. He made a beeline right back to that biology department where the dead Professor worked.

FROHIKE: Their base of operation.

LANGLY: Yeah. So if Southhall is involved, and yet he doesn't have the virus inside of him...?

YVES: So how exactly does he fit into their plan?

MORRIS: Three card Monty. You ever played it? You have now.

FROHIKE: What's that supposed to mean?

MORRIS: It means these guys have you running after the Ace, when you should be chasing the Queen.

(Shocked, YVES immediately realises what MORRIS means.)

YVES: Oh, my God. Southhall is the decoy. That's all he is.

MORRIS: They knew that you were hot on their trail, so they gave you someone else to follow.

JIMMY: I thought you said you didn't know anything about terrorists?

MORRIS: I don't. But boy, do I know scams. I wasn't a Man in Black all those years for nothing. They made you work at finding Southhall. Which tells me the real guy is hiding in plain sight. Right out in the open.

FROHIKE: A friend of the dead Professor. A co-worker maybe.."

YVES: The man who saw me through the Professor's window. The one who identified me.



SCENE 18
INTERNATIONAL BIOETHICS FORUM

(The forum SPEAKER is making his introductions. The clock behind him reads 7:55 PM. The camera pans to reveal rows of tables, at which sit the conference delegates. A large video screen is to one side of the hall.)

SPEAKER: (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, scientists, academic leaders and government representatives, coming together is our goal this Evening. Coming together as one. Those words are easily spoken, but guiding our missile into that fugitive and vulnerable target, is hard.

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ is sitting at one of the tables. He looks around anxiously.)

(Outside in the foyer, BYERS, FROHIKE, LANGLY, JIMMY and YVES race in and head for the conference hall. The SECURITY GUARD blocks their path.)

SECURITY GUARD: Sorry. Conference attendees only.

BYERS: We're reporters.

SECURITY GUARD: What newspaper do you work for?

BYERS: Uh... uh... The Lone Gunman.

(BYERS holds up his Press Pass.)

SECURITY GUARD: Never heard of it.

LANGLY: We're legit, man.

FROHIKE: Come on. Come on. Passes. Show 'em your Press Pass.

YVES: Sir, it's desperately important that we get in there.

JIMMY: Yeah, buddy, come on.

SECURITY GUARD: These expired last December.

YVES: We've got five minutes.

BYERS: Listen to me. We believe there's a dangerous man in that room.

SECURITY GUARD: Folks, I need all of you to step away, right now.

LANGLY: Look, thousands of people may die.

(The GUARD talks into his radio.)

SECURITY GUARD: Mike? I got a situation over by the main conference room.

(JIMMY takes matters into his hands, shouting toward the assembled conference.)

JIMMY: (Yelling) John Gillnitz! John Gillnitz!."

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ gets up and looks around nervously.)

SECURITY GUARD: Step back, sir.

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ hastily exits the hall through an exit behind the SPEAKER. LANGLY spots a gap and chases after him. JIMMY stands in front of the GUARD.)

JIMMY: I'm really sorry.

(He grabs his waist and headbutts him on the forehead, knocking him to the ground. Way to go!)

(Their path now clear, they quickly make their way for the exit through which PROFESSOR GILLNITZ escaped. They arrive in a darkened corridor, but their is no sign of PROFESSOR GILLNITZ.)

JIMMY: (Looking around) Where'd he go?

YVES: Split up. Four minutes left. Good luck.

(LANGLY checks his watch. YVES and JIMMY split off from the group, leaving the GUNMEN behind.)

FROHIKE: Hey, wait! What'll we do with this guy once we find him?

YVES: Hold him till I get there. I'll do the rest.

(LANGLY is )

LANGLY: You mean cut him open?

YVES: If that virus gets into the air stream, we'll have failed. People will die. Whatever it takes...

(They split up, YVES and JIMMY head off one way, and the GUNMEN set off in the other. As they race down the corridor, a they hear a door swing closed.)

BYERS: Three minutes and counting.

(They run off along the corridor. They check all the doors for any sign of PROFESSOR GILLNITZ, but do not find him. They hear banging up ahead. PROFESSOR GILLNITZ is trying to break his way through a locked door. Unsuccessful, he turns around and runs back down the corridor, just a the GUNMEN appear. He runs towards them, then stops.)

BYERS: Don't try to run.

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ smiles, resting his hands on his hips. He looks as though he will finally get a chance to complete his mission.)

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: I don't have to.

(LANGLY calls to YVES and JIMMY to let them know of the situation.)

LANGLY: Yves, Jimmy, we found him!

FROHIKE: Over here!

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: What do you plan to do? By my watch, it's two minuets to eight. (LANGLY checks his watch.) Not much time for surgery.

(In desperation, BYERS turns and calls out again)

BYERS: Yves! Jimmy!

(Grinning at them in their time of desperation, PROFESSOR GILLNITZ checks the time on his watch.)

PROFESSOR GILLNITZ: Now you have a minute forty.

(The GUNMEN stand there for a moment, contemplating their options. FROHIKE notices a fire alarm switch on the wall. He turns to the others, signalling his intention.)

FROHIKE: Guys?

(LANGLY and BYERS look at the fire alarm, then at each other. In silence, they both agree with FROHIKE'S suggested course of action.)

BYERS: Whatever it takes.

(PROFESSOR GILLNITZ stands in silence, waiting for their next move. FROHIKE looks back at him, before reaching for the switch, activating the fire alarm. The siren sounds.)

(Suddenly, thick fire doors descend from the ceiling, completely blocking off the exits in the corridor. PROFESSOR GILLNITZ looks on in shock, realising what they have done. He races over to one of the closing doors, but it reaches the ground before he can get to it. His plan is now thwarted. The corridor is now airtight, and the GUNMEN are trapped inside.)

(GILLNITZ looks out of a window in the door. BYERS, LANGLY and FROHIKE are standing in the background, silent. We hear a voice coming from around the corner.)

JIMMY: Byers! Frohike! Langly!

(JIMMY and YVES race around the corner, YVES heading off in the other direction as JIMMY turns towards the closed off section of corridor. He runs up to the door, peering in through the window. He calls out to YVES, who has now disappeared around a corner further up the corridor.)

JIMMY: Yves, come here!

(JIMMY checks the window again. He sees the GUNMEN trapped in the back. YVES races down the corridor to join him. JIMMY calls to them through the door.)

JIMMY: Guys!! Guys!!

(The GUNMEN stand motionless as they see JIMMY through the glass. They look down at PROFESSOR GILLNITZ. He is convulsing on the floor. A strange, pink liquid stains his shirt, and a pool of the liquid is collecting around his mouth on the floor. JIMMY sees this from behind the glass and cries out.)

JIMMY: Oh god, no!!

(JIMMY tries to use all his strength to open the massive firedoor, but cannot lift it. The GUNMEN see him trying, and race over to the door.)

BYERS: Don't, Jimmy!

YVES: Don't. It's too late. They're already exposed.

(JIMMY is totally devastated, and starts to break down in tears. So soon after making such great friends with the GUNMEN, the realisation he may lose them begins to dawn on him.)

JIMMY: No, guys.

(Instinctively, JIMMY places his hand on the glass, in a final act of friendship. BYERS does the same on the other side of the glass. LANGLY and FROHIKE add their hands to BYERS'. The camera now pans across the faces of FROHIKE, LANGLY and BYERS in turn, as each of them communicate their last words to JIMMY and YVES.)

FROHIKE: Why do you fight the good fight?

LANGLY: Both of you.

BYERS: Never give up.

(JIMMY is in tears. They stand there in silence, motionless.)

(Fade to white.)



SCENE 19
ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY

(We fade in to a beautiful blue, cloudless sky overhead. The camera slowly pans down, to reveal row upon row of perfectly aligned headstones, commemorating those laid to rest in the Cemetery. An old man is slowly folding away the chairs that have just been used during the funeral service.)

(Three identical coffins rest on the ground in front of the remaining chairs. KIMMY stands next to them, paying his final respects to his fallen heroes. He stares down at the coffins in silence.)

KIMMY: in Spanish) Vayo con dios, amigos.

(He walks over to the coffins, and touches each of them in turn, before heading off.)

(AGENTS DOGGETT, REYES, and SKINNER are standing in a line opposite where KIMMY was standing. DOGGETT looks over to SKINNER.)

DOGGETT: Arlington. You must have pulled some big strings to get those guys in here.

SKINNER: It's the least I could do.

(SKINNER turns and leaves. REYES turns to DOGGETT.)

REYES: Are you ready?

DOGGETT: Yeah.

(SCULLY is standing with YVES and JIMMY, who is holding three folder American flags, one for each of our fallen heroes. SKINNER pauses as he passes SCULLY.)

SKINNER: Dana?

SCULLY: I'll catch up. (SKINNER heads off, following REYES and DOGGETT.) They meant so much to me. I'm not sure if they ever really knew.

JIMMY: Nobody knew... what heroes they were.

(YVES still can't believe how things have turned out.)

YVES: It's not right. It's not.

(MORRIS approaches from the background. He remembers what LANGLY had told him about JOEY RAMONE earlier in the episode.)

MORRIS: No, it's not. Langly said to me, "The ones who never give up, they never die."

(MORRIS pauses.)

MORRIS: I still don't know what that means.

SCULLY: It means that, like everyone buried here, the world is a better place for them having been in it. (She pauses.) It means that they're gone... but they live on through us all.

(JIMMY is noticeably moved by SCULLY'S tribute to the GUNMEN. He comforts YVES, putting his arm around her. The four of them stand there in silence, as the camera pans up and away.)

[Fade to black]

SCENE 1

(The Wyoming state flag - a blue flag with red and white borders and a white Buffalo in the middle -- waves in the wind. It's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the sky is blue and the grass is green.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the house, a man is painting a wooden buffalo carved figure white. He glances up. His wife is sweeping the floor by the doorway.

MR. VAN DE KAMP: Easy there, hon. You're cleaning so hard I'm afraid you're going to stick the dog in the dishwasher.

(She stops sweeping. The man looks up and sees his wife just standing there with the broom in her hands looking down at the floor. He stops what he's doing and gets up.)

MR. VAN DE KAMP: Hey. Come on, now. Quit it. This is what we dreamed about. What we prayed for

MRS. VAN DE KAMP: I know. I'm sorry.

(She sighs.)

MRS. VAN DE KAMP: I just can't stop wondering why. Why give up a child? Give it up to strangers?

MR. VAN DE KAMP: God has his reasons and his ways.

(They kiss. In the background, the sound of a car driving up the road interrupts them. The car parks.)

SOCIAL WORKER 1: Mr. and Mrs. Van de Kamp. Hi. This was so hard to find.

(Two female social workers get out of the car. The first social worker holds a folder in her hands. The second social worker is getting the baby out of the car.)

SOCIAL WORKER 1: I'm so sorry but there's a page here that didn't get signed. If I can just get you to do that now. Here we go. Okay. Right there.

(The first Social Worker hands the papers to Mr. Van de Kamp to sign. Mrs. Van de Kamp has her attention on the car.)

SOCIAL WORKER: Thanks.

MRS. VAN DE KAMP: I keep asking myself a question. I know there's been a medical exam ... but are you sure he's okay?

MR. VAN DE KAMP: Now, honey.

MRS. VAN DE KAMP: Why would the mother give him up?

SOCIAL WORKER 1: You should understand ... this was a life choice by a single mother and a terribly difficult decision for her. But I can say it was only for the good of the child.

(This answer seems to satisfy Mrs. Van de Kamp for the moment. She nods. The second social worker appears holding William. She gives the baby to Mrs. Van De Kamp. William is wearing his blue stars and moon bunny ears hat.

SOCIAL WORKER: I want you to meet William.

GEORGETOWN
10:55 PM
ONE WEEK EARLIER

(SCULLY drives up in front of her apartment building. She parks her car. She's singing softly to WILLIAM who is in his carseat in the back of the car.)

SCULLY (singing softly): William was a bullfrog. ... was a good friend of mine. ... never understood a single word he said ...

(SCULLY gets out of the car as she's done so many times before and moves to the back to get WILLIAM.

(Off across the street in the shadows, there is a figure watching her. The person has difficulty breathing.)

SCULLY (singing): ...and it must have been some mighty fine wine. ... joy to the world. All the boys and girls. Joy to the fishes ...

(SCULLY gets WILLIAM out of the car. He's wearing a blue stars and moons bunny hears hat and is sucking on his pacifier. Behind her a faint clattering interrupts her singing. SCULLY turns around and doesn't see anything.)

SCULLY (singing): ...in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me. If I were the king of the world, I tell you what I'd do ...

(The figure watches from a safe distance away as SCULLY turns on her car alarm and goes into her apartment.)

SCENE 3
FBI HEADQUARTERS
11:21 PM

(It's late. DOGGETT is in the office. He's reading a file and doing push ups on the office floor. There's a coffee cup and some empty Chinese take-out containers on the floor behind him.)

DOGGETT: 1,492. ... 1,493 ... 20.

(DOGGETT finishes his push ups and collapses on the floor and rolls onto his back. He's tired. He glances at his watch.)

DOGGETT: They don't pay me enough.

(Deciding that its late enough, DOGGETT gets up and leaves the office. He turns the lights off behind him. His jacket in hand, he makes his way to the elevator, unrolling his shirt-sleeves as he goes.)

(In the darkness of the corridor, a figure wearing red tennis shoes slips into the office. He shuts the door quietly, pulls out a flashlight and begins going through the files. He's looking for something)

CUT TO:

(The elevator dings and the doors open. DOGGETT exits and begins walking down the hallway. He stops, pats his pockets as if he's forgotten something, turns around and runs to catch the elevator before the doors closes.)

CUT TO:

(The elevator dings and the doors open to the basement office. DOGGETT opens the office door, doesn't bother turning on the lights and walks in to the office. He looks down on the floor and the file he was reading is still there. Opened. He reaches over to pick it up. Behind him, the figure of a man appears. DOGGETT doesn't sense anyone behind him.)

(The intruder hits DOGGETT from behind. DOGGETT crumples to the floor. The man gives DOGGETT some good kicks before running out the door.)

(DOGGETT gets up and follows in pursuit. He pulls out his gun and makes it out the doorway as he sees the intruder heading up the stairs.)

DOGGETT: Right there! Hands in the air!

(The man stops.)

DOGGETT: Turn around and step forward.

(The man turns around. The light at the top of the stairs is behind the figure casting his face in the shadows.)

DOGGETT: Step forward.

(The man slowly turns around and makes his way down the stairs. DOGGETT still has his gun on the man.)

DOGGETT: Let's go, tough guy! All the way down!

(The man approaches DOGGETT. His hands are still raised in the air. As he gets closer, DOGGETT sees his face. (Off DOGGETT), he looks surprised.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4
2:02 AM

(FBI Building. The elevator bell dings and the doors open. SCULLY is standing there. She looks like she was just called in and rushed over. Her pants cuff is tucked inside her right boot. She makes her way down the hallway, glances down and notices it. With a small hop and skip, she corrects it and continues on down the hallway without breaking her stride.)

(SCULLY enters the observation room. In the adjoining room, DOGGETT is questioning the intruder.)

SCULLY: Agent Reyes.

REYES: Agent Scully.

SCULLY: Do we know who he is?

REYES: He says his name is Miller but he has no identification on him. Beyond that, we don't know a lot.

SCULLY: Why are the lights off?

REYES: He wouldn't speak with them on.

SCULLY: What do you mean?

REYES: If you saw him in the light, you'd understand. Something's wrong with his face. He's been severely burned by fire or maybe acid.

SCULLY: And he says he knows me?

REYES: And that he's afraid. A victim of what he calls the alien conspiracy.

CUT TO:

(Inside the Interrogation Room. DOGGETT is sitting there with his arms crossed. Approaching footsteps can be heard.)

DOGGETT: You won't talk to me. You going to talk to her, Mr. Miller?

THE BREATHER: If she'll help me and protect me.

(THE BREATHER'S voice is raspy. His face is covered with scars. DOGGETT gets up to meets SCULLY at the door.)

DOGGETT: You better hope she's feeling more charitable than I am, partner.

(Scully enters while Reyes remains in the observation room. Scully's eyes land on the man, trying to get a better look at him.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully. He's under arrest for assaulting a federal officer. I've explained to him the penalties but he still refuses a lawyer.

SCULLY: How did he get in the building?

DOGGETT: We found a card key on him. Says it was given to him by Fox Mulder.

(This is news to SCULLY as it strikes her someplace she wasn't expecting. SCULLY turns, evaluating the man critically now. Although DOGGETT is talking to her, SCULLY'S focus seems to have shifted to the man sitting at the table.)

SCULLY: His name is Miller?

DOGGETT: Daniel Miller of Fredericksburg. He gave us an address but we're still working on the confirmation.

(SCULLY moves further into the dark room and closer to the man at the table.)

SCULLY: What are you doing here?

THE BREATHER: I came here to find answers.

(Like his features, the man's voice is a damaged distortion. It is at once disturbing, affecting, pathetic and true.)

SCULLY: Answers to what?

THE BREATHER: To this. What they did to me.

(THE BREATHER gestures to his own face.)

SCULLY: From your scarring, it appears that you've been burned. Are you claiming that someone burned you and that there is evidence here to incriminate them?

(SCULLY fights focus and composure just hearing the name.)

THE BREATHER: According to Fox Mulder, the men who did this are part of a government conspiracy.

(THE BREATHER pauses. SCULLY waits. She moves to take the seat on the other side of the table.)

SCULLY: Go on.

THE BREATHER: You know who these men are.

(THE BREATHER pauses again.)

SCULLY: Did Mulder tell you that, too?

(THE BREATHER remains silent.)

SCULLY: When?

THE BREATHER: If I were to tell you that, you might use the information to find him. Mulder doesn't want to be found.

DOGGETT: When I searched him I found those X-Files stuffed inside his clothes.

(SCULLY pulls out a photograph of a young MULDER with SAMANTHA.)

DOGGETT: You know who that is?

SCULLY: That's his sister.

DOGGETT: Whose?

THE BREATHER: Mulder's. She was abducted from her home when she was a little girl -- part of this same government conspiracy.

SCULLY: You seem to know a lot, Mr. Miller. It gives an impression either that you are telling the truth or you just want us to believe that you are.

THE BREATHER: (glibly) If I thought you'd believe me, I wouldn't have snuck in here.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Would you please arrange the transfer of this man to Quantico? I'd like to personally examine his injuries.

CUT TO:



SCENE 5

(Quantico. In the examination room, THE BREATHER is lying undressed on the examining table. There is scarring from his feet to the top of his head. There doesn't appear to be a single inch of him not scarred.)

(SCULLY removes the layers of latex from THE BREATHER. She places another piece on the side table next to the other pieces there: two ears, his hair and his nose.)

(REYES watches from the back.)

SCULLY: from the tissue quality, the scarring is fairly recent ... the extent of it severe but it's not from burning or chemicals.

THE BREATHER: No.

SCULLY: What is it, then?

(THE BREATHER is quiet, however, he breathes a little more rapidly than before. His mouth works as if to force the words out. He's quiet.)

REYES: Mr. Miller?

THE BREATHER: I was injected.

(THE BREATHER suddenly turns his head to face SCULLY.)

[QUICK FLASHBACK: A hand holding a hypodermic needle. A man strapped down naked in an examining chair. The needle slowly approaching. Three men in which lab coats surrounding the man in the chair. A large overhead examining light above the chair. Metal clamps holding the man's mouth open. The hypodermic needle being inserted in the man's neck. The man's hand griping the chair's arm rest in pain and another hand physically holding it down. ]

SCULLY: Injected with what?

THE BREATHER: I don't know. It burned. Throughout my whole body inside and out.

(THE BREATHER again quickly turns his head toward SCULLY in reaction to the flashback. Almost as if he were trying to escape the memory.)

[QUICK FLASHBACK: Back in the room. The needle injecting something into the man's neck. The mouth clamps used to keep his mouth open. Three men in white lab coats surrounding the naked man strapped in the examining chair. The man writhes in pain. His head thrashing from side to side. Needle injection into the man's neck. The scarred hand gripping the arm rest. The men in lab coats standing by the man in the examining chair. The mouth clamp. The hand physically holding the man's hand down. Mouth clamp. Pain.]

(THE BREATHER can't speak any more. The memory of his experiences overcoming him.)

(The door opens and DOGGETT appears.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully, Agent Reyes. I need to speak to you.

(SCULLY places a comforting hand on THE BREATHER'S shoulder and reluctantly leaves him.)

CUT TO:

(They move out into the hallway.)

SCULLY: What is it, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: I've been out running this man's supposed ID. There's seven Daniel Millers in Fredericksburg but I can tell you, he isn't one of them.

REYES: Then who is he?

DOGGETT: I got an idea but you're not going to believe it.

SCULLY: Well, who is he?

DOGGETT: You asked him how he got in the FBI -- how he knows what he knows.

SCULLY: He said that he contacted Agent Mulder -- that Mulder told him...

DOGGETT: I don't think so. I don't think Mulder told him anything. I think that how he got in here and the reason he knows what he knows is because that man in there is Mulder.

(SCULLY laughs at the thought.)

SCULLY: That's ridiculous. It's absurd.

DOGGETT: Is it? What is true and what we want to be true aren't always the same.

SCULLY: I'm telling you, that's not Mulder.

DOGGETT: I hope you prove me wrong.

(Behind SCULLY thought the window, THE BREATHER is sitting up on the examining table.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 6

(Still in the examination room. A needle injection in THE BREATHER'S arm prompts another flashback.)

[QUICK FLASHBACK: A scarred face close up. Head thrashing from side to side. The man in a white lab coat wearing an executioner-like black mask over his entire head approaching the man in the chair. One man in a white lab coat in the room with the naked man in the examining chair. Mouth clamp and head thrashing from side to side. A scarred hand gripping the arm chair rest. Close-up of a hypodermic needle. Three men in white lab coats surrounding the chair. Needle injection. Mouth clamp. Scarred hand being held down. The man in a white lab coat wearing an executioner- like black mask over his entire head. The man slowly pulls off the black mask over his head ... the mask slowly comes off ... ]

(THE BREATHER looks sad. He closes his eyes at the memory. SCULLY is standing next to him. She's holding a needle, drawing blood from his arm. When she's done, she carefully caps the needle and puts it on the tray beside her.)

SCULLY: (softly) Can you open your mouth, sir? I need to look at your dental work.

THE BREATHER: You're not going to tell me I need braces, are you?

(THE BREATHER chuckles at his own joke. SCULLY doesn't crack a smile. THE BREATHER complies. SCULLY flashes light inside THE BREATHER'S mouth.)

SCULLY: Now your eyes.

(SCULLY shines the light from her penlight into his eyes.)

THE BREATHER: Are you going to help me?

(SCULLY turns away.)

SCULLY: Are you going I don't know how I can.

THE BREATHER: Help me make them pay for this.

SCULLY: You, uh... refer to them as if I know them or know where they are.

THE BREATHER: They did terrible things to you, too, when you were abducted.

(SCULLY gently feels THE BREATHER'S glands at the side of his neck. Her fingertips lightly pressing.)

SCULLY: Sir, you've given us a false name. We know that your name is not Daniel Miller.

THE BREATHER: No, it's not.

SCULLY: What is it?

THE BREATHER: I can't say.

SCULLY: Why lie to us, if you want us to help you?

THE BREATHER: Because there are people working here at the FBI who would kill me if they knew I was being held here. The same people who would kill Mulder.

SCULLY: You can put your clothes back on.

THE BREATHER: I'm asking for your help. But I might be able to help you.

SCULLY: How can you help me?

THE BREATHER: You're looking for answers, too.

(SCULLY has a QUICK FLASHBACK of something MULDER once said:)

[MULDER: We're both looking for answers.]

(SCULLY puts a hand to her eyes at the memory.)

(SCULLY seems upset. She leaves the man sitting on the examining table and heads out to meet DOGGETT and REYES in the hallway.)

SCULLY: It's not him. It's not Mulder.

DOGGETT: You're absolutely sure of that?

SCULLY: Yes. And so will we all be once you bring me back his DNA tests.

(SCULLY hands the capped syringe of drawn blood to DOGGETT.)

REYES: What do we do with him now?

SCULLY: Well, admittedly he's lying about who he is but the danger to him may be real. I think we need to figure out what it is that he wants and then see if he lies about that, too.

DOGGETT: How are we going to do that?

SCULLY: Well, first, I think we need to quietly get him back to D.C. To FBI headquarters.

(They all turn to look at the man inside. THE BREATHER has his back to the window. He reaches out for his latex nose and gently begins to piece himself back together.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 7

(Inside the X-Files basement office. Memories of Mulder and of a legacy left behind. The camera pans from the "I Want To Believe" poster to the pencils stuck in the ceiling. The office lights switch on. SCULLY and REYES walk into the office. THE BREATHER is already standing there. It was through his eyes that we were seeing. He seems retrospective as if remembering ... )

SCULLY: You came here looking for something. What is it that you hope to find?

THE BREATHER: I didn't find it.

REYES: You stole several files pertaining to the 1973 abduction of Mulder's sister. But yet you say there's danger to your life right now.

THE BREATHER: The conspiracy to keep the truth about aliens from the American public all but destroyed a few years ago has given rise to a new conspiracy in the government now by men who are alien themselves.

SCULLY: And what does this have to do with you?

(THE BREATHER is leafing through the same file cabinet that he started going through just prior being interrupted by DOGGETT.)

THE BREATHER: What you can see they did to me was a failed attempt to turn me into one of these alien men. I was a guinea pig -- a test subject. And now I want to expose their evil plans.

REYES: What plans are those?

(THE BREATHER stands and turns to face them.)

THE BREATHER: To do this to you ... to everyone. Mulder said there were files here -- cases like mine. He gave me names and case numbers but I don't see them. They're not here. Someone's already removed them.

SCULLY: Yes.

REYES: Who?

CUT TO:



SCENE 8

(Scully's apartment. SCULLY opens her closet door digs into the back. She pulls out a file storage box. She puts it on her bed next to THE BREATHER and opens the cover of the box.)

SCULLY: This is what you're looking for.

(THE BREATHER looks at SCULLY.)

THE BREATHER: You trust me? Thank you.

(SCULLY doesn't say anything and leaves.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY and REYES walk out into the hallway leaving THE BREATHER alone to examine the files. REYES is absolutely confused by SCULLY'S uncharacteristic behaviour.)

REYES: What are you doing?

SCULLY: Proving Agent Doggett wrong. That that's not Mulder in there.

REYES: How? I don't understand.

SCULLY: Mulder and I agreed to take those files out of the X-Files office and leave them here for safekeeping. Mulder would have known where they were. And that man in there didn't.

(In the background, WILLIAM begins crying. SCULLY and REYES go to check on WILLIAM. SCULLY glances into the bedroom where she left THE BREATHER. He's not there. SCULLY hurries to check in on WILLIAM. THE BREATHER is standing over WILLIAM'S crib in the dark.)

SCULLY: What are you doing?!

(SCULLY pushes THE BREATHER away from WILLIAM.)

SCULLY: Get away from the crib!

THE BREATHER: The baby was crying ...

SCULLY: It's none of your business!

THE BREATHER: I'm sorry. I'd heard so much about William. Mulder told me how he missed him.

SCULLY: Well, if that's true, then where the hell is he?

(THE BREATHER looks at here sympathetically.)

SCULLY: Just tell me where he is!

THE BREATHER: You don't want to know.

SCULLY: I have to know.

THE BREATHER: He's in pain. Terrible pain.

SCULLY: Then let me go to him.

THE BREATHER: There's nothing you can do.

SCULLY: That's not for you to decide.

THE BREATHER: You know as well as I that's Mulder's decision. I... he begged me to honor it. For your safety ... and William's.

(SCULLY hasn't stopped staring at THE BREATHER since his slip-up.)

REYES: Here, Dana, let me take him for you.

THE BREATHER: No.

(He holds out his arms. WILLIAM has stopped crying)

THE BREATHER: Please. May I?

(SCULLY hesitates and yet, she considers it.)

THE BREATHER: I want to hold him.

REYES: Mr. Miller ...

THE BREATHER: No, it's important I do this. I want to hold him for Mulder.

(SCULLY gives WILLIAM to THE BREATHER to hold. Tears fall on WILLIAM. THE BREATHER is weeping.)

THE BREATHER: He's so beautiful.

(THE BREATHER continues to hold him. SCULLY looks troubled.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 9

(AD SKINNER is sitting in his office at his desk working.)

(The door opens and DOGGETT walks in.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director. You said you've spoken to the lab.

SKINNER: I got some advance info on the exam that Scully performed on the man.

DOGGETT: What?

SKINNER: The blood type matches Mulder's but there are aspects of the physiology that aren't a match.

DOGGETT: Such as?

SKINNER: Well, the body mass, of course. He's shorter and weighs considerably less than Mulder did.

DOGGETT: You haven't seen this guy -- what they've done to him. They way he's twisted, he's like an old man. He could be a hundred years old.

SKINNER: I'm just relaying the facts. And the fact is he's not a hundred years old, is he? Not the way he attacked you.

SKINNER: Well, whoever he is, he wants something.

DOGGETT: He says he wants revenge against the people that burned him. And Mulder directed him to the place where he could find the files and the people who did it.

SKINNER: That doesn't make any sense. Mulder knows those files inside out. Why would he direct him? Why not just tell him?

(DOGGETT nods at the logic of this. The phone rings. SKINNER answer it.)

SKINNER: Skinner. Yeah. You're sure about that? All right.

(SKINNER hangs up.)

DOGGETT: What?

SKINNER: That was the lab. They were able to rush the PCR test and they came up with a definitive DNA result.

DOGGETT: What is it?

SKINNER: Where is this man right now?

CUT TO:



SCENE 10

(Scully's apartment. THE BREATHER is sitting on the bed in the bedroom. He's reading through the files.)

(SCULLY is standing in the doorway watching him.)

SCULLY: It's all been a good act.

THE BREATHER: I don't know what you mean.

(SCULLY closes the bedroom door.)

SCULLY: I think you do. You knew those files were here. You just pretended not to know.

THE BREATHER: No.

SCULLY: I want the truth from you.

THE BREATHER: What truth?

SCULLY: The truth that you won't speak.

THE BREATHER: I want the same truth you do.

SCULLY: (begging) Don't do this to me. Not you.

THE BREATHER: I didn't come here to upset you. I didn't plan on being caught. I know you must have a hard life living alone raising a son not knowing whether you'll see Mulder again.

SCULLY: How do you know my life?

THE BREATHER: I know what Mulder knows. I know they used you to create the child. I know they continue to use you to take care of it and raise it.

SCULLY: What are you saying?

THE BREATHER: You know what I'm saying. Your son -- your child is part alien.

SCULLY: Just tell me who you are. Come on, just say your name. Say it! Just say it!

(REYES appears in the doorway and interrupt the conversation.)

REYES: Agent Scully ...

SCULLY (to REYES): Could you please leave? And close the door?

REYES (to THE BREATHER): Can you step out, please?

SCULLY: This was a private conversation.

REYES: I understand. I'm sorry.

(THE BREATHER gets up and without a word leaves.)

SCULLY: Do you know who that man is?

REYES: Yes, I do.

DOGGETT: Agent Scully ...

(Both DOGGETT and REYES enter the bedroom and close the door behind them.)

SCULLY: What is this? What?

DOGGETT: We got DNA results. A positive ID.

SCULLY: It's not him. He wouldn't say these things.

DOGGETT: The DNA's a match to Fox Mulder'S.

(Even though faced with the scientific proof, SCULLY will not go against her gut.)

SCULLY: It's not him.

CUT TO:

(Standing in the hallway just outside the door, THE BREATHER listens in on their conversation. He hears everything.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(SCULLY is sitting on the bed in her apartment. She's silent and thoughtful. DOGGETT and REYES stand next to the door. SCULLY hasn't moved. DOGGETT opens the door to leave.)

DOGGETT: Can we get you anything?

SCULLY: No, thank you. I just need a minute.

(SCULLY lets up and leaves the room without looking at the other agents. She moves into her bedroom and closes the door behind her.)

(DOGGETT and REYES walk out into the living room. THE BREATHER isn't around.)

DOGGETT: Where'd he go?

REYES: I don't know. I'll go check the nursery.

(DOGGETT notices that the front door is slightly ajar. He opens the door and looks down the hallway.)

DOGGETT: Monica, stay with Scully!

(DOGGETT goes off after THE BREATHER.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 12

(DOGGETT comes out of SCULLY'S building and onto the open street. THE BREATHER is not too far ahead.)

DOGGETT: Hey!

(DOGGETT takes off after him. THE BREATHER tries to loose DOGGETT in the twists and turns between the buildings. For as fast as THE BREATHER runs, DOGGETT runs faster. THE BREATHER turns into an alleyway. DOGGETT rounds the building's corner into the alleyway. He's lost THE BREATHER. There is no exit in this alley.)

(DOGGETT looks around and walks further into the alleyway. He doesn't see anything. THE BREATHER, thinking that it's clear, makes a break for the open road from his hiding place behind the dumpster. DOGGETT catches up with him and tackles him.)

DOGGETT: No more running, Mulder. We're going to protect you now.

CUT TO:



SCENE 13

(SCULLY is standing by the doorway in her apartment. She doesn't look happy. REYES appears from behind her holding a prescription bottle.)

REYES: Give him some time.

(Inside the bedroom, REYES gives THE BREATHER a couple of pills. DOGGETT pours a glass of water for him.)

DOGGETT: You're going to live, buddy.

THE BREATHER: Think that's going to scar?

REYES: We're going to talk, but first you're going to get some sleep.

(They both watch as THE BREATHER takes the pills with a sip of water. SCULLY walks away. THE BREATHER lies down on the bed. DOGGETT and REYES stand there for a moment, then leave.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY is sitting on the sofa. REYES joins her. DOGGETT is standing off to the side.)

SCULLY: So, what now?

REYES: What do you mean?

SCULLY: What do you want to do?

DOGGETT: Keep it a secret, for starters.

SCULLY: Well, that's not going to be hard.

(She sighs.)

SCULLY: Nobody's ever going to believe that that's Mulder.

REYES: Somebody did this to him. Whoever that is is going to know it's him. I mean, that's what he's afraid of.

SCULLY: If he's so afraid, then why did he run?

DOGGETT: You still don't believe it's him.

SCULLY: You know a person in so many ways. Ways that a test can't even begin to know.

DOGGETT: Look, I'll be happy to run his DNA again for you but I don't have to tell you what a long shot it is. I mean, it came up a perfect match.

REYES: You asked why he'd run. Stop and think how hard this is for him. I mean, the way he looks.

SCULLY: If that was Mulder, I wouldn't care.

REYES: But he cares. He has to.

(DOGGETT moves to sit next to REYES on the couch.)

DOGGETT: Maybe he's ashamed. Of what?

(He sighs.)

DOGGETT: Not just the way he looks but you let him go to protect him only he couldn't protect himself.

SCULLY: You believe that?

DOGGETT: I don't know. We'll have a better sense when he wakes up.

(The three sit on the couch. Each deep in their own thoughts.)

CUT TO:

(THE BREATHER is lying on the bed. He coughs out the sleeping pills. He only pretended to swallow them waiting for the opportunity where they would leave him alone and not bother him. He gets up and makes his move.)

CUT TO:

(SCULLY moves to settle on the couch. THE BREATHER slips out of the bedroom and makes his way to the nursery. It's dark inside and WILLIAM is resting. He is awake with a pacifier in his mouth.)

(THE BREATHER takes out a small cloth pouch containing a small bore needle. He fills the syringe with an unknown substance, takes out another bottle with stuff in it, dips his little finger in it, gently removes WILLIAM'S pacifier and rubs a bit in WILLIAM'S mouth (this we don't see on screen).)

(He then takes the syringe and ... )

CUT TO:

(SCULLY is sitting on the couch. REYES is quiet next to her and DOGGETT'S pretty much tuckered out.)

(Sounds of WILLIAM crying pierce the air. Whether is a different kind of cry that babies make, something alerts SCULLY that WILLIAM needs her. She gets up and runs to the nursery to check on WILLIAM. WILLIAM is alone in the bedroom. He's on his hands and knees, up and crying. SCULLY picks him up to comfort him.)

SCULLY: it's okay.

REYES: Is he okay?

(DOGGETT bursts through THE BREATHER'S room to check on THE BREATHER who is back in bed feigning sleep. He is wide awake, his back to the door.)

(DOGGETT turns and rushes back to SCULLY as he hears the panic in her voice.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god, there's blood! Oh, my god!

REYES: There's blood on the sheets.

(DOGGETT arrives in the doorway, a grim look on his face.)

SCULLY: What'd he do? What'd he do to him?!

(SCULLY is still trying to comfort WILLIAM ... and now, herself. She glances at DOGGETT who has a grim look on his face.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 14

(Hospital Emergency Room. SCULLY and REYES rush through the ER doors. SCULLY is carrying WILLIAM. REYES follows close behind.)

SCULLY: Where's Dr. Edwards?

DR. NEWMAN: I'm Dr. Newman. I'm going to take your baby.

(DR. NEWMAN takes WILLIAM from SCULLY. WILLIAM is still screaming.)

SCULLY: He's been injected with something.

DR. NEWMAN: Take him to trauma.

DOCTOR (checking WILLIAM): Airways are open. Lungs are clear. Heart rate slightly elevated. Skin is warm. Nondiaphoretic.

REYES: I spoke to another doctor, a woman -- Dr. Edwards.

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: I'm Whitney Edwards. Agent Reyes?

REYES: Yes. This is Dana Scully.

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: Do we have any idea what he's been injected with?

SCULLY: I've no idea. I don't know. I don't know.

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: We're going to run some tests ...

SCULLY: I'm a medical doctor, okay? Can I ...

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: (interrupting) Good. Then you know what this is all about. You just need to sit tight for me and let us do our job.

(SCULLY and REYES watch helplessly as the ER physicians work on WILLIAM. SCULLY glances down at WILLIAM'S blue moon and stars bunny-ears hat in her hands.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 15

(Inside Scully's apartment, DOGGETT slams THE BREATHER up against the wall. He is very angry.)

DOGGETT: What'd you do to him?! What'd you do?!

(DOGGETT briefly frisks the man. He's looking for something.)

DOGGETT: Where'd you put it?

(DOGGETT leaves THE BREATHER next to the wall and begins to tear the room apart. He pulls the pillows off of the bed. He strips the sheets off the mattress. He throws the mattress off of its frame. Then he finds it. Hidden beneath the mattress is the cloth pouch and contents.)

(DOGGETT picks up the syringe and turns his attention back to THE BREATHER.)

DOGGETT: Is this it?

(He holds out the syringe in front of THE BREAHTER'S face.)

DOGGETT: Is this what you used? Answer me!

THE BREATHER (straining): Yes.

(DOGGETT removes the cap from the needletip. It's not a gun, but it's a promise and just as effective.)

DOGGETT: Anything happens to that kid I'm going to take you out personally. I don't care who the hell you are.

CUT TO BLACK.



SCENE 16

(Time passes slowly in the hospital. SCULLY and REYES are in the waiting room. SCULLY hasn't moved in her seat. Her hands are clasped around WILLIAM'S tiny hat. REYES stays with her.)

(REYES stands as she sees the ER physician approach.)

REYES: Here she comes.

(They both meet the physician eager for an update on WILLIAM.)

SCULLY: How is he? Is he all right?

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: He's good. He's doing fine.

SCULLY (smiling): Oh, god.

REYES: Well, can she see him?

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: We have him in step down right now as a precaution but I think he'll be going home in no time.

SCULLY: What did you find?

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: Nothing.

(SCULLY'S suddenly quiet. REYES takes over the questioning. SCULLY simply stands there, her mind working furiously over the pieces of information.)

REYES: How could you find nothing? There would have to be something.

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: There's some slight bruising on the head where something clearly broke the skin, but... he's fine.

REYES: What about a tox screen?

DR. WHITNEY EDWARDS: There's an elevated amount of iron in his blood but other than that, your son is completely normal.

(Realization dawns on SCULLY. She now understands what happened and how it happened.)

REYES: That doesn't make sense.

SCULLY: No ... I think it does. It makes perfect sense now.

SCENE 17

(THE BREATHER is once again sitting in an interrogation room. He's completely relaxed. His mission complete. SCULLY enters.)

SCULLY: I have seen my share of the hideous of the disgusting and the repellent, but you, sir, are the most perfect expression I will ever see of all that is vile and hateful in life.

JEFFREY SPENDER: That may well be, but for a moment, you believed it -- that I was him

SCULLY: I never believed it.

JEFFREY SPENDER: You wanted to believe.

SCULLY: You are as false as your face.

(JEFFREY SPENDER stands and moves to look at the mirror - a mirror that he knows is two-way.)

SCULLY: I bet you wish night and day that that bullet that was meant to kill you had succeeded.

(On the other side of the mirror, SKINNER stands amazed.)

SKINNER: I don't believe this.

DOGGETT: What?

SKINNER: Who this is.

CUT BACK TO:

JEFFREY SPENDER: You're wrong about that. When I look in the mirror I see something much different than the world sees. He could destroy my face and my dignity when he shot me in that office ...

JEFFREY SPENDER: ...but he couldn't destroy the one thing I love most -- my hatred of him.

SCULLY: Your cigarette-smoking, son of a bitch of a father.

JEFFREY SPENDER: And Mulder's.

(This information doesn't surprise SCULLY.)

SCULLY: You counted on the DNA ... that we'd buy it without question and not look any further. DNA's what Mulder shared with Jeffrey Spender.

JEFFREY SPENDER: Ah.

(JEFFREY SPENDER sits back down at the interrogation table.)

JEFFREY SPENDER: Half brothers raised apart -- that's about all that Mulder and I ever shared.

SCULLY: You haven't seen Mulder, have you? You haven't even talked to him. So, getting caught at the FBI ... winning our trust was all towards one thing. It was only to get to William.

JEFFREY SPENDER: Sitting here, you'd wish me dead. Shortly, I'll do you the favour.

(SCULLY pulls out the bottle found with the syringe. The bottle that contained whatever it was that was injected into WILLIAM.)

SCULLY: I had this checked. It's an unknown metal that you injected into my son.

JEFFREY SPENDER: It's a form of magnetite.

(He inhales deeply.)

JEFFREY SPENDER: A gift.

SCULLY: "A gift"?

JEFFREY SPENDER: Having failed as a conspirator to control alien colonization, my father wanted nothing more than to see the world fail, too.

SCULLY: So, what, you've prevented it now? You've ... prevented alien colonization by injecting this metal into my son?

JEFFREY SPENDER: Your son is the one thing the aliens need. I took revenge on my father by taking William away from them.

SCULLY: So, he's all right now? I mean, just like that?

(He nods.)

SCULLY: So, it's over. They'll let him be.

(JEFFREY SPENDER looks sad.)

JEFFREY SPENDER: It'll never be over. They'll always know what he was. They'll never accept what he is.

SCULLY: Well, I can protect him.

JEFFREY SPENDER: And if you can't? Look at me ... what they did. Is this what you want for your son?

(There are tears in SCULLY'S eyes as she listens to the man before her.)

SCENE 18

(Inside Scully's apartment. WILLIAM is lying down in his bassinet, the stars and moon mobile hanging above him. SCULLY is sitting next to him, watching over him. She's been thinking. REYES appears in the doorway.)

REYES: (gently) Dana ... the room's all fresh for you. I threw out all the old bedding and bought some brand-new stuff, okay?

SCULLY: Thank you.

REYES: I know it's impossible to stop thinking about what he said about William ... but it's all lies, Dana and you were the one who proved it.

SCULLY: And how should I prove it now? By insisting that I can protect him ... only to learn too late that I can't?

REYES: You say it as if you have a choice.

SCULLY: He didn't have a choice to come into this life. I don't have a choice about what he is or was ... but I do have a choice about the life my son will have ...

(SCULLY turns away from REYES to look down at her son. Her voice breaking.)

SCULLY: ... And shouldn't I choose that he never have to be afraid of anyone or anything? And can I ever really even promise him that?

REYES: But who can?

(SCULLY reaches over the crib and lightly taps a star in WILLIAM'S mobile. She bursts into heart-breaking sobs.)

SCENE 19

[The song is "Michael, Row The Boat Ashore".]

(We find ourselves in the Van De Kamp house. The camera travels through the house. Mr. Van De Kamp is sitting at his desk. He's busy working on something. Probably continuing the wood project he was working on at the beginning of the episode.)

(The camera moves to the back into the nursery where Mrs. Van De Kamp is carrying WILLIAM and is ready to put him to bed. The walls of the nursery are covered with cloud-printed wallpaper. WILLIAM is wearing a planet and stars pajamas with a huge red UFO in the middle. MRS. VAN DE KAMP is carrying WILLIAM and rocking him gently.)

MR. VAN DE KAMP: ... in there. Look what I got. Big buffalo.

(MR. VAN DE KAMP enters carrying a hand made mobile with wood carvings of four white buffalo He proudly shows his wife and son the work he's done. He playfully jiggles the mobile in front of his son. All of them laughing and sharing a loving family moment. He hangs the mobile above the crib. MRS. VAN DE KAMP gently puts WILLIAM in the crib and under the mobile.)

(MR. VAN DE KAMP stands closely behind his wife leaning forward to take a long look at his new son.)

MR. VAN DE KAMP: Sweet dreams, baby boy.

(The both move to leave. They linger at the doorway, turn the light off and leave the nursery.)

(WILLIAM is smiling at the mobile. He lifts his hand pointing at the mobile (just as he did in NIHT). The mobile doesn't move.)

SCENE 1
THE TIP

(Night. What at first appears to be the moon, is a flickering street lamp. The streets are wet. A dark coloured car (License# 46-RFXG) pulls up in front of one of the buildings. Doggett's behind the wheel. He double checks the building number with a small piece of paper he holds in his hands. Building #1161. It matches. He gets out of the car)

(Alone, he bursts in through the door and walks into the building. The only light he has comes from his small flashlight. He goes up the stairs, the small piece of paper with the information clutched in his hand. He reaches the floor and walks through an abandoned and messy hallway.)

(Once again, he checks the room number against the piece of paper in his hand. #311. In matches. He reaches for the doorknob and opens the door. He is pushed back and against the far hallway wall by someone inside who runs down the hallway and to his escape.)

(Instead of pursuing the strange man, DOGGETT is distracted by a scratching sound coming from inside the room. He enters the room. The scratching persists. It's coming from behind the freshly cemented wall. The cement is still wet. DOGGETT brushes away the cement, the wall begins to bleed and run down its sides.)

SCENE 2

(FBI Academy at Quantico. SCULLY adjusts a lamp above a cadaver on an examining table. She's teaching a class. The table is surrounded by students.)

SCULLY: Jane Doe. Found last night entombed in a tenement wall by an agent who was following an anonymous tip. Time of death, approximately 2100 hours from three stab wounds to the abdomen. Dirt and clay were found under the nails of her right hand.

CADET 1: What are those lacerations on her arms and feet?

SCULLY: Predation-- from rats. The agent was led to her body by the sound of their feeding. Anyone?

CADET 1: She was killed someplace else. She clawed at the dirt before succumbing to her injuries.

SCULLY: That's possible. What else would help us I.D. This victim -- find the killer?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: It's obvious, isn't it?

SCULLY: What is?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: The chipped nail polish. The drugstore hair rinse. This is a single woman, unemployed. That's why no one's ID'd her. You found blood alcohol?

SCULLY: Point zero four.

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: She hooked up with the wrong man in a bar. He killed her. This man has killed before.

SCULLY: And you know that because ...

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: ... that bruise beneath her ribs? It's from the hilt of a knife. The killer intended a single blow ... the blade thrusting upward at a 45-degree angle into the heart, causing death instantly. But she struggled so, he missed. Then he got mad. Like I said ... obvious.

(SCULLY is stunned.)

SCENE 3

(The Diener rolls the body into an examining room and prepares it for SCULLY. SCULLY does an examination of the corpse. She realizes that the CADET'S conclusions are accurate.)

SCENE 4

(REYES and DOGGETT enter Scully's office. SCULLY is finishing up on the telephone.)

DOGGETT: Agent Scully?

SCULLY (on phone): Great; thank you.

DOGGETT: You got something?

SCULLY: Quite a lot, actually. We've identified your Jane Doe as Ellen Persich, 28, from Redland, Maryland.

REYES: How'd you make the I.D. So fast?

SCULLY: The bar that she was at last night is about a half a mile from where another woman was murdered two weeks ago apparently by the same killer.

REYES: You're saying the body John found was the second victim?

DOGGETT: This says that Rita Shaw was found in a ditch dead from a single knife wound. The woman I found was plastered behind a wall and stabbed three times.

SCULLY: That's why I didn't make the connection at first, either but that was the lab on the phone and they confirmed that it was the same knife in both killings.

REYES: Well, how did you make the connection?

SCULLY: I didn't but one of my students realized that the killer only meant to stab Agent Doggett's victim once. The other wounds were out of anger because he missed.

REYES: That's a pretty astute observation.

SCULLY: Amazingly so.

DOGGETT: This cadet have any other answers up his sleeve?

SCULLY: Like what?

DOGGETT: I want to know why someone tipped me off to this in the first place 'cause this isn't an X-File -- not by a long shot.

SCULLY: I don't know, Agent Doggett, but now that you've got this case I'd say run with it.

SCENE 5
FORENSIC TRAINING FACILITY
JOPLIN, VIRGINIA

(Outside. DOGGETT and REYES are walking through the training exercise field. They pass through various cadets looking at cadavers and pieces of cadavers tucked away in the grassy field. They make their way to the lone cadet examining a severed arm. CADET RUDOLPH HAYES moves to pick up a arm invested with worms .)

DOGGETT: Cadet Hayes? Rudolph Hayes?

(THE CADET looks up, but doesn't get up from his crouched position in front of the severed limb.)

DOGGETT: I'm Agent Doggett. This is Agent Reyes.

(THE CADET smells the arm. He doesn't say anything. DOGGETT and REYES look at each other in reaction to THE CADET'S strange behaviour.)

DOGGETT: Is that part of the training here, Cadet -- smelling body parts?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: This man's flesh smells of creosote ... but his skin is soft. Untanned. He worked indoors. A hardware store, probably. The tear marks at his elbow go from left to right. He was broadsided in a car accident. His hands gripped the wheel so hard ... his thumb bone snapped on impact.

DOGGETT: You determined all that just by looking at that arm?

(HAYES stands up and turns his attention to the agents.)

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: I see things.

REYES: We came to thank you. Because of your analysis, we were able to work up a profile to catch the man who murdered those women.

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: What's the profile?

DOGGETT: White male, 25 to 35, ex-military. (HAYES shakes his head.) Employed near the bars where he met ... why are you shaking your head?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: The profile's wrong. Your killer is in his 40s. A felon recently arrived from out of state. His parole officer thinks he's looking for a job. He already has one -- working for organized crime. He's killed many people. He's going to keep on killing.

(HAYES walks away. REYES smiles.)

REYES: Kind of annoying, isn't he?

(She leaves DOGGETT standing there. He's still looking at the CADET.)

SCENE 6

(Inside an unknown residence. CADET HAYES makes his way back to his home. He walks down a wide, empty hallway. He switches on a lamp. He pins a photograph of the most recent victim on a wall. He stares at the picture then walks away. The picture is one of many. Other picture of victims of bloodied, violent crimes.)

(He takes his shoes off. There are more pictures pinned on the wall - all the way down to the baseboard. He walks away. The camera pans up the wall to reveal more pictures. Dozens. Maybe even hundreds. The entire wall is covered with them. All pictures of victims of violent crimes.)

(The camera gives a front shot of the entire wall panel in front of CADET HAYES' bed is covered with pictures. The camera pans out to give a full view of the same wall. Two of the three panels are covered with pictures.)

(Further out, the camera shows a view of the entire room. CADET HAYES is sitting at this desk in front of the window. The wall in front of the desk is covered from ceiling to floor with pictures.)

SCENE 7

(Outside Mark Mooney's Bar. A dark coloured car stops at the bar.)

(REYES and DOGGETT walk into the bar. REYES spots someone that they're looking for sitting at the bar. REYES nods toward the bar.)

REYES: John.

(DOGGETT pulls out two photos of the man they're looking for to do a visual comparison. Oh, yeah. It looks like the guy. The man is casually sitting at the bar smoking a cigar and having a drink when the two agents approach him.)

REYES: Nicholas Regali? I'm Agent Reyes; this is Agent Doggett.

(They both show him their IDs and badges then put them away.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Oh, don't put them away so fast, Agents. I want to read them. John Jay... Dog... It.

NICHOLAS REGALI: (whispering) Monica Reyes.

(The agents put their IDs away.)

REYES: Mr. Regali, you're in town in violation of the terms of your parole back in New York.

NICHOLAS REGALI: Call my parole officer. She'll tell you I'm here looking for work.

REYES: You come here often, Mr. Regali? Like last night when Ellen Persich got murdered in the parking lot out back?

NICHOLAS REGALI: Last night. I don't remember.

REYES: Maybe you remember being at The Bent Oak. Bartender says he saw you there two weeks ago. The same night a woman named Rita Shaw got stabbed in the heart. What do you have to say about that, Mr. Regali?

NICHOLAS REGALI: You folks don't know what you're dealing with.

(DOGGETT grabs NICHOLAS REGALI's cigar and puts it out in his drink.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: You don't want to play this game, flatfoot. Not with me.

REYES: You like to kill women, Mr. Regali? You may think you can get away with it but that's not going to happen.

NICHOLAS REGALI: Like I said ... you really don't know what you're dealing with.

DOGGETT: I think we do.

(NICHOLAS REGALI chuckles at some inside secret joke.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Agent Dog ... It, Agent Reyes.

(NICHOLAS REGALI takes a sip of his drink, dismissing them. The two agents leave.

SCENE 8

(CADET RUDOLPH HAYES in standing in front of his window looking outside. He turns his desk lamp off and gets into bed. The camera pans the wall of pictures. The camera closes in on a series of photographs of a little boy lying face down in a grassy field. These are pictures of LUKE DOGGETT shown in *EMPEDOCLES. The final picture is of DOGGETT crouched over his son, the grieving father.)

SCENE 9
TITLE: ASHES

(DOGGETT'S is lying in his bed. It's in the middle of the night and he can't sleep.)

(He opens his closet and gets a small box out from the top shelf. The box says: "LUKE DOGGETT" / January 9, 1986 - August 13, 1993.)

(DOGGETT is sitting on his bed, holding the box.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 10

(Day. Inside the X-Files basement office. DOGGETT is sitting on his desk, looking through a file. He senses someone watching him. He looks up. CADET RUDOLPH HAYES is standing in the doorway.)

DOGGETT: How long you been standing there?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: Not long.

(DOGGETT moves to stand behind his desk.)

DOGGETT: I'm glad you dropped by. Wanted to tell you we hit pay dirt with your profile. No arrests yet, but we're building our case.

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: There's something else.

DOGGETT: There's another case I'd like you to take a look at. Seven-year- old boy rides his bike around the block. His mom's on the porch, counting his laps. He waves to her every time he goes by and after six laps, he doesn't come back around. She goes looking for him.

(DOGGETT sits on the edge of his desk. He swallows.)

DOGGETT: Lying on the sidewalk. There's no witnesses no ransom demands no clue as to who took him or why. The cops search door-to-door block-to-block for two days. Nothing. No news at all. And after three days they find him in a field.

(DOGGETT reaches over to his desk and picks up a slim file folder. He opens it and skims the contents. He gets up and starts walking toward the CADET, who hasn't moved from his position near the doorway.)

DOGGETT: It's all in here. The particulars ... about my son.

(This is very difficult for DOGGETT to admit.)

DOGGETT: I've been over this I don't know how many times but after nine years there's not a lot to go on. You were such a big help yesterday. If there's anything you see here ...

(CADET RUDOLPH HAYES glances down at the file folder in DOGGETT's hands.)

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: Agent Doggett, that case I helped you with yesterday? That is your son's.

CUT TO:



SCENE 11

(Hayes' residence. The door opens. CADET RUDOLPH HAYES enters the apartment (2D), followed close behind by DOGGETT. He closes the door without a backward glance. For some reason, his eyes are glued to the walls in CADET RUDOLPH HAYES' apartment.)

DOGGETT: What is this?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: Unsolved murders. I started collecting them before I came to the FBI. I couldn't tell you why.

DOGGETT: What do you do with these?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: If I sit with them for a long time very quietly they tell me things.

(DOGGETT zeroes in on the series of photographs of his son's unsolved murder. From the photograph of himself over his son's body to the other photographs of his son lying in the field.)

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: It's how I see what I see.

DOGGETT: You've been following my son's case.

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: For a long time. He calls to me.

(Whether he believes it or not, DOGGETT turns around to look at the young CADET.)

DOGGETT: Cadet, you should know there's a real good chance you're nuts.

(The CADET hands DOGGETT a photograph.)

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: You recognize that man?

DOGGETT: It's Bob Harvey. It's the closest we ever had to a suspect.

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: He died. Killed in a car crash last year in New Orleans.

DOGGETT: This man killed my son?

CADET RUDOLPH HAYES: He took him. (He shakes his head, no.) He didn't kill him.

DOGGETT: Are you saying the same man that killed those women killed my son? This guy Regali?

(CADET RUDOLPH HAYES nods slightly.)

SCENE 12

(AD Brad Follmer's Office. AD FOLLMER is fixing his tie while looking at his reflection in a glass painting. From behind, DOGGETT knocks on the door and enters.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director? Can I have a minute?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: It's not a good time. I'm off to a meeting with the Director.

DOGGETT: This can't wait.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: And the Director can?

(DOGGETT doesn't move. It's not every day that DOGGETT asks to see FOLLMER. FOLLMER glances at his watch and puts on his jacket.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Okay, you've got one minute.

(DOGGETT closes the door and steps into the office.)

DOGGETT: When you were in New York, you worked the organized crime task force, right?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Mm-hmm.

DOGGETT: Did you ever hear of a guy named Nicholas Regali?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Yeah, he was ... a collector a low-level thug. Why are you asking me, Agent Doggett?

DOGGETT: When the New York office was investigating my son's death his name never came up.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Well, why would it? You have reason to believe he was involved?

DOGGETT: I've got no evidence but somebody's telling me he's mixed-up with the suspect in my son's kidnapping, this Bob Harvey.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Well, I never heard that. And I'm sure I'd remember.

(If it was a clear brush-off by FOLLMER, DOGGETT doesn't seem to notice. In fact, DOGGETT doesn't move at all. He's too wrapped up in his own thoughts about his son. Thinking that this may be just another dead end, DOGGETT lets out a sigh.)

(FOLLMER stops what he's doing. He notices that DOGGETT doesn't have his usual witty comeback for him. In fact, the man looks downright grieved. Whether its out of compassion or for another unknown reason, FOLLMER offers to do a little bit extra for DOGGETT.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: You want me to ask around and pull some files?

(A look of hope for the impossible crosses DOGGETT'S face. His eyes widen in gratitude at FOLLMER'S generosity. He nods slightly.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: I'll see what I can find.

DOGGETT: I'd appreciate it.

(FOLLMER nods his head. DOGGETT leaves.)

SCENE 13

(DOGGETT is walking down the hallway in the FBI Building. He's stopped by REYES, who calls out to him from behind.)

REYES: John! Where you been?

DOGGETT: Chasing down leads.

REYES: We were supposed to meet in the office this morning, remember? To go over what we have on Regali.

(DOGGETT looks behind him and pulls REYES off to the side. He confides in her what's really been on his mind.)

DOGGETT: I think this guy, Regali may have been involved in Luke's death.

(REYES is shocked.)

REYES: What? Since when?

DOGGETT: Since I've been talking to Cadet Hayes. He says Regali knew Bob Harvey -- that they were in on it together.

REYES: How could he possibly know that?

DOGGETT: How does he know half the stuff he knows? I did some digging. I found out that Bob Harvey and Regali both did time at Walkill in 1988.

REYES: So did a thousand other men. That doesn't mean they knew each other.

DOGGETT: I tracked Regali's credit card use, Monica. The day Luke disappeared he gassed his car up two miles from my house.

REYES: Regali is a New Yorker. A lot of New Yorker's visit Long Island.

(REYES is upset by this sudden turn in the investigation. She seems more upset that DOGGETT seems to have his hopes up about solving LUKE'S murderer.)

REYES: This is not evidence not even close.

(DOGGETT swallows.)

REYES: I will never know how badly it hurt you to lose your son or how much pain you still carry. I understand how much you want to find his killer, but I don't want to see you disappointed. Not again.

DOGGETT: It's not going to happen. Not this time.

(DOGGETT walks away. REYES sighs.)

SCENE 14
WOODBURY, NEW YORK

(Outside a lovely two story house, a woman is working in the yard. She looks up. DOGGETT'S standing there. We realise it is his estranged wife.)

DOGGETT: Hi, Barbara. How you doing?

(We are now inside the house. DOGGETT walks a bit into the living room. He looks around. BARBARA DOGGETT doesn't offer him to sit. She doesn't offer him a drink. She doesn't intend for this to be a long visit.)

DOGGETT: When'd you get the new furniture?

BARBARA DOGGETT: Last year. I just wanted to make a change.

DOGGETT: It looks great. You look great.

BARBARA DOGGETT: You need to call first, John. Kind of throws me when you just show up here.

DOGGETT: I'm sorry. It won't happen again. I need to talk to you, Barb.

BARBARA DOGGETT: It's about Luke.

DOGGETT: I got a suspect.

BARBARA DOGGETT: Oh, god. John ...

DOGGETT: I know, I know. But this time, it's different.

BARBARA DOGGETT: Is it? He "could" be, he "might" be ... I want to find out who did this just as badly as you do. But I don't want you coming over here again unless you know ... unless you absolutely know.

(By the look on DOGGETT'S face, he's not sure.)

BARBARA DOGGETT: That's what I thought.

DOGGETT: Look, this guy may have been cruising the neighbourhood. You could have seen him.

BARBARA DOGGETT: Did you hear anything I said?

SCENE 15

(Inside an FBI viewing room. DOGGETT opens the door. BARBARA DOGGETT walks in. She stands in front of the window. DOGGETT pulls the drawstring that lifts up the blinds blocking her view of the men standing in the next room for her to ID.)

(DOGGETT looks hopefully to her. NICHOLAS REGALI is there. The last one in the line up. BARBARA DOGGETT takes her time studying the men. There are about five of them all similar height and built in the line up. She looks over each man. She doesn't recognize anyone. She glances over at DOGGETT and shakes her head, no.)

(Without a backward glance at him, BARBARA DOGGETT leaves the room.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16

(SCULLY enters the hallway outside the viewing room. She sees that DOGGETT and REYES are talking with a police officer in the Viewing Room.)

BARABA DOGGETT: Agent Scully? I'm Barbara. John's ex-wife.

SCULLY: Hi. I'm Dana. Nice to meet you.

BARBARA DOGGETT: He said you'd be coming by.

SCULLY: You weren't able to make an identification?

BARBARA DOGGETT: I didn't expect to.

(In the Viewing Room, DOGGETT is shouting at the police officer. He's not happy about the turn of events. REYES is standing next to him.)

BARBARA DOGGETT: You know he doesn't think clearly about this. He can't.

SCULLY: He blames himself.

BARBARA DOGGETT: He thinks he failed Luke. In his mind, he can never do enough, never suffer enough for what happened. I think if you can help him find the man who did this maybe he could move on.

(BARBARA DOGGETT looks over at the Viewing Room. REYES is standing in front of the Police Officer just before he leaves indicating that she's the one who's speaking with him. DOGGETT is off to the side.)

BARBARA DOGGETT: He and Monica could really have something together. He just won't let her in.

(DOGGETT opens the door and REYES steps out. They both approach SCULLY and BARBARA DOGGETT.)

BARBARA DOGGETT: They're letting him go?

DOGGETT: For now.

BARBARA DOGGETT: I'll be at my mom's till tomorrow.

(With a smile in SCULLY'S direction and without another word to DOGGETT, BARBARA DOGGETT leaves.)

(DOGGETT moves to stand in front of SCULLY. He wants to know something.)

DOGGETT: Tell me you got something.

SCULLY: As you asked, I compared the wounds inflicted on your son with the wounds on these two women.

DOGGETT: And?

SCULLY: There are similarities between the trajectory of the wounds and the force with which they were delivered.

DOGGETT: Meaning Regali's the guy.

SCULLY: Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction on Cadet Hayes's part. But that's all it is. The killer used different weapons, he demonstrated no consistent M.O, and no clear victimology.

REYES: None of it will hold up in court.

DOGGETT: Well, something out there will.

(DOGGETT walks away. REYES takes a deep breath and silently follows him.)

(In the X-Files office, a file with NICHOLAS REGALI'S prison ID photo is open. DOGGETT closes the file, puts it down and gets up.)

DOGGETT: Something's not right.

REYES: What do you mean?

DOGGETT: Here's a guy whose name comes up in connection with racketeering, prostitution, drugs, even murder, yet all he's got are nickel and dime convictions. Always gets off with just a slap on the wrist.

REYES: You know as well as I do mob cases are hard to build.

DOGGETT: What I'm saying is I don't think anyone's even trying. I think this guy Regali's greasing somebody.

REYES: As in bribery?

DOGGETT: What else could it be?

(REYES is silent. She's thinking. Making connections. Something is worrying her.)

DOGGETT: What? What is it?

REYES: We need to talk to you, Assistant Director. About New York.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Oh, didn't you get the case files?

REYES: I mean when we were working in the New York office. You and me.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: I'm not following.

(REYES walks inside and sits on a chair.)

REYES: I used to get take out from a place on 11th street. A little hole- in-the-wall. Maybe you remember it. Carlo's.

(FOLLMER glances over at DOGGETT who is standing silently by the door. FOLLMER moves to sit across REYES.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Is it me, or, uh is this becoming an odd conversation?

REYES: One night, three years ago, I'm waiting for my order. I wandered toward the kitchen.

(FOLLMER turns again to look at DOGGETT, who still hasn't moved. Only DOGGETT has a grim look on his face. FOLLMER doesn't have a choice but to turn his attention to REYES.)

REYES: And I saw you.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Me?

REYES: Talking to a man. A mob guy. I saw you take money from him, Brad. A stack of it.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Three years ago? So, instead of asking me to explain it or even reporting me to the bureau you broke off our relationship and moved away?

REYES: I cared about you, Brad. I'm not defending my actions.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: And now you've come here because you think I'm on the take. Maybe I was on the take when Agent Doggett's son was murdered.

DOGGETT: Somebody gave Regali inside help. Covered his role in my son's death.

(FOLLMER doesn't like the implications made about him. He doesn't take his eyes off of REYES, who is also just as grim as DOGGETT is. Hell, she seems downright angry.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: The man you saw me with was a confidential informant. I was giving him the money.

REYES: That's not what happened.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: We were buying his help to infiltrate a crime family. It's all documented. The entire operation.

(DOGGETT is listening to the explanation and looks at REYES. REYES breaks eye contact with FOLLMER to glance at DOGGETT. His story seems plausible.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Now I can prove what I'm saying. Can you? You should have come to me, Monica. Especially given what I know now.

(FOLLMER is through with that line of questioning and stands up to get the file on his desk. REYES remains sitting. DOGGETT turns his attention to FOLLMER.)

DOGGETT: What do you know?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: When you raised concerns about Regali I looked into the source of these allegations -- uh, a cadet, right?

DOGGETT: Rudolph Hayes. He's been very helpful in this investigation.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Rudolph Hayes died in 1978 in a car accident.

DOGGETT: What? Let me see that.

(DOGGETT grabs the file that AD FOLLMER holds out to him.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Cadet Hayes's real name is Stuart Mimms of Mendota, Minnesota. Last known residence the Dakota County Psychiatric Facility.

REYES: He was a mental patient?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Diagnosed paranoid schizophrenic voluntarily institutionalized in 1990. In 1992, he checked himself out and disappeared. There's another thing. We can also place him in New York city in 1993 ... the year your son was murdered.

(FOLLMER is clearly implying something about CADET RUDOLPH HAYES. DOGGETT is surprised at the implications.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 20

(HAYES' residence. A team of armed FBI men walk down the hallway leading up to RUDOLPH HAYES' apartment. It's daylight outside, light shines through the window. DOGGETT and REYES are there in their kevlar jackets. DOGGETT still has a confused look on his face. He gives the signal for the men to go into the apartment.)

(The team bursts the door in. DOGGETT and REYES take up the back.)

(RUDOLPH HAYES is in a plain white shirt and long pants. He's sitting in the swivel chair in front of his desk, but he's facing the door as if awaiting their arrival. His back is to the desk and the window. It doesn't appear as if the men surprised him at all.)

(DOGGETT goes into the room and glances about him in shock. The swat team pull RUDOLPH HAYES down to the ground. They apprehend him. He doesn't resist.)

(DOGGETT still can't believe his eyes. All the photographs that graced the walls are gone. The walls are completely bare. The men take RUDOLPH HAYES away. DOGGETT turns and shakes his head at REYES, who his standing by the door.)

(DOGGETT doesn't know what to think.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 21

(Night. Just outside Mark Mooney's bar, NICHOLAS REGALI gets into a car. He's smoking a cigar. We see the car belongs to AD BRAD FOLLMER.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Nice car. I remember when they had you banging around in a ten-year-old Impala. Now look at you. Mr. Assistant Director.

AD BRAD FOLLMER: You got lucky. He has another suspect.

NICHOLAS REGALI: You came down here to tell me that?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: There's something I need to know. Were you in any way involved in the death of John Doggett's son?

NICHOLAS REGALI: Since when do you ask me questions?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: Were you involved!

(AD BRAD FOLLMER is upset. He turns his head to look at NICHOLAS REGALI. This casts half his face in the darkness and half in the light. NICHOLAS REGALI turns to answer him also casting his own face half in darkness and half in light.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Course not. What kind of guy do you think I am?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: That's it, I'm done, Regali.

NICHOLAS REGALI: Done?

AD BRAD FOLLMER: With you, with this, with this whole thing.

NICHOLAS REGALI: And if I say no, what are you going to do? You know, if I'm you, right now I'm thinking "I could bop this guy right here and who's going to know it's not self defence?" Well, let me remind you anything happens to me a videotape lands at the Washington Post showing a young Brad Follmer taking cash from yours truly to make an indictment go away. You're done when I say you're done.

(NICHOLAS REGALI exits the car.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 22

(Another suspect line up. As was done before, DOGGETT pulls up the blinds to the viewing room. He turns around. BARBARA DOGGETT moves up closer to the window. In the line up stands RUDOLPH HAYES.)

(BARBARA DOGGETT looks closely at all the men in the line up. She recognizes RUDOLPH HAYES.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 23

(FBI interrogation room. RUDOLPH HAYES pulls out the chair with his cuffed hands. He sits down.)

(SCULLY pushes the thin manila file toward RUDOLPH HAYES.)

SCULLY: It's all in there. How you defrauded the FBI with a false identity in order to gain admittance to the Academy. We know who you really are. We know about your history with schizophrenia. We know that you orchestrated this entire thing in order to get close to Agent Doggett.

(DOGGETT is standing off to the side of the interrogation table.)

RUDOLPH HAYES: I've been recognized by Agent Doggett's ex-wife who failed to identify Nicholas Regali in that same room yesterday.

SCULLY: Because Nicholas Regali did not kill Agent Doggett's son. You did.

RUDOLPH HAYES: That's one explanation.

DOGGETT: It's the explanation.

RUDOLPH HAYES: No.

(DOGGETT is angry and frustrated.)

DOGGETT: Then what is? What is?!

RUDOLPH HAYES: I told you before, Agent Doggett. I studied the photos of your son's death. They called to me. I don't know why, but it was a message, and I listened.

SCULLY: And then, you killed Agent Doggett's son.

RUDOLPH HAYES: I studied his case obsessively. I'm a schizophrenic. That's what schizophrenics do. Obsess. I watched Agent Doggett. I watched his ex- wife, too. She can't tell you how she recognizes me just that she does.

DOGGETT: You're a liar. You lied to the FBI. You're lying now.

RUDOLPH HAYES: Would you have listened to me otherwise? A mental patient with insight into your son's death? I wanted to get close to you, Agent Doggett. To help you.

DOGGETT: You gave me that tip. To find the woman's body in the wall.

(RUDOLPH HAYES does not deny giving DOGGETT the tip. HAYES, however, is through playing games with them.)

RUDOLPH HAYES: Regali associated with the man who abducted your son. I called you so that you could catch him.

(The implications of RUDOLPH HAYES' meaning hits DOGGETT hard. Even SCULLY understands what is being said. DOGGETT was so concerned with getting REGALI for LUKE'S murder, that they failed to get REGALI for the other two women's. In short, REGALI (Luke's murderer) still walks free because of that failure to "catch him". As far as HAYES' involvement is concerned, it's over.)

RUDOLPH HAYES: I've received another message. I'd like to go back home now to the institution.

CUT TO:



SCENE 24

(REYES and AD FOLLMER are waiting patiently in the hallway outside the interrogation room.)

(DOGGETT bursts through the door nearly running into the two. He is upset. Without a single word to either of them, he heads out the door. He ignores REYES as he leaves.)

REYES: John? John!

(SCULLY slowly walks out of the room.)

AD BRAD FOLLMER (to SCULLY): Well?

SCULLY: Well, he told us his story. Whether it's true ...

REYES: In other words, we're nowhere. Again.

(REYES sighs and goes after DOGGETT. FOLLMER is left in the hallway alone with his thoughts.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 25

(Daytime outside Mooney's Bar. A black car parks in front of the establishment. DOGGETT gets out.)

(Inside the bar, NICHOLAS REGALI is sitting alone at the bar when DOGGETT approaches him. REGALI has his drink in front of him and his cigar in his hand.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Well, well. It's the FBI agent.

(DOGGETT sits on the stool next to NICHOLAS REGALI.)

DOGGETT: I'm not here as an FBI agent. I'm here as a father.

NICHOLAS REGALI: Whoa. What could that mean?

DOGGETT: I want to know what happened to my son.

NICHOLAS REGALI: I don't know who killed your son. But I like you, FBI. I really do. I'll tell you how it could have happened, hypothetically.

(DOGGETT'S listening.)

NICHOLAS REGALI: Say there was this guy - a businessman. And say this businessman -- in the course of doing business -- has to associate with any number of thugs, sickos, perverts. Like Bob Harvey, for example. And say this Bob Harvey likes little boys. Yeah. Disgusting. Say one day, Bob Harvey sees a little boy riding a bike, and he can't stand it. He grabs the boy. So, Harvey takes the boy back to his place only he doesn't tell the businessman what he's doing. So, the businessman walks in on him. You see what I'm saying, FBI? The boy sees the businessman's face. The businessman who never did nothing to this little boy. That's a problem. Well ... every problem has got a solution, right?

(NICHOLAS REGALI is finished with his story. He walks out leaving DOGGETT behind at the bar.)

(DOGGETT sits there thinking for a moment. He pulls out his gun and follows NICHOLAS REGALI. He manages to take a couple of steps when a gunshot from outside is heard.)

(DOGGETT comes out of the bar, his gun in his hand. REGALI is dead on the ground with a gunshot wound to his right eye.)

(A woman exits a car in front of DOGGETT and begins screaming in DOGGETT'S direction.)

WOMAN: Oh, my God. He shot him. He just took out his gun and shot him.

(Standing behind DOGGETT with his gun still grasped in his hands is AD BRAD FOLLMER. He has a wild look in his eye and blood splatters on his clothes and face.)

(DOGGETT is standing there staring at FOLLMER. FOLLMER drops his gun. It clatters onto the pavement.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 26
TITLE: RELEASE

(Day. It's a beautiful, sunny day at the beach. The waves roll into shore. DOGGETT and his ex-wife BARBARA stand inside the tide holding the small box containing their son LUKE DOGGETT'S ashes. They are holding on to each other and staring at the distance while the waves continue to roll at their feet. A private, spiritual service for their son ... and for themselves.)

(DOGGETT is holding the box with the bare inscription: "LUKE DOGGETT" / "January 9, 1986 - August 13, 1993". He turns to look at BARBARA -- sharing a moment with her -- perhaps finally connecting with her for once in a very long time. He opens the box and releases their son's ashes into the wind, scattering them into the ocean. DOGGETT cries freely. After all these years, it's finally over.)

(They stand there for a moment, then BARBARA walks away taking the empty box with her.)

CUT TO:

(REYES is leaning against DOGGETT'S white truck waiting patiently for him. In the distance, DOGGETT climbs the sand dunes to her. REYES sees him, turns and goes to meet him.)

(DOGGETT reaches the top and waits for REYES, who stops in front of him. They look at each other. DOGGETT wraps his arms around her and buries his face in her hair -- sharing his grief with her. REYES holds on to him as DOGGETT continues to cling to her.)

[THE END]



                     SUNSHINE DAYS



SCENE 1
VAN NUYS, CALIFORNIA
11:52 PM

(Night. Best friends BLAKE McCORMICK and MICHAEL DALEY are sitting on the bonnet of a car, parked outside a Van Nuys house in a quiet neighbourhood. BLAKE is whistling "The Brady Bunch" theme song.)

BLAKE: So, what do you think, man?

MICHAEL: What do I think about what?

BLAKE: That's the Brady Bunch house. That's "the" house - where they shot "The Brady Bunch."

MICHAEL: What are you on? Crack? Does that honestly look like "The Brady Bunch" house to you?

BLAKE: From inside it does. Straight up, dude. I was there delivering a pizza last night, and the guy who lives there is all, like, tryin' to crowd the door so I can't see inside. But then... he drops his Crazy Bread and bends down... and *boom!* I see it all, man! "The Brady Bunch" house. (BLAKE squashes his can and tosses it onto the pavement. He gets off the bonnet and walks over to toward the house.) I'll prove it.

MICHAEL: No! Wait!

(Seconds later, BLAKE knocks on the green front door of the house.)

MICHAEL: What are you doing? Blake? It's midnight, man.

BLAKE: My honour's at stake, man.

(There is no reply to the knocking.)

MICHAEL: All right, nobody's home. Let's go. Come on.

BLAKE: It's not even locked.

MICHAEL: You're trippin', dude.

(MICHAEL and BLAKE quietly open the door and walk into the house.)

BLAKE: Huh? See? (Giggling) I told you.

(MICHAEL can't believe his eyes. It's an exact copy of *the* Brady house.)

(MICHAEL and BLAKE start exploring the living room, noticing all kinds of things.)

BLAKE: This is exactly like the show. look at this! That weird horse sculpture (laughing) and the vase that Peter broke. Mama always said, "Don't play ball in the house." You remember that one?.

MICHAEL: I don't understand this.

BLAKE: Who's on crack now, huh?

(Breaking the silence, a dusty American football slowly bounces down the stairs, stopping as it reaches the floor. )

MICHAEL: (Calling up the stairs) Hello?

(BLAKE picks up the football.)

BLAKE: Remember the episode where Marcia broke her nose? She got hit with a football, right?

(MICHAEL looks spooked by the whole course of events.)

MICHAEL: Screw this, man. I'm outta here.

BLAKE: Daley, don't be a puss.

(MICHAEL reaches the door, opens it, and leaves quickly, leaving MICHAEL alone in the house.)

BLAKE: Daley?

(BLAKE places the football down on the side. We hear children's laughter coming from the first floor. BLAKE turns and starts up the stairs. He reaches to the top of the stairs and slowly moves down the corridor toward the laughter.)

BLAKE: H-Hello?

(BLAKE turns a corner upstairs and finds two young children, brightly dressed, standing in the corridor.)

BLAKE: Bobby? Cindy?

(The two children turn and enter a bedroom. BLAKE races down the corridor to the doorway. He turns the doorknob and enters.)

BLAKE: Wait! Wait!

(Outside, MICHAEL is waiting for BLAKE in the car, tapping his fingers on the wheel and checking the time on his watch.)

MICHAEL: Come on, man! Come on!

(Suddenly, MICHAEL is startled by a noise, similar to a gunshot. He looks around. Suddenly the roof of the car is crushed downwards, caving in from something heavy landing on it. MICHAEL starts feeling around. The glass of the driver's door is smashed, and MICHAEL manages to pull himself out of the car. He turns as he climbs out and looks up at the car roof. Lying in the middle of the roof lies BLAKE, dead.)

MICHAEL: (Shocked) Oh, my God ...

SCENE 2

(Day. Outside the house in Van Nuys the next day. DOGGETT and REYES are looking towards the heavens. They're trying to work out what happened.)

DOGGETT: I'm tellin' ya.

REYES: No. I don't see how.

DOGGETT: Well, how else do you explain it? A guy falls from a plane, or a... I don't know, maybe a helicopter. Out the door and then... (falling whistle) ... bam. Simple as that.

REYES: And how, exactly, did he wind up in a helicopter, when supposedly he was busy breaking into someone's house at the time?

DOGGETT: Details.

(DOGGETT finds a piece of material on the car. He retrieves it, placing it in an evidence bag.)

REYES: What you got?.

DOGGETT: Maybe nothin'.

(A Police Car pulls up in front of the house. MICHAEL gets out.)

MICHAEL: You the people from the FBI?

REYES: Michael Daley?

MICHAEL: Yeah. Is someone finally gonna arrest that freak?

DOGGETT: Well, how about you tell us what you witnessed, and then we'll go from there.

MICHAEL: What I witnessed was Freaksville, man! My friend was murdered. Who would have thought this could happen at "The Brady Bunch" house.

REYES: That's not "The Brady Bunch" house.

MICHAEL: Yeah, it is. I mean, I know it doesn't look like it, but... but it is. That's where they shot the show.

REYES: No, they shot the show on a soundstage in Hollywood. The house they used for the exteriors is a split-level in Studio City. (Smiling) I took a picture of it once.

MICHAEL: I'm telling you, it's like some kind of creepy Brady Bunch museum in there. I told the cops to search the place, but they wouldn't listen to me. But whatever the hell happened to Blake, it happened right in there.

(Later. DOGGETT knocks on the door and a middle-aged man, OLIVER MARTIN, opens the door.)

DOGGETT: Oliver Martin?

(He nods yes.)

REYES: Mr. Martin, I'm Agent Reyes. This is Agent Doggett. We're with the FBI.

OLIVER: This is regarding the death that happened across the street?

DOGGETT: Yes, Sir. May we come in?

OLIVER: I-I already talked to the police about this..

REYES: Yes, Sir, we know.

OLIVER: As I told them, I didn't see or hear anything. I wasn't home at the time.

MICHAEL: This guy's stonewalling. Kick the door in.

DOGGETT: Shut up.

OLIVER: I'm... really kinda busy.

REYES: Mr. Martin, just five minutes and we'll be out of your hair.

(DOGGETT humours MARTIN.)

DOGGETT: Unless you want us to get a warrant, and then... we could be here for hours.

(MICHAEL pushes past them into the house.)

MICHAEL: Right in here, see?

(MICHAEL stops in his tracks. The house looks nothing like it did earlier.)

MICHAEL: What happened? This isn't what I. saw. None of it. It's all different. Where'd it all go?

OLIVER: I'm... not following.

MICHAEL: What happened to all the Brady Bunch stuff?

REYES: Uh, Mr. Daley was under the impression that your house was used for the filming of "The Brady Bunch", the television show.

OLIVER: Well... it wasn't.

(Moments later, MICHAEL and the Agents leave the house and walk into the street.)

MICHAEL: I know what I saw.

(MICHAEL walks off. DOGGETT and REYES stop at the end of the driveway. DOGGETT looks up on top of the roof.)

REYES: What are you lookin' at?

DOGGETT: I want to check somethin' out.

(DOGGETT goes to a green rubbish bin in the backyard. He opens it and finds an identical piece of roof tile that matches the piece he found earlier on the car.).

DOGGETT: Ah-ha. Hold this, please?

(REYES takes the evidence bag. DOGGETT climbs up on the roof and sees a freshly tiled section of the roof. It looks much cleaner than the rest of the roof.)

DOGGETT: (grunts) Ah-ha.

REYES: Twice with the "ah-ha's."

(DOGGETT climbs down.)

DOGGETT: (sigh) The roof's been patched. When I was inside, I knew I smelled fresh plaster.

REYES: So, are you gonna fill me in?

DOGGETT: A - Eyewitness places the deceased inside this house just prior to the time of his demise. B - We found a fragment of roofing shingle at the scene of the impact. It would seem it matches the discarded piece you now hold in your hand. C - There's a hole in the roof, recently patched, this big around. Connect A to B to C.

REYES: Much in the fashion of, say, Daffy Duck or Wiley Coyote, the deceased shot straight up through the roof, flew high into the air and landed on his buddy's car? (Sceptically) You're serious?

DOGGETT: A to B to C. I gotta tell ya, I think I'm finally gettin' the hang of this job.



SCENE 3
FBI ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Later. SCULLY is examining BLAKE'S body in the autopsy room. She is using a voice recorder to note her findings.)

SCULLY: (Into microphone) Case number 1-4- dash-3-0-8, Blake McCormick. A well nourished Caucasian male, 24-years-old. I will begin with my external examination. (She walks around the body, noticing a large amount of grey material stuck in BLAKE'S head.) And here is a likely place to start.

(SCULLY hears a rattling noise and walks over to her instrument tray. A scalpel is rattling around in the tray, all on its own. She reaches out and touches it. She gets a small electrical shock.)

SCULLY: Ahhhh!

(The rattling stops. She is dumbfounded.)



SCENE 4
FBI FIELD OFFICE
LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA
7:08 PM

(DOGGETT and REYES are sitting in an office. They are video-conferencing with SCULLY, who is still at work at QUANTICO.)

DOGGETT: Help me out here, Agent Scully. Monica thinks I'm losin' my marbles. What can you tell us about what happened to this guy?

SCULLY: Well for starters, Mr. McCormick was dead before he landed on the car. His skull was pulverized from a previous impact. And judging by the roofing material that I found in the wound, I'd say that Agent Doggett's theory holds water.

REYES: Well, like I asked Agent Doggett, how exactly can that be?

SCULLY: Electricity.

DOGGETT: How's that?

SCULLY: Or maybe electricity is only a by-product. I'm... I'm not really sure. But... look, I had an odd experience today. And, uh, and it made me think to try something unusual. I borrowed an EEG machine, and I wired Mr. McCormick to it. And for the last few hours, he's been putting off a faint reading.

REYES: Are you saying he's alive?

SCULLY: No. He's dead as a hammer. Uh... what I'm reading is some sort of residual electricity, like a... like a battery that's draining off its charge. (A monitor shows a faint reading.) It's fascinating. I mean, I've never seen anything quite like it.

REYES: But what does it mean?

SCULLY: Well, if Mulder were here, I'd, uh, imagine he'd talk about research linking electromagnetic fluctuations to levitation, poltergeist activity, ghost sightings ...

DOGGETT: Ghosts and poltergeists? That's what Mulder would say?

SCULLY: At the end of the day, I wouldn't have any theory that was any better. And I don't now.



SCENE 5

(Later that night. Across the street from the Brady Bunch house, MICHAEL is pouring a can of beer on to the ground in a mark of respect to his dead friend.)

MICHAEL: Here's to you, buddy.

(He takes a final drink from the can and then tosses it aside. He walks over the road toward the house. He climbs over a chain link fence and walks round to the back of the house. He looks through a window and sees ALICE BRADY in the kitchen, tending to the oven. He carries a tray of food through to another room.)

ALICE: (Carrying food) Well folks, I made pork chops and apple sauce.

ALL: Oh!

(MICHAEL looks through another window into the dining room window. He sees the entire BRADY family sitting at the table, enjoying dinner.)

(MICHAEL runs around to the front door. He charges at the door which gives way after two attempts. He runs into the house and finds the dining area completely deserted. Standing in a doorway behind him is OLIVER MARTIN.)

MICHAEL: What is this, man? What in Holy freakin' hell is this, man?

OLIVER: (Whispering) Please ... leave.

(MICHAEL is getting agitated.)

MICHAEL: They were here. I saw 'em! I saw 'em all!!

OLIVER: (Whispering) Leave... before it's too late.

MICHAEL: I saw the Brady Bunch.

(OLIVER slowly shakes his head. Suddenly MICHAEL begins to rise into the air. It takes him a few seconds to realise he is rising up. He tries to reach the floor with his feet, but continues to rise upwards.)

MICHAEL: Oh, my God! What are you doing? Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

(Getting closer to the ceiling, MICHAEL screams out. He suddenly accelerates and smashes through the ceiling. Roof tiles and plaster fall down towards OLVIER, who is standing below.)



SCENE 6

(Day. Outside the house the next morning. A white sheet covers MICHAEL'S body. As the sheet is pulled away, we see his body is lying about a foot below the surface of the lawn. DOGGETT and REYES examine the body.)

(Behind the garden fence, a REPORTER is trying to direct her cameraman for her story.)

REPORTER: Over here, guys! Get the body in the background!

REYES: Smile. All of Southern California's watching us scratch our heads in confusion.

(The REPORTER is giving her report to camera as DOGGETT and REYES continue to check the scene for clues.)

REPORTER: ... second time in one week, as this morning police were called to the house.

DOGGETT: So let's go get some damn answers.

REPORTER: There they found the body of a young man. Although authorities have yet to release any information...

(Later. DOGGETT pounds on the front door.)

OLIVER: I've said all I'm gonna say to you people! You don't like it, go get your warrant!

(OLIVER slams the door in their face.)

REYES: He called your bluff. Maybe we can get a warrant.

(They walk away from the door.)

DOGGETT: Yeah. Judge, I want to toss the house of a man who makes people magically zoom into the sky. It has somethin' to do with electricity and poltergeists and what not. (Chuckling at the thought) Yeah, that'll fly.

(DOGGETT'S cell phone rings. He stops and answers.)

DOGGETT: Doggett.

SCULLY: So, the owner won't talk, huh?

(We see SCULLY is watching REYES and DOGGETT on the TV. The report is on Channel NEWS 6 LIVE - Death In Van Nuys. We can see DOGGETT and REYES in the background.)

REPORTER: (on TV) There you see the two officials...

DOGGETT: Excuse me?

REPORTER: ... who we assume...

SCULLY: (to DOGGETT) Smile. You're on TV.

DOGGETT: Ah...

SCULLY: I'm in Los Angeles at the Field Office. I've called in someone whom you'll both want to meet.



SCENE 7

(Later in the Field Office. The room is darkened as SCULLY plays a film to DOGGETT and REYES. We see a young boy sitting at a table in front of some coloured blocks.)

DR. REITS: (On film) April 4th, 1970, 10:36 AM. Present for this test are John Reits, speaking, and Anthony Fogelman, age 8. Hello, Anthony. (Anthony waves to the camera) Are you ready to begin? (Anthony nods) Good. Now, relax. Relax and focus. Almost immediately the EEG is registering an increase of fast beta wave activity on all leads. Theta activity is rising as well. Oh, my goodness. Oh! My goodness. (DR. REITS gasps.)

(The film turns white. SCULLY turns off the projector and opens the blinds. DR. REITS is sitting across a table from DOGGETT and REYES. He is a late middle aged man, wearing a neat red and white striped necktie.)

DR. REITS: Well, there you have it. My right hand to God, all four blocks rose off of the table, and spiralled halfway to the ceiling before they fell.

REYES: Too bad that wasn't on film.

DR. REITS: (Laughs) The understatement of a lifetime. Whatever phenomena caused this, I also believe that it radiated an electro-magnetic field strong enough to defog the image. Well, don't be polite. Call me crazy. Everybody does.

DOGGETT: I believe you. (REYES looks stunned at DOGGETT'S admission.) Did you recognize that kid? That was our suspect, Oliver Martin. Right?

SCULLY: I went through Mulder's reference books. Van Nuys, California, 1970, one of the best documented cases of what was initially thought to be poltergeist activity. It focused on a young. boy, Anthony Fogelman, who has since changed his name. And Doctor Reits was the parapsychologist who investigated it.

DR. REITS: Objects flew around the house. Rooms would grow inexplicably cold. Strange voices would be heard. Anthony's mother was at the end of her rope. I spent six months with her and her son. Six astonishing months.

REYES: What did you learn?

DR. REITS: That Anthony was as bewildered as everyone else. But that he was responsible for all of it.

SCULLY: He was psychokinetic.

DR. REITS: (Nodding) He was the Mozart of psychokinesis.

REYES: Sir, in your line of work, why would you fall out of touch with the Mozart of psychokinesis?

DR. REITS: (Pausing) Over time, Anthony's abilities faded. The last few months I was with him, there were no manifestations of it whatsoever.

SCULLY: He lost his power?

DOGGETT: We're lookin' at this guy for two murders. What can you give us that we could actually take to a judge? Was he... Was he an angry kid? Was he violent?

DR. REITS: I can't say what he grew up to be. I... haven't spoken to him in 30 years. But the Anthony I knew... was a lonely little boy.



SCENE 8

(Standing on a stepladder, OLIVER is finishing patching the ceiling of his house. He climbs down and walks over to the window, looking outside. He closes the curtains. He closes his eyes briefly and when he opens them, his home is transformed into the Brady House. As he looks around, all of the Brady children come running down the stairs, giggling to each other. As the pass OLIVER, they all say goodbye to him.)

MARCIA: Bye!

JAN: Bye!.

(OLIVER smiles. The phone rings, bringing him straight back to reality. The answering machine picks up. It is DR. REITS.)

DR. REITS: This is a message for Oliver Martin. Oliver? I believe I knew you years ago as Anthony. This is Dr. John Reits calling. Remember me? It's been far too long, and uh... I'd love... I'd love to talk to you. I'd really... like to catch up. Obviously, uh, you're all grown up now. It's funny. I have trouble picturing that. My God, how time flies. But, uh, anyway...

(The stepladder begins to vibrate.)

DR. REITS: ... you can reach me any time on my cell phone. 714-555-0146. I look forward to hearing from you. Bye now.

(The plaster blade suddenly flies across the room, straight past OLIVER. It imbeds itself in the phone, which lies on the floor.)



SCENE 9

(Moments later in the FBI Field Office. DR. REITS puts down the phone.)

DR. REITS: I guess he's not home.

DOGGETT: He's home.

(REYES is working at a computer in the room. She finds something.)

REYES: Ah- ha. I was wondering why a man with no criminal record would change his name. And then I thought about the name itself. Oliver Martin. It sounded familiar, so I ran it.

DOGGETT: Through what, NCIC?

REYES: No. A Brady Bunch website. It popped right up.

(On REYES' monitor we see a BRADY BUNCH website. The page has a picture of Cousin Oliver.)

DOGGETT: Cousin Oliver. Who the hell's that?

REYES: Carol Brady's nephew. He came to live with the Brady's during the last season of the show.

DOGGETT: You're speaking Greek to me here, uh ... What's this case have to do with an old TV show?

REYES: You remember what Michael Daley claimed he saw inside that house? He said it was the Brady Bunch house. He seemed certain of it. And now this name, Oliver Martin? Just connecting A to B to C.

(DOGGETT smiles at REYES.)

DOGGETT: (To DR. REITS) Does this make any sense to you? When you knew Anthony, was he nutty for the Brady Bunch?

DR. REITS: No. We'd watch it together.

DOGGETT: (To REYES) Okay, say he is. What's it mean?

REYES: Well, why name himself after cousin Oliver? None of the other Brady's particularly liked Oliver. He was a self-described pest.

SCULLY: A jinx. Cousin Oliver, the Jinx. (SCULLY tries to explain her knowledge of the show.) Oh, so maybe I watched an episode or two. Uh... so what you're saying is that, uh, his choice speaks to Anthony Fogelman's character. How he views himself. Um, unlucky, star-crossed, a danger.

DOGGETT: Okay, so be it. Just tell me how this helps me bust him, and uh, I'm happy.

SCULLY: Well, I'm starting to hope that it doesn't come to that.

REYES: What do you mean?

SCULLY: Well, the power that this man seemingly possesses is extraordinary. It needs to be studied.

DR. REITS: It could expand the scope of human knowledge. It could change everything.

SCULLY: It very well could. I mean, I've... I've been working this unit for nine years now. I-I've investigated nearly 200 paranormal cases. We are due for some incontrovertible proof. I want vindication, for ... for Mulder and ... for all of us.

(DOGGETT and REYES nod in agreement.)



SCENE 10

(Later. Outside OLIVER'S house.)

(DR. REITS knocks on the door as DOGGETT looks in one of the windows. We see the house number is 8554.)

DOGGETT: What in the hell?

(DOGGETT tries the door, but it's locked.)

DR. REITS: What is it? Agent Doggett, what?

(DOGGETT picks the lock and they enter.)

DOGGETT: Wait here.

(DOGGETT closes the door and enters, finding himself inside the Brady house. He walks around. A noise upstairs draws his attention and he heads up the stairs to investigate.)

DOGGETT: Oliver Martin? FBI!

(DOGGETT finds OLIVER at the end of the hall.)

OLIVER: Get out of my house.

DOGGETT: Oliver, there's someone here that wants to talk to you. Dr. Reits - you remember him?

OLIVER: Why won't you people just leave me alone? Please, get out..

(DOGGETT begins to levitate and grabs onto the doorknob to try and stay on the ground. He continues to float up, hanging upside down onto the doorknob. His hand lets go of the door and he crashes through the ceiling.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(Moments later DOGGETT comes to. To his horror, he realises he is lying on his back upside down on the attic ceiling. A light bulb hands down.)

DOGGETT: Oh, crap.

(He stands up on the ceiling and tries to jump down, but can't. He calls out to DR. REITS.)

(Outside the house, DR. REITS hears DOGGETT's calls.)

DOGGETT: Oliver? Dr. Reits? I need some help up here. Oliver? You up there? Down there? Whatever the hell?

(DOGGETT sees OLIVER through the hole in the floor.)

DOGGETT: Oliver? Oliver?

(DR. REITS is now upstairs in the house looking for DOGGETT.)

DR. REITS: Anthony?.

DOGGETT: Hey! Hey! I'm up here! Dr. Reits! Help me out here!

(We see ANTHONY kneeling down around a corner as DR. REITS approaches.)

DR. REITS: Anthony?

DOGGETT: Come back here, man! He's dangerous!

DR. REITS: Anthony?

(ANTHONY stands up as DR. REITS sees him.)

DR. REITS: Anthony, let him go.

OLIVER: I can't.

DR. REITS: Sure you can.

OLIVER: No. I don't know how.

DR. REITS: Anthony, you're a good person. I know that hasn't changed. Relax, and focus, remember? (ANTHONY nods) Good. Relax ... and focus.

(OLIVER starts to sob. DOGGETT suddenly falls through the ceiling with a loud crash.)



SCENE 12

(Later on in the living room. DOGGETT is holding an evidence bag filled with ice on the back of his head. REYES and SCULLY enter, amazed at what they see.)

REYES: Oh - my - God. This is ... Are you all right?

DOGGETT: Yeah.

(SCULLY checks his head.)

SCULLY: Just minor bruising.

DOGGETT: Dana Scully? Meet Oliver Martin.

DR. REITS: Uh... Anthony Fogelman.

OLIVER: Oliver.

SCULLY: Oliver. It's a great pleasure to meet you.

REYES: Where did all this come from, Oliver? How did you make this come to be?

OLIVER: (Exhaling) I think about it, and it's here.

SCULLY: Can you think about other things? (Pause) What happens if you think about another place? A nice place?

DR. REITS: Can you do that, Oliver? Please? It's important to me.

(OLIVER concentrates and suddenly they are in an open field next to the ocean. SCULLY stands up in amazement.)

SCULLY: Oh, my god.

(The illusion remains for a moment, then disappears. OLIVER is out of breath.)

OLIVER: Mainly... I like to be here.

(SCULLY is in awe of OLIVER.)

SCULLY: Oliver? With your help, we could learn so much. I would love to take you back with us to Washington.

DR. REITS: It would mean so much to me, Oliver, to show the whole world.

(OLIVER nods his head.)

DR. REITS: Wonderful. Let's go get you packed.

(OLIVER and DR. REITS go upstairs.)

DOGGETT: We've got a tiger by the tail.

REYES: Do you believe he intended to kill you?.

DOGGETT: He wanted me out of his house, and the way I went, it was involuntary like a sneeze. What the hell difference does it make? It means he's not in control of this power of his.

SCULLY: Well, I think that's where we can help him. I mean, he needs to learn how to control his powers. I mean, my God. There's no end to what he could accomplish.

DOGGETT: And there's no end to the harm he could cause if he goes off the deep end, which isn't too long a walk for this guy, in case you haven't noticed. I mean, this whole Brady Bunch thing? I'm not so sure about this.

REYES: Well, we can't keep him here. Two people are dead. Clearly, this isn't working.

SCULLY: And besides, I mean... as grand as this may sound, we owe it to the world.

DOGGETT: Maybe. Except that I can't shake this feelin' that the other shoe's gonna drop. That there's somethin' Oliver's not tellin' us.

(Upstairs. OLIVER comes out of a bedroom, holding the football in his hands.)

DR. REITS: Oliver? You coming?

(A blue spark shoots out of his hand and he drops the football to the floor. He looks more shocked than hurt.)

DR. REITS: Oliver?

[Fade to black]



SCENE 13

(AD SKINNER'S Office. SKINNER is shocked to find himself levitating about two feet in the air. REYES is smiling.)

(DR. JAYCOCKS examines SKINNER, who suddenly begins doing back flips in the air. SCULLY laughs.)

(SKINNER comes back on the ground, amazed.)

SKINNER: (Laughing) Wow!

OLIVER: (His voice is now raspy) May I have a glass of water?

(SKINNER's assistant, ARLENE, pours him a glass of water.)

SKINNER: We'll only be a minute. Anything you need just, uh, ask Arlene.

(SKINNER comes back in the room, shaking his head.)

SCULLY: So, what do you think, Dr. Jaycocks?

DR. JAYCOCKS: What do I think? I think there's a hell of a lot of physics books that are due for major rewrites.

(SCULLY laughs.)

DR. JAYCOCKS: And I think a year from now, you and Dr. Reits will be in Stockholm accepting the Nobel Prize. (SCULLY and DR. REITS smile) This will change everything. May I use your phone?

SKINNER: Yeah.

DOGGETT: So, you're onboard with this?

(SKINNER sighs.)

REYES: What happens next?

SKINNER: I want Kersh to see this. I want the Director himself in here. I mean, do you realize what this means? This kind of proof? It ensures that they can't shut you down. It means the X-Files will go on forever.

(Outside the room there is a loud bump.)

ARLENE: (gasp) Oh!

(ARLENE suddenly bursts into the office.)

ARLENE: Agent Scully?!!

(In the entrance room to SKINNER'S office, OLIVER is having a seizure on the floor.)

SCULLY: He's having a seizure. What happened?

ARLENE: I saw a big spark, and then he just collapsed.

(SCULLY kneels on the floor, protecting OLIVER'S head. DOGGETT picks up the phone.)

DOGGETT: We need an ambulance. We got a man havin' a seizure. Fourth floor, AD Skinner's office. Make it quick.



SCENE 14

(Later. Hospital room. OLIVER rests as DR. REITS sits next to him. REYES and DOGGETT are standing at the foot of the bed, watching over OLIVER.)

DR. REITS: It was just all the excitement. A little bed rest will do him wonders, and we'll get things right back on schedule.

(SCULLY motions for them to join her outside in the corridor.)

REYES: What do his doctors say?

SCULLY: Oliver's electrolytes were severely imbalanced. That's what sent him into shock. They've stabilized his fluids.

DR. REITS: Well, when will they release him?

SCULLY: Well, there's other problems. His thyroid level is elevated, his glucose is low, CPK liver enzymes and BUN, they're all elevated.

DOGGETT: Which in a nutshell means?

SCULLY: It points to a multi-system organ failure. Gradually, his body is consuming itself. It's been going on for months, and ... maybe even years.

REYES: Well, what's causing it?

SCULLY: His doctors have no idea, but I think I'm starting to.

DOGGETT: This power of his, it's eating him alive.

SCULLY: And if so, it follows that the more he uses it, the more his health will decline ... until finally ...

(REYES notices something strange in OLIVER's room.)

REYES: What in the hell?

(The entire Brady family is standing around OLIVER's bed. They rush in.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

(They rush back in, only to find OLIVER alone.)

DR. REITS: Oliver?

REYES: Oliver, those people just now? Was that... Were they...?.

(OLIVER nods his head yes.)

DOGGETT: Why were they here?

OLIVER: To say goodbye.

SCULLY: Why goodbye, Oliver?

OLIVER: Because I'm dying.

(SCULLY, REYES, DOGGETT and DR. REITS watch in silence as OLIVER lays back in bed, clearly exhausted.)



SCENE 15
FBI HEADQUARTERS
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(In the X-Files basement office, DR. REITS' film of young ANTHONY is on the screen. DOGGETT is watching it.)

DR. REITS: (On film) April 4th, 1970, 10:36 AM. Present for this test are John Reits, speaking, and Anthony Fogelman, age 8. Hello, Anthony. Are you ready to begin?

(SCULLY, DR. REITS and REYES enter.)

DOGGETT: Any change in his condition?

SCULLY: Well, they're trying everything they can think of. Experimental drugs, plasma transfusion.

DOGGETT: None of that's gonna work.

DR. REITS: Why not?

DOGGETT: Because they're treatin' the symptoms, not the cause.

REYES: What do you have, John?

DOGGETT: One big question. Why "The Brady Bunch"? Seriously, you two are fans. Why are people still watchin' a 30 year old TV show?

REYES: Because... they're the family everyone wishes they had. Loving parents, lots of brothers and sisters, everybody getting along.

SCULLY: They're the, uh, perfect family. And since Oliver didn't have one as a child, he ... created one.

DOGGETT: Sure, I'd buy all that. But in this case, why "The Brady Bunch"? Why not "The Partridge Family"? Why not "Eight Is Enough"? (to DR. REITS) Where was Oliver when you first saw "The Brady Bunch"? He was with you, right?

DR. REITS: He'd always insisted we watch it together, every week I was there.

DOGGETT: And the longer you two were together, the more his psychokinetic power faded, until finally it went away completely. Now, what do you think that was?

(Long pause. DR. REITS slowly realises DOGGETT'S reasoning.)

DR. REITS: Because for the first time in his life, he was happy.

DOGGETT: Because he was with you.

SCULLY: Well, what are you suggesting is the course of action, John?

DOGGETT: A - Oliver's gonna die if he continues to use his power. B - his power goes away when he's happy. And C - you're the father he never had, and he loves you. A to B to C.

(REYES, SCULLY and DR. REITS silently agree with DOGGETT'S theory.)



SCENE 16

(Later in Oliver's hospital room. A male ORDERLY is trying to feed OLIVER.)

ORDERLY: Come on, Oliver. You gotta eat somethin', man. Doctor's orders.

(DR. REITS enters the room.)

ORDERLY: (to DR. REITS) Talk to him, will ya?

(The ORDERLY exits.)

DR. REITS: Oliver? You have to understand. My life's work ... the vindication of it, it's so important to me. I let it blind me. I treated you like ... a lab rat, and not a man. And 30 years ago, I left, with barely a goodbye. I am sorry for that. You can't use your power. Not ever again. I forbid it.

OLIVER: I can't be alone.

DR. REITS: You won't be. You've got me. Can you forgive me, Oliver?

OLIVER: Anthony.

(DR. REITS laughs with happiness. He sits down at OLIVER'S bedside. The agents watch on from the corridor as DR. REITS feeds OLIVER.)

DOGGETT: So close, Dana. I'm sorry you don't get your proof.

SCULLY: Me too. Well, maybe I've had it these past nine years. If not proof of the paranormal, then ... of more important things.

(After pausing to look at OLIVER, SCULLY walks off down the corridor, leaving DOGGETT and REYES in the hallway.)

DOGGETT: Well, here's hopin' the TV stays off and he learns how to love the real world.

(REYES reaches down and takes his hand in hers.)

REYES: I think you are getting the hang of this job.

(REYES and DOGGETT smile warmly at each other.)

[THE END]                           THE TRUTH PART I



SCENE 1
MOUNT WEATHER COMPLEX
BLUEMONT, VIRGINIA

(Day. A white helicopter (#45) flies overhead, above the mountain top readying to land. There is a military-secure facility in the mountain side guarded by a lot of armed military personnel.)

(A military man opens the helicopter door and several people get out. First two men, a woman, two more men ... and MULDER. He walks out and surveys the place.)

(They all get into a square green transport bus. Military men close the door. The bus drives into a long, dark tunnel inside the mountain nearby.)

(The busy stops. Three men approach the bus. The people unload from the bus, they meet the men, MULDER exits and goes right. He glances behind him to see whether anyone sees him. He's in the clear. He takes off, running down another tunnel.)

(A blue door opens. MULDER steps through the passageway and onto the top of metal stairs that leads into an open tunnel. There are dozens of government workers and military personnel below. It is unclear exactly what is going on. MULDER makes his way down the stairs.)

(MULDER walks quickly through the catwalk. At first, trying to look casual, MULDER settles for just getting to his destination and trots.)

(A card key pops out of an electronic lock. The door opens. MULDER makes his way through another tunnel. It's apparent that he definitely knows where he's going.)

(A large blue door opens. MULDER shuts it quietly and heads to the main computer terminal in the room. MULDER takes a seat and looks up at the screen in front of him. Encrypted nonsense fills the screen from top to bottom. With a series of keystrokes, the screen clears. MULDER definitely knows what he's doing.)

(The following appears on screen:

     END GAME
     ACCESS CODE>

(MULDER types in the correct access code. The screen clears and fills with another coded screen that quickly decodes in front of his eyes. The screen reads:

     CONFIDENTIAL
     DECEMBER 22, 2012
     "THE DATE SET FOR MOBILIZATION OF ALIEN FORCES CULMINATES IN THE COMPLETE ...
     .. OF CIVILIAN AND MILITARY ...
     .. WAS FIRST RECORDED BY ...
     .. DANIEL M. MILLER UPON ...
     .. -IGENCE IN ROSWELL, N.M., I- ...
     .. -ONTACT WITH ALIEN FORCES ...

     .. MILITARY OFFICIALS ARE INSTRUCTED

     .. -RUCTIONS. IT IS ANTICIPATED...
     .. -MENT WILL BE DESTROYED ...
     .. RESULTING IN THE TRANS- ...
     .. THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY ...

(As the screen decodes before him, MULDER reads the secret that the government hides from all humanity. The Truth that no one must discover.)

(MULDER'S reading is interrupted by the sound of the lock mechanism of the door to the room. The door opens and in walks KNOWLE ROHRER. ROHRER moves to the abandoned terminal that MULDER was recently seated at. The de-coded message still on screen.)

(ROHRER knows that someone's been there.)

(From behind ROHRER, MULDER approaches. MULDER hits ROHRER squarely in the head with something. ROHRER simply turns around and grabs MULDER by the neck. He picks MULDER up as if he weighed nothing at all, and throws him through the glass used as the computer screen. MULDER falls onto the floor below. ROHRER makes his way to MULDER.)

(MULDER quickly gets off of the floor and heads out the partially open door. Running for his life, MULDER tries to put as much space as he can between himself and ROHRER. ROHRER is in pursuit.)

(MULDER runs down the tunnel toward the door that will take him back into the main tunnel. He stops running when he sees a man blocking the doorway. The familiar shape of a man who simply stands there. MULDER looks back at KNOWLE ROHRER closing in on him and heads toward the door and the man standing in the doorway.)

(It's KRYCEK.)

(MULDER runs past him and KRYCEK closes the door behind him shutting ROHRER out on the other side. ROHRER immediately begins to batten the door in with his shoulder.)

(MULDER stops and looks at KRYCEK The thumping sounds of ROHRER trying to get through the thick, secure door continue.)

MULDER: No! You're dead.

(KRYCEK looks at MULDER.)

KRYCEK: Go.

(MULDER doesn't move. KRYCEK turns to look at the door. The thumping sounds continue. He looks at MULDER.)

KRYCEK: There's others.

(The Klaxon alarm blares. MULDER turns around to see armed military men running on the catwalks heading toward him. MULDER turns around and KRYCEK'S gone.)

(MULDER'S a bit confused at the apparition, then starts running from the military as they slowly close in on him. MULDER runs on the catwalk only to be stopped by KNOWLE ROHRER in front running toward him. He must have found another way around the sealed door. Behind him, another armed military man blocks that route. MULDER climbs up the stairs. ROHRER closes in on him.)

(MULDER crosses the catwalk headed toward the stairs for the next level. ROHRER reaches MULDER and pulls him down from behind and pins him to the catwalk railing. ROHRER has MULDER'S neck in a vice-like grip while pushing him downward over the railing. Government / military personnel gather on the ground below to watch the commotion.)

(MULDER struggles to maintain his balance and to find a way to fight ROHRER. His foot braces against a canister bolted to the catwalk floor. Using the leverage, MULDER flips both himself and a surprised ROHRER over the catwalk railing. ROHRER, unprepared, falls into the electrical wires running across the tunnel.

(MULDER remains above hanging from the catwalk railing.)

(While ROHRER fries down below and government workers scramble to aid him, MULDER pulls himself up over the railing onto the catwalk and into the arms of the other armed military men advancing on him.)

(There's no escape for MULDER.)

[Fade to black]

SCENE 2

(Unknown Brig. The door opens and two MILITARY GUARDS walk in.)

MILITARY GUARD: What are you thinking?

MULDER: Where am I?

MILITARY GUARD: Wrong answer!

(THE MILITARY GUARD violently hits wall above MULDER.)

MILITARY GUARD: What are you thinking?

MULDER: I'm thinking about getting the hell out of here.

MILITARY GUARD: Wrong... answer!

(THE MILITARY GUARD hits MULDER in the abdomen. MULDER groans in pain. THE MILITARY GUARD walks out. At the door he turns around with a final directive.)

MILITARY GUARD: N sleeping!

(The door closes leaving MULDER in darkness.)

CUT TO:

(The metal door opens and the same MILITARY GUARD walks in. He stops in front of MULDER.)

MILITARY GUARD: What are you thinking?

MULDER: About my son ... about his mother.

MILITARY GUARD: Wrong answer!

(The MILITARY GUARD swings and hits the space very close to MULDER'S face, barely missing him. MULDER has to duck to the side to avoid getting hit.)

MILITARY GUARD: Now, what are you thinking?

MULDER: What do you want from me?!

MILITARY GUARD: Wrong... answer!

(The MILITARY GUARD swings and tries to hit MULDER'S head directly, but MULDER'S prepared for him. MULDER grabs the stick, but THE MILITARY GUARD is too strong for MULDER. MULDER starts to gasp as THE MILITARY GUARD presses the baton against his neck. MULDER struggles and gasps.)

MILITARY GUARD: I want answers, you hear me? I want answers!

(The two are in that locked position. MULDER continues to gasp. Finally the MILITARY GUARD lets go. He stands and walks out. The metal door clangs shut leaving MULDER in darkness once again.)

CUT TO:

(The door opens and THE MILITARY GUARD walks in. MULDER is lying naked on the cold floor. MULDER tries to cover his eyes from the sudden bright light.)

MILITARY GUARD: No sleeping!

(THE MILITARY GUARD knocks MULDER'S hands away from his eyes with his booted foot.)

MILITARY GUARD: Did you hear me?

MULDER: Yes.

MILITARY GUARD: What are you thinking?

MULDER: What should I be thinking?

MILITARY GUARD: You're a guilty man. You entered a government facility illegally in search of non-existent information! You failed in every respect!

MULDER: Yes.

MILITARY GUARD: Say it!

(THE MILITARY GUARD pulls his hand back as if to beat MULDER. He waits for MULDER'S response.)

MULDER: I'm a guilty man. I failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest punishment for my crime.

(THE MILITARY GUARD walks out. The door closes.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 3

(Outside MULDER'S cell. The door buzzes open. SCULLY and SKINNER walk in through a door. They show their FBI IDs to the GUARD on the inside who opens the metal gate for them.)

SCULLY: How long has he been here?

SKINNER: I'm trying to get someone to say

(They rapidly make their way down a hallway.)

SCULLY: Who called you?

SKINNER: Kersh's office.

SCULLY: Who called them?

SKINNER: I don't know; I just know that Mulder's being held here indefinitely.

SCULLY: What for?

SKINNER: For the murder of a military man.

CUT TO:

(The guard inside MULDER'S holding cell opens the door to let SCULLY and SKINNER in. The guard remains in the cell. MULDER is standing by the window. He's dressed in prison orange and is quiet. MULDER doesn't turn around to acknowledge their presence. He turns when SCULLY calls him.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

MULDER: Dana.

(SCULLY walks to him, eager to finally see him and touch him. She wraps her arms around him ... holding him as if she will never let him go. They embrace.)

SCULLY: Oh, my God.

(SCULLY presses a tender kiss to MULDER'S cheek. She's still holding on to MULDER. When she finally pulls away, MULDER has a strange stoic expression on his face. It may be that SCULLY is just too happy to see MULDER to be fully in tuned with him at that moment. And yet ... )

MULDER: You okay?

SCULLY: Am I okay? Mulder, I haven't seen you in such a long time.

(SCULLY smiles and reaches out and touches MULDER'S face. Her hand lingers.)

SCULLY: I was so worried.

MULDER: Well, it's okay, I'm all right. They're treating me really well in here.

(SCULLY'S caress travels from his face to his chest. She finally gets the sense that something's dreadfully not right.)

SCULLY: What's happened to you?

MULDER: Nothing. I'm squared away.

(MULDER looks up to SKINNER.)

MULDER: Oh, hey, Walter. It's good to see you, man.

SKINNER: Have they told you what the charges are, Mulder? What you're doing here?

MULDER: Oh, yeah, yeah. We're clear on that.

SCULLY: You're clear on what?

MULDER: My crimes.

(SCULLY'S silent for a moment, her eyes searching MULDER'S face. Something is going on and MULDER'S play-acting. She knows this, but before she can say anything ... )

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: (interrupting) I murdered a man, Dana. I went looking for something that didn't exist, and I ... I made a terrible mistake. I should be punished severely.

SKINNER: Whatever you were doing you have the right to a lawyer ... to an inquiry and process of law.

MULDER: I don't think you heard me.

GUARD: All right - time's up.

(SCULLY'S eyes continue to search MULDER'S face.)

SCULLY: (quietly) We're going to get you out of here.

MULDER: And why is that? I'm a guilty man.

GUARD: Time's up. Let's go.

MULDER: Uh ... excuse me.

(MULDER leaves SCULLY where she is, turns his back on her and moves back to his position in front of the window. He doesn't look back. SCULLY is left with a hurt and a worried look on her face. She stands there for more than a moment staring at MULDER'S back)

(SKINNER turns to leave the room. SCULLY follows him out. As she approaches the doorway, she turns around once more to see MULDER'S back to her. He hasn't moved and he doesn't look at her.)

(Without a word, SCULLY leaves with SKINNER.)

(THE GUARD holding the door open for SCULLY and SKINNER keeps a watchful eye on MULDER.)

(MULDER assumes a thoughtful position standing, his hand is partially covering his mouth as he plays with his lower lip.)

MULDER: (whispering) I don't understand. Why are you helping me?

(Standing directly in front of MULDER is KRYCEK.)

KRYCEK: Because you can't do this alone.

GUARD: [Come on,] Let's go.

(THE GUARD grabs MULDER'S shoulders. MULDER is startled. When he looks back, KRYCEK is gone.)

(THE GUARD removes MULDER from the cell.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 4

(Day. AD Skinner's Office. SKINNER is on the phone in his office trying to get more information about MULDER'S situation. SCULLY is there filling in DOGGETT and REYES.)

MULDER: You saw him? Mulder?

REYES: They've accused him of murder?

SCULLY: And they have him believing that he did it.

DOGGETT: Murdered who?

SCULLY: Knowle Rohrer.

DOGGETT: Knowle Rohrer? It can't be. I watched Knowle Rohrer die.

REYES: He can't die. Knowle Rohrer's a super soldier.

(SKINNER hangs up the phone.)

SKINNER: Mulder side-stepped security at a facility known as Mount Weather -- a place where they say our so-called "shadow government" is installed.

REYES: What about this murder charge?

SKINNER: Thirty government workers are ready to testify they witnessed Mulder push a military officer to his death.

DOGGETT: Killing the man who can't be killed?

(DOGGETT'S words ring ominously in the room. SCULLY remains quiet for a moment. She looks at DOGGETT and she makes a decision. Without a word, she walks past DOGGETT on her way out of the office.)

DOGGETT: Where are you going?

(SCULLY turns around.)

SCULLY: To beg mercy with the man upstairs.

(DOGGETT, REYES and SKINNER are speechless. The door closes behind her.)

QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(Day. Office of General Mark A. Suveg. KERSH knocks on the closed door.)

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: Come in.

(KERSH enters and approaches the man sitting behind the desk.)

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: Deputy Director Kersh. I've just been going over my notes on this whole business. Please, have a seat.

KERSH: Thank you.

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: We both got a problem with this man of yours, Agent Mulder.

KERSH: Mulder's been a running problem for the FBI. But nothing this serious.

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: I would think ...

KERSH: (interrupting) I've been asked by a female agent ... Mulder's closest associate to beg mercy of the military court to give Mulder every consideration based on his good character.

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: You've reviewed the charges, yes?

KERSH: Yes. There's a charge of murder.

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: This would look bad for the Marines if it didn't look worse for the FBI. What does Mulder intend to plea?

(KERSH shrugs his shoulders and shakes his head. He doesn't know.)

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: You wanted a chance to clear up this mess, Mr. Kersh and I'm going to give it to you. Give it to the FBI.

KERSH: How?

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: A fair hearing for your agent by his own agency. Your prosecutor, your judges. Held in my court.

KERSH: That can't be legal. Why do this?

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: I want a verdict. A guilty verdict. This man Mulder has made a lot of enemies. He's a crusader. And a lot of people do not like the crusade.

(KERSH shakes his head, no.)

KERSH: I can't do that.

GENERAL MARK A. SUVEG: Oh, you'll do it, Deputy Director. You and I both know there are forces inside the government now that a man would be foolish to disobey.

(KERSH knows a threat when he hears one.)

SCENE 6

(Mulder's holding cell. THE GUARD opens the cell door for SCULLY and SKINNER. This is a different cell. A darker cell. There's a small window at the very top of it. MULDER is standing in front of that window stretching upward and facing the light. He has his back to the door.)

(THE GUARD closes the door. He remains outside.)

SCULLY: Mulder.

(MULDER turns around slowly. He moves away from the light and a little closer to SCULLY and SKINNER. He has a strange look on his face.)

SCULLY: Mulder!

(MULDER sniffs the air around him. He fixes his stare only at SCULLY and says ...)

MULDER: I smelled you coming, Clarice.

(SCULLY and SKINNER look a little stunned. SCULLY throws an uncertain glance to SKINNER. MULDER releases a chuckle and a smile. SCULLY takes a deep breath at being once again exposed to MULDER'S exquisite sense of humour.)

SCULLY: Oh, my ...

(SCULLY doesn't seem too amused. She also hasn't moved closer to MULDER. She remains where she is since she came into the cell, quite a length away from MULDER with SKINNER between them.)

SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder. It's not funny to see you putting on that act.

MULDER: No, that is funny.

(MULDER fixes SCULLY with a look and begins to walk toward her.)

MULDER: What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on that act.

(MULDER finally sounds like his old self.)

(MULDER reaches for SCULLY, cups the back of her head with both hands, and draws her to him. MULDER kisses SCULLY leisurely taking his time, his thumbs gently caressing her cheek. SCULLY reaches up and touches MULDER. This is the reunion they both need. MULDER wraps his arms around SCULLY, drawing her nearer to him without breaking the kiss. They embrace each other in their passion. For one moment now and after, they simply hold each other.)

(SKINNER standing close to them, averts his eyes allowing them what little privacy he can.

(MULDER and SCULLY pull away from each other. MULDER humorously turns to SKINNER.)

MULDER: Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man.

SKINNER: The only thing you're going to be kissing, Mulder, is your sweet ass good-bye, with the trouble your in.

MULDER: Uh-huh, I kind of gathered that right around the 50th brainwashing session.

(MULDER inches a little closer to SCULLY, he's holding her hand and lifts it to his lips.)

SCULLY: Mulder, why are they doing this to you?

MULDER: They think that they're preparing me for my trial. For my testimony.

SKINNER: Your testimony's not going to matter. Not with the case they're building.

MULDER: Not building. Rigging.

SKINNER: Yeah, I don't think you understand the seriousness of the charges. This isn't some routine wrist slapping. You're on trial for your life.

MULDER: My trial's a forgone conclusion. What they really want is for me to admit my guilt and help them out. What's really on trial here is the truth.

SCULLY: Mulder, they're saying you killed a man.

MULDER: Have they produced a body?

(Neither SCULLY nor SKINNER answer. SCULLY looks over at SKINNER.)

MULDER: You can't produce a body because you can't kill a man who won't die.

SKINNER: Well, body or not, they've got 30 witnesses from that government facility ready to testify against you.

SCULLY: Mulder, we'll get you the best lawyer.

(MULDER lets out a smile and a laugh.)

MULDER: Would you defend a man who believes in aliens against the FBI and the military? It's never going to happen. Skinner can defend me.

SKINNER: I can't represent you.

MULDER: You know all the facts, the details the whole government conspiracy. (MULDER looks at SKINNER.) More than that, I trust you.

(SKINNER is stunned silent by the weight of MULDER'S complete faith in him ... of MULDER'S willingness to put his life in SKINNER'S hands.)

SCULLY: Mulder ...

MULDER: They can't try me without exposing themselves. I know what I'm doing.

(The three are silent for a moment. The cell door opens. DOGGETT and REYES enter.)

MULDER: Whooo, now it's a party.

(DOGGETT stops in the cell and looks at MULDER. The two men look at each other.)

DOGGETT: Agent Mulder.

SCULLY: What's the matter?

REYES: We've been working off what little we have but the military just got back to us.

DOGGETT: You ready for this? I know this is impossible, but they're saying they got Knowle Rohrer's body.

(They all know this is a lie. They're in for a tough battle ahead.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 7
7:12 AM

(MULDER is lying on his cell floor. He's dressed in orange. The soft sounds of footsteps approaching from the side. A gentle, familiar hand touches his shoulder waking him.)

SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.

MULDER: Is it time to go?

SCULLY: No. That's why I'm here.

(MULDER gets up and yawns.)

SCULLY: Mulder, I need you to talk to me. Confide in me ... or we'll lose.

MULDER: We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting.

SCULLY: You're scaring me. Mulder, I'm so scared that I've just got you back and now I'm going to lose you again.

MULDER: I know what I'm doing.

SCULLY: Well ... whatever you're doing ... you have no idea how much has already been lost ... What I've had to do ...

MULDER: I do know. Skinner told me.

(SCULLY begins to cry.)

SCULLY: Our son, Mulder ... I gave him up.

(MULDER gathers SCULLY into his arms trying to comfort her, drawing comfort from her.)

SCULLY: Our son. I'm so afraid you could never forgive me.

MULDER: I know you had no choice. I just missed both of you so much.

SCULLY: God, where have you been? Where have you been hiding?

MULDER: In New Mexico.

(MULDER buries his face in SCULLY'S shoulder.)

SCULLY: Doing what?

MULDER: Looking for The Truth.

(MULDER laughs at how absurd that sentence sounds. SCULLY chuckles, too. She presses her lips to him.)

SCULLY: You found something, didn't you? Huh?

(SCULLY pulls away from him to look into his eyes.)

SCULLY: What did you find?

MULDER: I can't tell you.

SCULLY: You found something in that facility? That's what you were doing, right? Mulder, what did you find out there?

MULDER: Scully, I can't tell you.

SCULLY: That doesn't make sense.

MULDER: (sadly) You've got to trust me, Scully. I know things. It's better you don't.

CUT TO:



SCENE 8

(Empty courtroom. A door opens into the empty room where the faux court proceedings will occur. SKINNER walks in carrying a briefcase. He stands in the center of the room for a moment, then turns to set up his table)

(Off to the side a man walks into the room calling him. This is SPECIAL AGENT KALLENBRUNNER.)

KALLENBRUNNER: Assistant Director Skinner.

KALLENBRUNNER: Special Agent Kallenbrunner. I'll be handling the prosecution. I'm out of the L.A. Field office.

SKINNER: How did you get this assignment?

KALLENBRUNNER: I was a Federal Prosecutor in D.C. Before joining the FBI. And you?

SKINNER: That's a good question.

(KALLENBRUNNER takes a seat at the table opposite SKINNER.)

(The side door opens and the five man "jury panel" walks in. They are led by the TOOTHPICK MAN, followed by an unknown man, DD KERSH, and two other men we don't recognize. A total of five men sit on the panel. The are all carrying folders. Once all the men walk in, the side door is closed by a guard. The jury sits. Only KERSH remains standing.)

KERSH: Let's bring in the defendant. This proceeding is called to order.

(The back door opens and MULDER walks in accompanied by a guard. He's still dressed in his orange prison garb. He isn't restrained.)

KERSH: Mr. Kallenbrunner you may proceed.

KALLENBRUNNER: I have no witnesses to call. I will submit to the court, however the sworn testimony of 30 men and women who saw the crime.

KERSH: Assistant Director.

SKINNER: I move to dismiss these proceedings on the grounds it violates the accused's rights to a fair trail. I'm not a lawyer. You're not a judge. This is not a court of law.

KERSH: This is a military court of law. You may want to familiarize yourself with title ten of the U.S. Code. But I suggest you call a witness.

SKINNER: Then I move to delay this trial. My central witness, Marita Covarrubias works for the united nations and I can't locate her. And I've received no help from the U.S. Government locating her.

KERSH: I have to deny that request. Do you another witness, Mr. Skinner?

SKINNER: I'll call a witness but I would like to do so under protest.

KERSH: Both the panel's judgments and rulings are sovereign, Mr. Skinner. There is no record.

SKINNER: Excuse me? This isn't a secret tribunal. As you've so kindly informed me, it's a court of law.

KERSH: Military court of law, Mr. Skinner

MULDER: (to SKINNER) It's okay. Try your case.

CUT TO:

(Later on in the courtroom. SCULLY is sitting alone in front of the "jury".)

SKINNER: Please state your name for the court.

SCULLY: My name is Dana Katherine Scully. I was assigned nine years ago to the X-Files to spy on Agent Mulder whose methods the FBI distrusted.

SKINNER: Assigned not just as an agent, but as a medical doctor. A scientist. And as a serious scientist you came to believe in Agent Mulder's theories.

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* from The Erlenmeyer Flask (1X23): Scully pulling the E.B.E. foetus from the cryogenic container.

* from The Erlenmeyer Flask (1X23): Deep Throat getting shot and dying.]

SCULLY: I came to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life and in a conspiracy inside the government to keep their existence a secret.

SKINNER: The proof was overwhelming. It was even scientifically undeniable.

SCULLY: I believe as do many respected scientists that life came to earth millions of years ago from a meteor or a rock from Mars.

[Clip shown of a meteor falling to earth.]

SKINNER: So, what you're saying is, life-- human life-- is extraterrestrial by definition.

KALLENBRUNNER: Objection. What does this nonsense have to do with Mulder murdering a man in cold blood?

SKINNER: Agent Scully will prove that a government conspiracy exists to deny the existence of extra-terrestrials.

KERSH: You are not here proving government conspiracies Mr. Skinner. You are here to defend Fox Mulder.

SKINNER: And I'm trying to do that.

KERSH: It's your case, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: So, a meteor crashed to earth but along with the biological building blocks on it there was something else -- an alien virus.

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* from FTF: Caveman being infected by the oil.

* from FTF: E.B.E. from virus gestating in a human.]

SCULLY: I believe there was a virus which thrived here prehistorically. I believe that virus infected early man and transformed his physiology.

SKINNER: Changed him into something else.

SCULLY: Into an alien life-form himself.

SKINNER: And what happened to these aliens?

SCULLY: They died in the last ice age, 35,000 years ago.

SKINNER: And the virus?

SCULLY: It lay dormant underground until it surfaced once again during our current geologic period.

SKINNER: And the government knows of this?

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* (new) Newspaper clipping from the "Daily Record"

SCULLY: The government learned of this virus in 1947 when a UFO crashed in Roswell, New Mexico.

SKINNER: A UFO crash revealed a virus?

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* from Terma (4X10): The oil blaze after the bomb explodes. Mulder barely making it out of harm's way.

* from FTF: the black oil moving on the ground. * from Piper Maru (3X15): Krycek infected with the black oil.

* from Vienen (8X16): the rig workers infected with the black oil.]

SCULLY: The virus thrived underground in petroleum deposits. In black oil. It has sentience. It can think. It has the ability to communicate and it communicated with the UFOs.

SKINNER: And the government knows this, too.

(SCULLY turns to look at MULDER.)

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* from Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man (4X07): CSM & Deep Throat standing next to each other looking at something hooked up to life support through a window.

* from Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man (4X07): Man in gas mask pushing open a door.

* from Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man (4X07): E.B.E. hooked up to life support.]

SCULLY: In Roswell, they captured aliens from the spacecraft wreckage. They salvaged various alien technology from them and from their data banks they learned of the alien plan to "re-colonize" the earth.

KERSH: Is this all leading anywhere?

MULDER: Yeah. The destruction of mankind.

KERSH: I'll warn you once, Agent Mulder.

(MULDER turns to look at SCULLY. He has slight goofy smile on his face.)

SKINNER: And what did the government do with this ... information of an alien takeover?

SCULLY: They kept it a dark secret. If it had gotten out there would have been wild panic.

KERSH: Mr. Skinner, are we finished?

SKINNER: No. There's the matter of Agent Scully's own abduction in 1994.

KERSH: Abduction by whom?

[Clip Sequence shown while SCULLY'S speaking:

* Light moving fast across the sky (fade to white)

* from One Breath (2X08): Scully on an examining table

* from One Breath (2X08): Scully's eyes open (close-up)

* from One Breath (2X08): Machine attached to Scully's naval filling it with something. Scully's abdomen filling up. rising and expanding.

* from Memento Mori (4X15).: Mulder discovering Tanks filled with green coloured liquid and with bodies within them.

* from Memento Mori (4X15): Mulder standing next to Kurt Crawford clearing the glass on the tank with his hand to see clearer the fully grown clone within.]

SCULLY: By the military working with the government conspirators to develop a breed of human-alien hybrids that the aliens would use as a slave race.

SKINNER: Thank you, Agent Scully. Your witness, Mr. Kallenbrunner.

(KALLENBRUNNER stands.)

KALLENBRUNNER: All these ET'S running around ... it's hard to keep these aliens straight without a scorecard. I myself have never seen an alien. Could we call one as a witness?

SCULLY: You're being facetious.

KALLENBRUNNER: No, I'm not. I'd like to see some proof.

SCULLY: There are the mars rocks ...

KALLENBRUNNER: No. I need something good. Something amazing. Something really cool.

SCULLY: I don't know what you mean.

KALLENBRUNNER: Well, what I mean is, you have no proof to back up one word you just told us. (Scully is silent.) Agent Scully, isn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers, and you got pregnant and had his love child?

SKINNER: Objection!

KALLENBRUNNER: Thank you. Next witness.

(SCULLY turns to look at MULDER. MULDER ever so slightly shakes his head, no .. and mouths that its okay. SCULLY slowly gets up and leaves the witness chair.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 9

(Later in the courtroom during the proceedings. The door opens. JEFFREY SPENDER appears and walks resolutely to the witness chair. JEFFREY SPENDER is scarred and made up just as he was in WILLIAM (9X17). KALLENBRUNNER looks shocked at what he sees. KERSH, recognizing SPENDER, looks down and a bit ashamed. JEFFREY SPENDER takes his seat.)

(This must be MULDER'S first glimpse at JEFFREY SPENDER since ONE SON (6X12). He looks a little stunned. JEFFREY SPENDER turns to look at MULDER. MULDER nods his head. SPENDER nods back.)

SKINNER: Can you state your full name?

JEFFREY SPENDER: Jeffrey Frank Spender.

SKINNER: Mr. Spender, I know you didn't hear Mr. Kallenbrunner, but he'd like to make a mockery of the X-Files. You worked on the X-Files yourself.

JEFFREY SPENDER: Yes, until three years ago.

SKINNER: When you were shot in the X-Files office. Shot by your father.

[Clip Sequence shown while SKINNER'S speaking:

* from One Son (6X12): CSM pointing a gun face level at Jeffrey Spender, and gun firing (fade to white)]

SKINNER: Can I ask you to please tell the court exactly who your father was?

JEFFREY SPENDER: He led the government conspiracy to exploit the existence of aliens.

KALLENBRUNNER: Objection. There's no government conspiracy that I've seen established here.

KERSH: I agree with Mr. Kallenbrunner. I don't see where this is going.

SKINNER: If I can prove this conspiracy, it will justify Mulder's actions and you will have no choice but to acquit.

KERSH: (taunting) I hope this isn't the entire basis of your defence, Mr. Skinner.

(It is. SKINNER looks hesitant. He glances over at MULDER. MULDER doesn't look worried. SKINNER sighs and turns back to JEFFREY SPENDER to continue.)

SKINNER: You have a relationship to Agent Mulder don't you, Mr. Spender?

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from Talitha Cumi (3X24): CSM talking with Mrs. Mulder at Quonochautaug, Rhode Island.

JEFFREY SPENDER: He's my half brother. His mother had an affair with my father.

SKINNER:: And he never knew that. Not until he met you at the FBI.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from Anasazi (2X25): CSM smoking and Bill Mulder having a drink on a round table on a porch. They're talking. Close up of Bill Mulder.

* from Anasazi (2X25): Mulder on cell phone talking to Scully while in the train car after just discovering the mountain of skeletal remains hidden away .. buried.

* from Anasazi (2X25): Bill Mulder in bathroom rummaging through the medicine cabinet for some pills. He closes the cabinet door and reflected in the mirror standing in the tub behind him is Alex Krycek.

* from Anasazi (2X25): Mulder opens the bathroom door to find his father on the floor shot.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: He didn't know both his father and mine were in the alien conspiracy. His father was a reluctant member. When Agent Mulder began to know the truth about this connection, my father had his father killed by an assassin named Alex Krycek.

SKINNER: He killed him to silence him?

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from Paper Clip (3X02): Mulder in the Strughold mines looking for a particular filing cabinet. He opens a drawer and pulls out Samantha's file:

(Subject Name: MULDER, Samantha Ann; Birth Date: 11/21/65; I.D. 378671). Scully is standing next to Mulder. Mulder pulls off the file label to reveal his own name on the file underneath (Subject Name: MULDER, Fox William; Birth Date: 10/13/61; I.D. 292544)]

JEFFREY SPENDER: Mulder's father lived his life in shame. Not for the conspiracy but for a terrible decision he made.

SKINNER: Involving Agent Mulder's sister.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from One Son (6X12): Members of the conspiracy, CSM, Bill Mulder, etc. at the El Rico air base. A young Cassandra Spender and other women and children walking at the air base.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: The aliens distrusted their human collaborators. Members of the conspiracy were made to surrender family members as human collateral.

SKINNER: So, Mulder's father gave up Mulder's sister. His own eight-year-old daughter.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* A bright white light shines through a doorway with a thin unknown figure (presumably alien)

* A young Fox Mulder in his basketball jersey turning his head toward the bright light.

* A young Samantha Mulder being levitated out the window by a bright orange/red ray of light

* A close up of a young adult Fox Mulder at the FBI.

* From 3 (2X07): plastic wrap covering the X-File filing cabinets being taken off.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: Mulder witnessed his sister being abducted by aliens. It haunted him to no end. It's why he pursued the X-Files.

SKINNER: What became of her? Samantha?

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from Closure (7X11): Mulder and Harold Piller.

* from Closure (7X11): A close up of an old sidewalk cement block with two child's-sized handprints with the name "Samantha" printed between them.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: She was returned. She was sent to California where we were raised together. She was taken many more times and suffered horrible tests.

(MULDER has an incredibly sad look on his face as he thinks about Samantha.)

SKINNER: Mulder spent years looking for her ... several times thinking that he'd found her but he was tricked.

[Clip Sequence shown while Spender's speaking:

* from End Game (2X17): Samantha Mulder Clone in scrubs. Close up of Mulder. Two other Samantha Mulder Clones. One in a white lab coat and the other dressed in a brown coat and pants.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: Samantha was part of a cloning experiment done by the conspiracy. She herself died in 1987.

[Clip Sequence:

* from Closure (7X11): The apparition of a teenaged Samantha Mulder running toward Mulder, reaching him and wrapping her arms around him.]

SKINNER: By your own father's hand essentially.

JEFFREY SPENDER: When I went to work for the FBI, I didn't know of my father's crimes. When I stood up to him, he shot me.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* flashback from William (9X17): A hypodermic injection into his neck. A naked Jeff Spender in a testing chair in a sterile morgue with an examining light above and three men in lab coats in the room with him. A mouth clamp. Head thrashing from side to side. Head thrashing from side to side. One man in a black mask and a lab coat. A hypodermic injection into the neck. A hand struggling against the restraints. A window.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: When I didn't die he subjected me to the same horrible tests.

SKINNER: Your witness.

(The room is silent. SKINNER walks back to his seat and sits down.)

KALLENBRUNNER: Mr. Spender, I'm sorry for your suffering. I'm sure none of us can really imagine what it's like. Your father must be brought to justice.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from Requiem (7X22): Krycek pushing a wheelchair-bound CSM down a flight of stairs while Marita watches from the side. CSM and his wheelchair falling down the flight of chairs. CSM on the floor unmoving.]

JEFFREY SPENDER: I believe my father is dead.

KALLENBRUNNER: Mr. Spender, you're here to speak for the character of Agent Mulder. In reports you filed while an FBI agent I see here you describe Mulder as "arrogant," "difficult," "a control freak widely disliked by his peers."

JEFFREY SPENDER: Those reports were written before I knew the truth.

[Clip Sequence shown while SPENDER'S speaking:

* from The End (5X20): Mulder attacking Spender while holding an empty pack of Morleys in his hands.]

KALLENBRUNNER: This report calls him "unstable prone to violent outbursts." I have the report right here if your memory needs refreshing.

(JEFFREY SPENDER slowly turns to look at MR. KALLENBRUNNER.)

KALLENBRUNNER: Thank you, Mr. Spender.

(JEFFREY SPENDER has a sad look of regret on his face.)

SCENE 10
WEED HOPE, NEW MEXICO

(Day. A long-haired man on a moped makes his way up the hills on old unpaved ground and across long distances to an old secluded trailer. He parks and enters the trailer. He's looking for someone. That someone sits in the next room. The person gets up when the young man walks into the trailer.)

GIBSON PRAISE: You found out about Mulder. You found out he's in trouble. I'll get ready now.

[Fade to black]



SCENE 11

(Mulder's holding cell. SCULLY walks down the hallway. THE GUARD opens the door for her. She walks through and continues without stopping.)

(The door opens to MULDER'S cell and SCULLY walks in. MULDER is sitting on the floor against the wall. He's in his orange prison garb and white shoes. SCULLY stops in front of him. The door closes behind her. SCULLY remains standing. MULDER'S still sitting and looking up at SCULLY.)

MULDER: I know what you want and I can't give it to you.

SCULLY: Make them a deal, Mulder. Guilty on a lesser charge. Maybe they'll go for it and they'll let you walk out of here.

MULDER: I'd rather die, Scully.

SCULLY: How can you say that? How can you say that, Mulder, to me?

MULDER: Because this is greater than you or me. This is about everything we worked for for nine years. The truth that we both sacrificed so much to uncover and to expose.

(SCULLY moves to get down on her knees in front of MULDER. They're now eye level with each other.)

SCULLY: Well, then, expose it, Mulder! Take the stand. Whatever it is that you're withholding take the stand and hit them full force.

MULDER: I can't.

SCULLY: Why?

MULDER: I just can't.

SCULLY: You say this is greater than us, and maybe it is, but this is us fighting this fight, Mulder, not you. It's you and me. That's what I'm fighting for, Mulder. You and me.

(MULDER shakes his head. He can't say anything. He wants to, but he can't. Not without betraying what he's trying to keep her from finding out.)

(SCULLY gets up and leaves.)

(MULDER remains behind in the cell with his silence. Suddenly a voice speaks out.)

X: Get up.

MULDER: Who's that? Who's there?

(Out from the dark shadows in front of him, Mr. X steps out.)

MULDER: What are you doing here?

X: That's what I'm here to ask you.

MULDER: I'm putting the truth on trial.

X: What truth? Who's truth? You think these men will even hear it?

MULDER: They're afraid to hear it.

X: They're not afraid. They have too much power to be afraid. You're going to learn that, just like I did. You'll die learning it.

MULDER: I'm not afraid of that.

X: There's a truth even you're afraid to speak now because you know it's futile.

MULDER: No. Because I refuse to accept it.

X: Then you're going to need help.

MULDER: How can you possibly help me?

(X reaches into his inside jacket pocket and pulls out a slip of paper and hands it to MULDER. MULDER opens it up and reads the handwriting on it:

     MARITA COVARRUBIAS
     756 N. MAPLE
     ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.

(When MULDER looks up, X is gone.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 12

(Night. Doggett's residence. Doggett is sitting on his couch. He's on the phone.)

DOGGETT: They said this is where I could find the body, at Fort Marlene.

(Pause as DOGGETT listens to the response.)

DOGGETT: Right. (pause again) The deceased's name is Knowle Rohrer, former marine last employed by the D.O.D.

(REYES is standing by the kitchen counter listening in on DOGGETT'S side of the conversation.)

DOGGETT (o.s.) : No, I don't want a call back. I want to talk to your superior .. (phone disconnects).

(REYES notices a shadow pass by DOGGETT'S kitchen window.)

(DOGGETT looks at the telephone in his hand.)

DOGGETT: Son of a bitch hung up on me!

REYES: Shhh!

(DOGGETT gets up, but stops at REYES' warning. A warning he takes very seriously.)

REYES: There's somebody in your yard.

(DOGGETT reaches for his holster on the coffee table. He unholsters his gun and walks toward REYES.)

DOGGETT: Where is he?

(REYES pulls out her gun.)

REYES: He was at the back door.

(They both go to the back door, DOGGETT turning out the lights in the rooms as they pass it. DOGGETT peers out the kitchen window and spots the shadow as it passes by the window once more.)

DOGGETT: I got him. He's coming around.

(DOGGETT and REYES both position themselves in front of the front door. Their guns out and prepared for the worst. The doorknob rattles. DOGGETT looks at REYES, who nods that she's ready. DOGGETT reaches over and opens the front door.)

DOGGETT: Stay where you are! Federal agent! Hands in the air!

(The shadowed figure of the long-haired INDIAN BOY raises his hands in the air. DOGGETT pulls him into the house and pushes him flat against the wall. He does a quick search for any weapons. When he doesn't find any, DOGGETT turns the young man around to face him, his gun aimed directly at him. REYES stands on the side, her gun never leaving the young man.)

DOGGETT: Who are you? What are you doing skulking around my house?

INDIAN BOY: I didn't want to be seen. I don't want to endanger him.

DOGGETT: Who are you talking about?

INDIAN BOY: Someone who wants to help Mulder.

(DOGGETT and REYES look at each other surprised.)

SCENE 13

(Day. Back in the Military courtroom. MULDER sits in his seat next to SKINNER. A woman approaches the witness chair. She sits. It's MARITA COVARRUBIAS.)

SKINNER: State your full name for the court.

MARITA: Marita Covarrubias.

SKINNER: And your former government title?

MARITA: Special Representative to the Secretary General of the U.N.

SKINNER: The United Nations.

[Clip Sequence shown:

* from Patient X (5X13): Military personnel file out of United Nations Peacekeeping covered vehicles. In one of the vehicles, Marita exits. She closes the vehicle door.

SKINNER: A position giving you unrestricted access to countries and leaders around the world. Isn't that right?

MARITA: Yes.

(MARITA answers the questions truthfully. She looks professional as always. She seems softer and a little more vulnerable, not her self-assured self of the old days. MARITA doesn't look at MULDER.)

SKINNER: How did you use this power?

MARITA: Basically, to further the interests of a secretive group of men who called themselves The Syndicate.

SKINNER: What were their interests?

MARITA: Developing an alien virus vaccine before the Russians developed one.

SKINNER: And how'd they go about that?

[Clip Sequence shown:

* from Tunguska (4X09): Rows of men, bare-chested in prison work pants held down on a table strapped in place under chicken wire.]

MARITA: By testing innocent civilians all over the world. Test subjects were tracked through a DNA identifiers in their small pox vaccination scars.

SKINNER: Without subject's knowledge?

[Clip Sequence shown:

* from Terma (4X10): Knife being heated red hot over an open flame. The young man holding the red-hot knife approaching the men holding down ALEX KRYCEK. KRYCEK is struggling to get free. The men hold him down while the young man begins to crudely amputate his arm. KRYCEK screams in pain.

* from Terma (4X10): KRYCEK at PESKOW'S residence in St. Petersburg, Russia, dipping a tea strainer using his fake left hand.]

MARITA: Mostly. Some developed suspicions. I saw Russians who cut off their arms to prevent being tracked.

SKINNER: As they did to an American man that you worked quite intimately with.

MARITA: Yes. Alex Krycek.

SKINNER: Did you believe in the syndicate? In their international conspiracy?

MARITA: No. I was paid for my access.

SKINNER: In fact, you came to hate them.

MARITA: Yes. It's why I helped Agent Mulder when he approached me.

SKINNER: But you were found out. And the syndicate punished you for this.

(For a brief second, MARITA falters. Her composure waivers at the memory of her experiences of being a test subject.)

[Clip Sequence shown:

* from TR&TB (5X14): The syndicate looking down from a glass observation room in the ceiling. MARITA is on an examining table. She's intubated and has other wires monitoring her vital signs hooked up to her. A latexed gloved hand opening MARITA'S eye to expose evidence of exposure to the black oil that swirls in her eyes.

* from One Son (6X12): MARITA ravaged by being a multiple test subject.]

MARITA: They turned me into a ...

MARITA: ... a test subject.

SKINNER: Testing what?

[Clip Sequence shown while MARITA speaks:

* from Colony (2X16): AGT. BARRETT WEISS morphing into the ABH.

* from Requiem (7X22): DETECTIVE MILES morphing into the ABH.

* from Without (8X02): An ABH observing MULDER on the testing chair.]

MARITA: They were pretending to work with the aliens to infect the entire population with an alien virus, but the conspirators were trying to save themselves by secretly and selfishly developing a vaccine. The conspirators believed all life in the universe had been infected with the virus including a race of shape-shifting alien bounty hunters who policed the conspiracy for the aliens. But they were wrong and it led to the destruction of the conspiracy.

SKINNER: And who destroyed it?

[Clip Sequence shown while MARITA speaks:

* from Patient X (5X13): group of rebels and their burn sticks and people running from them. Close up of a Rebel with his eyes and mouth sewn shut.]

MARITA: A group of renegade aliens who had avoided infection with the virus through self-disfigurement.

SKINNER: And the conspirators themselves -- what happened to them?

[Clip Sequence shown while MARITA speaks:

* from One Son (6X12): At El Rico, the syndicate and their family members surrounded by the faceless rebels.]

MARITA: They're all dead now. Killed by these same faceless aliens.

SKINNER: Then what are you afraid of now?

(MULDER watches SKINNER. MARITA remains silent.)

SKINNER: Why resist testifying here today?

(MULDER watches MARITA closely.)

SKINNER: Because the conspiracy continues just in another form by other men.

KALLENBRUNNER: Objection. Mr. Skinner can't ask questions and give the answers.

KERSH: Sustained.

SKINNER: Fox Mulder's on trial for murder here. The man he's accused of killing is one of these new conspirators. An alien replacement for a human being. What they're calling a super soldier. You can prove this, can't you?

(MARITA remains silent. Her face has a hint of fear in it.)

SKINNER: You know who these men are, don't you? Ms. Covarrubias?

(Still MARITA doesn't say anything.)

(MULDER watches the proceedings. A hand rests on his shoulder. MULDER turns to see who it is. It's KRYCEK.)

KRYCEK: (softly) They'll kill her.

SKINNER: Ms. Covarrubias, I asked you a question. I need an answer.

(MULDER intervenes before it's too late.)

MULDER: No.

(SKINNER turns to MULDER in surprise. For the first time since she entered the court room, MARITA looks at MULDER. MULDER looks at MARITA who has a look of relief on her face. KALLENBRUNNER looks a bit surprised at this development. SKINNER moves closer to MULDER.)

MULDER: It's okay. Let her go.

SKINNER: What the hell are you doing, Mulder? She's the last best witness that we have.

MULDER: Doesn't matter.

(MARITA still looks a bit frightened of being made to talk. SKINNER turns to MARITA.)

SKINNER: Thank you, Ms. Covarrubias. I got nothing else.

(SKINNER sits back in his chair. MARITA looks fearfully at MULDER. She nods her head slightly in thanks. MULDER nods his thanks to her for the effort.)

(MARITA leaves.)

(The back door opens, MARITA exits and DOGGETT walks in.)

DOGGETT: Assistant Director.

(SKINNER meets with DOGGETT at the back of the room. MULDER, KALLENBRUNNER and The panel wait patiently while the two men confer. When they're done, SKINNER turns to the panel and makes an announcement.)

SKINNER: I have an unscheduled witness that I'd like to call here today.

(DOGGETT appears in the doorway with GIBSON PRAISE. MULDER immediately gets up in protest.)

MULDER: No, not him.

SKINNER: Mulder, sit down.

MULDER (to SKINNER): You don't understand. I'm trying to protect that boy.

SKINNER: Well, now he's here to protect you.

KERSH: Mr. Kallenbrunner? Do you have any objections to this witness?

KALLENBRUNNER: Not like Mr. Mulder here does.

(GIBSON PRAISE moves to sit in the witness chair. MULDER crosses his arms on the table and rests his chin on them. He keeps watch on GIBSON PRAISE.)

SKINNER: Can you tell us your name?

GIBSON PRAISE: Gibson Andrew Praise.

SKINNER: Do you know this man? (indicates MULDER)

GIBSON PRAISE: Yes. He's my friend. I hid him in the desert for the last year.

[Clip Sequence shown while SKINNER speaks:

* from The End (5X20): A young GIBSON PRAISE at the chess tournament. Close up of GIBSON moving the brown rook.

* from The Beginning (6X01): GIBSON PRAISE being operated on. His head is in a brace and his skull is open and his brain tissue exposed.]

SKINNER: Mulder met you as a chess protégé. You're life was endangered because of your highly unusual brain activity.

KERSH: Cut to the chase, Mr. Skinner.

SKINNER: Gibson Praise can read people's minds. Mulder and Scully proved this scientifically. There's a certain "junk DNA" which all humans share but has no apparent function. Gibson's "junk DNA" is functional. DNA which is believed to be alien.

KALLENBRUNNER: You're trying to tell us this boy can read minds?

GIBSON: Yes.

MULDER: He's reading your mind right now.

(GIBSON PRAISE turns to look at KALLENBRUNNER.)

KALLENBRUNNER: (facetiously) And the minds of the judges, too?

GIBSON PRAISE: Yes.

(GIBSON PRAISE turns to look at each of the judges. He stops at the last judge.)

GIBSON PRAISE: Even his.

(GIBSON PRAISE lifts his arm and points a damning finger at TOOTHPICK MAN. MULDER'S interest is piqued. He lifts his head to look at TOOTHPICK MAN. KERSH turns his head to look at TOOTHPICK MAN. TOOTHPICK MAN gives a wry grin at all the attention.)

KALLENBRUNNER: And what makes him so special?

(MULDER turns to watch GIBSON PRAISE.)

GIBSON PRAISE: He's not human.

MULDER: He's one of them.

(TOOTHPICK MAN stops smiling. MULDER stands and starts to approach the TOOTHPICK MAN who rises with the commotion.)

MULDER: One of them! I want that man examined!

(SKINNER intercepts MULDER. KERSH stands to reign in order in the "court".)

KERSH: Mr. Skinner control him!

MULDER: You're afraid!

(GUARDS from the back move to restrain MULDER and remove him from the room.)

SKINNER: Mulder!

(THE GUARDS escort MULDER out of the room.

MULDER (yelling): You're afraid of what I know! You're afraid of the truth!

(KALLENBRUNNER is standing watching the GUARDS as they remove MULDER. GIBSON PRAISE turns around to look at TOOTHPICK MAN who is no longer smiling but looking grimly at GIBSON PRAISE. GIBSON PRAISE looks scared.)

[Fade to black]

[END OF PART 1]



                               THE TRUTH  PART II



SCENE 14

(Two GUARDS escort MULDER down the hallway and into another holding cell. SKINNER, DOGGETT and REYES are there. It's a larger cell with lots of light from the windows. MULDER doesn't look happy at all.)

MULDER: Where's Gibson?

REYES: He's with Scully ... in good hands.

(MULDER begins to shake his head in disappointment.)

DOGGETT: We spent the night talking to him. Gibson knows you're concerned. We're protecting him now.

MULDER: He shouldn't have done what he did -- exposing himself like that.

SKINNER: Well, the boy was trying to protect you and it looks like it may have worked.

REYES: He says three judges are wavering. They're leaning in your favour.

(MULDER smiles at their naivete.)

MULDER: It's going to take a little more than that the way things are going. We were never going to win.

SKINNER: Take the stand, Mulder. Testify.

MULDER: No.

DOGGETT: Then we'll testify, me and Monica.

MULDER: No.

REYES: Both of us have seen too much ...

MULDER: Listen to me, they'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street.

DOGGETT: What's left for us on the X-Files?

REYES: We came to this job to give it our best. It's the way we're going to leave.

MULDER: It's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it.

DOGGETT: Then let's shove it up their ass.

CUT TO:



SCENE 15

(Back in the courtroom.)

KERSH: Mr. Skinner?

SKINNER: I'd like to call John Doggett.

(DOGGETT enters the room and makes his way to the witness chair.)

SKINNER: Agent Doggett ... you've been on the X-Files for two years. And with all that you've seen how do you feel about this term "paranormal"?

DOGGETT: Well, the way I look at it, calling something paranormal is just a way of avoiding a real explanation.

SKINNER: You're a sceptic. But I see here in your own case reports some very detailed descriptions of things that a sceptic would never believe in ... these so called "Super-Soldiers."

DOGGETT: Well, that's a whole different deal.

SKINNER: In what way?

[Clip Sequence shown while DOGGETT speaks:

* from NIHT2 (9X02): DOGGETT shooing at KNOWLE ROHRER. KNOWLE ROHRER getting hit at point blank range and continuing to advance.

* from NIHT1 (9X01): SHANNON McMAHON in the car underwater.

* from Essence (8X20): BILLY MILES falling off the roof of the building and into the garbage truck. MULDER and SKINNER leaning over the side of the roof to see BILLY MILES being squashed into something the size of a box.

* from Existence (8X21): The replicating metal.]

DOGGETT: 'Cause I've seen it with my own eyes; shot ... drowned ... even ground up in a garbage truck. And they just come right back to life.

(At DOGGETT'S words, KERSH looks down and sneaks a glance at the TOOTHPICK MAN who just continues to sit there staring at DOGGETT.)

SKINNER: What are they?

DOGGETT: Well, the best I can figure they're some kind of secret military project-ordinary men made invincible.

KALLENBRUNNER: Objection. What does this science fiction have to do with anything?

SKINNER: Agent Doggett is going to tell you that the man that Mulder is accused of killing is a super soldier. A man that Agent Doggett served with in the marines. Name of Knowle Rohrer.

KALLENBRUNNER: Objection. Agent Doggett was not present at the murder nor has he seen or examined the victim.

DOGGETT: That's because I've been getting the bum's rush from the government.

KERSH: Objection sustained.

(DOGGETT turns to look at KERSH, a little more than surprised. Perhaps realizing for the first time that KERSH may not be on the side of justice after all.)

SKINNER: Well, then, let me ask you, Agent Doggett if a super soldier is invincible, how could Mulder have killed this man?

DOGGETT: He couldn't.

(A look of respect crosses MULDER'S face at DOGGETT'S testimony.)

[Clip Sequence shown while DOGGETT speaks:

* from William (9X17): SHADOWMAN falling to his knees at the quarry where his face begins to turn black with oxidation from the metal within him. SCULLY holding her gun on SHADOWMAN and not moving. A look of surprise on her face at what's happening in front of her. SHADOWMAN flying past SCULLY and smashing into the quarry walls.]

DOGGETT: The way I understand it they only way to kill a super soldier is with some rare metal. Agent Scully says it's a form of magnetite from some meteor that fell to earth.

SKINNER: And Mulder's not accused of doing that, is he?

DOGGETT: No, sir.

SKINNER: Your witness.

(KALLENBRUNNER stands up.)

KALLENBRUNNER: Agent Doggett ... in going over your files I must say ... it's an honor to speak to a man whose record is distinguished by such duty to his country. Now, I'm not going to doubt a man of your integrity, Agent Doggett, even if he tells me a story I find too incredible to believe.

DOGGETT: Thank you.

KALLENBRUNNER: Just as you must not doubt the integrity of Fox Mulder on whose behalf you're here to testify.

DOGGETT: Correct.

KALLENBRUNNER: Even if Mulder believes these so-called super soldiers are aliens?

(MULDER realizes where KALLENBRUNNER'S going with this questioning. DOGGETT turns to look at KALLENBRUNNER. He remains silent.)

KALLENBRUNNER: He believes they're aliens, you know. You said you were a sceptic.

DOGGETT: That's right.

KALLENBRUNNER: So an alien conspiracy which Mulder has built his defence on must be entirely unbelievable to you, too.

(KERSH look at DOGGETT. DOGGETT is unable to answer the question against his own beliefs. MULDER understands the situation DOGGETT'S in. DOGGETT turns to look at MULDER. He will not lie. KALLENBRUNNER sits back down.)

CUT TO:

(Later in the courtroom.)

REYES: My name is Monica Reyes. I've been with the FBI since 1990.

SKINNER: Before coming onto the X-Files, Agent Reyes, you worked in the New Orleans field office investigating cases of satanic ritual abuse.

REYES: I did.

SKINNER: Did you ever prosecute any of these satanic cases?

REYES: No.

KALLENBRUNNER: For god's sake, Mr. Skinner, we're trying a man for murder not taking a trip down memory lane.

SKINNER: (angry) I'm showing the court that Agent Reyes is level-headed and objective on strange and extraordinary cases. That her belief in aliens comes from firsthand experience. And she can offer you hard proof that there is an alien conspiracy!

REYES: I was called on last year to protect Agent Scully who was pregnant and whose life was in danger because of her pregnancy.

KALLENBRUNNER: What does this have to do with aliens?

[Clip Sequence shown while REYES speaks:

* from Existence (8X21): Car arriving at night.

* from Existence (8X21): Door to the place Scully gives birth. It's dark inside and they're using a flashlight to see by.

* from Existence (8X21):BM pushes MR and flies her away from him. MR hits the side of the building wall and falls to the ground.

* from Existence (8X21):MR is on the ground and grabs a pitchfork near her. BILLY MILES gets shot by a shotgun and falls backwards.

* from Existence (8X21):BILLY MILES and others enter the place where SCULLY labours and watch her give birth.]

REYES: I drove Agent Scully to a secluded location in Georgia where it was believed she could deliver safely. But we soon discovered we weren't alone. I was attacked and had to defend myself against an assailant, who was shot at point-blank range. Who should have died, but didn't. This assailant was then joined by others like him who surrounded Agent Scully and me, and witnessed her as she gave birth to her son.

(MULDER listens to this story as REYES tells it, not unaffected at what SCULLY went through last year.)

KALLENBRUNNER: Witnessed her? What do you mean?

(REYES turns to look at KALLENBRUNNER.)

[Clip Sequence shown while REYES speaks:

* from Existence (8X21): SCULLY looking down at WILLIAM in MULDER'S arms.]

REYES: We were confused as well. But we came to understand that her son was a kind of miracle child. Its birth was all important to these people; these so- called Super-Soldiers, who I believe are humans replaced by aliens.

KALLENBRUNNER: Why would Scully's child be important to aliens, Agent Reyes?

[Clip Sequence shown while REYES speaks:

* from TrustNo1 (9X08): Patti hugging Scully asking for forgiveness after the death of her husband. She then leaves SCULLY. REYES is standing on the side.

* from NIHT2 (9X02): On the Valor Victor deep in the on-board lab, SCULLY searches through the names looking for either her own and/or her son's.]

REYES: We came to learn that Scully was one of a number of random women who had miraculous childbirths and these women all had been abducted as part of a government program to secretly manipulate their biology operating offshore on a navy ship using these women as surrogates.

KALLENBRUNNER: Surrogates?

REYES: For alien babies.

KALLENBRUNNER: To create a slave race.

REYES: Yes.

KALLENBRUNNER: A program conducted by the Navy, on a ship which is where?

[Clip Sequence shown while REYES speaks:

* from NIHT2 (9X02): The Valor Victor explodes. SCULLY, REYES and DOGGETT narrowly escaping the bomb's detonation.]

REYES: The ship housing this program was exploded on the Baltimore dock.

KALLENBRUNNER: So, in other words, we have no true evidence past your good word.

(SKINNER looks down at the same tactic being used by KALLENBRUNNER over and over again for each witness he brings up. With no proof they have no case. REYES, on the other hand, grows more determined and more defiant to make the truth known.)

KALLENBRUNNER: You claim Scully gave birth to one of these alien babies. How can you be sure of this, Agent Reyes?

[Clip Sequence shown while REYES speaks:

* from Provenance (9X10): SCULLY opens the drawer and the metal piece of ship taken from AGENT COMER flies through the air, out of the room and directly toward WILLIAM who is lying in his crib. The piece of metal breaks through the wooden frame and stop in front of WILLIAM. SCULLY and REYES run into the room to see the metal piece leisurely floating and slowly turning above the baby.]

REYES: I saw her child do things that could be explained no other way. I saw him display amazing powers. He'd move objects with his mind.

KALLENBRUNNER: Really? Do you think we could arrange a demonstration for the court? That we could see that ourselves?

REYES: No. The child was given up for adoption to an anonymous family.

(MULDER once again isn't unaffected by this.)

KALLENBRUNNER: She gave up the miracle child? The proof of everything that she and Mulder claim that they've risked their lives for over the last nine years - she just sent it off to some strangers?

REYES: Yes, to protect him!

KALLENBRUNNER: Thank you, Agent Reyes. That's all.

(KALLENBRUNNER sits down, thereby dismissing her. REYES, however, will not be dismissed so easily. She looks at KALLENBRUNNER, stands and calls the hand of the faux court proceedings that makes a mockery of justice, fairness and decency.)

(REYES moves in toward KALLENBRUNNER. He simply looks up at her.)

REYES: You don't care about that child or what Scully had to sacrifice. You're only too happy she had to give it up so there's no proof.

KERSH: Agent Reyes.

(REYES swings around and pins KERSH with a look, slowly advancing toward him, anger and contempt dripping from every word she says.)

REYES: You don't care what these people have sacrificed over the last nine years - what's been lost to their cause. You make a mockery of it, gladdened it proves your point.

KERSH: Agent Reyes, that's enough!

REYES: What is the point of all of this? To destroy a man who seeks the truth or to destroy the truth so no man can seek it? Either way, you lose.

(Her contempt for the man who sits before her evident. Just before she leaves, REYES turns to look at MULDER, who sits up straighter in his chair, a look of respect on his face for the woman who just told the FBI, the Military and the Toothpick Man to go to hell.)

(The door closes shut behind her.)

(SKINNER looks over at KERSH, who now looks uncomfortable.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 16
GEORGETOWN
WASHINGTON, D.C.

(Night. DOGGETT drives hurriedly to get to SCULLY'S apartment. He parks the car and gets out. REYES is there. They're both in a hurry to get to SCULLY.)

(SCULLY opens the door. DOGGETT and REYES enter.)

DOGGETT: Are you ready for this? We may have found Knowle Rohrer.

SCULLY: You found him?

REYES: His body.

SCULLY: What are you talking about? There can't be a body; he can't die. Knowle Rohrer is a super soldier.

REYES: Exactly. But they're saying it's him -- the man Mulder killed.

SCULLY: Who's saying it's him?

DOGGETT: I got some guy on the phone at Fort Marlene who didn't know that he was supposed to give me the run-around. I got him to send the victim's corpse to Quantico.

SCULLY: It's there now?

REYES: We got a car out front.

GIBSON PRAISE (o.s.): Agent Scully?

(SCULLY looks worriedly at GIBSON PRAISE, not wanting to leave him alone and unprotected for a moment and yet knowing the importance of examining the body herself.)

REYES: (gently) Agent Doggett can stay with him.

CUT TO:



SCENE 17
FBI ACADEMY
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

(SCULLY and REYES enter the examining room. SCULLY pulls on a lab coat. The body is there, covered. SCULLY pulls the sheet back to expose a badly burned body.)

REYES: Oh, my god. This is Knowle Rohrer?

(SCULLY grabs and examines the paperwork that accompanies the body.)

SCULLY: That's what it says here.

REYES: Well, how could anyone tell if it wasn't?

SCULLY: I need you to get me Knowle Rohrer's medical records.

REYES: They'd have to come from the military. I don't know if I can.

SCULLY: You've got to, Monica; whatever it takes. I need those records for Skinner. I need them for Mulder.

(REYES looks at SCULLY. Without a word more, she turns and walks away to get KNOWLE ROHRER'S medical records. SCULLY turns and puts on a fresh pair of latex gloves. She's going to get to work.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 18

(In the courtroom, SKINNER is busy looking through his notes. MULDER is sitting next to him. KERSH looks bored.)

KERSH: Mr. Skinner. Please call your next witness.

(SKINNER stands up. The back door opens and SCULLY walks in holding a thin report.)

SCULLY: Assistant Director ...

(SKINNER nods to approach him. SCULLY gives the thin report to SKINNER who immediately begins to read through it. She leans in toward MULDER, a look of assurance on her face.)

SCULLY (to MULDER): I found it.

MULDER: What?

SCULLY: What's going to get you off.

SKINNER: I want to move to dismiss again based on new evidence I just received that there is no victim. That the body of Knowle Rohrer is not Knowle Rohrer, but that of a man who died of a broken neck and whose body was burned post-mortem.

KERSH: Motion denied.

SCULLY: You can't deny it.

KERSH: You're out of order and in contempt of court, Agent Scully.

SCULLY: You're in contempt. I have evidence proving that Agent Mulder is innocent.

KERSH: You have no authorization to examine the body, Agent Scully. Have her removed from the courtroom.

(MULDER stands.)

MULDER: If she's got evidence, you got to listen.

(MULDER turns to watch as the GUARDS escort SCULLY out of the courtroom.)

KERSH: Order! Remove the defendant from the courtroom. This trial is adjourned.

(KALLENBRUNNER looks aghast at what's happening in front of him. SKINNER watches in confusion as the GUARDS escort MULDER out of the room.)

FADE IN TO:

(Later. The courtroom is now empty.)

FADE OUT:

FADE IN TO:

(Later still in the courtroom. KALLENBRUNNER, SKINNER are MULDER sitting in their seats. All men are deep in their own thoughts waiting for a verdict.)

(The side door opens and the panel enters.)

KERSH: Gentlemen ... we have a verdict. If you'd rise.

(SKINNER stands. MULDER remains seated.)

KERSH: Acting fairly and impartially, this panel finds the defendant ... guilty of first degree murder under aggravated circumstances. Is there anything you'd like to say on your behalf, Mr. Mulder ... before we decide your sentence?

MULDER: (softly) Yes.

(All parties sit down. MULDER stands and looks only at KERSH.)

MULDER: I'd like to congratulate you on succeeding where so many before you have failed. A bullet between the eyes would have been preferable to this charade. But I've learned to pretend over the past nine years - to pretend that my victories mattered only to realize that no one was keeping score. To realize that liars do not fear the truth if there are enough liars. That the devil is just one man with a plan but evil, true evil, is a collaboration of men which is what we have here today. If I am a guilty man, my crime is in daring to believe that the truth will out and that no one lie can live forever. I believe it still. Much as you try to bury it, the truth is out there. Greater than your lies, the truth wants to be known. You will know it. It'll come to you, as it's come to me faster than the speed of light.

(MULDER glances up and sees KRYCEK and X standing behind the panel.)

MULDER: You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now and maybe you are .. but you're only done it by cutting off your own heads.

(KRYCEK and X are gone. MULDER finishes his words. With a reassuring hand on SKINNER'S shoulder, MULDER leaves the room.)

(SKINNER glances up again at KERSH.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 19

(Scully's apartment. SCULLY is sitting alone and quiet on her couch. Everyone else is in the kitchen. DOGGETT is having a mug of something to drink; REYES and GIBSON PRAISE are sitting at the dining room table.)

(The phone rings. SCULLY doesn't move to pick it up. DOGGETT puts down his cup and goes into the living room to answer the phone. He walks past SCULLY and straight out of screen's view.)

DOGGETT (o.s.): (quietly) Yeah. (pause as he listens) I'll tell her.

(DOGGETT hangs up the phone. He's very quiet.)

SCULLY: Who was it?

DOGGETT (o.s.): Skinner.

SCULLY: Agent Doggett?

(DOGGETT'S not looking at SCULLY. It doesn't seem as if he's moved since he hung the phone up. He slowly turns to look at SCULLY. His face betraying the bad news and his sorrow.)

DOGGETT: Death by lethal injection.

(The single thread of hope that held SCULLY together finally snaps. SCULLY begins to crumble and heart breaking sobs escape her uncontrollably. She covers her face with both her hands and continues to cry.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 20
USMC BASE BRIG
11:21 PM

(Night. A car approaches the gate. The POST GUARD leaves the booth to check the driver's ID.)

POST GUARD: Evening. ID, please.

(An ID appears. The POST GUARD checks it and the camera pulls back to reveal the driver. It's KNOWLE ROHRER.)

POST GUARD: Master Sergeant Rohrer? Go on ahead.

(The gate opens and ROHRER drives in.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 21

(Mulder's cell. The door opens. Light shines on MULDER, who is lying on the hard floor.)

DOGGETT: Get up.

(The light continues to shine on MULDER. He can't see who it is ... whether they're friend or foe.)

MULDER: Who's there?

DOGGETT: I'm here with Skinner. Get up.

SKINNER: Move it, Mulder.

(At the sound of SKINNER'S familiar voice, MULDER perks up.)

MULDER: What are you doing?

(DOGGETT helps MULDER up..)

DOGGETT: We're getting you out of here. Come on.

(DOGGETT and MULDER exit the cell. SKINNER closes the door behind them.)

CUT TO:

(The three men make their way down the hallways as quickly as they can. The doors that are locked shut, SKINNER unlocks with his very own trusty key.)

CUT TO:

(The door opens to MULDER'S empty cell. KNOWLE ROHRER walks in just moments too late. No one is there. )

ROHRER: Guard!

(Two guards appear in the doorway.)

ROHRER: Where is he?

(The guard shakes his head. He doesn't know.)

ROHRER: Seal the building.

(ROHRER pauses by the doorway next to the GUARD.)

ROHRER: Seal the base.

(ROHRER heads down the hallway hoping to catch up with the escapee.)

GUARD (to communication device): We have an escaped prisoner.

CUT TO:

(The alarms begin blaring. The men are not yet out of the building. They come across a closed gate. SKINNER takes out a key and unlocks the gate getting them to the main room. They just need to get past the NIGHT DUTY OFFICER at the desk.)

(SKINNER goes first and checks it out. )

(The NIGHT DUTY OFFICER is called away. The three men get past the gate without detection. On the far side of the room is another closed gate that's locked. SKINNER takes out the key, unlocks the door and MULDER walks through it straight into KERSH.)

(The three men freeze uncertain of their fate.)

KERSH: You're never going to make it this way.

(KERSH looks at the men.)

KERSH: Come on.

(KERSH turns around and leads everyone to an alternate route out of the building. While armed military personnel are heading in one direction, KERSH leads MULDER, SKINNER and DOGGETT in another direction and to safety.)

(At the top of the stairs, REYES stands by the cut hole in the wire fence. She holds it open so the men can get out. She has a vehicle waiting for them.)

(They drive a while down the road that takes MULDER to SCULLY who is waiting next to another vehicle with GIBSON PRAISE.)

(As soon as the vehicle stops, MULDER gets out and makes his way to SCULLY. He puts on a jacket. The others join them.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

KERSH: You've got to move out.

SCULLY: What's he doing?

KERSH: What I should have done from the start.

(KERSH continues to give them instructions.)

KERSH: You want to go north to Canada. Get to an airport. If you're not off the continent in 24 hours you may never get out, you understand?

(MULDER looks at those who have risked so much to help him: KERSH, SKINNER, DOGGETT and REYES.)

MULDER: None of you will be safe now.

DOGGETT: You let us worry about that.

REYES: Good luck.

(SCULLY moves toward the vehicle provided by REYES. With a parting gesture of gratitude to GIBSON PRAISE, MULDER follows SCULLY. They both get into the car leaving their trusted friends behind.)

(GIBSON PRAISE silently remains standing by the car. He shakes his head as he realizes where MULDER is truly headed.)

CUT TO:

(MULDER drives SCULLY on the road past a sign that says "INTERSTATE 95" (South bound).)

CUT TO:

(Inside the car, SCULLY notices the sign.)

SCULLY: Mulder, Kersh told us to head north. You just got on a road going south.

MULDER: That's right.

SCULLY: Where are you going?

MULDER: To see a man about The Truth.

(SCULLY looks a bit confused and just a tad worried.)

FADE INTO:



SCENE 22
7:12 AM

(A distance shot of the Washington Monument in the early golden glow of morning.)

CUT TO:

(Inside the FBI Building basement. The elevator bell rings, DOGGETT, REYES and GIBSON PRAISE exit.)

GIBSON PRAISE: You can't hide me forever.

REYES: We can destroy your files - make it next to impossible to find you.

GIBSON PRIASE: You don't know these people.

(With all sincerity and just a tad naivete, DOGGETT looks into GIBSON PRAISE'S eyes and tells him with all sincerity:)

DOGGETT: I'm going to protect you, Gibson.

(GIBSON PRAISE shakes his head slightly as if he's heard it all before. REYES opens the door to their office and stops in shock.)

REYES: John ...

DOGGETT: What the hell is this? What the hell is going on?

(The entire office has been stripped bare of all the file cabinets, desks and other valuable things. Various items such as MULDER'S basketball and the I WANT TO BELIEVE poster litter the floor. DOGGETT walks into the office, grabs the poster and begins rolling it up.)

DOGGETT: They can't do this. Who authorized this?

REYES: I'm going to find out.

SKINNER (on phone): Skinner.

REYES: They've packed up The X-Files.

(SKINNER'S in his office.)

SKINNER: I know. It's out of control. I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. I'm trying to get to Kersh.

CUT TO:

(DOGGETT, REYES and GIBSON PRAISE make their way through the hallways toward KERSH'S office. SKINNER is already there knocking on the door. He turns and sees them.)

SKINNER: All I can think is it's punishment for taking Mulder's side. Unless they found out that we helped him escape.

DOGGETT: Then they know about the Deputy Director's involvement, too.

(The office door opens. It's TOOTHPICK MAN.)

SKINNER: I need to see the Deputy Director.

TOOTHPICK MAN: And he needs to see you.

(DOGGETT and REYES don't like the sound of it. They look at each other. Both worried. SKINNER turns around to look at them. Without a word, he enters the office. GIBSON PRAISE looks at the TOOTHPICK MAN. The TOOTHPICK MAN looks at GIBSON PRAISE, then quickly shuts the door to the office.)

GIBSON PRAISE: He knows.

(DOGGETT and REYES look at GIBSON PRAISE.)

DOGGETT (looking at the closed door that SKINNER just walked through): Then we're all in danger here.

(DOGGETT heads toward the closed office door ready to get SKINNER and KERSH out. GIBSON PRAISE stops DOGGETT from entering KERSH'S office.)

GIBSON PRAISE: No. He knows about Mulder and Scully -- where they're going.

REYES: You mean the border?

GIBSON PRAISE: No, that's not where they went and they know that. They're going to find them and kill them.

DOGGETT: Where are they, Gibson? Mulder and Scully -- where'd they go?

(GIBSON PRAISE looks scared for his friends.)

[Fade to black]



SCENE 23
TEXAS-NEW MEXICO BORDER
5:07 AM

(The SUV driven by MULDER makes it was down the road. It pulls off to the side.)

(MULDER cuts the engine, leans toward SCULLY who is sleeping and gently kisses her cheek. He gets out of the car.)

(MULDER unzips his pants and relieves himself, when ...)

FROHIKE: Hey, hot shot! You might have the common courtesy of doing your business there downwind.

MULDER: Oh, boy.

LANGLY: Why don't you just finish draining the little lizard and then we'll talk?

BYERS: We're very worried about you.

FROHIKE: It's craziness, man. Turn around.

LANGLEY: Just hang a big U-ie and never look back.

MULDER: I can't.

BYERS: Why risk perfect happiness, Mulder? Why risk your lives?

MULDER: Because I need to know the truth.

BYERS: You already know the truth.

(MULDER thinks about that one for a moment. When he responds, its with complete honesty at what he's really doing there.)

MULDER: I need to know if I can change it.

LANGLY: Change it?

FROHIKE: For crying out loud. All you're going to do is get yourself killed.

(From behind him, SCULLY got out of the car to look for MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder! What are you doing?

MULDER: I'll be right with you, Scully.

(They both get back into the car.)

CUT TO:

(Day. The road they're driving on will soon end at a hidden pueblo carved into the side of a mountain.)

(MULDER stops the car. They both get out. SCULLY looks around.)

SCULLY: What are they?

MULDER: Pueblos. Anasazi Indian. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows why.

SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder, but what are we doing here?

(MULDER points high to the window of a ruin along the way. There's smoking coming out from the window. Someone is there.)

(MULDER heads off in that direction. SCULLY follows. They both begin to climb up to meet the Keeper of the Truth.)

CUT TO:

(Inside on of the pueblos. An old Indian woman tends to the fire. MULDER and SCULLY enter the area where she lives.)

MULDER: Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me?

(The old woman looks at MULDER. Without a word, she rises from her chair and pushes the cloth curtain back and disappears behind it.

(SCULLY moves up from behind MULDER and passes him bringing her closer to the curtain. She turns around to look at MULDER.)

SCULLY: Mulder, what is it?

MULDER: I was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount Weather. The Indians said it was from a wise man who lived in the ruins: A Keeper of the Truth.

CUT TO:

(REYES and DOGGETT are traveling by helicopter above, doing a visual search for MULDER and SCULLY based upon the information given to them by GIBSON PRAISE.)

REYES: Do you see anything at all?

(DOGGETT shakes his head and continues to scan the grounds below.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 24

(Cave entrance. MULDER and SCULLY make their way through the narrow passageway at the mouth of the cave. They're led there by the old Indian Woman. At the end where it opens up into a living space, an old white-haired man sits there waiting for them.)

(MULDER enters first followed by SCULLY.)

CSM: What's the matter, Agent Mulder?

(CSM / C.G.B. SPENDER takes a drag of the cigarette through the hole in his trachea.)

CSM: You come to see the wise man but you look as if you've seen a ghost.

MULDER: You're no wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X.

CSM: You see a dead man, Agent Scully?

SCULLY: I hoped and prayed you were dead you chain-smoking, son of a bitch.

(MULDER looks more than a little shocked to see CSM still alive.)

CSM: You waste your time. Ask Mulder. He knows the futility of hopes and prayers. He knows the truth now.

(SCULLY looks confused at what CSM'S saying. CSM zeroes in on this immediately and begins to exploit it as he's done so many times before.)

CSM: You have told her the truth haven't you, Fox? I helped you find it.

MULDER: You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing exactly what I'd find.

CSM: And now you refuse to speak it. Not to Scully, not to anyone. You've even refused to testify what you learned ... even though it would have saved your life. You damned me for my secrets ... but you're afraid to speak the truth.

(CSM takes another drag from his cigarette.)

MULDER: You call me afraid? Look at you sitting here alone in the dark like a fossil.

(CSM exhales a puff of smoke around him.)

CSM: It's the final refuge. The last place to hide from those who are insidiously taking power now.

SCULLY: Who?

CSM: The aliens. They fear this place ... its geology. Magnetite. Like that which brought down the original UFO in Roswell. Indian wise men realized this over 2,000 years ago. They hid here and watched their own culture die. The Original Shadow Government.

CUT TO:



SCENE 25

(Outside the pueblos. The helicopter (#N218SS) carrying DOGGETT and REYES land outside the Anasazi Pueblos. They've found MULDER and SCULLY'S SUV. They both get out of the helicopter and it takes off leaving them there.)

(REYES sees an ominous-looking black SUV make its way toward them. There's a lone driver in it.)

REYES: Agent Doggett!

DOGGETT: Who the hell's that?

(It's KNOWLE ROHRER. DOGGETT and REYES both look worried as the dead man lives once again.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 26

(Back inside the pueblo, CSM takes a drag from his cigarette.)

CSM: It leaves me to tell you what Mulder's afraid to, Agent Scully.

MULDER: Come on, let's go.

(SCULLY doesn't budge,)

CSM: It's a scary story. You want to come sit on my lap?

SCULLY: You don't scare me.

CSM: My story's scared every president since Truman in '47.

MULDER: You don't have to hear this.

SCULLY: No, I want to hear it, Mulder.

CSM: Ten centuries ago the Mayans were so afraid that their calendar stopped on the exact date that my story begins. December 22, the year 2012. The date of the final alien invasion. Mulder can confirm the date. He saw it at Mount Weather ... ...where our own "Secret Government" will be hiding when it all comes down.

(SCULLY looks at MULDER. He doesn't take his eyes off of CSM. CSM has a wild glint in his eye - almost a crazed look.)

MULDER: Yeah, you smile ... feeling drunk with power. The power to do nothing.

CSM: My power comes from telling you. Seeing your powerlessness hearing it. They wanted to kill you, Fox. I protected you all these years ... waiting for this moment ... to see you broken. Afraid.

(MULDER lifts his head and schools his features to reveal nothing.)

CSM: Now you can die.

CUT TO:



SCENE 27

(Two heavily armed black ops helicopters are flying low along the roadway head to the Anasazi Pueblos.)

CUT BACK TO:



SCENE 28

(Outside the pueblos, KNOWLE ROHRER advances on DOGGETT and REYES who continue to back up slowly. Soon they won't have any room to back up anymore. DOGGETT reaches for his gun. REYES reaches for hers. They both hold it on ROHRER knowing full well that it'll be useless.)

DOGGETT: Run, Monica. Get out of here.

REYES : No.

(DOGGETT glances at REYES, accepting her decision to stand next to him.)

DOGGETT (to ROHRER): Knowle Rohrer. That's far enough.

(ROHRER continues to advance. An arrogant smugness about him.)

ROHRER: Shoot me, Agent Doggett, if you think it'll make a difference this time.

(DOGGETT fires. The bullet harmlessly hits ROHRER in the chest. He continues to stand there with the smugness about him.)

(DOGGETT and REYES both continue to back up as KNOWLE ROHRER continues to advance toward them.)

(They've run out of room behind them. ROHRER, on the other hand, has also stopped advancing. In fact, he seems to be struggling to move forward. A confused look on his face.)

(DOGGETT lowers his weapon. Something is happening to ROHRER. He's starting to spasm, He lifts his arms, unable to control their shaking. Black metallic oxidation appears on the skin under his arms and rapidly spreads.)

(DOGGETT and REYES watch as the metal within ROHRER becomes the metal without. ROHRER looks afraid. When the metal completely covers his exterior, ROHRER is sucked into the rocks. DOGGETT pushes REYES out of ROHRER'S path.)

(ROHRER smashes into the rock. REYES looks completely shocked at what she just witnessed.)

MULDER: Agent Doggett!

(Both MULDER and SCULLY appear outside the second level doorway.)

DOGGETT: Mulder, get out of there!

REYES: They know where you are!

CUT TO:

(The two black helicopters continue their path to the ruins. We see they are both very heavily armed.)

CUT BACK TO:

(DOGGETT and REYES climb into MULDER and SCULLY'S vehicle and drive it closer to MULDER and SCULLY as they make their way down the ruins.)

(MULDER runs alongside their vehicle as they approach. DOGGETT stops the car.)

MULDER: Get out of here!

DOGGETT: Get in the car.

MULDER: No!

(DOGGETT looks a little confused. They don't have much time. MULDER tells them again to leave.)

MULDER: (insistent) Go! Go!

(MULDER and SCULLY both run to the other vehicle at the site. The vehicle left behind by KNOWLE ROHRER. DOGGETT takes off.)

CUT TO:

(The helicopters are rapidly approaching the site. They're still not in view of the ruins.)

CUT BACK TO:

(MULDER and SCULLY get in the abandoned vehicle and take off in a different direction from DOGGETT and REYES. They disappear from their view around the hill.)

CUT TO:

(The helicopters round the mountain side. MULDER and SCULLY barely escape detection. The helicopters position themselves across the ruins.)

CUT TO:

(The old Indian Woman inside the pueblo panics as her pots and pans rattle at the disturbance. The helicopters hover just outside her window.)

(They fire missile after missile aimed at the ruins, destroying them whole sections at a time in fiery explosions.)

(The old Indian Woman screams.)

CUT TO:

(CSM sits inside his final "refuge", a cigarette in his hand.)

(The pueblos explode with each missile fired. The ancient stones crumble to the ground. Fire burns what little there is to burn.)

(The black helicopters swing around and hover just outside the old Indian Woman's windows. A dreamcatcher hangs from the window with the black helicopter in its sites.)

(Another missile is fired and another portion of the ruins destroyed.)

(Inside, CSM takes a last drag from his cigarette. He throws the remainder on the ground.)

(Outside, in perfect positions, the black helicopter hovers. A final missile is fired finding its intended target. The corridor and the cave fill with fire consuming the once-powerful man within.)

(The pueblos explode. Missiles upon missiles are fired until the entire mountainside is decimated. Their mission complete, the helicopters turn around and fly off into the horizon.)

CUT TO:



SCENE 29
ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO

(Night. Outside a motel room, it's raining. Thunder rumbles. )

(Inside, MULDER is sitting on the floor, leaning back against the bed and his head resting back.)

SCULLY (o.s.): What are you thinking?

(MULDER is silent. Thoughtful.)

SCULLY: Mulder?

MULDER: I'm thinking ... I'm a guilty man. I've failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest punishment for my crimes.

SCULLY: (softly) You don't believe that.

(Mulder sighs.)

MULDER: I believe that I sat in a motel room like this with you when we first met and I tried to convince you of the truth. And in that respect, I succeeded, but ... in every other way ...

(MULDER turns to look at SCULLY)

MULDER: ... I've failed.

SCULLY: You don't believe that, either.

MULDER: Mmmm.

MULDER: I've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the man - the date's set. I can't change that.

SCULLY: You wouldn't tell me. Not because you were afraid or broken .... but because you didn't want to accept defeat.

MULDER: Well, I was afraid of what knowing would do to you.

(MULDER turns to look at SCULLY and confesses one of his greatest fears.)

MULDER: I was afraid that it would crush your spirit.

SCULLY: Why would I accept defeat? Why would I accept it, if you won't? Mulder, you say that you've failed but you only fail if you give up. And I know you -- you can't give up. It's what I saw in you when we first met. It's what made me follow you ... why I'd do it all over again.

MULDER: And look what it's gotten you.

SCULLY: And what has it gotten you? Not your sister. Nothing that you've set out for. But you won't give up, even now.

(SCULLY reaches out and takes hold of MULDER'S hand in a firm grip.)

SCULLY: You've always said that you want to believe. But believe in what Mulder? If this is the truth that you've been looking for then what is left to believe in?

MULDER: I want to believe that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us - greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves.

SCULLY: Then we believe the same thing.

(SCULLY watches MULDER intently . MULDER looks like he Believes. SCULLY smiles at MULDER. MULDER reaches over and lightly picks up SCULLY'S cross. He reaches up and caresses her lips.)

(MULDER gets off of the floor and settles himself in bed next to SCULLY. He wraps himself around her, so that they are now holding each other closely.)

MULDER: (whispers) Maybe there's hope.
